Arranged by the Climate Action Centre, ‘The Indus Resistance Conference’, held for the first time, is a forum aiming to amplify the voices of “frontline defenders” against the exploitation of natural resources.
The first of its kind, the conference brought together women, the working class, lawyers, students and journalists committed to the cause of climate justice. Pakistan was ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022.
“The Indus River is on its deathbed,” said Yasir Darya, founder of the Climate Action Centre (CAC), as he initiated the one-day conference, addressing resource theft and climate injustice in Sindh.
He called for granting the river “personhood status” to ensure its preservation against what he termed “colonial policies, water theft, and capitalist interests”.
Advocate Abira Ashfaq of CAC’s Green Chamber, speaking to Dawn.com, explained what the status of personhood for the Indus River would mean: “If we can have people look at the rights of the river, perhaps that could be a roundabout way to get them to look at other ecological damage that is happening.”
She added, “If a corporation can have legal standing, then why can’t a body of nature?
“It would also be a way to bring in other ecological conversations into the fold — about poverty, about canals on the Indus, about villages, rural rights, the rights of women farmers,” Ashfaq said.
“We talk about how indigenous people have knowledge, which we often take as wisdom — but it is knowledge that is never taken into account.”
 
 

Calling out the state’s “hypocrisy” on water resources in Sindh, former Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) vice president Zubair Abro criticised the contrast between Pakistan’s domestic policies and its international stance.
“Pakistan justifies water allocation on the basis that it is a lower riparian country, but in the same breath, it denies that right to lower riparian areas within the country,” he said while speaking at a panel discussion at the event.
He also noted that the existing water distribution treaties — the Indus Water Treaty and the 1991 Water Apportionment Accord — do not include any provisions for climate or environmental preservation. Abro called for a revision of the agreements.
Challenging what she described as “imperialist extractive policies” enacted by the state on the river, Advocate Romisa Jami said that the Indus River has been made into a commodity.
“It was never meant to be a commodity,” she added.
She urged the audience to view the issue through the lens of “decolonisation”.
While the Indus River is an entire ecosystem for the people of Sindh, “to colonial masters, it offers an opportunity for extraction”, said Jami.
She attributed the loss of sustainable agricultural practices to the “building of irrigation projects by the British Empire”. Jami emphasised that people have come to “inherit our colonial past, which has always been profit-driven and never human-centric”. She recommended an overhaul of the existing system as the only way forward.
 
 

Speakers also raised alarm over recent canal construction and corporate farming initiatives introduced under the Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI), which sparked protests across Sindh, particularly in Baberloi, where demonstrations continued for days until the canal project was shelved. However, the corporate farming initiative remains in place.
Advocate Kazim Mahesar, activist Amar Haseeb Panhwar and Advocate Riaz Sabzoi — who were involved in the protests — spoke during a panel discussion on resource theft, warning that corporate farming was “just a guise for land theft”.
“We are told to go to court against these decisions, but with the 26th Amendment in place, the doors of justice have been closed for us,” said Panhwar.
Mahesar alleged that “Sindh’s land has been stolen under corporate farming”. He added, “It’s not that we are against development — we only stand against destruction.”
He further argued that such development projects “are only for the elite”, adding that “there is nothing in it for the common man.”
Historian Hafeez Baloch, also speaking on the panel, recalled that Malir — where he was born and raised — was among the first victims of land grabbing in Sindh.
“Malir was an agricultural land, but it was stolen and handed over to capitalists,” he said.
He also referred to the late scholar Gul Hassan Kalmati, who had warned that “what is happening in Malir will eventually happen to the rest of Sindh as well”.</p><small>2025-06-15 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1519352945c8c36.jpg?r=193541' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917285/trump-insists-israel-and-iran-should-make-a-deal-after-fresh-exchange-of-missiles' target='_blank'><strong>Trump insists Israel and Iran should ‘make a deal’ after fresh exchange of missiles</strong></a><br><p>As Israel and Iran continued an intense exchange of missiles for a third day, US President Donald Trump called on the two foes to “make a deal”.
Israel launched an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.

“Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make, in that case by using TRADE with the United States to bring reason, cohesion, and sanity into the talks with two excellent leaders who were able to quickly make a decision and STOP!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
Earlier this month, Trump had offered to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a ceasefire between the two nuclear powers following their most intense military confrontation in decades.
In his social media post, Trump said that Iran and Israel will have peace “soon”, adding that there were many unspecified meetings happening and that the two countries should make a deal.
“We will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran,” Trump said.
 


Following Friday’s strikes, Trump urged Iran to “make a deal”, warning that there will be more “death and destruction” after Israel launched the deadly strikes.
While speaking to ABC, Trump said “it’s possible [the US] could get involved” in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that the US is “not at this moment involved” in the conflict.
He also said he would be “open” to Russian President Vladimir Putin being a mediator. “He is ready. He called me about it. We had a long talk about it,” Trump told ABC.
Later on Sunday, Iranian media reported explosions in the northeastern city of Mashhad.
“Two locations in Mashhad suffered explosions and fires,” Fars news agency reported, adding that “air defences were activated in the area”.
The Tasnim news agency said that blasts were heard near the city’s Shahid Hasheminejad Airport.
“No damage has been reported to the airport buildings or runway,” it added.
Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest site in Iran for Shia Muslims.
Israel’s military said its air force struck Mashhad airport. It added it was “the longest-range strike conducted since the beginning” of its attack on Iran, which began on Friday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told Trump in a phone call today that Ankara was ready to act as a facilitator to resolve the nuclear dispute which led to the conflict breaking out.
In a statement from his office, Erdogan welcomed Trump’s latest statement on a possible peace between Iran and Israel and urged his US counterpart to take action immediately to prevent a disaster “that could set the region on fire”.
Meanwhile, the US’ virtual embassy in Tehran issued a travel advisory urging Americans to not travel to Iran under any circumstances and recommending that US nations in Iran either depart immediately or shelter in place for extended periods.
“US citizens in Iran face serious, increasing dangers due to rising regional tensions,” the advisory warned. “The US government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Swiss government, acting through its Embassy in Tehran, serves as the protecting power for United States interests in Iran.”
The embassy informed that American nationals can cross into Armenia by land through the Agarak border crossing, which is open. It added that according to the Turkish government, border crossings at Gurbulak, Kapikoy and Esendere are open, but noted that the Iranian government may restrict movement by non-Turkish nationals.
The advisory added that Azerbaijan’s land borders remain closed, but US nationals may be able to enter via the Astara border crossing on June 15 with special authorisation.
“US citizens need approval from the Government of Azerbaijan before going to the border. US Embassy Baku must facilitate this,” it read. “US citizens that plan to request entry into Azerbaijan should send personal details (name, date of birth, passport information) and a photograph of their passport biodata page to the US Embassy Baku American Citizens Services Unit at BakuACS@state.gov.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Iran would pay “a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children” during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.
Earlier today, the Israeli army called on citizens to take shelter after detecting new missile launches from Iran toward Israel. However, Israel soon eased the air raid warning and said citizens could “leave protected spaces in all areas across the country.”
Two missile-like projectiles hit two locations in central Tehran, leading to explosions, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Sunday, saying the blast occurred near the central Valiasr Square.
Iranian media said an Israeli strike hit the Tehran police headquarters in the city centre.
“The Greater Tehran Police Command was hit by one of the enemy’s drones,” ISNA news agency reported, citing a police statement. It added that the attack caused “minor damage” and injured “a number” of police personnel.
President Masoud Pezeshkian said Iran’s responses to Israeli attacks will be “more decisive and severe” if Israel’s hostile actions continue, according to state media. Pezeshkian added that Iran’s military has so far responded “strongly and appropriately”.
The Iranian president also urged Iraq to block Israel from using its airspace and territory to launch attacks on the Islamic republic.
“We emphasise that the Iraqi government must exercise greater vigilance and protection of its borders and airspace so that Iraqi territory is not misused against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Pezeshkian said in a call with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, according to the Iranian presidency website.
Earlier today, Tehran said Israel wanted to “drag the conflict to the Persian Gulf” after the latter attacked the world’s largest gas field that Iran shares with Qatar, igniting another round of deadly tit-for-tat missile barrages.
A day after Israel wiped out the top echelon of Iran’s military command, it hit Iran’s oil and gas industry for the first time. Iran then partially suspended gas production at the South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar.
According to an Israeli government statement, at least 13 people have been killed and 380 hurt in Iran’s attacks on Israel, with children among those killed, Al Jazeera reported.
Of those wounded, nine are in serious condition while the rest have minor or moderate injuries. The statement also said 200 missiles and drones have been fired into Israel since the start of the fighting, with 22 places in the country affected.
Rescue teams combed through the rubble of residential buildings destroyed in strikes, using flashlights and sniffer dogs to look for survivors.
 






Following the fresh exchange of missiles, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran does not want its conflict with Israel to expand to neighbouring countries unless the situation is forced, adding its response had been based on self-defence.
Araghchi said Tehran had been responding to foreign aggression, and that if this aggression stopped, Iran’s reactions would also cease.
The foreign minister said the Israeli strikes on the offshore South Pars gas field that Iran shares with Qatar were a “blatant aggression and a very dangerous act”.
“Dragging the conflict to the Persian Gulf is a strategic mistake, and its aim is to drag the war beyond Iranian territory,” he said.
 


The foreign minister accused Israel of seeking to sabotage ongoing Iran-US nuclear talks, which, according to him, could have opened the way for an agreement. Tehran was set to present a proposal this Sunday during a sixth round of talks, which were cancelled following recent escalations.
“Israel’s attack would never have happened without the US green light and support,” Araghchi said, adding Tehran does not believe American statements that Washington had taken no part in recent attacks.
“It is necessary for the United States to condemn Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities if they want to prove their goodwill.”
The Wall Street Journal reported that the US military was “operating in the air, on land and at sea to shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel”. “US jet fighters, Navy destroyers and ground-based air-defence systems had [been] positioned to help counter any attack”, it said, citing US officials.
Axios quoted a US official as saying that Israel has urged the Trump administration to join the war, but said currently the administration was not considering it.
In the afternoon, Israel’s Oil Refineries said its pipelines and transmission lines in Haifa had been damaged by missile strikes by Iran, according to a regulatory filing to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
It said that no injuries or casualties were reported at the sites, with refining facilities continuing to operate despite a shutdown of some downstream operations.
It said it is examining the impact of the damage on its operations and implications on its financial results.
Explosions echoed through Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as missiles streaked across the skies overnight, as interceptor rockets were launched in response. The military lifted its shelter-in-place advisory nearly an hour after issuing the warning.
Israeli media said at least 35 people were missing after a strike hit Bat Yam, a city south of Tel Aviv. A spokesperson for the emergency services said a missile hit an eight-storey building there and while many people were rescued, there were fatalities.
It was unclear how many buildings were hit overnight.
The latest wave of Iranian attacks began shortly after 11pm on Saturday (1am PKT Sunday), when air raid sirens blared in Jerusalem and Haifa, sending around a million people into bomb shelters.
Around 2:30am local time (4:30am PKT), the Israeli military warned of another incoming missile barrage and urged residents to seek shelter.
So far, at least 13 people in Israel have been killed and over 300 others injured since Iran launched its retaliatory attacks on Friday.

Brigadier General Ali Mohammad Naeini, the spokesperson for the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), said in a televised statement that Israel’s fuel production facilities for fighter jets and energy supply centres were targeted with a large number of drones and missiles, Press TV reported.
The IRGC spokesperson also claimed that the IRGC aerospace defense system had “successfully intercepted and destroyed” three Israeli cruise missiles, 10 drones, and dozens of “hostile mini-drones in the affected regions”.
The elite force warned Tehran’s attacks will be “heavier and more extensive” if Israel continues its hostilities.
Meanwhile, the new commander of Iran’s Khatam al-Anbia Central Headquarters vowed that the Islamic Republic will keep conducting military operations against the Zionist regime vigorously to make the criminal enemy regret its aggression, Tasnim reported.
In comments on Sunday, Major General Ali Shadmani underlined that Iran’s retaliatory military operations against the Israeli regime will continue relentlessly.
“The chain of military operations by the Iranian Armed Forces that have brought pride to the country will continue in a much more massive and harsh manner than the past until the criminal and aggressive Zionist enemy regrets what it did completely,” he stated.
Iran said it had arrested two individuals it accused of being members of Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad in Alborz province while they were preparing explosives and electronic devices, Tasnim reported today.
Meanwhile, Yemen’s Houthis also said they targeted Israel in coordination with Iran, the first time a regional group has publicly announced joint cooperation on attacks with Tehran.
The Yemeni group targeted central Israel’s Jaffa with several ballistic missiles in the last 24 hours, military spokesperson Yehya Sarea said in a televised address.
“Triumphing for the oppressed Palestinian and Iranian peoples […] This operation was coordinated with the operations carried out by the Iranian army against the criminal Israeli enemy,” he added.
Israel’s El Al Airlines said it has cancelled flights to and from many European cities as well as Tokyo and Moscow until June 23.
 


Situation ‘under control’ after oil depot hit
The Israeli military warned Iranians living near weapons facilities to evacuate, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks by Israel so far were nothing compared with what Iran would see in the coming days.
“The Israeli military will strike these sites and will continue to peel away the Iranian snake’s skin in Tehran and everywhere — targeting nuclear capabilities and weapons systems,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.
Just after his country’s attacks on Iranian oil and gas sites, Katz had posted on X:“Tehran is burning”.

In Iran, nearly 140 people have been killed since Friday, with 78 on the first day of Israel’s campaign, and scores more yesterday, including 60 when a missile brought down a 14-storey apartment block in Tehran, where 29 of the dead were children.
Iranians can seek shelter in mosques and schools during Israeli attacks, as well as subway systems, which will be open at all times from tonight, government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani told state TV on Sunday.
“There is no problem with the provision of food, medicine, fuel,” she added.
The Shahran oil depot in Tehran was targeted in an Israeli attack, Iran said, but added the situation was under control.
A fire had erupted after an Israeli attack on an oil refinery near the capital while Israeli strikes also targeted Iran’s defence ministry building, causing minor damage, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said.

At the Tehran Oil Refinery, fuel production, supply and distribution continue without disruption, Iran’s Student News Network reported after an overnight fire following an Israeli strike took place at a fuel tank unrelated to the refinery.
Similarly, Iran’s oil ministry told state media today that operations at the Isfahan refinery continue without disruption, denying online reports of an incident or attack against the facility.
Trump distances US from strikes on Iran, warns against attacks on it in ‘any way’
US President Donald Trump said earlier today that if Iran attacks the United States in “any way, shape or form”, it would face the might of the US military “at levels never seen before”.
Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform that the US had nothing to do with an attack on Iran overnight and that “we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict!!!”
 


Three drones were launched toward the Ain al-Asad air base housing US forces in western Iraq following Israel’s strikes on Iran, the Associated Press reported, citing a US military official and a second US official.
The drones were shot down, the officials said. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the report.
AP further said that for a second day, supporters of armed factions in Iraq held a demonstration in Baghdad to denounce Israel’s bombing of Iran but did not attempt to breach a high-security zone where the US Embassy is located.
Germany, France, UK offer Iran talks over nuclear programme
Meanwhile, Germany, France and Britain are ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme in a bid to de-escalate the situation in the Middle East, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
Wadephul, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he was trying to contribute towards a de-escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran, adding that Tehran had previously failed to take the opportunity to enter into constructive talks.

“I hope that’s still possible,” Wadephul told German public broadcaster ARD late on Saturday.
“Germany, together with France and Britain are ready. We’re offering Iran immediate negotiations about the nuclear programme, I hope ]the offer] is accepted.”
“This is also a key prerequisite for reaching a pacification of this conflict, that Iran presents no danger to the region, for the state of Israel or to Europe.”
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz spoke to Oman’s Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said on Sunday morning and both agreed it was important that the conflict in the Middle East should not escalate, a German government spokesperson said.
“The chancellor thanked (the sultan) for Oman’s mediation efforts towards ending Iran’s nuclear programme. He emphasised that Iran must never have nuclear weapons,” the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that both leaders underlined their willingness to help end the conflict through diplomatic means.
Tehran called off nuclear talks that Washington had said were the only way to halt Israel’s bombing. Netanyahu claimed Israel’s strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear programme “possibly by years” and rejected international calls for restraint.
US intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have “repeatedly said Iran was not pursuing a nuclear weapon before Israel” launched its attacks on the Islamic Republic this week, AP noted.
 
 

Trump had warned Iran of worse to come, but said it was not too late to halt the Israeli campaign if Tehran accepted a sharp downgrading of its nuclear programme.
A round of US-Iran nuclear talks that was due to be held in Oman on Sunday was cancelled, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi saying the discussions could not take place while Iran was being subjected to Israel’s “barbarous” attacks.
British minister signals possible support for Israel; Iran denies asking Cyprus to convey messages to Israel
Britain could potentially support Israel in its conflict with Iran, but the decision to send additional military jets to the Middle East was made mainly to protect British bases and personnel, British finance minister Rachel Reeves said today.
Speaking to Sky News, Reeves called for a de-escalation in the conflict and said the decision to send additional jets to the region was a “precautionary move”.
Asked if Britain would come to Israel’s aid if asked, Reeves said: “We have, in the past, supported Israel when there have been missiles coming in.”
She added: “We’re sending in assets to both protect ourselves and also potentially to support our allies.”
 


Iran did not send any message to Israel via a third country, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said on Sunday, after Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said earlier Tehran had asked Nicosia to convey “some messages” to Israel.
Since yesterday, Iran’s foreign minister has contacted his Chinese, Russian, Azerbaijani and Armenian counterparts to discuss the regional developments.
Gas field attack
In the first apparent attack to hit Iran’s energy infrastructure, the semi-official Tasnim news agency said Iran partially suspended production at the world’s biggest gas field after an Israeli strike caused a fire there on Saturday.
The South Pars field is located offshore in Iran’s southern Bushehr province and is responsible for the lion’s share of gas production in Iran, the world’s third largest gas producer after the United States and Russia.
The strike caused a fire, which has been extinguished, the Iranian oil ministry said. The fire broke out in one of the four units of Phase 14 of South Pars, halting production of 12 million cubic metres of gas, Tasnim said.
Iran produces around 275 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year or some 6.5pc of global gas output, and consumes it domestically as it cannot export gas due to sanctions.
Iran shares the field with Qatar, which calls the field North Field. Qatar produces 77 million tonnes of liquefied gas from the field with the help of global majors such as Exxon and Shell and supplies the gas to Europe and Asia.
Fears about potential disruption to the region’s oil exports had already driven up oil prices 9 per cent on Friday, even though Israel spared Iran’s oil and gas on the first day of its attacks.
An Iranian general, Esmail Kosari, said on Saturday that Tehran was reviewing whether to close the Strait of Hormuz, controlling access to the Gulf for tankers.
 
 

With Israel saying its operation could last weeks, and Netanyahu urging Iran’s people to rise up against their rulers, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.
B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organisation, said on Saturday that instead of exhausting all possibilities for a diplomatic resolution, Israel’s government had chosen to start a war that puts the entire region in danger.
Tehran has warned Israel’s allies that their military bases in the region would come under fire too if they helped shoot down Iranian missiles.
Israel sees Iran’s nuclear programme as a threat to its existence, and said the bombardment was designed to avert the last steps to production of a nuclear weapon.
Tehran has repeatedly said the programme is entirely civilian and that it does not seek an atomic bomb. However, UN’s nuclear watchdog IAEA reported it this week as violating obligations under the global non-proliferation treaty.</p><small>2025-06-15 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609339-na-speaker-turns-down-omar-ayubs-demand-to-form-committee-on-ecp-appointments' target='_blank'><strong>NA speaker turns down Omar Ayub's demand to form committee on ECP appointments</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed that 450 Pakistani pilgrims were evacuated from Iran earlier today, with more to follow from the neighbouring country as well as from Iraq.
Israel launched an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
According to statements issued by deputy commissioners (DC) across the province today, the Balochistan government has closed all Iranian borders adjacent to the Gwadar district and imposed a ban on travel corridors due to the deteriorating situation in the region.
A statement issued by the Gwadar DC’s office said, “In light of instructions from the Balochistan government, the Gwadar district administration has closed the corridor at the Gabd-Kalato 250 border until further notice.
“The public is requested to cooperate and contact the district administration for any information or guidance,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, the Panjgur district administration also closed all crossing points connected to Iran for an indefinite period, stating that this decision was taken as a precautionary measure due to the current regional security situation.
The announcement said that not only movement by foot through these routes been halted, but the delivery of fuel has also been completely banned.
The Panjgur DC maintained that these measures were taken due to “the possible uncertain situation in Iran and the security threats arising from international tensions”.
“The district administration has appealed to the public to fully cooperate with … in the current situation and avoid unnecessary movement in order to avoid any unexpected situation,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, in a post on X this afternoon, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government was taking necessary measures for the welfare and safety of Pakistani nationals.
 






He noted that 450 Pakistani zaireen (pilgrims) had been evacuated from Iran yesterday. Arrangements have been made for the safe evacuation of Pakistani students currently residing in Iran, including 154 in the first batch.
“Our Embassy in Iraq is in contact with Pakistani zaireen who are stranded due to the closure of airspace,” Dar said on X. “Measures are underway to ensure their safe stay in Iraq and possible evacuation.”
He noted that the Crisis Management Unit at the Foreign Office is operational 247 and can be contacted at:
+92 51-9207887  and cmu1@mofa.gov.pk
“Our embassies in the region are closely coordinating all necessary efforts to support Pakistani nationals and zaireen,” Dar added.
Following Israel’s initial strikes, PM Shehbaz on Friday directed all relevant authorities to provide every possible assistance for the safe return and protection of Pakistani pilgrims currently in Iran.
The Foreign Office also advised all pilgrims from Pakistan to reconsider their travel plans to Iran and Iraq in view of the evolving security situation in the region.
Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran Mudasir Tipu is currently in his home country for official meetings, the FO said.
“The embassy under the instructions of the foreign minister along with Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working to extend all possible facilitation to Pakistanis in Iran,” it added.
Dar, Turkish FM express concern
Dar received a telephone call on Sunday from Foreign Minister of Turkiye Hakan Fidan as both leaders expressed “deep concern and anguish over the deteriorating regional situation due to Israel’s unjustified attacks on Iran”.
He also confirmed his participation in the forthcoming meeting of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM), and the Islamic Cooperation Youth Forum’s (ICYF) ceremony both scheduled to be held next week in Istanbul.
PM Shehbaz had earlier during a telephonic call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed Pakistan’s presence in the events.
PM Shehbaz said Dar would represent Pakistan at the upcoming OIC CFM meeting in Istanbul. He also congratulated President Erdogan for being honoured by the ICYF. The OIC CFM is scheduled to take place in Istanbul from 21-22 June.</p><small>2025-06-15 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609343-baseless-propaganda-pakistan-denies-supplying-ballistic-missiles-to-iran' target='_blank'><strong>'Baseless propaganda': Pakistan denies supplying ballistic missiles to Iran</strong></a><br><p>

According to the first information report (FIR) filed by the slain man’s brother, Mazhar Iqbal, 51-year-old Zafar Iqbal had returned from Faisalabad to Mardan after many years. Zafar was accompanied by his wife, Farzana alias Gul Bibi, aged 40.
Mazhar stated that the couple was at his house when the suspects forcibly entered and opened indiscriminate fire on his brother and sister-in-law, killing them on the spot. He added that he, along with his wife and children, narrowly escaped the attack.
He nominated suspects Sarbuland, Munir Khan, Asad Shah, and Imran — all residents of Jehangira — along with Wajid and Muhammad Hussain from Babenai.
The complainant urged the police to register a case against them for trespassing, attacking his family, causing bodily damage, and murdering his brother and sister-in-law, the FIR said.
Muhammad Faheem, spokesperson for the Mardan district police officer, told Dawn.com that the couple had married of their own free will about 17 years ago. He said the man had returned to his brother’s home in Mardan after several years from Faisalabad.
Faheem claimed that the woman’s family allegedly carried out the attack and fled the scene. However, efforts are underway to arrest the suspects, he added.
He said the bodies of the deceased were taken to the Type D Hospital in Katlang, Mardan, where Zafar’s brother recorded his statement with a team from the Jabr police station.
The FIR is lodged under the following sections of the Pakistan Penal Code; 302 (punishment of premeditated murder), 311 (punishment for premeditated murder after the right of qisas (retribution) has been waived), 324 (attempt to commit murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed), and 449 (house trespass in order to commit offence punishable with death).
‘Honour’ killings refer to the murder of individuals, predominantly women and girls, by family members who believe the victim has brought dishonour upon the family.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab.
From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country. The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to ‘honour’ killings.</p><small>2025-06-15 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15193804644426f.jpg?r=194123' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917320/trump-administration-weighs-adding-36-countries-to-travel-ban-memo-says' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration weighs adding 36 countries to travel ban, memo says</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s administration is considering significantly expanding its travel ban by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.
Earlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against “foreign terrorists” and other national security threats.
The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from US universities and deport others.
In an internal diplomatic cable signed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.
“The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days,” the cable sent out over the weekend said.
The cable was first reported by The Washington Post.
Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said. Another was “questionable security” of that country’s passport.
Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed. Some countries were overstaying the US visas their citizens were being granted.
Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or anti-Semitic and anti-American activity. The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed.
The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote D’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
That would be a significant expansion of the ban that came into effect earlier this month. The countries affected were Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
The entry of people from seven other countries — Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela — has also been partially restricted.
During his first term in office, Trump announced a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.</p><small>2025-06-15 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15191133ec09ea0.jpg?r=192520' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917318/bitcoin-pioneer-michael-saylor-lauds-pakistans-crypto-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Bitcoin pioneer Michael Saylor lauds Pakistan’s crypto efforts</strong></a><br><p>American entrepreneur Michael Saylor on Sunday lauded Pakistan’s efforts to move towards cryptocurrency and digital assets, according to a press release from the office of the State Minister on Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib.
Pakistan is establishing itself as a key player in the global cryptocurrency economy and setting trends rather than following them in the digital currency space, said Saqib, who is also the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer.
The PCC was officially launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
According to the press release, Saylor had a meeting with Saqib and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, where the discussion revolved around how Bitcoin can serve as a tool for sovereign reserves, monetary
resilience and driving long-term digital economic transformation.
Calling Saylor “one of the most influential voices in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption”, the statement outlined that his enterprise software company Strategy holds the largest corporate reserve of Bitcoin.
“His (Saylor’s) advocacy echoes the [US President Donald] Trump-era vision of economic sovereignty, decentralisation of financial power and investment in long-term national strength through hard digital assets,” the statement read.
“Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation and inclusive growth in the digital economy,” Aurangzeb was quoted as saying.
Saqib was quoted as saying that Saylor’s work in the crypto field transformed Bitcoin into a “sovereign-grade asset”.
“In five years, Mr Saylor transformed a mid-sized software firm into a $100 billion company, purely through strategic vision, bold conviction and disciplined execution,” Saqib said. “If private individuals can build that in the US, why can’t Pakistan, as a nation, do the same? We have the talent, the story, and the energy.”
According to the statement, Saylor praised Pakistan’s efforts to take a “forward-looking, innovation-friendly stance in the global digital economy” and welcomed the opportunity to support ongoing developments and advise.
“Pakistan has many brilliant people. It also has commitment and clarity needed by businesses globally,” Saylor was quoted as saying.
“Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience,” he added. “Emerging markets like Pakistan have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance.”
The statement hailed the dialogue as “another milestone in Pakistan’s effort to build a robust digital assets policy framework, attract global institutional interest and position itself as a Web3 and Bitcoin-ready emerging market”.
Earlier this month, the PCC agreed to form a technical committee to draft a framework for digital and virtual assets, the Ministry of Finance announced in a statement.
According to the ministry’s press release, the council’s launch marks a “significant step in the country’s efforts to regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into its financial landscape”.
“The council is set to play a pivotal role in formulating policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring a secure and forward-thinking approach to crypto adoption in Pakistan,” the Finance Division said.</p><small>2025-06-15 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609330-war-only-option-if-india-blocks-pakistans-water-says-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>War only option if India blocks Pakistan's water, says Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

While Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his priorities are strengthening peace and security, building critical mineral supply chains and creating jobs, issues such as US tariffs and the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine are expected to feature heavily.
US ally Israel launched a barrage of strikes across Iran on Thursday, a blow to Trump’s diplomatic efforts to prevent such an attack.
The summit will take place in the mountain resort of Kananaskis, some 90 kilometres west of Calgary.
The last time Canada played host, in 2018, Trump left the summit before denouncing then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “very dishonest and weak” and instructing the US delegation to withdraw its approval of the final communique.
“This will be a successful meeting if Donald Trump doesn’t have an eruption that disrupts the entire gathering. Anything above and beyond that is gravy,” said University of Ottawa international affairs professor Roland Paris, who was foreign policy adviser to Trudeau.

Trump has often mused about annexing Canada and arrives at a time when Carney is threatening reprisals if Washington does not lift tariffs on steel and aluminum.
“The best-case scenario … is that there’s no real blow-ups coming out of the back end,” said Josh Lipsky, the chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council think tank and a former White House and State Department official.
Carney’s office declined to comment on how the Israeli strikes would affect the summit.
No joint communique
Diplomats said Canada has ditched the idea of a traditional comprehensive joint communique and would issue chair summaries instead, in hopes of containing a disaster and maintaining engagement with the US.
A senior Canadian official told reporters Ottawa wanted to focus on actions the seven members — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — could take together.
Canadian Senator Peter Boehm, a veteran former diplomat who acted as Trudeau’s personal representative to the 2018 summit, said he had been told the summit would last longer than usual to give time for bilateral meetings with the US president.
Expected guests for parts of the Sunday to Tuesday event include leaders from Ukraine, Mexico, India, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil, who all have reasons to want to talk to Trump.

“Many will want to talk to President Trump about their own particular interests and concerns,” Boehm said by phone.
A senior US official said on Friday working discussions would cover trade and the global economy, critical minerals, migrant and drug smuggling, wildfires, international security, artificial intelligence and energy security.
“The president is eager to pursue his goals in all of these areas including making Americas trade relationships fair and reciprocal,” the official said.
The visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the Oval Office in February descended into acrimony and has served as a warning for other world leaders about the delicate dance they face in negotiating with Trump.
But diplomats say the frustration of dealing with the Trump administration has made some keener to assert themselves.
Canada has long been one of Ukraine’s most vocal supporters. Trump came to power promising to end the war with Russia within 24 hours but diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have stalled.
One Ukrainian official involved in preparations for the summit said hope had faded for a strong statement in support of Ukraine. Instead, success for Kyiv would merely constitute an amicable meeting between Trump and Zelensky.
A European official said the G7 summit and the Nato summit in The Hague later in June provided an opportunity to underscore to Trump the need to press ahead with a sanctions bill put together by US senators alongside a new European package to pressure Russia into a ceasefire and broader talks.
Early test
Trump’s first international summit will offer some early clues on whether Trump is interested in working with allies to solve common problems, said Max Bergmann, a director at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
“The big overarching question here is, basically, is the United States still committed to formats like the G7? That is going to be the big test,” Bergmann said.
French President Emmanuel Macron has said he has a good, but frank relationship with Trump despite differences on subjects such as Ukraine or climate change.
Macron said on Friday that a United Nations conference co-hosted between France and Saudi Arabia scheduled after the G7 to work towards a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians has been postponed.
India’s Modi visits Cyprus to advance trade corridor plans
Modi arrived in Cyprus on Sunday in a visit focused on the potential role the island could play in linking India to Europe via a trade corridor, officials said.
The Indian PM, who was on his way to the G7 summit in Canada, and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides were scheduled to address business leaders on Sunday and hold formal talks on Monday.
India is pursuing the so-called India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) trade link by sea and rail, but the visit is being held in the shadow of a rapidly escalating crisis in the Middle East.

“One of the objectives of our discussions is the connection of India with Europe through the region of the wider Middle East, (and) its entry into Europe through the Republic of Cyprus,” Christodoulides told journalists earlier on Sunday.
The two-day visit is part of a broader diplomatic outreach to European nations. Cyprus assumes the rotating EU presidency for six months in early 2026. The two countries have close relations through their shared membership of the Commonwealth.</p><small>2025-06-15 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15165434b6556dd.jpg?r=165457' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917313/ukraine-says-received-another-1200-bodies-from-russia' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine says received another 1,200 bodies from Russia</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine on Sunday said it had received another transfer of 1,200 bodies from Russia as part of an exchange agreement struck in Istanbul talks earlier this month.
“Another 1,200 bodies which the Russian side claims belong to Ukrainian citizens, including military personnel, were returned to Ukraine,” Kyiv’s headquarters for the treatment of prisoners of war wrote on social media.
“In total, 4,812 bodies have been returned this week,” Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said on Facebook. “I am grateful to everyone involved in this humanitarian mission,” he said.
Ukraine has not said whether it has transferred any bodies to the Russian side.
The two sides agreed a large-scale exchange of prisoners and bodies of killed soldiers during their latest round of direct talks in Istanbul on June 2.
Both Russia and Ukraine typically do not disclose their military losses.
In a rare public estimate, President Volodymyr Zelensky told US news outlet NBC earlier this year that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and some 380,000 wounded.
Russia has not announced its military deaths since September 2022, when it said fewer than 6,000 soldiers had been killed — a figure believed to be vastly lower than reality.
Several independent investigations using open sources, such as the publication of death announcements by local officials and family members, have reported massive death tolls for Moscow’s army.
The Russian website Mediazona and the BBC’s Russian service said they had identified the names of some 111,000 killed Russian soldiers.</p><small>2025-06-15 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15160640c6c7414.jpg?r=161121' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917310/several-arrested-arms-recovered-in-bannu-joint-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Several arrested, arms recovered in Bannu joint operation</strong></a><br><p>Several suspects were arrested and a cache of heavy weapons seized during a joint search and strike operation carried out by the police, counter terrorism department, and the army in Bannu district of Khyber Pakthunkwa.
In a statement, Bannu police spokesperson, Khanzala Quraishi, said law enforcement agencies received a tip-off about the presence of suspicious individuals in Barganto and Kam Chashmi areas within the jurisdiction of Domel police station.
Acting on the information, a large-scale operation was swiftly launched on the instructions of Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and led by District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kalachi, on the reported presence of terrorists.
Bannu Brigade Commander Brigadier Naveed Ahmed, SP CTD Fazal Wahid, SP Investigation Sajid Mumtaz, SP Rural Mahmood Nawaz, SDPOs, SHOs, CTD officials, Quick Response Force (QRF), Ladies Police, BDS, and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the operation.
During the operation, police deployed modern technology, including drone cameras, to monitor and search suspected houses and locations in the area, which had been flagged for the presence of “drug dealers, proclaimed offenders, and suspected terrorists”.
According to police, 40 suspects were taken into custody and shifted to an undisclosed location for interrogation. A large cache of weapons was also recovered from their possession.
In a statement, DPO Bannu Saleem Abbas Kalachi said, “The purpose of these coordinated operations is to rid the area of crime, drugs, and terrorism, ensuring that citizens feel safe and secure. Bannu Police will continue such effective operations in the future to maintain peace and order in the region.”
RPO Sajjad Khan, while congratulating all officers on the successful operation, said, Bannu police and CTD teams have “successfully carried out a major operation with professionalism, discipline, and courage”.
“Such operations not only dismantle criminal networks but also strengthen public trust in the police We are committed to maintaining peace and order across the region at all costs,” he added.
Police earlier on Friday claimed to have arrested a terrorist during a search and strike operation in the Miryan area of Bannu district.
An official said that the operation was launched on the directives of district police officer Saleem Abbas Kulachi.
He said that a police party jointly headed by Miryan SHO Anwar Khattak and additional SHO Zaman Shah Khan raided a suspected hideout in a rural area and arrested a terrorist, identified as Rafiullah.
“The terrorist had been wanted by the Miryan and Janikhel police in murder, attempted murder and terrorism related cases since 2009 as he had killed eight people and injured six others in different incidents,” the official said, adding that a case was registered against him under relevant sections of law.</p><small>2025-06-15 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609303-field-marshal-asim-munir-welcomed-in-us-with-times-square-appreciation-campaign' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Asim Munir welcomed in US with Times Square appreciation campaign</strong></a><br><p>

Along with the NTSB, officials from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were in Ahmedabad in western India’s Gujarat state surveying the crash site, said one source with direct knowledge.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Gatwick Airport south of London began losing height seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday, and erupted in a huge fireball as it hit buildings below.
 
 

All but one on board were declared dead in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade. Around 30 people died on the ground.
Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down.
The secretary of the US Department of Transport, Sean Duffy, said on Friday he was in the process of deploying a team from the FAA and the NTSB to India. Boeing and GE, whose engines were used in the plane, were also sending teams.
“We’ll take action should any recommendations come forward from the NTSBs investigation,” Duffy said.
The FAA and NSTB did not immediately respond to Reuters queries outside regular business hours.
The FAA has said India will lead the investigation, but the NTSB is the official US representative for providing assistance, while the FAA provides technical support.
Boeing officials will also look at various parameters in their inspections, including the angle of landing, as they investigate the matter, said the first source.
In all, around 10 officials were present at the site on Sunday, including from the NTSB, said the second source.
India’s aviation regulator has ordered all Boeing 787s being operated by local carriers to be inspected.
The crash brings a fresh challenge for both Air India which has for years being trying to revamp its fleet, and Boeing, which is trying to rebuild public trust following a series of safety and production crises.
In Ahmedabad, doctors were struggling to identify bodies that were charred in the incident, resorting to dental samples and DNA profiling.
DNA samples of 32 victims from the crash have been successfully matched, Rajnish Patel, additional superintendent at the city’s main hospital, said on Sunday.
“The bodies for which DNA samples have been matched are being handed over to the families with due respect,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-15 10:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15141114071d3b6.jpg?r=141702' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917299/3-brothers-drown-as-car-plunges-into-river-in-gb' target='_blank'><strong>3 brothers drown as car plunges into river in GB</strong></a><br><p>At least three members of a family died and three others went missing on Sunday after their car plunged into a river stream in the Shinbar area of district Nagar, Gilgit-Baltistan.
Rescue 1122 official Nizamuddin told Dawn.com that the family was returning from a marriage ceremony when their car plunged into a stream, resulting in the drowning of six people and injuries to one.
He said rescue divers had recovered three bodies, while a search operation was ongoing to locate the remaining three missing individuals.
Sajid Ali, spokesperson for the Nagar district police officer, also confirmed the incident and said the car was en route to Chalt Bala when it plunged into the river stream.
He added that the bodies were transported to the District Headquarters Hospital in Nagar, while the injured had been referred to a hospital in Gilgit for further treatment.
The spokesperson identified the deceased as Ghulam Abbas, Sher Baz Ali, and Zohaib Ahmad. Those reported missing are Sharafat Hussain, Muhammad Hussain, and Aleem, while Kashif Hussain received injuries.
He said the three victims, who were brothers, were returning from the Bardas area after attending a wedding ceremony when the incident took place.
Gilgit Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said the accident was “regrettable”. He said Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed sorrow over the incident and instructed all relevant departments, including the Home Secretary, to mobilise all available resources in the search for the missing individuals.
According to the spokesperson, the vehicle carrying seven passengers was returning from a wedding ceremony when it plunged into the river late last night.
Following the chief minister’s directives, rescue teams were dispatched to the site and efforts are underway to locate the remaining missing persons, he added.
Many accidents occur on Gilgit Baltistan’s roads due to its challenging and treacherous terrain, which becomes particularly dangerous during harsh weather conditions.
The lack of proper safety barriers, limited visibility, and inadequate maintenance further increase the risk of accidents, making it one of the more hazardous routes in the region.</p><small>2025-06-15 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15141646ea71a5f.jpg?r=141652' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917301/police-file-fir-over-rape-of-disabled-14-year-old-girl-in-punjabs-hafizabad' target='_blank'><strong>Police file FIR over rape of disabled 14-year-old girl in Punjab’s Hafizabad</strong></a><br><p>Police have registered a first information report (FIR) in the case of a 14-year-old girl with mental and physical disabilities being allegedly sexually assaulted in Punjab’s Hafizabad district.
Sahil’s Six Months Cruel Numbers data reveals that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country last year.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. 48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.
The victim was brought to the hospital due to her health condition, where, during a medical check-up, it was discovered that she was six months pregnant.
An application for action was filed by the victim’s family on Saturday at the City Hafizabad Police Station, on which case number 1152/25 was formally registered on Sunday under Section 376 (3) (Whoever commits rape of a minor or a person with mental or physical disability, shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life and fine) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Rana Sultan Mahmood has been named as the plaintiff in the FIR.
The victim is a child with congenital disabilities, unable to speak, hear or walk, and is also mentally immature and unconscious. Her parents stated in the FIR that they belonged to a poor and illiterate family and were unable to learn about the incident due to their daughter’s physical condition.
Investigation into the incident revealed that the suspect allegedly found the girl alone in the Hussainabad neighbourhood six months ago and sexually assaulted her. After the incident, he went into hiding.
Hafizabad District Police Officer (DPO) Atif Nazir Kadhar has taken immediate notice of the incident and ordered the DSP City Circle to submit a report. The DPO has also issued instructions for the immediate arrest of the suspect.
 
 

According to police officials, the accused will be arrested within the next 48 hours, while the victim’s family is being provided with full protection.
In May, police said they had arrested four suspects involved in an alleged gang rape of a mentally-challenged minor in Lahore earlier this month.
Also last month, A madrassah teacher in Muzaffargarh district of Punjab was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student at a seminary.</p><small>2025-06-15 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15135127e2016dd.jpg?r=135353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917303/pmd-says-chances-of-rain-thunderstorm-in-karachi-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>PMD says chances of rain, thunderstorm in Karachi tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Karachi is expected to receive rain on Monday, accompanied by a dust thunderstorm, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).

Cloudy weather with temperatures ranging from 36–38 degrees Celsius is expected to persist throughout the metropolis tomorrow. Humidity levels are expected to touch 70-80 per cent in the morning.
“Dust-thunderstorm /rain likely in Karachi division on tomorrow & isolated places at outskirts of Karachi division on Tuesday,” the weather advisory read.
Under the influence of this system, the following parts of Sindh are expected to receive rain accompanied by dust thunderstorm at isolated places today: Ghotki, Sukkur, Jacobabad, Qamber Shahdadkot, Shikarpur, Khairpur, Dadu, Nosheroferoz, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tharparker, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, T.M.Khan, T.A.Yar, Hyderabad, Mitiari, Thatta, Sujawal, Badin and Jamshoro districts.
The forecast predicts light to moderate rainfall accompanied by dust thunderstorms on 16th-17th June.
Every year, Karachi gets flooded by rains, causing widespread disruption to public life and their safety. Last year in August, Mayor Karachi declared a state of emergency ahead of the downpour to tackle management efforts. The five-day rain spell left a trail of destruction in its wake, washing away roads and crippling civic life.

Trump hailed the United States as the “hottest country in the world” after watching tanks, aircraft, and troops file past him in Washington to honour the 250th anniversary of the US army.
But it formed a stark split screen with turmoil at home and abroad, as police used teargas to disperse protesters in Los Angeles and US ally Israel traded missile fire with Iran in a rapidly escalating conflict in the Middle East.
Trump’s parade on an overcast night in Washington came after tens of thousands of “No Kings” demonstrators thronged the streets in cities including New York, Philadelphia, Houston and Atlanta.
Trump largely avoided his usual domestic political diatribes in an unusually brief speech, and instead focused on praising the US army, saying that they “fight, fight, fight, and they win, win, win”.

The display of military might comes as Trump asserts his power domestically and on the international stage.
In his address to the parade, Trump sent a warning to Washington’s adversaries of “total and complete” defeat, with the United States increasingly at risk of getting tangled up in Israel’s conflict with Iran.
“Time and again, America’s enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you,” Trump said.
‘Happy Birthday’
Trump had openly dreamed since his first term as president of having a grand military parade, of the type more often seen in Moscow or Pyongyang than Washington.
The last such parade in the United States was at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
When it came, Trump stood and saluted on a stage outside the White House as tanks rumbled past, aircraft roared overhead, and nearly 7,000 troops marched past.
Troops and military hardware from different eras of US history passed by, with an announcer reeling off victories in battles with Japanese, German, Chinese and Vietnamese forces in past wars.
The army said it cost up to $45 million.
But while the crowd sang “Happy Birthday” and there were occasional chants of “USA! USA!”, the atmosphere was less intense than one of the barnstorming rallies that swept Trump to power.
The White House said that “over 250,000 patriots showed up” for the event, without providing evidence. Communications Director Steven Cheung described the “No Kings” protests as a “complete and utter failure”.
“No Kings” organisers said protesters gathered in hundreds of cities, with AFP journalists seeing large crowds in several cities.

Organisers said they were protesting against Trump’s dictatorial overreach, and in particular what they described as the strongman symbolism of the parade.
“I think people are mad as hell,” Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician, told AFP in New York, where tens of thousands of people rallied.
‘Display of authoritarianism’
Thousands turned out in Los Angeles to protest Trump’s deployment of troops in the country’s second-largest city following clashes sparked by immigration raids.
Police in Los Angeles used tear gas and mounted officers to clear protesters who had gathered in front of the federal building in downtown, the focus of demonstrations for the last week.
AFP reporters at the scene said there was no disorder, but it appeared local officers were moving people away from an area where National Guard troops and Marines are stationed.
Some protesters targeted Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida — while a small group even gathered in Paris.
“I think it’s disgusting,” protester Sarah Hargrave, 42, said in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, describing Trump’s parade as a “display of authoritarianism”.
The killing of a Democratic lawmaker and her husband Saturday in the northern state of Minnesota — in what the governor called a targeted attack — also cast a pall over the parade.
Trump was quick to condemn the attacks outside Minneapolis in which former state speaker Melissa Hortman was killed along with her husband, while another state lawmaker and his wife were hospitalised with gunshot wounds.</p><small>2025-06-15 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1511291179a3d82.jpg?r=113204' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917161/thar-villagers-stumble-upon-ancient-wooden-sculpture' target='_blank'><strong>Thar villagers stumble upon ‘ancient’ wooden sculpture</strong></a><br><p> 

THE ‘ancient’ sculpture.—Dawn

MITHI: An apparently centuries-old wooden sculpture of a robed, bearded man has been discovered in the hilly region of Karoonjhar, Nagarp­arkar, intriguing historians and archaeologists about its cultural origins.
Sources privy to the discovery said the artefact was recovered near a seasonal riverbed in the Karoonjhar hills by area residents and social activists.
The intricately carved wooden statue depicts a robed man with traditional features, and is believed to be of considerable antiquity. Preliminary observations suggest it may be linked to ancient eastern cultures, though its exact provenance remains unclear.
Researcher and writer Khalid Kumhar, who had extensively documented the historical geography of Tharparkar, remarked that the design and posture of the statue appeared to reflect influences of East Asian or Chinese culture.
“The statue does not match known relics of Buddhist or Jain iconography common to this region,” he noted.
The discovery drew the attention of the Sindh Department of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities and provincial minister Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah stated that measures would be taken to preserve the object.
“A team of heritage experts will conduct thorough research on the sculpture, and their findings will be shared with the public in due course,” said the minister.
The wooden statue has been temporarily secured by locals until it is formally examined by experts from the culture department.

The minister also revealed that the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has expressed willingness to fund the project while final decision regarding the loan approval was expected in September this year after its board meeting.
 
 

Commenting on the media talk of Sindh chief minister regarding the motorways, Mr Aleem said that he takes responsibility for the past year only but does not want to comment on the inaction of previous governments regarding the construction of the HSM and Karachi motorways.
He emphasised the corporate importance of connecting Karachi Port to the National Motorway network, highlighting that without this connection, the motorway’s utility for import, export, and business would be of no use.

Minister vows to start work on the project this year

He pointed out that various political parties, including the PPP remained in power but unfortunately, valuable time was lost due to their failure to initiate crucial infrastructure projects such as the Karachi-Hyderabad-Sukkur motorways.
The minister reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to construct HSM but also the Hyderabad-Karachi section as well while the aim was to complete the entire route within two years. Furthermore, the Northern Bypass will be converted into an eight-lane highway and linked with HSM.
He said HSM has been divided into five zones. The Islamic Deve­lo­p­ment Bank will finance three of these zones while funding for the remaining two will be sought from other banks or donor agency, he added.
The minister extended his thanks to the Sindh chief minister and said that the federal government would definitely not hesitate to request the Sindh government’s contribution of Rs25 billion, if needed.
He affirmed the federal government’s desire to complete this $2bn project as swiftly as possible through its own resources.
Mr Aleem further said the National Highway Authority (NHA) was actively working on the Lyari Expressway. This project will also be upgraded to meet international standards and, upon its completion the project will be presented as a gift to the people of Karachi.

Little is known publicly about President Asif Ali Zardari’s efforts to play a mediatory role and seek a rapprochement between Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In January 2011, the Iranian president’s special envoy invited Zardari to a conference on the global ‘War Against Terror’ in Tehran. Despite advisers suggesting Pakistan participate at a lower level, Zardari readily accepted and decided to attend personally.
During his visit to Tehran in June 2011 for the conference, Zardari met with Rahbar Ayatollah Khamenei. After initial pleasantries, Zardari asked his delegation members to leave him alone with Iran’s supreme leader. The contents of their discussion remained undisclosed. A press release from the Rahbar’s office merely reiterated the usual diplomatic language about “historical, cultural and religious bonds” and the need to “strengthen Tehran-Islamabad relations in all areas.”
Unusually, Zardari revisited Tehran the following month, meeting the Rahbar one-on-one for a second time in less than 30 days.
I gained more insight into the June meeting with the Rahbar when Iran’s foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, visited Pakistan and met with the president at Bilawal House in Karachi that September. I was present throughout the meeting. Salehi first summarised his visit’s achievements, mentioning signed agreements and reiterating the need to earnestly pursue the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project. He then broached the subject of Iran-Saudi relations, saying, “Mr President, I wish to convey my president’s deep appreciation for your efforts.”
Speaking in hushed tones and glancing over his shoulder, Salehi appeared uncomfortable with my presence. As I rose to leave, Zardari gestured for me to remain seated. Zardari’s face brightened as Salehi disclosed, “Necessary elements are falling into the right place, and it is proceeding in the right direction.” The cryptic nature of these “necessary elements” and the direction of progress intrigued me.

From seeing off military dictator Gen Musharraf to the Osama bin Laden fiasco, from being mired in the Memogate controversy to pushing legislation for greater provincial autonomy and staring down threats of coups, Asif Ali Zardari’s first presidency was anything but ordinary. His former spokesperson and trusted confidant, Farhatullah Babar, recounts the events he was witness to first-hand in The Zardari Presidency (2008-13): Now It Must Be Told. Eos presents exclusive excerpts from the book…

After a pause, Salehi continued, “As we started on your advice and took the first step, a storm erupted in parliament. They even called for my impeachment.” Zardari interjected, “No, I did not give any advice. I only made a request.”
This exchange further piqued my curiosity. Salehi elaborated on his response to the Iranian parliament: “I asked them, what did they expect from me? As foreign minister, is it not my responsibility to talk with everyone, even our enemies? Indeed, it is my job to pursue peace. So why criticise me? Why condemn me merely for seeking to open a window?”
He explained that he had reasoned with parliament that seeking peace was Iran’s own desire and initiative, not driven by external forces. Salehi then revealed that the Iranian ambassador in Riyadh had received a message from the Saudi government stating, “We expect some progress next month”, though he didn’t elaborate further. Zardari didn’t press for details but instead smiled and called for refreshments.
President Zardari informed Salehi that, during his recent trip to Urumqi, he had already briefed the Chinese vice premier about these developments. He explained that this was to enable Chinese leaders to play a role if needed. Salehi listened intently, eager to learn about the Chinese reaction. Zardari noted, “The Chinese vice premier did not respond to my comments,” adding that the premier may have avoided commenting without President Xi’s approval.
Pleased that Iran had accepted his mediatory role, Zardari continued, “When I met the Rahbar, I told him that I would sit in his office and not leave until he agreed. We have no choice but to seek peace and pursue rapprochement. We are all in serious turmoil. Pakistan cannot afford a war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.”
His thoughts seemed to flow rapidly as he jumped from one subject to another.
“Economies are falling apart. I fear this will result in wars. I’ve seen how small mistakes and miscalculations can be disastrous. I witnessed Shevardnadze [then Soviet foreign minister, later President of Georgia] visiting Pakistan. He wanted to discuss Afghan President Najibullah’s offer for a peaceful power transfer. Najibullah was willing to seek a political solution, and the Soviet Union supported this. It was a great opportunity. But our people insisted on a military victory. Egos came into play. They wanted to tell our people that we could win wars. Some were obsessed with a military victory. We all know what happened then. We were misled when they told my wife, ‘Madam Prime Minister, Jalalabad will fall within a week.’”
Zardari also recalled US Ambassador [Robert] Oakley once telling him that the US was unaware Najibullah possessed MiGs and other sophisticated weapons. “Oh, a serious lapse on the part of our intelligence,” Oakley had admitted. “The Americans do not have a plan A, let alone plans B or C,” Zardari remarked.
 


As he continued speaking, Salehi listened without interruption. Past midnight, the president requested the draft press release of the meeting. He reviewed it, deleting references to currency swap and banking cooperation agreements with Iran and diluting mentions of the Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project.
While Zardari may have thought the Americans incapable of executing even plan A, he was careful not to offend the US by publicly acknowledging the growing Pakistan-Iran cooperation. Iran’s Bank Melli had been on the United Nations’ watch list since 2008 for its alleged involvement with Iranian nuclear and missile programmes. The UN had also imposed sanctions on states opening Iranian bank branches in their countries. The president removed references to banking cooperation.
However, the next day’s newspapers quoted a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, which was front-paged with reports that, “despite UN restrictions on the Iranian banking sector”, Pakistan had signed a banking cooperation agreement with Iran. Zardari was displeased.
Thus, in 2011, Zardari mounted a serious bid to seek Iran-Saudi rapprochement. He was prepared to sit in the Rahbar’s office until the supreme leader agreed. Zardari also informed Chinese leaders about his efforts.
 
 

Some speculated that Zardari might have undertaken this initiative at the behest of Chinese leaders, but there was no evidence to support this claim. It remains debatable whether the Chinese encouraged Zardari to undertake this mission in 2011 or were inspired to broker peace between the two nations after Zardari informed them about his secret mediation efforts.
A decade later, in April 2023, the world was stunned to learn that Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud met his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, in Beijing for the first time in seven years. They agreed to reopen embassies and consulates. The peace process between Iran and Saudi Arabia was on track. Zardari did not have to sit in front of the Rahbar after all.
THE CULMINATION OF THE LAWYER’S MOVEMENT
Some advisers of Zardari, known for their links with the establishment, had made it known that [Chief of Army Staff] Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani wanted [Justice Iftikhar] Chaudhry reinstated [as Chief Justice of Pakistan]. Throughout the day on March 15, [2009] they spoke, first in whispers and later loudly, that troops in Rawalpindi had been alerted in anticipation of some emergency.
Zardari had never mentioned what Kayani wanted. Indeed, he did not heed any talk about it. As the convoy of hundreds of vehicles led by Nawaz Sharif readied in Lahore to march on Islamabad for the “final push”, the chorus by these advisers grew louder, and the push for Chaudhry’s reinstatement stronger. A few, painting a grim picture, even claimed they had heard about the takeover from the horse’s mouth. Their refrain was that a military coup was imminent if Chaudhry were not reinstated immediately.
[Late Night, March 15, 2009]
As I entered the president’s chamber on the fourth floor, Zardari was seated on a rocking chair. Surprisingly, he appeared unfazed. A few close advisers were already present. It was difficult to tell whether he had been informed of the shadows lurking in the compound below. Even if he were aware, he did not seem to care. The late-night meeting was held in the president’s official chamber instead of the committee room, where such meetings were typically conducted.
Twenty-two close associates and advisers had been invited to the huddle, but only thirteen turned up. One suspected they avoided coming at that hour, fearing an army takeover. Those who had been falling over one another for an audience with the president in the morning were conspicuously absent at night, even when asked to come.
Zardari inquired about those who had not turned up. No one had an answer. There was a hushed silence. Everyone pretended that he had not heard what the president had said. Zardari did not press for an answer. It was enough just to point out that several invitees had failed to appear. The message would reach those who did not come for the meeting.
“Sir, my information is that, in a short while, the marchers will set out from Lahore towards the capital and lay siege to the Presidency and PM’s House,” a close adviser said with a drawn face.
Zardari responded, “Sometimes you have to take strong decisions and take a firm position and stand by your decision.” Regarding the threatened march on the Presidency, he said in Urdu: “Ye loagon ka samundar jo Islamabad ki taraf aaraha hai, yeh chand gaarrion ke siwa kuch bhi nahi hoga. Yeh sab drama hai [The sea of people marching towards Islamabad will turn out to be no more than a few cars. It’s all a drama]. Yeh sab drama hai [All this is a drama],” he further emphasised.
He reassured the dozen advisers gathered around him, saying nothing would happen even if the demonstrators were allowed to camp in front of the Presidency for a few days. The cabinet ministers, however, already had cold feet.
A federal minister expressed concern: “A serious law and order situation, even bloodshed, can result if the masses were allowed to converge at the ‘D’ Chowk.” Zardari remained unimpressed. The huddle continued until past midnight. Almost everyone urged the President to reinstate Chaudhry to avert an imminent military takeover. A few who may have thought otherwise kept quiet.

A minister occasionally called someone from the meeting room to ascertain whether the marchers had actually started from Lahore. Every time he made a phone call, he told the president, “Sir, the marchers will start off in a few minutes. They are led by Nawaz and will be joined by groups on the way. I am keeping watch.” The few minutes seemed like an eternity, never-ending. Occasionally, a minister would rise and, coming closer, almost whisper into the president’s ears. One guessed that the advice to reinstate Chaudhry and “save the system” was being whispered. Zardari remained defiant.
Everyone spoke about reinstating Iftikhar Chaudhry. No one talked about reinstating the scores of other sacked judges. Surprised, the president asked why no one talked about reinstating the other sacked judges. No one responded. The president said, “In principle, I am not against the reinstatement of other sacked judges, but I don’t want Chaudhry reinstated.”
“Sir, if you agree to reinstate all other sacked judges, why not also reinstate Chaudhry,” Prime Minister [Yusuf Raza] Gilani asked. “Why, sir?” another asked, endorsing the suggestion. “If it is right to reinstate other sacked judges, why would it be wrong to reinstate Chaudhry?”
Almost in chorus, everyone said that all sacked judges, including Chaudhry, should be reinstated.
As everyone stressed Chaudhry’s reinstatement, Zardari once again said, “I know Chaudhry more than you do.” He explained that it would be wrong because, to reinstate Chaudhry, he would have to sack the sitting chief justice, Abdul Hameed Dogar. “I will not do it under any circumstances. Dogar has been appointed under the Constitution. I will not go against the Constitution.”
He reminded the advisers around him that Shaheed Benazir Bhutto also didn’t favour reinstating Chaudhry, although she protested the sacking of judges. “We cannot ditch Dogar unceremoniously and unconstitutionally,” he said. Zardari then talked about Chaudhry and said that some people had brought messages from him that he would not cause any problems if reinstated. He did not name the messengers. “His [Chaudhry’s] methods were not like [that of] a Chief Justice,” Zardari told the meeting.
 
 

At one point, Zardari blurted: “Wo qasmain kha raha tha ke Saab ko meri taraf se guarantee de do [He swore to assure me that he would not cause any problem to me],” Zardari recalled.
“I cannot talk more than this,” he said, leaving everyone guessing. He was surprised at how his close associates had ditched him at this hour and left him alone in the ring. He turned around to look closely at a go-getter federal minister as if saying to him, “Et tu, Brute?”
Once again, he firmly said he would not sack Dogar to bring in Chaudhry, “come what may.” Gilani pointed out that Dogar would be retiring in a week, and Chaudhry could be reinstated after Dogar’s retirement. “Chaudhry will not mind waiting for a week,” he said. There was silence as all eyes turned towards Zardari.
Zardari was silent, signalling his agreement.
THE ‘MEMOGATE’ CRISIS
The Memogate scandal, which turned into a political and security crisis, seemed like a suicide attack on Zardari by the army chief and DG ISI, aided by the opposition leader at the time and CJP (Chief Justice of Pakistan) Iftikhar Chaudhry.
It consumed Zardari worse than any other personal or political crisis he had thus far endured. While it is indeed remarkable that he survived it, to claim that he was unscathed would be wrong and not borne out by facts. He was badly bruised.
The army and ISI chiefs claimed that the memo to [US Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral] Mike Mullen was not fake. They asserted it existed and that Zardari wanted to use the US against the army and ISI in the aftermath of the raid on the Osama bin Laden (OBL) compound. They blamed [Pakistan ambassador to the US, Husain] Haqqani as the conduit for the memo but actually aimed at Zardari as the mastermind.
 
 

In TV talk shows, Zardari was painted as an evil incarnate who conspired against the military leadership and the ISI. References were made to the Kerry-Lugar Bill that linked US aid to Pakistan with democracy in the country and blamed it on Zardari-Haqqani. Doomsday predictions were made that Ambassador Haqqani would turn into an approver. References were made to his alleged admission in the past of having links as a student with the ISI chief [under Gen Zia] Akhtar Abdul Rehman. Suggestions were made that some civilians who were aware may have blown the OBL cover.
Who else among the civilians would know more about the cover than President Asif Ali Zardari? The president, indeed, was under siege. Accused of treason, he stood at the centre of the storm. Embattled and defiant, Zardari decided to go down fighting. To send a message of defiance, he announced he would address a joint session of Parliament and make some hard-hitting statements by directly addressing the nation. He was ready to fight to the finish.
The announcement to address Parliament created an uproar. He was accused of pitting parliament against the judiciary and the army. Zardari did not care.
“President and supreme commander of the armed forces Asif Ali Zardari has decided to address [a] joint session of the Parliament after Muharram and called upon the government to take appropriate steps in this regard,” said a brief press release issued by the Presidency. Never before had the title “supreme commander of the armed forces” been used for President Zardari in official press releases.
But today, Zardari asked that the press release clearly state that the “supreme commander of the armed forces” had decided to address Parliament. The decision about the time and date of the address was left to the government to allow him to choose the timing. The press release also referred to iconic pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar for “standing up to mountains of hardship for the cause.”
The president approved the draft press release before it was issued. The die was cast. Enough was enough. He invited a small group of advisers to his residence for discussions to prepare the draft of the address to Parliament. Nearly half a dozen advisers came for the preparatory meeting. Zardari began speaking to prepare the pitch for his speech points. I pulled out my pen and notebook.
Soon, it became clear that he was laying bare his distressed mind and soul more than indicating points for a formal speech. It was yet another monologue, as in meetings with the Sri Lankan dignitaries and the Korean business delegation the previous week.

He alone spoke uninterruptedly, words coming out of his mouth like a torrent. He spoke for nearly two hours. Words and sentences gushed out of his lips like a heavy downpour. Sometimes he was highly sublime, at other times too mundane and abrasive. That he was deeply distressed was not in doubt.
Aware that the president had been stressed this past week, his personal physician, Dr Asim, barged into the meeting uninvited. He did not want the president to remain engaged in a brainstorming session for too long. Dr Asim was casually dressed, as if straight from the bedroom.
Seeing him, the president clapped, as if to draw attention to an unwelcome intrusion and firmly asked Dr Asim not to disturb him. Dr Asim retreated. As emotions turned into anger, Zardari resumed: “I am the supreme commander. I can destroy my enemies. If anyone thinks that I will surrender, he is mistaken. I am not going to run away.” He also threatened: “I know many things. Kayani is under me; I am not under them. Nobody should think that manipulations against me will succeed.”
“I will defeat all manipulators,” he declared. Without naming anyone, he said, “They are playing with me, but I will play with them.” He seemed to indict Kayani and Pasha. Then he softened somewhat: “But I will not talk. I have to protect the country. I will.”
I scribbled in shorthand as he spoke. I did this not to prepare his speech but for the sake of history and to record how intrigues at the highest state levels had pushed the civilian president to the brink.
“I am radiating energy, Farhatullah, that you don’t understand,” he said, looking at me as he noticed me scribbling. He once again clapped his hands and said, “Laughter is the best medicine. It releases frustration.” Then he laughed out loud, asking us to laugh with him. Obligingly, everyone giggled. Once or twice, he clapped, which exaggerated the laughter.
It brought to mind [US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger’s memoirs of [US] President Nixon, when he was mired in Watergate and deeply distressed. One night, the president telephoned Kissinger and called him to the White House during the crisis. When Kissinger came, Nixon told him, “Henry, you are not a very orthodox Jew, and I am not an orthodox Quaker, but we need to pray,” and went down on his knees. Obligingly, Kissinger knelt, too.
Zardari, mired in Memogate, asked his advisers to laugh with him as he laid bare his soul, and everyone did. Suddenly, looking at me, he said, “Do you know why I did not send you to the Senate [in the last Senate election in 2009]? You are a credible face of the Party, and when you speak, people trust you. You speak for me. I asked you to work with me even though, when you worked with Bibi, you did not think highly of me. You also thought I was corrupt.”
When I tried to say something, he stopped me.
Turning sublime and philosophical, he started talking about how, with a trained mind, focused thoughts, and an outpouring of love, one can even control the universe. Love embraces everything. He seemed to be reading from Rumi’s treatise on love. He hopped from one subject to another as everyone listened.
Next, he spoke about the power of words. Positive words inspire, while negative words cause stress and anxiety and can be demoralising. “Watch your words,” he asked everyone. He alternated between the sublime and the mundane as he said again: “No one should think of intrigues against me. I will defeat them.”
Exhausted, he asked for tea for everyone.
After over two hours of monologue, the president called off the meeting and asked to reassemble later that night. The “briefing session” was postponed until after dinner. The aborted midday preparatory meeting resumed after dinner.
Once again, the president began by lamenting how he had been demonised and wronged in life. Some unforgettable and telling words and sentences stuck in the mind: “I worshipped Bibi, not merely loved her. She was far beyond even the feelings of love. I have lost her. She sacrificed her life.” “What else is there for me to give?”
“I was accused of every crime on earth. I was accused of murder, of killing my own brother-in-law. I was accused of drug smuggling, of tying a bomb to the leg to extort money.” “Is there anything of which I have not been accused?” “I endured all this. I have been wronged.”
 
 

Baring his anguished soul, his words came out from the depths of his heart, creating a tapestry of admiration and respect that was difficult to explain. His words pierced the heart as he spoke and were profoundly moving. His voice became louder, and his speech incoherent. The next moment, it faltered, and his body shook. Then he began to stutter.
He struggled for the words to come out of his lips. Words that had flowed like a torrent before were now coming out with difficulty and haltingly. Each word was a struggle to come out of his mouth.
Then the stutter vanished, and he turned pale. His head swung to the right as he slipped on the sofa. A bottle of water was rushed, but it was hard to make him drink. He lay on the sofa, his feet dangling. He was helped to lie on the carpet on the floor. Someone rushed out to call for medical help.
Before the physician arrived, a trained valet barged into the room and administered some emergency tablets on his own. He knew what to do almost by reflex action if something went wrong. He removed Zardari’s socks, which were moist with sweat. Artificial resuscitation was also tried, but only briefly. It was not needed. The military secretary also rushed in. Everyone left the room. Minister of State Kamal Majidullah and I, however, stayed behind. Doctors called in emergency had arrived. A stretcher was brought in to take the president to his bedroom. The shades of night had fallen. It was 10:30pm.
As he was being shifted to the bedroom, I looked at him more closely again, fighting back the thought that it might be the last time. This was not the fate he deserved. It was hard to look at him. He was going down fighting. If it were his last battle, it was also his best. Shakespeare wrote: “He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.”

A few days later, a furniture brand known for its chairs, Chairman, released a press ad with the caption, “Humari kursi sab se mazboot hai [Our chair is the strongest].”
That one press ad put the brand smack dab in the middle of a political discourse that was raging at the time. Some understood the ad as mocking Bhutto, while others believed it was supporting him. The brand was doing neither. It was simply trying to gain some relevance during a time when a majority of Pakistanis were split into two camps and politics was all they were talking about. Uncannily, Chairman did something that was ahead of its time.
There is now enough evidence that in today’s polarised societies, consumer brands and their advertising agencies are struggling to understand their consumers and to stay relevant.
 
 

Numerous articles and books have appeared trying to figure out the ‘enigma’ that is Generation Z (1997-2012). It is as if the problems brands are facing to stay relevant can be resolved if this generation is ‘correctly’ profiled. But it has been profiled. In fact, unlike past generations, this one has been over-profiled.
Yet, numerous brands are continuing to struggle to get a foothold in the psyche and zeitgeist of the times they are operating in. Nevertheless, consequently, an increasing number of brands are realising that the field of marketing requires some major alterations in a polarised milieu. How can a brand find relevance in fragmented societies split into opposing cultural and political camps?

As societies grow increasingly divided along political and cultural lines, and as consumer identities rapidly change, brands must evolve or risk irrelevance

This is the question brands are asking — even though most have decided to go about their business the way they always have. But this means they are suffering from a ‘cultural lag.’ These brands are not keeping pace with the rapid cultural and political transformations taking place in societies and, consequently, within the markets that these brands operate in.
Consumer brands are not just products or services. They carry an ethos in a bid to strike a much ‘deeper connection’ with consumers. Sneakers are products. Nike, a company that makes this product, is a brand. It posits a belief: “Just Do It.” This is not just a slogan but an ethos: ‘Don’t hold back. Believe in yourself. Take the plunge. This act in itself is a win.’
To survive, brands need to remain relevant. One way of doing this is to jump on a bandwagon of trends driven by a particular generation. But this is not working anymore. For example, in Pakistan, some brands, in a bid, to become relevant for the youth, plug rap/hip-hop music in their communication. On most occasions, the youth finds this to be inauthentic and downright silly.
Disney learned this the hard way when it began to shape characters and plots of their films and TV series according to Gen Z’s ‘woke’ beliefs. But the company suffered one flop after another. It lost a huge amount of money by ‘going woke.’ And the irony is, the ‘woke crowd’ wasn’t interested. In fact, it saw Disney’s ploy as a corporate entity turning a cluster of beliefs into silly caricatures.
 
 

This shows just how tough it has become for brands to stay relevant in this day and age. Those who are playing safe may still be selling their products, but the emotional hold of the brands that make these products is rapidly loosening.
Politics has become a vital part of the transformations taking place in today’s polarised societies. But most brands are petrified to take sides or, for that matter, even to think about politics — even though it is possible that most of their consumers today would want them to. Brand teams and their advertising agencies are not designed to think any deeper than the standard ways they comprehend their consumers. The focus groups and researches that they bank on are engineered to only skim the surface of segments they are targeting.
It’s like those doltish TV shows in which a host asks the most inane questions from guests. One can get to know what a person’s favourite colour, soft-drink or ice cream flavour is, but that’s about it. Most focus groups turn consumers into caricatures.
A 2021 report by the American Marketing Association concluded that, as the political landscape continues to shift and polarise, the influence of politics on consumption behaviours is poised to grow. The report suggested that “analysing and utilising consumers’ political ideologies may prove not only useful to brands, but also necessary…”
 


Indeed, but such suggestions horrify most brands. Those who handle them are not designed to think about marketing in this manner. Secondly, most of them have only a superficial understanding of politics. So, even if they do venture out to determine the politics of their consumers, what will they ask? Some brands have started to hire help in this regard by asking sociologists and political scientists to design questioners.
After doing this, they have plunged in to pick a side. The American ice cream brand Ben&Jerry’s openly advocates progressive/liberal causes, whereas Black Rifle Coffee quietly supports conservative causes.
 
 

In fact, in the US, there are now numerous ‘Red Brands’ and ‘Blue Brands.’ Red ones identify with conservative views, and the blue ones uphold ‘liberal’ ideals. This is how these brands are finding relevance in a polarised society and, thus, market.
However, not all brands want to go this far — especially in Pakistan. But they are likely to continue losing relevance if they fail to understand the politics of their consumers. They don’t really have to pick a side. They only have to reshape the way they understand today’s consumers. This can provide them a deeper understanding of their consumers and more relevant communication can be the outcome, without even mentioning any politics.
I once worked with a Thai sociologist who was associated with a major advertising agency. This was during a research stint I was a part of in Washington DC, in 2018.
He demonstrated that even when a person enters a store just to buy a soft-drink can, on the surface, his choice in this regard is being influenced by taste and aesthetics. But, more importantly, what’s on the surface is being unconsciously influenced by his political and social views. In politically charged times, a brand needs to dig and mine these.

The fatal accident comes as relatives mourn at least 279 people killed when a passenger plane slammed into a residential area in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday.
The helicopter crash left the pilot and all six passengers dead when their chopper came down during the flight from Kedarnath temple, in Uttarakhand state, disaster response official Nandan Singh Rajwar told AFP.
The state’s chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, said rescue teams had been dispatched to the scene after the “very sad news”.
The crash was likely caused by bad weather, according to district tourism official Rahul Chaubey.
Pilgrims flock to Kedarnath temple during the summer when it is possible to access the site, which stands at an altitude of 3,584 metres.
A cottage industry of helicopter charter firms has developed to serve wealthy pilgrims who want to visit shrines in the Indian Himalayas, but who prefer to avoid arduous trekking.

• Inaugurates second phase of first segment of Shahrah-i-Bhutto
KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has warned the PML-N government that the PPP will not support the passage of the federal budget in parliament if Islamabad continues to manage development schemes in Sindh instead of transferring them to the provincial government.
Although the PPP is not part of the federal cabinet, it is a major coalition partner of the PML-N government and without its support the passage of the federal budget in the National Assembly is not possible.
Speaking at a programme held to inaugurate the second phase of the first complete segment of the Malir Expressway, renamed as Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Expressway / Shahrah-i-Bhutto, on Saturday, the CM strongly criticised the federal government, accusing it of discriminating against Sindh and treating the province like a colony.
“The federal government has wronged us. They have dissolved the Public Works Department (PWD), which was responsible for overseeing development projects across provinces,” he said, adding that while the other three provinces received funding for development projects accompanied by their budgets, Sindh was completely overlooked.
“They want to manage Sindh’s projects from Islamabad through a newly formed company. I have made it clear that this will not work,” he asserted.
He asked the federal government to transfer all development projects in Sindh to the provincial government; otherwise the PPP would not support the PML-N-led federal government in the passage of the federal budget in parliament.
“You cannot run Sindh like a colony,” he said,  adding that the federal government’s decision seemed influenced by specific vested interests.
Without naming the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, a coalition partner of the PML-N government at the Centre, the CM said: “It appears this move has been motivated by  land grabbers, the so-called ‘china-cutting mafia’.”
Mr  Shah urged the federal government to stop treating Sindh like a stepchild. “If you continue this stepmotherly treatment, we know how to claim our rights,” he warned.
‘A gift from PPP to Karachiites’
Talking about the expressway, the CM described the project as a vital gift from the PPP government to the people of Karachi,  promising enhanced transportation, economic growth and better industrial connectivity.
 
 

He reiterated that the expressway would improve transportation, stimulate economic growth and facilitate industrial links.
He also directed that the section from Kathore to Quaidabad be completed promptly. This project is the largest public-private partnership initiative in Sindh.
The chief minister noted that the starting point of Shahrah-i-Bhutto is located 200 meters before the Jam Sadiq Interchange. To enhance connectivity from DHA and Korangi, a permanent interchange/roundabout is being constructed at the existing Korangi Causeway to facilitate traffic from all directions, including Korangi, DHA, and Sharea Faisal (KPT Interchange).
Emphasising the importance of infrastructure development for progress, the CM stated that the focus is on making urban and industrial connections faster and safer. Although there have been some delays due to utility shifting and local issues, he assured that work is ongoing, with expected completion dates for the remaining sections by Dec 2025.
This inauguration follows the opening of the first phase of the first segment by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Jan 11, 2025, which covered the Sharea Faisal to Quaidabad stretch.
Mr Shah added that the final phase from Quaidabad to Kathore is expected to be opened by the end of Dec 2025, and that he plans to request an appointment with the PPP chairman after the anniversary of Benazir Bhutto’s death.
Speaking about future plans, he said the provincial government aims to establish a link road from the port to Qayyumabad, with strong backing from the Karachi business community. “Some people are beginning to recognise the efforts of the PPP,” he stated, adding: “To those who still question our work, I say the people of Sindh are fully aware.”
Earlier, the inauguration event drew significant attendance from PPP members and the public, with participants chanting party slogans.
Accompanied by senior ministers Sharjel Inam Memon, Minister of Planning and Development Nasir Shah, and Senator Waqar Mahdi, the chief minister inspected the expressway and paid the toll tax.
The Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Expressway project spans 38.661 km, with six lanes  and a design speed of 100 km/h. It connects DHA and Korangi to the M-9  Motorway near Kathore and includes six interchanges and 12 toll plazas.  The overall progress of the project is currently at 80 per cent.

PBC Chief Executive Officer Ehsan Malik, in a letter to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, said the powers do not differentiate between major taxpayers and the informal sector.
“We are alarmed at the draconian powers proposed to be granted to the FBR. If past practice is anything to go by, these will most likely be misused to harass the formal taxpaying sector,” he feared.
“We are disappointed that the powers proposed for the FBR will do the exact opposite of encouraging investment,” Ehsan informed the finance minister.
Pointing out excessive powers to FBR, he said Section 11E enables tax assessment and recovery based on suspicion without proper investigation, while Section 14AE allows arbitrary seizure of business premises and property without adequate safeguards.
Section 32B empowers private auditors with quasi-legal authority over businesses, while Section 33 introduces 10-year prison terms and Rs10 million fines for broadly defined “tax fraud,” which is likely to encompass business errors.
Section 37AA authorises arrest without a warrant based on mere suspicion of tax fraud—a power that invites abuse and harassment, followed by Section 37B, which permits a 14-day detention of businesspersons, extendable through magistrates. Overriding the principle of client/advisor relationship, Section 58C will grant the FBR access to the offices of tax advisers and firms where discrepancies in returns are suspected.
He informed the finance minister that from a country on the brink of default less than three years ago, the current economic stability owes much to your determined leadership. The raging fire of inflation has been doused, borrowing costs have declined sharply, the fiscal deficit is in control, the current ac­­c­ount is in surplus, two IMF tranches have been appr­o­ved, and the rupee is stable.
A substantial contribution to securing the IMF programme, and the resultant solvency, is the formal sector’s disproportionate contribution to taxes in the FY25 budget.
The council, for FY26, sought and has so far been denied a roadmap of gradual reduction in taxes. The critical need to support exports amid significant uncertainty from US tariffs has not been addressed.

• Asad Qaiser says it is Pakistan’s moral duty to support Iran
ISLAMABAD: Minister for Defence Kha­waja Asif on Saturday cal­le­­d on the Organisation of Islamic Coope­ra­tion (OIC) to hold an emergency meeting to map out a joint strategy in the wake of Israel’s ongoing aggression, warning that if the Muslim Ummah does not unite, every Muslim country’s turn will come.
“The way Israel has targeted Yemen, Iran, and Palestine shows a larger game plan,” he said while speaking in the National Assembly.
The remarks came as another war in Middle East has sparked a global turmoil. The defence minister pointed out that most of the Muslim nations were already facing security risks.
“Strong leadership is needed now,” he remarked and described Israel’s brutal actions, particularly its military aggression against Iran as a serious threat to regional and global peace.
Regretting the apathy of the Muslim world over the aggression in Palestine where even children were being brutally killed, he said there were more protests in non-Muslim countries than in Muslim nations. He assured that Pakistan stands firmly with Iran and will continue to support it on all international fora.
The defence minister said that while Pakistan’s military strength was commendable, the economy must also be strong.
 






Tax evasion
Mr Asif said that the country suffers huge losses due to tax evasion, especially in sectors like tobacco, real estate, steel, and tyres. “We lose around Rs300 billion annually in tobacco taxes alone,” he said, acknowledging that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made some improvements, but much more needs to be done.
“If we can just improve our tax collection by 50 per cent, we wouldn’t need foreign loans,” he noted.
He demanded accountability and urged the finance ministry and FBR to brief the parliament on the people behind large-scale tax evasion. “We need honesty in governance. Only then we can provide real relief to the people,” he said.
Jibe at PTI
The minister criticised those who now attack the government’s economic policy had once urged the IMF not to support Pakistan.
“These people tried to sabotage our economy,” he said. “Pakistan is not about any one person. It is a mission, a belief, and a shared history.”
He urged political leaders to rise above personal ambitions and serve the nation with sincerity.
‘Stand by Iran’
Former National Assembly speaker and PTI leader Asad Qaiser in his speech while referring to Israeli attack on Iran said, “It is our moral obligation to stand by Iran at this critical time.”
He also said that Israel has committed the worst atrocities against Palestinians, sparing neither children, women, the elderly, nor hospitals and schools. He regretted the criminal silence of international community, particularly from human rights organisations and so-called democratic states.
“Most disappointing, however, is the deafening silence of the Muslim Ummah,” he said and demanded that the government immediately launch diplomatic efforts to convene an emergency session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
Discussing financial ‘injustices’ with Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, he said, “After the Fata merger, the province’s NFC award share should have been increased from 14 per cent to 19pc, but there has been no substantial progress.
During his visit to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had claimed that an additional 1pc allocation was allocated for terrorism-affected areas.
 
 

However, the province’s agreed annual share of 4.84pc, amounting to Rs381bn, has yet to be released, Mr Qaider recalled.
Furthermore, the hydel profit amount due to the province has also been withheld.
“Is this all just because the people of KP voted for PTI,” he asked.
He said the current government has earmarked only Rs550m for the entire province’s Public Sector Develop­ment Programme (PSDP).
“We are demanding our constitutional rights, and if the situation remains unchanged, we will stage a sit-in on the motorway with our people.” he warned.
 






‘Discrepancy’
Expressing his views, PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar stated that there is a clear contradiction between the public statements made by the prime minister and cabinet members and the figures presented in the budget documents.
He said that while government officials insist that agriculture is the backbone of country’s economy, there is nothing for this vital sector, which ensures food security.
“Do you want to depend on imports to meet country’s food needs?” he questioned.
 






In her remarks, PPP leader Sharmila Farooqui questioned the powers being given to the FBR to arrest people without any notice.
She pointed out that external debts continue to pile up but over 100 entities had been given relief in taxes.

Additionally, some existing taxes have been eliminated or reduced, with export processing zones and special economic zones exempted from the services tax.
Addressing a post-budget press conference at the CM House, he announced the abolition of the entertainment tax and reductions in restaurant taxes.
He said that as per the Sindh Finance Bill 2025-26, the stamp duty on third-party vehicle insurance had also been reduced to Rs50 with a drop in the insurance tax from 15 to 5pc, adding that a list of tax-exempted items would be published as per the IMF requirement.
As per the finance bill, services of parliament and assembly members, local government representatives, judges, and tribunal members were exempted from sales tax.

Chief minister opposes Centre’s 18pc general sales tax on solar panels

Tax exemption on construction of 10,000 sq. feet of houses in private residential schemes and there would be no tax on health and life insurance worth Rs500,000.
The government-approved universities and colleges will also not have to pay tax on educational research, while Haj and Umrah travel operators will be exempt from tax.
According to the bill, a 19.5pc tax would be applied to vehicle trackers, security cameras, and alarm systems in security services.
The internet, telephone services, Wi-Fi and broadband connections service will have to pay 19.5pc tax, and there will be a three per cent tax on those who transact vehicles.
There will be 8pc tax on online payments of restaurants, hotels, farmhouses and beverages. Cab services will have to pay 5pc, rental car services and freight vehicles will have to pay 8pc tax.
As per the bill, 8pc tax will have to be paid on hiring armed guards and security guards.
There will be 8pc tax on real estate services and 3pc on foreign exchange services.
Coaching and training centres will also have to pay 3pc tax. Schools and colleges that receive an annual fee of Rs500,000 will also pay 3pc tax.
The chief minister in a wide-ranging post-budget press conference outlined an ambitious fiscal and development agenda for the province while addressing serious financial challenges and federal shortfalls.
Flays Centre for withholding funds
He criticised the federal government for failing to meet its financial commitments, revealing that Sindh was informed just one day before the budget presentation that Rs105bn in expected funds would be withheld. “Sindh has received Rs1,478.5bn from the divisible pool since last year, but Rs422.3bn remains outstanding,” he lamented.
Mr Shah expressed hope that the withheld amount would be disbursed by the end of June.
He said that the Sindh government would allocate Rs590bn for development projects this year, with a total budget of Rs3.45tr — Rs1tr for development and Rs2.15tr for current expenditures.
“Notably, Rs1.1tr is earmarked for salaries and pensions, leading to salary increases of 12pc for lower-grade employees and 10pc for higher grades.
He said that sectoral budget increases included an 18pc rise in education funding and an 11pc increase in health. Funding for agriculture, irrigation, and local government projects has also seen significant boosts.
Job vacancies
He also noted 20,000 to 25,000 job vacancies in Grades 1 to 4, with plans for recruitment via IBA-administered tests for Grades BPS-5 to 7 and filling higher Grade 16 positions.
On the critical Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, the chief minister expressed concern over the halving of federal funding from Rs30bn to Rs15bn.
Opposes tax on solar panels
Mr Shah emphasised that major projects are not included in the Federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and criticised the 18pc tax on solar panels as unjust, warning that the Pakistan Peoples Party would not support the federal budget if concerns raise are not resolved.
Addressing various challenges, he acknowledged delays in operating 150 buses in Karachi due to resource constraints but highlighted ongoing infrastructure and sanitation projects.
On digitisation, Mr Shah admitted the Sindh government had not fully digitised land records yet, but was piloting a project in Matli and Sukkur.
Mr Shah revealed Rs25bn allocated for solar projects and the launch of afforestation programmes to combat climate change, admitting more needs to be done.

• Meagre allocations for Sukkur motorway and K-IV projects deplored
KARACHI: Trade and industry leaders on Saturday strongly criticised the federal and Sindh budgets for the upcoming fiscal year, calling them deeply disappointing and discriminatory towards Karachi, the country’s economic nerve centre.
Businessmen Group (BMG) Chairman Zubair Motiwala and Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani expressed serious concerns over the sheer neglect and denial of essential development funds to Karachi and the province of Sindh as a whole.
In a joint statement, they also demanded that before the approval of budgets, necessary amendments be made by significantly enhancing allocations for Karachi-centric development projects.
Highlighting the gross underfunding of the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, a strategic infrastructure project vital for the economic connectivity of Sindh and Karachi, they said despite the project’s total cost exceeding Rs400 billion, the federal government allocates a meagre Rs15bn for 2025-26, reflecting a blatant disregard for Sindh’s development priorities, especially considering that Karachi would directly benefit from the completion of this motorway.
The K-IV Water Supply Project has been in limbo for years despite being a critical lifeline for the water-scarce city of Karachi. Despite multiple promises made at the highest level, including by prime minister himself, the federal government has once again failed to demonstrate a commitment to the project, allocating only Rs3.2bn out of the total required Rs150bn, thus raising doubts about the government’s sincerity in addressing Karachi’s water crisis.
They stated that the Sindh government has failed to address Karachi’s needs adequately. In the provincial development outlay, the Sindh government has allocated a meagre Rs100 million for the K-IV project and a symbolic Rs15bn for the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, amounts that are practically meaningless in terms of project execution.
Alarmingly, this marks the third consecutive year in which not a single new mega development project has been announced for Karachi, they said, adding that the only gesture made was the allocation of Rs eight billion for the continuation of previously announced mega projects, most of which have been progressing at a snail’s pace.
Despite being a vital lifeline for Karachi, the K-IV project continues to face inexcusable delays, even as the city’s demand for water grows exponentially with each passing day.
Shockingly, millions of gallons of water are being wasted and discharged into the sea, while the people of Karachi and its industrial zones remain parched and desperate for a sustainable water supply, they deplored.
Appreciating the ongoing development of the new canal from Hub Dam, they noted that the project was initially scheduled for completion by August. With barely two months remaining, the government must accelerate work on a war footing to ensure its timely execution.
They further recalled that an additional supply of 10 MGD (million gallons per day) was promised for the SITE Industrial Area, and the relevant PC-I had already been approved — a move widely welcomed by the business community. However, the promised supply remains unfulfilled, leaving industries in a continued state of uncertainty.
They stressed that the continuous denial of fair development funding for Karachi is not just a regional injustice but a national threat, as Karachi contributes the largest share of 67pc revenue to the national exchequer, 90pc to the provincial kitty and 54pc in terms of exports.
They called on both the federal and provincial governments to urgently revise their priorities and ensure that Karachi receives its fair share of development funding. The time for symbolic allocations and broken promises has long passed. Concrete action, substantial funding, and political will are now required to address the growing frustration of the citizens and business community of Karachi.

ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel on Saturday pressed senior tax officials to drop proposed provisions in the Finance Bill 2025 granting arrest and money laundering notice powers to tax commissioners, warning the move would create unnecessary obstacles for businesses.
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandvi­walla, convened for a second consecutive day to examine the Finance Bill 2025. Lawmakers debated the implications of enhanced powers for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and discussed measures to curb tampered vehicles.
Senator Mandviwalla warned that there is a grave risk of misuse of the power to arrest or issue a notice. Even a junior FBR officer sending a notice could create chaos, he warned. He also emphasised that receiving a money laundering notice often leads to business shutdowns. “Such notices should require the express permission of the FBR chairman and the finance minister,” he said.
Senator Shibli Faraz also stressed that this extension of power to tax commissioners is turning Pakistan into a police state. “Even taxpayers will flee,” he warned.
Senator Farooq H. Naek underscored the imp­act of business bec­ause of the same, stating that money laundering notices are not trivial. “They can cripple a businessman’s ability to import or export,” Mr Naek warned the FBR.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb acknowledged the apprehensions of senators, stating that money laundering notices are indeed a very serious matter and should be reviewed carefully under this provision.
The Pakistan Business Council has also raised alarm, formally writing to the prime minister to urge the government to reconsider the plan to empower FBR officials with arrest and notice authority.
Meanwhile, FBR Cha­ir­man Rashid Mahmood Langrial defended the move, stressing that tax officials already possess the authority to arrest businesspersons, but the procedure has been further refined in the latest bill.
However, Senator Shibli Faraz strongly opposed the proposal to grant arrest powers to income tax commissioners, arguing that such mea­sures are turning the country into a police state.
Amendments to the Customs Act
The committee also examined proposed ame­­ndments to the Customs Act, 1969, including the rollout of a digital Cargo Tracking System (CTS) to monitor the movement of imports, exports, transhipments and transit cargo. The CTS aims to curb smuggling and ensure duty compliance while easing legitimate trade.
 
 

Another amendment would exempt postal or courier imports valued below Rs5,000 from duties and taxes. However, the de minimis limit for courier parcels is set to drop from Rs15,000 to Rs500 to prevent misuse by individuals.
The committee also approved strict measures against tampered vehicles. Under the proposed law, any vehicle found with a tampered chassis number, cut-and-weld modifications or re-stamped identification will be presumed smuggled, regardless of registration status.
The FBR chairman clarified that such vehicles will be confiscated and destroyed. “Such vehicles will not be auctioned again. In principle, these vehicles should be scrapped to prevent the resale of parts,” he said.
The committee recommended that the confiscation and destruction of such vehicles must occur within 30 days of seizure.
The Pakistan Poultry Association requested that customs duty on grandparent chicks be reduced to zero, while the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture sought a cut in duty on imported and reconditioned tractors from 15 to 5 per cent.
FBR chief briefing
Briefing the committee, Mr Langrial highlighted Pakistan’s stark wealth inequality, stating that just 5pc of the population controls most of the country’s wealth.
“Ninety-five per cent cannot afford to pay taxes,” he added, revealing that the top one per cent earn an average of Rs10 million per year.
The focus must shift from expanding the tax net to taxing the rich effectively, he emphasised. He added that only 6m people are registered tax filers, while 132m are under 18 or senior citizens — outside the labour force. At the same time, 67m are unemployed, including a large segment of educated women.
Mr Langrial confirmed that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked Pakistan to introduce new tax measures worth Rs701 billion for FY26. The FBR aims to generate Rs500bn through enforcement measures, although the Fund has adjusted this target to Rs389bn.
He said that tax collection from the sugar, cotton, and other sectors is being underreported. In the tobacco sector, strict monitoring will start from July 1 to track green tobacco leaf production, he said, adding, “We will fix cameras at identified places.”
The IMF will also conduct weekly reviews of the FBR’s performance. Mr Langrial claimed that improved enforcement had already led to significant tax collection gains.

Mr Dar was scheduled to travel to New York next week to attend a United Nations conference on Palestinian statehood. But on Friday, France and Saudi Arabia — co-sponsors of the event — requested the UN to postpone the gathering.
The request followed Israeli air strikes on Iran. Speaking in Paris, French President Emmanuel Mac­ron said the conference, which aimed to advance a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, had been delayed but would still take place.
“While we have to postpone this conference for logistical and security reasons, it will take place as soon as possible,” Presi­dent Macron said.
The changing situation in the Middle East has also delayed another planned visit — that of a trade delegation from Islamabad, which was to hold talks in Washington on tariffs.
 
 

At a news briefing last week, US President Donald Trump had anno­unced that the delegation would arrive “next week” for trade talks. Those plans are now on hold.
“But it will happen soon. We are working on the schedule,” a source told Dawn.

• Egypt blocks activists’ bid to march to Gaza border
CAIRO: Israeli firing and air strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, many of them near an aid distribution site operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation on Saturday, local health authorities said.
Medics at Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa Hospitals in central Gaza areas, where most of the casualties were moved to, said at least 15 people were killed as they tried to approach the GHF aid distribution site near the Netzarim corridor.
The Israeli army said in a statement that an aircraft had opened fire on a person “to neutralise the threat” after he advanced towards troops and ignored warning shots fired near a group.
Last week, the army warned Palestinians not to approach routes leading to sites of the GHF between 6pm and 6am local time, describing these roads as closed military zones. The GHF said none of its distribution centres was opened on Saturday.
The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May after Israel partially lifted a near three-month total blockade. Scores of Palestinians have been killed in near daily mass shootings trying to reach the food.
The United Nations rejects the Israeli-backed new distribution system as inadequate, dangerous, and a violation of humanitarian impartiality principles.
“None of our distribution sites were open today, and there were no incidents at our sites because they were closed,” the GHF said in a written response to Reuters about Saturday’s incident.
The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday that at least 274 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,000 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.
Hamas, which denies Israeli charges that it steals aid, accused Israel of “employing hunger as a weapon of war and turning aid distribution sites into traps of mass deaths of innocent civilians.”
Health officials at Shifa Hospital in Gaza said Israeli fire killed at least 12 Palestinians, who gathered to wait for aid trucks along the coastal road north of the strip.
The Israeli military ordered residents of Khan Younis and the nearby towns of Abassan and Bani Suhaila in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and head west towards a so-called humanitarian zone, saying it would forcefully work against “terror organisations” in the area.
March to Gaza border
Meanwhile, Egyptian authorities have blocked activists’ efforts to hold a march to the Gaza border to draw attention to Israel’s blockade of the war-torn Palestinian territory, organisers said Saturday.
Several dozen activists hoping to join the planned Global March to Gaza were stopped on the edge of Cairo as they attempted to reach the Suez Canal city of Ismailiya, the organisers said.
From there they had hoped to travel on by road to the North Sinai city of El-Arish, the starting point for their planned march to the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing on the Gaza border.
Most of the activists were ordered onto buses back to the capital after several hours of questioning, but some remained in custody on Saturday, the organisers said.
“We were blocked for six to seven hours before security forces violently dispersed our group,” one organiser said.
At least one activist was expelled from Egypt, several sources said, adding to dozens more denied entry or expelled in the run-up.
Egyptian authorities have not commented on the reported expulsions.
The foreign ministry had warned that while Egypt backs efforts to put “pressure on Israel” to lift its Gaza blockade, any foreign delegations intending to visit the border area must obtain prior permission.

The vessel, MV ASL ROSE arrived from Australia carrying 20,000 tonnes of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser destined for Afghanistan.
Previously, the first ship under the Afghan Transit Trade, MV Beyond 2, berthed at Gwadar Port on Feb 4.
The current consignment was imported by Agven Private Limited, further highlighting Gwadar Port’s growing role as an emerging transit hub for Afghanistan.
This progress in Afghan transit trade became possible after the Economic Coordination Committee of Pakistan abolished the requirement for bank guarantees on Afghan trade — a policy aimed at facilitating smoother trade and strengthening economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Gwadar Port Chairman Shah Irfan Ahmed remarked that the successful berthing and swift unloading of MV ASL ROSE demonstrate that Gwadar Port is now fully equipped for modern and efficient commercial operations.
He emphasised that Gwadar’s expanding role in Afghan Transit Trade not only showcases the port’s capacity but also opens new avenues of economic opportunities for the entire region.
“We aim to establish Gwadar Port as a reliable trade corridor not just for Afghanistan but for Central Asia as well,” Mr Ahmed added.

Sachal Station House Officer Aurangzeb Khattak told Dawn.com that the body of a man in his mid-20s was recovered from bushes outside the wall of the society near Super Highway.
“The victim sustained injuries to his head,” he added.
Khattak highlighted the possibility that he might have been thrown there by suspects travelling in a car.
He also said that the body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that although the victim was in the advanced stage of decomposition, there were head injuries.
“The cause of death was a head injury,” Dr Syed said, adding that samples had been collected.
Earlier this year, Mustafa Amir, a 23-year-old youth, was kidnapped and allegedly murdered by his friends in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA). According to the police, the youth’s friends stuffed his body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
In Feb, police arrested Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect, for injuring officers while resisting his detention. His friend Sheraz aka Shavez Bukhari was remanded by an ATC.
Armaghan was sent to prison in March after he refused to record his confessional statement while a magistrate observed that the suspect was not in stable condition to record his confession.</p><small>2025-06-14 18:26</small></div><hr>
