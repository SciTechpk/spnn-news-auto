After nearly two decades of on-off negotiations, the deal will pave the way for India to open up its vast and guarded market to free trade with the 27-nation EU, its biggest trading partner.
“Yesterday, a big agreement was signed between the European Union and India,” Modi said.
“People around the world are calling this the mother of all deals. This agreement will bring major opportunities for the 1.4 billion people of India and the millions of people in Europe,” he said.
Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to make a joint announcement at an India-EU summit in New Delhi, along with the details of the deal, later on Tuesday.







Trade between India and the EU stood at $136.5bn in the fiscal year through March 2025.
The formal signing of the India-EU deal would take place after legal vetting expected to last five to six months, an Indian government official aware of the matter has said.
“We expect the deal to be implemented within a year,” the official added.
Flurry of trade deals
The agreement comes days after the EU signed a pivotal pact with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.
During the same period, New Delhi finalised pacts with Britain, New Zealand and Oman.
The spate of deals underscores global efforts to hedge against trade with the United States as President Donald Trump’s bid to take over Greenland and tariff threats on European nations test longstanding alliances among Western nations.
An India-US trade deal collapsed last year after a breakdown in communications between the two governments.
Talks between India and the EU were relaunched in 2022 after a nine-year lull, and gathered momentum after Trump put tariffs on several trading partners, including a 50pc tariff on goods from India.
For India, the tariff cuts with the EU will lead to more exports in labour intensive sectors that will help partly offset the impact of US tariffs, said Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official.
He said the deal will also give an immediate price advantage for EU products in India because of some relief from its high tariffs, for instance up to 110pc on cars.</p><small>2026-01-27 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/271151043f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969346/pakistan-ghana-hold-first-formal-bilateral-talks-reaffirm-commitment-to-strengthen-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Ghana hold first formal bilateral talks; reaffirm commitment to strengthen ties</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Ghana held their first formal bilateral talks and signed two Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs), the Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday.
A press release by the FO, initially released on Monday, said that the two countries convened their first Bilateral Political Consultations (BPC) on Monday, “marking an important milestone in the development of bilateral relations between the two countries”.
“The Pakistani delegation was led by Ambassador Hamid Asghar Khan, additional foreign secretary, while the Ghanaian side was headed by Ambassador Khadija Iddrisu, chief director (of the) ministry of foreign affairs,” it said.
During the talks, it added, two Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) were signed: an MoU on BPCs and an MoU between Islamabad’s Foreign Service Academy and the Ghana Foreign Service Institute.







“Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and agreed to enhance cooperation across a broad range of areas, including political, economic, defence, tourism, cultural, health, education, information technology, and other mutually beneficial sectors,” the statement said.
According to the FO, the two sides also agreed to hold the next round of the BPC in Islamabad next year.
“Pakistan and Ghana have friendly, cooperative ties, spanning many decades. The institutional dialogue process will further strengthen their bilateral relations through more meaningful and project-specific cooperation,” it said.
While relations between the two countries are still budding, Pakistan has been endeavouring to establish closer diplomatic ties with African nations.
On Saturday, Pakistan and Somalia signed an agreement abolishing visa requirements for diplomatic passport holders of both countries.
Last year, the Senate unanimously adopted a resolution declaring May 25 as Pakistan-Africa Frien­d­­ship Day, a motion moved by Deputy Prime Minister and Fore­ign Minister Ishaq Dar.</p><small>2026-01-27 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2711120129d329d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969344/westerly-wave-to-persist-until-tomorrow-says-nwfc-northern-areas-experience-below-freezing-temperatures' target='_blank'><strong>Westerly wave to persist until tomorrow, says NWFC; northern areas experience below-freezing temperatures</strong></a><br><p>The country remained in the grip of a cold wave as a westerly system affected the upper parts, with temperatures dipping below freezing in many northern areas.
The National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC) in its daily forecast said that “a westerly wave is affecting the upper parts of the country and likely to persist in northern parts till tomorrow”.
According to NWFC, the upper parts of the country, including Malam Jabba, Parachinar, and Gupis, saw temperatures dip to -7°C, Bagrote at -6°C, followed closely by Kalam and Rawalakot at -5°C, while the temperature in Muree and Skardu remained -3°C, followed by -1°C in Quetta.
The weather centre warned that snowfall may cause “road closure/ slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galliyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli on January 27”.
It also predicted the possibility of landslides and avalanches in hilly areas of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
It advised tourists to exercise caution and avoid unnecessary travel.
As for rain, the weather centre predicted that intermittent rain, wind, and thunderstorms were expected today in upper KP, AJK and GB.
“Heavy rain with moderate to heavy snowfall is also likely at isolated places,” it added.
As for the lower KP, northeastern Punjab and northern Balochistan, the NWFC predicted “cloudy weather accompanied [by] more isolated rain-wind/thunderstorm.”
“Cold and dry weather is likely in other parts of the country,” it further said, adding that the weather will persist till tomorrow.
Meanwhile, the National Highways and Motorways Police (NHMP), in a series of posts on X, detailed that the motorway police were “engaged in ensuring smooth flow of traffic” amid heavy snowfall in the upper parts of the country.
On the E-35 Hazara Expressway, NHMP said that “it was maintaining the smooth flow of traffic and ensuring timely assistance to the public”.
Visuals shared by the motorway police showed officials clearing snow from the road.







In a separate update, the NHMP shared visuals of heavy machinery removing snow from the Murree Expressway.







The NWFC, in its yesterday’s forecast, had warned of traffic disruption due to heavy snowfall, causing road closures and slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galiyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noshki, Harnai and Zhob.
Third spell of snow in South Waziristan
A third spell of snowfall, accompanied by intermittent rain, swept across the mountainous districts of South Waziristan Upper and South Waziristan Lower on late Monday night.
The weather intensified the cold and restricted mobility in high-altitude areas.
The weather system, described as the third major snowfall of the season, has caused a noticeable drop in temperatures, raising concerns over road blockages.
At the same time, the weather has brought relief to farmers after an extended dry period.
Local sources said snowfall continued intermittently in the upper reaches, while lower and plain areas received steady rainfall.
Residents reported icy roads, reduced visibility, and increased difficulty in daily travel.
Authorities warned that prolonged snowfall could once again cut off access to remote villages if road clearance operations are delayed.
Areas affected by the snowfall include Angoor Adda, Shakai, Khamrang, Raghzai, Zam Cheena, Margha Cheena, Kaniguram, Badar, Makeen, Ladha, and surrounding mountainous regions.
Two days prior, heavy snowfall in these localities blocked at least 12 road sections, severely disrupting transportation and delaying the supply of food and other essential items.
From an agricultural standpoint, the latest spell has been widely welcomed.
Farmers and landowners across South Waziristan said the winter rain and snowfall would have a positive impact on crops, particularly wheat, which is currently at a critical growth stage.
They explained that precipitation and melting snow naturally enhance soil moisture and fertility, creating favourable conditions for improved yields in the coming months.
A farmer from Wana said rain and snow function as natural irrigation systems. “They keep the soil moist, help seeds germinate properly, and increase the effectiveness of fertilisers,” he said. “This ultimately results in higher yields and improves farmers’ incomes.”
Officials from the agriculture and irrigation departments also described the latest weather spell as encouraging, particularly given the steady decline in groundwater levels observed over recent years.
They said prolonged dry conditions, below-average rainfall, and excessive use of tube wells had significantly depleted underground water reserves across South Waziristan.
According to officials, the gradual melting of snow will replenish streams, springs, and underground aquifers, helping stabilise water levels throughout the region.
Despite the benefits, the adverse effects of snowfall remain a concern in remote and elevated areas. The sharp decline in temperature has intensified cold conditions, while icy surfaces and fog have partially disrupted traffic in several localities. Residents reported difficulties commuting during early morning and evening hours, particularly on steep and narrow roads.
District administration has advised residents, especially those living in snowfall-prone areas, to remain cautious and avoid unnecessary travel during severe weather.
Citizens have also been urged to take preventive measures against extreme cold, particularly for children and the elderly.
Officials said instructions have been issued to ensure timely road clearance operations and preparedness to respond swiftly to any emergency arising from further snowfall or adverse weather conditions.</p><small>2026-01-27 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647438-police-shortage-in-karachi-may-have-led-to-mqm-p-security-withdrawal' target='_blank'><strong>'Police shortage in Karachi' may have led to MQM-P security withdrawal</strong></a><br><p>

Among many talking points, the biggest was the exclusion of speedster Haris Rauf; despite his good showing at the Big Bash Down Under.
Perhaps he’d lost the trust of chief selector Aaqib Javed.
Pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi suffered an injury during the Big Bash League, having missed the previous tri-series against Sri Lanka due to fitness issues.
With Haris absent, Shaheen will have to bear greater responsibility; needing to take wickets in the early overs, and the death overs — which will be particularly challenging for him as his performance in that phase has not been great.
Salman Mirza has emerged as a good pacer, performing well with both the new and old ball, while Naseem Shah’s fitness and performance were satisfactory, leading to his selection.
Many others were overlooked. The selectors did not choose Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jr., or Ahmed Daniyal, opting instead for fast-bowling all-rounder Faheem Ashraf.
Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, Saim Ayub, and skipper Salman Ali Agha are the spin-bowling all-rounders in the team, but their increased number, as well as the presence of multiple wicket-keepers seems to disrupt the team balance.
The squad includes three wicket-keepers, none of whom were the first choice for their Pakistan Super League franchises. Khawaja Nafay is with Quetta Gladiators, but the keeping is handled by Sri Lankans Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal.
Usman Khan played as a batsman for Multan Sultans and occasionally kept wickets, but Mohammad Rizwan was the number one choice.
Sahibzada Farhan kept wickets in just one match for Islamabad United, as Andries Gous and Azam Khan were the main wicket-keepers.
In comparison, the cricketing world has wicket-keepers who are match-winners.
Pakistan’s philosophy is different. Instead of a specialist, any batter who can keep wickets is given a chance without considering how costly it could prove for the team.
Babar conundrum
Further beyond, there are questions regarding former skipper Babar Azam’s selection, as his performance in the shortest format of the game hasn’t been very impressive of late; the batter coming off a below-par in Big Bash.
There is also a striking likeness between Babar and captain Salman Ali Agha. They are similar batters, occupying number three and four spots in the line-up. They may perform well in low-scoring matches, but could face difficulties in high-scoring games.
The batting lineup has five openers who are capable of batting at different numbers, including Saim, Sahibzada, Babar, Fakhar Zaman and Nafay, who have all been seen playing in the top order for their franchises. However, when it comes to the middle-order, batters like Irfan Khan Niazi and Abdul Samad have not been given opportunities.
The spotlight has been on the performance of Pakistan players in the Big Bash, while overlooking their performance in the Bangladesh Premier League.
Opener Sahibzada scored 185 runs in nine innings with a strike rate of 118.58, which is not particularly commendable. Similarly, Saim Ayub scored 68 runs in four innings with a strike rate of only 117.24.
Fakhar Zaman, who went to play in the International League T20, performed below his standards, scoring 260 runs in 12 innings with an average of 21.66 and a strike rate of 124.40.
Babar, meanwhile, played seven innings in the Big Bash, scoring 131 runs at a strike rate of 99.2.
Spin strength
Overall, Pakistan’s spin department looks the strongest with two specialist spinners in Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, who are world-class. However, it might be difficult to see both play together since Nawaz, Shadab and Saim are the three spin-bowling all-rounders available. With their presence, it is likely that only one of Usman or Abrar is able to secure a spot in the playing eleven.
Pakistan could benefit from the conditions in Sri Lanka, with the team playing all their matches in Colombo. Their biggest test will come against holders India, with the United States, Namibia and the Netherlands the other teams in the group.
On paper, Pakistan should advance from the group stage. Further ahead, it remains to be seen whether they can forge a combination that can help them go all the way.</p><small>2026-01-27 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647432-sindh-schools-receive-new-direction-after-gul-plaza-tragedy' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh schools receive new direction after Gul Plaza tragedy</strong></a><br><p>

This agreement marked the culmination of decades of global dialogue and ambition, beginning with the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, followed by the Millennium Summit in 2000, the Johannesburg Declaration in 2002, and Rio+20 in 2012. Each of these milestones laid the foundation for a shared vision of forging a global partnership to advance peace, prosperity, and sustainable development for both the people and the planet.
Importantly, the SDGs attempted to build on previous global efforts and address their shortcomings. The Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) that preceded them and had shaped development priorities for 15 years prior, achieved notable progress but were viewed as being narrowly focused on anti-poverty and public health in developing countries, and driven by a paternalistic top-down approach from external actors (largely UN agencies and donors).
The SDGs broadened the scope to ambitiously include decent work, climate action, affordable clean energy, peace and justice, and multi-stakeholder partnerships, among others. They evolved through a participatory bottom-up process and placed the responsibility for implementation on all countries, not just developing ones.
The year 2015 was marked by two other significant events.
The third International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD3) in July in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, underscored the importance of ramping up private and blended finance tools to achieve the SDGs. It highlighted that public flows alone would not be enough, popularising the phrase ‘from billions to trillions’. Additionally, donor countries reaffirmed their commitment to allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance (ODA), an unlikely triumph given preliminary discussions a few years ago at the heels of the financial crisis had not been promising.

 

The second was the Paris Agreement in December in France, a legally binding international treaty on climate change with an overarching goal to limit the global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius. It was understood that the developed world would take the lead on providing financial assistance, technology and capacity building to support the less endowed and more vulnerable countries for emissions mitigation and adaptation to climate change.
Fast forward to date, development practitioners reflect on 2015 with somewhat of a nostalgia. What was observed then, some argue, was the peak of multilateralism rather than a take-off for a new era of global cooperation – an apex, not a beginning. It may yet be early to say whether this pessimism is warranted and whether the development agenda has derailed or simply detoured for now. But warning signs are blaring: only 18pc of the SDGs are on track, the financing gap to achieving them has been estimated at a staggering $2.5 to $4.5 trillion annually till 2030, and the latest global warming projections imply that there is a two-third chance that the current mitigation policies will only keep warming below 2.8°C by the end of this century.
How did we get here?
For one, the designers of SDGs crafted a vision of a better world that fell short of the realities of politics, argues Professor Adam Tooze of Columbia University in the September cover essay for the Foreign Policy magazine. They, furthermore, failed to foresee how status quo powers would react when development eventually occurs. What would happen if, for instance, Mexico reached Canadian levels of GDP per capita, or Ethiopia and Nigeria achieved Turkish levels? Look no further than China, Tooze asserts, a remarkable development success story, which fostered neither greater trust nor reinforced the international rules-based order but has rather triggered a new Cold War. Development, he put forth, is fundamentally political and a more developed world is inherently more multipolar.
The rise in public sentiment of inward-looking, nationalist ideologies across rich democracies is maybe then not a coincidence. Instead, it reflects the growing belief that supporting development elsewhere comes at the expense of prosperity at home.
In March 2025, the US formally denounced the SDGs stating that such globalist agendas were incompatible with national sovereignty and had ‘lost at the ballot box’. Instead, the US called for ‘responsible’ development, emphasising that countries should take greater ownership of their national development priorities over compliance with global targets. When the US Agency for International Development became a casualty to this re-positioning, there was expectation that other donors and supporters of multilateralism (especially Europeans) would pick up the tab. Yet, it wasn’t the case. Indeed, aid budgets have been slashed across the board with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimating global aid to fall by 25pc by 2027.
But politics aside, there are other critical factors that deserve attention. The past decade has been one of unprecedented polycrisis: global pandemic, increasing conflicts, mounting public debt burdens, and rising geo-economic fragmentation.
The COVID-19 pandemic dealt a major setback to the SDGs, halting progress across multiple fronts. In 2020, an estimated 100 million children and youth slipped below minimum reading proficiency, more than 250 million livelihoods were lost, and over 100 million people had plunged back into poverty, reversing years of hard-won gains. More than 7 million COVID-19 deaths globally have been reported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to date.
In retrospect, the pandemic truly put the lofty claims of global cooperation to test, exposing just how fragile that cooperation really was. Higher-income countries rushed to hoard vaccines and personal protective gear and undermined efforts by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to temporarily waive patents for vaccine production. Consequently, many of these countries had administered their third and even fourth vaccine doses before even 20pc of the population in lower-income countries, mostly in Africa, had received a single shot. The head of WHO declaring this situation a ‘vaccine apartheid’.

 

The last decade has seen the world become increasingly less peaceful. There are 59 active state-based conflicts – the most since World War II. Many of the leading indicators that typically precede major conflicts are at record levels, and this trajectory appears to be getting worse. We have already seen extraordinary escalations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen, the regime change in Venezuela with the raid and seizure of President Nicolás Maduro by the US, as well as the US posturing over Greenland that has shaken its European allies and put into question the future of the Western alliance.
At the same time, the ability to resolve conflicts is at its lowest point in five decades. Between 1970s and 2010s, decisive victories fell significantly from 49pc to 9pc and conflict resolution through peace agreement declined from 23pc to only 4pc.
One key reason is the growing internationalisation of conflicts — 78 countries are involved in conflicts beyond their own boundaries. This growing external involvement is fuelled by deepening geopolitical divisions and intensifying competition among major powers, alongside the expanding influence of middle powers that have become increasingly active within their regions.
As a result, by the end of 2024, forced displacement had surged globally to over 123 million — including refugees, internally displaced people, asylum seekers, and people in need of international protection — nearly double the figure from a decade ago.
Amid these crises, global public debt continues to rise, driven by ongoing shocks and the sluggish, uneven performance of the global economy. By the end of 2024, global public debt had climbed to $102 trillion, equivalent to 93pc of global GDP.
Although, developing countries accounted for only about one-third of this total, their debts have grown twice as fast as developed economies over the past decade. Latest figures show 58 developing countries facing severe debt distress, with debt-to-GDP ratios exceeding 60pc (the International Monetary Fund (IMF) benchmark for elevated debt stress in emerging markets), placing acute strain on already stretched public budgets. Around 3.3 billion people – over 40pc of the world’s population – live in countries that spend more on servicing debt interest than on education and health.
Systemic inequalities in the international financial architecture limit access to affordable finance, forcing developing countries to rely on expensive private sources. In 2023, 60pc of their external public debt was owed to private creditors, at borrowing rates that were two to four times higher than those for the US. This growing dependence on private creditors, combined with elevated global interest rates (since 2022) and low sovereign credit ratings complicates debt restructuring and refinancing, causing delays and driving up resolution costs. At their annual meeting in October last year, IMF warned that the global public debt is forecasted to rise above 100pc of global GDP by 2029, the highest level since 1948.
Importantly, these trends are unfolding under a pervasive shadow of geo-economic fragmentation. The post Cold War era ushered in an unprecedented period of hyper-globalisation in the 1990s and 2000s that plateaued – also described as ‘slowbalisation’ – following the global financial crisis in 2008. Along the way, there has been scepticism and uneven gains, and not everyone has benefitted. But global integration and international cooperation have been instrumental in nearly tripling of the world economy and for lifting roughly 1.5 billion people out of extreme poverty, as a result of trade deepening, increased capital flows, cross-border migration, and technological diffusion.
Keen observers are signalling a Cold War 2.0 between the US (the incumbent hegemon) and China (the ascendant challenger).
Both are consolidating their spheres of influence – the Western Hemisphere dominated by Washington, and Asia by Beijing – as political frictions and security concerns have increasingly disrupted the free flow of capital and goods, especially since 2018. It may be early to accurately estimate the costs of the ongoing fragmentation, but recent modelling efforts and anecdotal evidence suggest that these could be significant because the world today is much more integrated.
The global trade-to-GDP is 60pc – more than twice the Cold War level – and economies are more deeply interdependent in the global marketplace through complex value chains. A scenario of severe fragmentation and high-cost adjustment (i.e. where trade substitution is not easy) is forecasted to cost losses as high as 7pc of global GDP. A 2023 study by the Bank of International Settlements looked at data from 25,000 firms, and found that supply chains had lengthened in the last two years, particularly those that linked Chinese suppliers with US customers. Furthermore, lower-income and emerging market economies are expected to bear the most losses, particularly from diminishing technology spillovers. As always, when giants clash, the minnows suffer.
Where do we go from here?
Earlier this month, the White House ordered US withdrawal from 66 international organisations – including 31 UN entities – arguing that these advanced globalist agendas over US priorities. This is not entirely surprising – the US President Donald Trump had, after all, inquired from a hall full of heads of state and ambassadors at the General Assembly session celebrating 80 years of the UN last year, “What is the purpose of the UN?”

 

It’s a valid question. The UN, and other multilaterals established after WWII, were created precisely to avert the conditions that confront the world today. Hardly anyone denies the duplication, inefficiencies and bureaucracy in these organisations; it is something that they themselves are acutely aware of and have made attempts to address. But it’s a difficult question to answer because there is no recent counterfactual – we don’t know whether the modern and technologically advanced world that we live in today would have been better or worse in the absence of international organisations.
Yet, logic dictates a pinch of realism about the UN’s capacity to perform the responsibility entrusted to it, and expected of it. Its legitimacy and prestige are derived from the confidence it commands when member states respect and comply with its authority. It provides a platform for member states to voice their grievances, but can as easily become paralysed when Security Council members exercise their veto on nationalist grounds. When member states falter, so does the UN.
There are, however, four important points that continue to make the UN relevant.
One, it is the only global forum where every single country in the world is a member, making it the ultimate convening power, a role unlikely to be easily displaced in the foreseeable future. Even when negotiations occur in separate forums, they often return to the UN for endorsement. Paradoxically, President Trump’s 20-point ‘Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict’ that was developed entirely outside of the UN found its way to the Security Council for blessing just a few weeks after his General Assembly speech.
Two, in most of the UN bodies, each member state has one vote: Tuvalu with a population of roughly 11,000 has the same formal voting power as India, with nearly 1.5 billion people. Globally, more than half of UN member states have populations under 10 million, and it is precisely these countries that feel very strongly about the UN for showcasing their voice and giving them visibility. Critics argue that cumulatively these countries represent only a limited share of global power and contribute only marginally to the UN budget, proposing that this structure be replaced by weighted voting. Such proposals, however, have not been adopted, giving smaller players great influence in global decision-making.
Three, many of the world’s most effective international regulatory regimes – notably in postal services, maritime safety, civil aviation, telecommunications, public health – would not exist without the UN’s ability to institutionalise cooperation at the global scale. Proponents argue that this underscores the UN’s relevance even more so today, as the world grapples with a fractured international landscape amidst rapidly evolving technological advances.
Finally, the UN has been instrumental (to some extent) for the provision of global public goods (GPGs) that extend benefits across borders and generations, and which would otherwise not exist or be significantly under-provided if left to market forces and governments. Key GPGs include financial stability, international peace, scientific advancement, disease eradication, and climate mitigation and adaptation.
With multilateralism in trouble, what can the rest of the world do as we observe the US – the champion of international rules-based order – bowing out of the ring?
This is an extreme situation but not a singularly unique one where there’s a gap between global consensus and US participation. Several of the most widely ratified international treaties – including the Convention on the Right of the Child, Convention on the Law of the Seas, Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, International Criminal Court, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty – have not been ratified by the US.
Hence, precedents show that the rest of the world has moved forward where their values converge in the absence of the US. As recently as last year, despite the US pulling out of the fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) in June in Sevilla, Spain, UN member states came together and adopted Compromiso de Sevilla as the global framework to guide efforts to finance sustainable development over the coming decade.
Similarly, multilateralism has faced significant headwinds before and has evolved by adapting different forms of cooperation within, outside and alongside traditional international organisations.
The oft-repeated ‘coalition of the willing’ describes an approach of pragmatic cooperation between nations with shared interests when multilateral mechanisms stall. The phrase first appeared in a New York Times article in 1971 and was coined by Professor Lincoln P. Bloomfield at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Ironically, at that time, he was urging the US to use this approach to rally a group of nations willing to coordinate on peacekeeping, aid, and conflict stabilisation. The phrase later became politicised and (in)famous during the Iraq war in 2003 when it was (mis)used to substitute multilateral authorisation.
Critics argue that this mechanism is oftentimes invoked when policymakers want to take decisions outside of the multilateral system. The model, nonetheless, offers a viable solution for a group of nations to act voluntarily – and one hopes more virtuously – when universal consensus appears unlikely.

 

Around the same time in the 1970s, ‘plurilateralism’ emerged during the multi-year multilateral trade negotiations in Tokyo. The term was convenient because it could be placed somewhere (or anywhere) in the middle along the spectrum of bilateralism and multilateralism.
It proposed the formal coming together of fewer countries that wanted to do more to neutralise gridlock on global challenges and offer adaptable and efficient solutions. The focus of plurilateral agreements has mostly been on trade and international economic governance. In fact, the IMF First Managing Deputy Director, Gita Gopinath, speaking at the 20th World Congress of the International Economic Association in 2023, suggested adopting a plurilateral strategy as one of her three proposals to minimise fragmentation costs in order to tackle global problems and achieve national objectives at the same time.
Almost four decades later, Moisés Naím, the then Editor-in-Chief of Foreign Policy magazine introduced the term ‘minilateralism’ in 2009, which abandons the futile task (in his opinion) of trying to bring together all nations to an agreement. He proposed that we should instead concentrate on getting together the smallest denominator of countries needed to generate the greatest possible impact for a particular problem. This extremely effective ‘magic number’ would vary by issue: around 20 countries dominate global trade and climate change, 21 shape nuclear proliferation, 19 are most affected by AIDS-related deaths, and as few as a dozen are pivotal in addressing African poverty.
Furthermore, it does not have to remain exclusionary and membership could be expanded to those countries that agreed with the overall rules set by the original group.
Advocates of multilateralism are rightfully dismayed over these sub-optimal cooperation models, raising concerns that they would lead to further fragmentation and the sidelining of smaller nations. But these models are an attempt to navigate the politico-economic realities of a strongman and transactional world we find ourselves in today, coupled with new challenges – think artificial intelligence and green energy.
Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of The Economist writing at the end of last year, succinctly prophesised: “In global politics, 2025 was the year when an old order ended”. It remains to be seen to what extent this unravelling will unfold.
The human connection of multilateralism
When I interned at the UN Headquarters more than a decade ago, I was deeply aware of the gravity of walking the hallowed corridors of power and prestige that had witnessed countless leaders in the best of times and the worst of times but, regardless, every year since 1945.
During the General Assembly session, I encountered Mark Zuckerberg, (then) CEO of Facebook (now Meta), helped print U2’s lead singer Bono’s speech (because he did not bring his hardcopy), and stared at Jeffery Sachs, the special advisor to UN Secretaries-General, so intently that he felt compelled to introduce himself. I was also able to conclude that the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, had the most dapper security detail.
But the person who fascinated me the most during my time there was a reticent elevator operator named Thorin, who had a rather commanding presence that was further magnified by his cramped operating space.

 

One day, I finally summoned the courage to ask him a question that had been on my mind for a long time: whether he had been named after the dwarf king from JRR Tolkien’s The Hobbit — a book that rekindles cherished childhood memories of unfiltered imagination to this day (and had convinced me that dragons were real, as were hobbits, goblins and wizards).
I was shattered that he had no knowledge of the book and was christened thus simply because his mother liked the name. He did share, however, that his favourite leader was the US President Barrack Obama, whom he proudly told me he had twice had the honour of accompanying in the elevator.
These experiences, for me, humanised the lofty and abstract concept of multilateralism. Perhaps it is the comfort of the familiar, or the wariness of the unknown, that keeps us clinging on to the ideal of a multi-country collaboration in pursuit of global good (on average) that is representative and willingly embraced (to some extent), however unrealistic and wishful that might now seem.
I, for one, will be sorry to watch it fade into history.
But as the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Kearney eloquently reminded us during his speech a few days ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland: “Nostalgia is not a strategy”.
Are other world leaders paying attention?

Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan also lost their status, and the WHO urged countries to boost vaccination rates, particularly among under-protected populations, to prevent the viral disease from infecting more children.
Measles is entirely preventable by vaccination, but it is very contagious, and so it is among the first illnesses to rebound when vaccination rates decline. It commonly causes symptoms including high fever and a rash, but can also lead to serious long-term complications and even death.
Sign of declining vaccination
Health experts have warned that rising outbreaks worldwide point to a resurgence of other preventable illnesses in populations increasingly mistrustful or skeptical of vaccines since the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The UK’s change of status reflects a broader challenge we’re facing across the WHO European Region,” the UN health agency said on its website. Several other European countries already have regular measles transmission, according to the WHO, including France and Romania.

 

Canada lost its elimination status last year, and the US is working to retain its status as infections mount.
WHO committees in each region decide whether a country is measles-free using case rates. To be considered measles-free by the WHO, a country must have no locally transmitted cases of the same strain for 12 months or longer.
The decision to strip certain European countries of their status was made last September based on data from 2024. But the WHO only released the information on Monday after getting sign-off from every country involved.
To keep measles at bay, vaccination rates must exceed 95 per cent, the WHO estimates. Yet in the UK, only 84.4pc of children had the two doses needed for full protection in 2024. Government data showed 2,911 confirmed cases in England that year, the most since 2012.
On Monday, the UK Health Security Agency said all children should be vaccinated to protect themselves from measles. The UK was first given elimination status in 2016, before losing it in 2018 then regaining it in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-27 05:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647417-through-storms-and-sacrifice-ispr-song-pays-homage-to-soldiers-for-unparalleled-sense-of-duty' target='_blank'><strong>'Through storms and sacrifice': ISPR song pays homage to soldiers for unparalleled sense of duty</strong></a><br><p>

The question is: if India is allowed to pick and choose, why should Bangladesh not be allowed to do the same?—AFP/file

BANGLADESH’S removal from the ICC World T20 in India is the crisis that nobody wants to talk about.
Yes, you might find endless analysis on South Asian talk shows, but look internationally and it is a governance disaster that shall not be mentioned.
The question why the international media will not discuss this issue, and the question of why Bangladesh is out of the tournament, both have the same answer: India’s absolute power over world cricket.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) is meant to govern in the best interests of the global game. However, what was clear over two decades has crystallised over the last two years: the purpose of the ICC is exactly what critics claim — to borrow from Donald Trump’s vocabulary — to put India first.

Pakistan should participate in the World T20; but it should also support Bangladesh‘s cause, and continue to point out the hypocrisy in the treatment that it receives, versus what India gets

It is perfectly evident that there is one rule for India, and another for its opponents. This reality is enabled by the spineless apathy of the other so-called cricketing powers. The evidence is unquestionable and is unquestioningly ignored.
India has taken a political decision not to play bilateral tournaments against Pakistan. It has taken a political decision not to step foot on Pakistani soil. Cricketers from Pakistan and of Pakistani heritage face ridiculous processes to be allowed to participate in events in India.
It is allowed to do this for purely political reasons, and the ICC says nothing. But, when another nation, Bangladesh in this instance, takes a similar position towards playing in India it is dropped from the tournament.
The merits of Bangladesh’s argument are not even worth debating. Why do I say this? I say this because the merits of India’s arguments against Pakistan aren’t worth debating. They are purely political.
If India is allowed to pick and choose, why should Bangladesh not be allowed to do the same?
We all know the answer to this: Bangladesh is not responsible for the financial gravy train of international cricket, and it does not hold numerical sway at the ICC board. India first.
The second troubling aspect of this decision is the complete dismissal of the safety concerns of the Bangladesh team. The root of this row is the removal of Mustafizur Rahman from the IPL because of threats received promising disruption to matches that he would be involved in.
Now, if those safety concerns are credible enough to warrant his exit from an Indian tournament, then it doesn’t seem too unreasonable of Bangladesh to have concerns about playing matches in India. Yet the ICC says that there are no valid safety concerns.
Unfortunately, nothing that the ICC says can be taken seriously given the absolute control that India holds over the ICC’s operations. India would not wish for any team to refuse to play in India for security reasons — while India can withdraw or refuse to play in a country whenever it wishes.
Indeed, this hypocrisy is evident in international cricket for a number of years. Even during the years of Pakistan’s exile from international cricket, security threats in other countries, including India, didn’t matter to cricket’s governing body. One rule for India and one rule for everybody else. India first.

 

The question that then remains is one of Pakistan’s participation in the tournament. The answer I believe is a simple one. Pakistan should participate in the World T20 because it has already agreed to the terms of its participation — namely that it will play its matches in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, Pakistan should continue to support Bangladesh‘s cause within the ICC. Pakistan should continue to point out the hypocrisy in the treatment that it receives versus the treatment that India receives on the international stage. Pakistan should explain how the Bangladesh situation is another example of India first.
The shame here is that given the tumultuous decision that was taken, and given the significance of the governance crisis in the game, it is a matter that the world’s cricket nations seem eager to ignore.
Where are the game’s leading commentators? Where are the game’s great cricketers? Where are the people who believe in the spirit of cricket? Where are guardians of cricket’s moral galaxy when their voice is most needed? The answer is nowhere. Money talks. India first.
Assuming that the tournament does go ahead with Pakistan in it, we will inevitably see the ritual India Pakistan group contest. The fact that we cannot hold a world tournament without India and Pakistan playing a group match confirms the game’s abdication to the business suits.
When it comes to money spinning international tournaments, politics and principles are quickly put to one side. What really matters is open for the world to see. What really matters is the revenue that the ICC and the Indian cricket board can make from a match against Pakistan.
Today, the governance of international cricket is in the gutter. The game is being destroyed by greed and political motivations. But who has the guts to stand up to this? More importantly, who can put a stop to it? The answer is nobody. The strategy is always India first because by putting India first the other nations also put themselves first.
As the bully bullies on, the world is too timid to take on the bully. Sound familiar?

A frigid, life-threatening Arctic air mass could delay recovery as municipalities from New Mexico to Maine tried to dig out following the storm, which dropped a vicious cocktail of heavy snow and wind, along with freezing rain and sleet.







Forecasters warned that much of the northern half of the country will see temperatures that are “continuously below freezing through February 1,” and “record low temperatures tonight across the South are particularly dangerous in the wake of the weekend winter storm with many still without power,” the National Weather Service said in an X post.
While skies began clearing in parts the country, relentless snowfall in the northeast meant parts of Connecticut saw over 22 inches of snow, with more than 16 inches recorded in Boston, Massachusetts.
The storm was linked to at least 23 deaths, according to a compilation of state government and local media reports, with causes including hypothermia as well as accidents related to traffic, sledding, ATVs and snowplows.
One man was found in the snow, unresponsive, with a shovel in his hand.
In New York City, eight more people were found dead amid plummeting temperatures, and an investigation to determine the causes was underway. It was not known if all of these fatalities were storm-related.







Electricity began blinking back on across the south, but as of Monday evening, well over 550,000 customers remained without it, according to the tracking site Poweroutage.com.
Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana — southern states unaccustomed to intense winter weather — were especially impacted.
Approximately 190 million people in the United States were under some form of extreme cold alert, the National Weather Service (NWS) told AFP.
The Great Lakes region’s residents woke up to extreme temperatures that could cause frostbite on exposed skin within minutes. In parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the NWS reported early Monday morning temperatures as low as -23F (-30.6C), with windchills exacerbating the bite.
Over the weekend, nearly half of the states in the contiguous US received at least a foot of snow (30.5 cm), and in many cases, far more.
The NWS said New Mexico’s Bonito Lake accumulated the highest US total over the weekend with 31 inches (78.7 cm).
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell told journalists that trees were continuing to fall under the weight of encrusted ice across the Tennessee capital city — sometimes knocking out power that had already been restored.







Nashville and other municipalities across the country were establishing emergency warming shelters.
NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli told AFP this storm recovery was particularly arduous because so many states were impacted — meaning northern states with more winter supplies were unable to share their resources with less-prepared southern regions.
“A lot of those locations don’t have the means or the resources to clean up after these events,” she said.
“We’re particularly concerned about the folks in those areas that are without power right now.”
Polar vortex
At least 20 states and the capital Washington, were under states of emergency in order to deploy emergency personnel and resources.
The snowfall and biting icy pellets that pummeled cities left impassable roads along with canceled buses, trains and flights – thousands of departures and arrivals were scrapped over the weekend.
The storm system was the result of a stretched polar vortex, an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes morphs into a more oval shape, sending cold air pouring across North America.
Scientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions may be linked to climate change, though the debate is not settled and natural variability plays a role.
Dave Radell, a NWS meteorologist based in New York, told AFP that the character of this storm’s snow was “very dry” and “fluffy,” meaning the wind could lash it around with ease, impeding roadway-clearing efforts and visibility.
“That makes it even more challenging,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-27 05:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/270921343cba1e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969338/2-killed-10-injured-in-accident-on-islamabad-peshawar-motorway' target='_blank'><strong>2 killed, 10 injured in accident on Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway</strong></a><br><p>A multi-vehicle collision on the Islamabad- Peshawar Motorway (M-1) on Tuesday killed two people and injured 10 others, including three women, according to Swabi Rescue 1122 officials.
Swabi Rescue 1122 spokesperson Luqman, while speaking to Dawn, said that a trailer initially met with an accident on the motorway and blocked the road. As a result, multiple vehicles collided with each other.
One vehicle occupant was killed on the spot, while the other was pronounced dead by medical staff at a hospital. The vehicles involved in the pile-up were travelling to Peshawar from Islamabad.
Traffic on the M-1 was disrupted following the incident. Motorway police said its teams were at the incident site soon after the mishap and started initial rescue operations.
Rescue personnel shifted the injured to Bacha Khan Teaching Hospital and an emergency was declared at the medical facility.
The hospital’s spokesperson, Rahan Yousafzai, confirmed they received two bodies and 10 injured from the incident. He added that five of the injured are in critical condition.
“The hospital director put all emergency staff on high alert and the required facilities were provided to the injured,” added Rahan.
Traffic was later restored on the vital artery after the vehicle wrecks were removed by emergency personnel.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
Earlier this month, at least 24 people were killed and over 20 were injured in two separate accidents, as a truck fell into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district and a coach overturned near Balochistan’s Ormara tehsil.</p><small>2026-01-27 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/6978255d57e9d.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969309/be-at-the-table-or-on-the-menu' target='_blank'><strong>Be at the table, or on the menu</strong></a><br><p>CANADIAN Prime Minister Mark Carney finished two significantly ground-breaking visits to Beijing and Davos last week and they hold a message for nations and leaders feeling the heat from President Donald Trump’s insulting and arrogant behaviour with friend and foe alike.
And while Carney maintained his country’s relations with the US were multifaceted and far-reaching, he was pleased that his rare talks with President Xi Jinping had set up guardrails for greater predictability in bilateral relations and to keep each other’s interests in mind. He also clarified — perhaps to avoid needlessly poking Donald Trump in the eye — that there hadn’t been a free trade agreement with Beijing even if thousands of electric cars from China would be plying Canadian roads in the coming days. And if this riles the US, so be it.
Why is it so difficult for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, representing a no less major power, to speak up like Carney? Holding the BRICS presidency for 2026, Modi is required to host a summit of its increasingly powerful and influential leaders in New Delhi around August. However, when Modi does speak, he usually speaks about a municipal election his party would win or has won, if he is not otherwise threatening to replace this or that opposition government in the coming state polls.
The last time one heard him speak on a foreign policy issue from Indian soil was the threat he made (unusually) in English in Bihar about avenging the death of innocent tourists in a terror attack in Kashmir in April last year. It resulted in Operation Sindoor against Pakistan, which apparently served no purpose other than to reveal India’s shocking diplomatic isolation under Modi’s watch.
Going by the claims of Modi’s own preferred media, he is a great speaker, a charismatic one, in fact. So why does the prime minister of India get tongue-tied facing Trump, whose presidency he canvassed for in 2020, which for likelier other reasons Trump lost.
In Davos, Carney spoke even more boldly about souring ties with the US. He told the ruling elites that the 80-year-old world order under US stewardship had ruptured and that there was a need to rearrange equations. The betterment of humanity and protecting its only known hospitable planet was paramount.
“We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false, that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically, and we knew that international law applied with varied rigour, depending on the identity of the accused or the victim,” Carney’s message was blunt. “Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.”

Why does the prime minister of India get tongue-tied facing Donald Trump?

Carney’s address was backed by the German chancellor and was followed by what seems like a Europe-Canadian pact to shun Donald Trump’s self-promoted Board of Peace for Gaza. Its endorsement by leading Islamic states including Pakistan, Egypt and Turkiye makes it trickier to fathom the true intentions. Imagine the lot working with Benjamin Netanyahu who for his own reasons has enrolled himself aboard. It’s not easy to see how Israel and Pakistan could be in a team that too in the name of alleviating the suffering of Palestinian people! India would have plunged headlong for the plan, but the unstated fear of being seen in the company of Pakistan has perhaps put it in a spot.

 

Trump’s plan, in any case, is widely seen as a half-baked idea that postures to tend to the humanitarian pleas of the victims of Israeli genocide. It’s also hampered by an even greater worry that Trump may be seeing the body as a substitute for the UN itself.
It’s in this context that Carney’s call for a new game plan for the “middle powers” finds traction, a group to which India presumably belongs as the world’s fourth largest economy. The call was to collectively negotiate the jostling of Big Powers, which impacts everyone, including the Global South. Thus, Carney not only came close to the BRICS ideal of multipolarity, he surpassed it in his zeal to locate a world without nerve-wracking uncertainties or any more inbuilt inequalities with the US.
What did Carney say that melds with the agenda of a multipolar world, which should make India and other BRICS nations take notice? Like them, he spoke of the threat to multilateral institutions, namely the WTO, the UN, COP, the very architecture of collective problem-solving. “When the rules no longer protect you, you must protect yourself. But let’s be clear-eyed about where this leads. A world of fortresses will be poorer, more fragile and less sustainable.” In other words, individual deals with the bully are ill-advised.
“Hegemons cannot continually monetise their relationships. Allies will diversify to hedge against uncertainty. They’ll buy insurance, increase options in order to rebuild sovereignty that was once grounded in rules but will increasingly be anchored in the ability to withstand pressure. This room knows this is classic risk management… . … Collective investments in resilience are cheaper than everyone building their own fortresses. Shared standards reduce fragmentations. Complementarities are positive sum.” Carney could be reading from a Xi Jinping script for the coming BRICS summit.
Calling the middle powers in particular to act together, Carney cautioned: “If we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.” How could Donald Trump not pace himself in the frame? “China will eat you up,” was his angry response.
There are questions nevertheless that flow from a tartly pinpointed speech. Does Carney’s new order propose to regard Palestine, Venezuela, Congo et al as equally violated by the old order? And what would be the fate of Nato, the Five Eyes and other assorted dubious relics of the US-led West? They can’t logically remain intact, can they, in the event of a genuine rupture with the old order?

Much of it has been because of the criticism directed at him by those at the centre, in Islamabad and beyond. It turned him from an unknown face into an equal of sorts, thanks to the very people who targeted him. But, along with this, his own decisions to reach out to the people have also got him attention.
Since his ascension to the post of chief minister, he has travelled to Lahore and Karachi in a bid to mobilise people. And while he did not prove very successful in Lahore, in Karachi and Hyderabad he drew impressive crowds for someone whose name was barely known to people outside the party a few months ago. In Lahore, while the people were few, he still managed to create enough of a spectacle thanks to the antics of the government there. Before that, in Islamabad, he made surprise visits to markets to mingle with those out and about.

 

In some ways, his outreach to the people is striking in this environment in which few are making the effort to do politics. The parties in power are far too busy roaming in byzantine corridors, enjoying their plush surroundings, and few of those outside in the cold are relevant enough to matter. And while PTI continues to tread around, eternally confused, Afridi has ignored the noise around him and walked his own path.
For instance, soon after he became chief minister, he spent some time in Islamabad, meeting groups of journalists, from anchors to bureau chiefs to reporters. And while little of his interactions were reported on mainstream media, what he said dominated YouTube channels and casual conversations in the capital. His point of view and that of the KP government soon became familiar to hacks in Islamabad. It was quite an effective communication strategy.

For a young politician and a relatively unknown one, Afridi has a way with people.

This was then followed by the trips to other provincial capitals to kick-start what he and his colleagues call a ‘street movement’.
In some ways, his approach also contrasts with the approach of his predecessor, a more traditional politician, who too addressed jalsas and rallies till the Nov 26 event in Islamabad. However, for Ali Amin Gandapur, the rallies never appeared to be more than a sideshow as, from all accounts, he thought Imran Khan’s release would be a result of negotiations he was carrying out away from the limelight.
Afridi, on the other hand, is focusing on the people; it could be argued that he doesn’t have the contacts to try and carry out negotiations. Be that as it may, it is still obvious that for a young politician and a relatively unknown one, he has a way with people. The ability to go out in the crowds and get them enthused is something that hasn’t been practised by many outside of the few leaders right at the top. Other than party heads, most politicians tend to stick to their constituency and rarely look beyond.
But it also has to be said that Afridi can do this because of circumstances peculiar to the PTI.
The party’s main leader, Imran Khan, is behind bars. Few of its senior politicians are still around and free; and beyond them, there is no clear hierarchy within the party. In addition, the family is also not in a position to lead the party publicly, because of Khan’s own assertions that his relatives will not get involved in the PTI, even if they are now always followed. This means the chief minister of KP (the only province where the party is in power) becomes a first among equals. Gandapur also enjoyed this legitimacy and so does Afridi now.
And this gives him an edge. It allows him to lead interactions with the press and the public. Even though he is always surrounded by his young Turks while at a rally, or during an interaction in a room, he is the chief minister, and few forget this.
But, to repeat, all of this is possible because Khan is behind bars and incommunicado.
Consider the other parties, where no one other than the main family leadership has the space to dominate political space. When Nawaz Sharif was behind bars, it was his political heir and daughter who took to the streets, not Hamza Shehbaz, let alone others. And Shehbaz Sharif opted for the role that Gandapur tried to play; unlike the previous KP chief minister, Sharif proved to be successful, far more than anyone could have imagined.
Even now, if there is one person whose coverage on television overshadows the prime minister’s, it is Maryam Nawaz in Punjab. This is less so because of her official position and more because of her standing as Nawaz Sharif’s daughter.
Contrast this with the chief minister of Sindh, Murad Ali Shah, who has been around for much longer. But he rarely seeks the limelight or coverage, for he is aware that his position is safe as long as he stays in the shadows. He has to play second fiddle to the party leadership and he does. Recently, when the party held an event in Islamabad to highlight the governance record of the Sindh government, the entire presentation was given by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. The chief minister of the province simply spoke for a few minutes before giving way to BBZ.
Afridi, at the moment, doesn’t have to play second fiddle. And he is also proving that he has the potential to reach out to the people and be effective in communicating with them. But will he have the space to continue taking such a prominent position and role when Khan is out of jail? For in the past, most leaders who led parties while the main leader was in trouble, didn’t last for long, once the good times returned. Consider the fate of Javed Hashmi and Amin Fahim. Will Afridi end up like them? This will be the real test for Imran Khan and the PTI.

Hundreds of locals have left their homes as the state prepares to go after a hornet’s nest of terrorists believed to be active in the area. But neither the KP administration nor the centre is ready to take ownership for the evacuation and displacement.
The federal information minister says neither the centre nor the military ordered the evacuation as the counterterrorism operation can be conducted without displacing the people from the area. The KP chief minister’s aide on information, however, claims that the province was not taken on board where the launch of the operation is concerned. In the midst of all this bickering, the evacuation process has been halted due to inclement weather, with more rain and snow expected in the days ahead.
Instead of trading blame, the KP government and the centre should be cooperating to address the people’s plight. Locals cannot be left to fend for themselves in such severe weather, especially when they have been uprooted from their native areas.
The state must ensure they have access to warm shelter, adequate food and water, health facilities, etc, until they are able to return home. Those familiar with local dynamics say that the PTI-led KP government had indeed been taken on board regarding the evacuation and operation.
However, due to the PTI founder’s opposition to a military operation, the provincial administration finds itself in a bind on how to sell the issue to the party’s cadres, and the general public. That state action is required in the area is evident. Sources say that militants belonging to IS-K, the Gul Bahadur group and Lashkar-i-Islam as well as Jamaatul Ahrar are all present in Tirah. These elements threaten all of Khyber district and Peshawar. Hence, an operation appears to be essential.
But the state’s action must be thorough, so that the terrorists are not able to re-establish themselves later. The tribal residents are justifiably exhausted in this endless cycle of violence and displacement. Therefore, the affected areas need to be permanently cleared of terrorists, while the local people must be cared for until their areas are declared safe.

The 1.4-kilometre-long bridge, which is built over the Malir river and connects Korangi Industrial Area with the city’s East and South districts, has six lanes — three on each side — and nearly five million people are expected to use the bridge on a daily basis.
The chief minister, accompanied by Sindh Local Government (LG) Minister  Syed Nasir Shah, Labour Minister Saeed Ghani, Karachi Mayor Murtaza  Wahab, arrived at the Korangi causeway, where he was received by Special  Assistant Ali Rashid, Secretary LG Waseem Shamshad and others.
Speaking on the occasion, the CM said the project will greatly benefit the Korangi and Landhi industrial areas, daily commuters and nearby facilities, including Indus Hospital, educational institutions and residential communities. 

Built over Malir river, the project connects Korangi and Landhi industrial areas with Karachi’s East and South districts

“This area used to be cut off whenever it rained, effectively dividing the city into two parts. To address this difficulty, we committed nearly three years ago to building a bridge here,” he said.
He said the bridge is part of a broader initiative to rehabilitate Karachi’s deteriorating infrastructure.
He noted that some ancillary construction work was still ongoing, including efforts to connect Shahrah-i-Bhutto with Korangi Road. “We aim to open Shahrah-i-Bhutto by Eid or immediately after. Although there has been a delay, the road will be operational from Korangi Road to the M-9 after Eid,” he said.
Rehabilitation initiatives for Gul Plaza victims
The CM also unveiled comprehensive relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction initiatives for those affected by the recent Gul Plaza tragedy
Talking to the media at the inauguration ceremony, he said the tragic event had deeply saddened the entire province and reiterated that no amount could ever truly compensate for the loss of human life.
He reiterated that the Sindh government had announced compensation of Rs10m for each deceased person on the very first day, acknowledging that no amount could truly compensate for the loss of life.
He recalled that during his address on the floor of the Sindh Assembly, he had also announced financial assistance for shopkeepers affected by the incident. “Until the shopkeepers stand on their own feet again, the Sindh government will not leave them alone”, he said.
Mr Shah announced that each affected shopkeeper would receive Rs500,000 in immediate subsistence support to help them manage household expenses, including food, children’s school fees, and utility bills. 
He assured that the Sindh government would compensate shopkeepers for the goods and inventory destroyed in the fire, with KCCI’s assistance playing a key role in verification and disbursement.

Separately, a magistrate sent seven people to jail on judicial remand for keeping of dangerous animals in residential areas.

 

Last week, a pet lion attacked an eight-year-old boy in the Sabzazar area of Lahore, in which he lost one arm.
According to police, Wajid Ali went close to the lion’s cage while playing when it attacked him.

Seven sent to jail on judicial remand in pet lioness attack case

The lion chewed off the child’s arm owing to improper enclosure arrangements and negligence by the owner.
The owner also hid the incident and misled authorities, claiming the boy was injured after his arm got stuck in a machine.
Due to the severity of the injuries, doctors amputated the child’s arm to save his life.
In a similar incident, a pet lioness attacked an eight-year-old girl in the Bhekewal Pind area of Lahore and seriously injured her.
Police said the lioness was being shifted from one place to another by its owner in an auto-rickshaw when it became disturbed, broke free and attacked and injured the girl.
“Following such incidents, CM Maryam Nawaz on Monday decided to revoke the legal permission to keep pet lions across the province,” the Punjab government said in a statement. She also directed that Wajid be provided with a modern bionic arm.
Police said they arrested the accused and registered an FIR against him.
The government said it had seized 59 big cats from different parts of the province and arrested 10 suspects for violating the SOPs on housing the animals.
Judicial remand
The local judicial magistrate sent a breeder, Fayaz alias Faizi, along with six other suspects to jail on judicial remand in a case involving the keeping of dangerous animals in residential areas, following a lion attack on a minor girl.
Police informed the court that the suspects had been interrogated and their further physical custody was not required. The police requested the court to send the suspects to jail on judicial remand.
Magistrate Hassan Sarfraz Cheema accepted the request and remanded the suspects to judicial lock-up, directing the police to produce them again upon completion of the remand period.

The announcement put an end to a lengthy process to locate and return the last of the 251 prisoners taken by Hamas during their October 2023 attack on Israel.
Meanwhile, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the return of all those held prisoner “down to the very last”.
The latest set of prisoner handovers were part of the first phase of the US-backed ceasefire deal, which began on October 10 and aimed to stop the fighting in the Palestinian territory.

Hamas says return reflects the group’s commitment to ceasefire agreement

Gvili’s family had expressed strong opposition to launching the second phase of the plan before they had received his remains.
The Israeli military said in a statement that its representatives “informed the family of Ran Gvili… that their loved one has been identified and will be returned for burial”.
It added that all prisoners have been returned from the Gaza Strip to the State of Israel.
The gradual return of the prisoners over several stages had been a complicated and arduous process for both sides.
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said in a statement that “the discovery of the body of the last Israeli prisoner in Gaza confirms Hamas’s commitment to all the requirements of the ceasefire agreement on the Gaza Strip”.
Officials said on Sunday that Israeli forces were searching for Gvili’s remains in a cemetery in northern Gaza.
The announcement of the search came after visiting US envoys reportedly pushed Israeli officials to reopen Gaza’s Rafah crossing, a vital entry point for aid.
Israeli officials said on Monday that though they would open the crossing, only pedestrians would be allowed to travel through the crossing to Egypt.
Reopening Rafah, a vital entry point for aid into Gaza, forms part of the US-brokered truce.

LONDON: In a revealing interview with The Sunday Times, former UK Chancellor Sajid Javid reflected on his life journey from a childhood marked by poverty, domestic violence and racism to a career as a multimillionaire, cabinet minister, and home secretary. He also discussed his family’s complex past and integration in Britain and modern immigration policy.
Among the most striking revelations, British Pakistani Javid admitted that under the existing immigration rules, he “wouldn’t allow either his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry today”.
“The biggest block to good community cohesion is English. We should have set a requirement that if you want to settle in the UK, you should be able to speak fluent English. We should have done that ages ago,” he said.
Javid’s parents arrived from Pakistan in the early 1960s. His father, arriving with just £1, worked as a bus driver, mill worker and shop owner, while his mother who was uneducated and initially unable to speak English, struggled to adapt. The Colour of Home, Javid’s new memoir, details a childhood shaped by hardship and family tension.

In revealing Sunday Times interview, Sajid Javid says he ‘wouldn’t allow his unskilled father or his non-English speaking mother entry’ into UK under current rules

The memoir describes his father’s violence. Javid recounts being beaten with a leather slipper, a wooden spoon and on one occasion a hammer that required a CT scan. He writes about enduring racist attacks from skinheads and school bullies, as well as the emotional toll of growing up in cramped and impoverished living conditions.
“Crouching in a ball and covering his face while his father beat him,” Javid recalls, highlights the intensity of these early struggles.
Family tensions extended to marriage expectations. His mother initially objected to his white Christian wife Laura refusing to meet her for two years, and had even tried to arrange a marriage with his cousin. His mother also “didn’t want two black workmen her husband employed to come for dinner” though she later learnt English and “came to deeply regret her racism towards the black workmen”.
Later in life, his father apologised to Javid for his past violence.
Despite these hardships, the family’s story is one of resilience. Javid fulfilled his childhood goal of buying his parents a house in Bristol, writing that one of his proudest moments was achieving “enough to give myself and my family a better life”.
He told the interviewer that a “Reform voter… might think this is exactly the kind of family that we want in the UK because they went on a journey and look where they’ve ended”.
In politics, Javid was known for his positions on immigration. He supported a post-Brexit points-based system but argued that the UK “lets in too many immigrants” and stressed that language skills are essential for community cohesion.

Last week, President Donald Trump said a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely after a crackdown on protesters.
The foreign ministry said in a statement it “has reaffirmed the United Arab Emirates’ commitment to not allowing its airspace, territory or waters to be used in any hostile military actions against Iran”.
The UAE hosts thousands of US personnel at Al Dhafra airbase near the capital Abu Dhabi, one of several American military bases in the Gulf.

US aircraft carrier arrives in Middle East
The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has arrived in the Middle East, the US military said on Monday, dramatically boosting American firepower in the region at a time of heightened tensions with Iran.
The Lincoln and accompanying ships are “currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability”, US Central Command said in a post on X.







Hezbollah chief’s warning
Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem warned on Monday that any war against the group’s backer Tehran this time will ignite the region as it will also target the group.
“Faced with aggression that does not distinguish between us… we are targeted by any potential aggression and determined to defend ourselves,” he said in a televised address to supporters at a solidarity rally for Iran. “We will choose at that time how to act… but we are not neutral,” he said, warning that “a war on Iran this time will ignite the region”.
Rubio’s warning to Iraq
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Iraq on Sunday against a pro-Iranian government as the expected return of Nouri al-Maliki as prime minister stirs Washington’s concern.
Maliki, who left power in 2014 following heated pressure from the United States, has been chosen by Iraq’s largest Shia bloc, which would put him in line to be nominated prime minister.
Rubio, in a telephone call with incumbent Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, voiced hope the next government will work to make Iraq “a force for stability, prosperity and security in the Middle East”.
“The secretary emphasised that a government controlled by Iran cannot successfully put Iraq’s own interests first, keep Iraq out of regional conflicts or advance the mutually beneficial partnership between the United States and Iraq,” Rubio said, according to State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott.
An Iraqi political source said the US had conveyed that it “holds a negative view of previous governments led by former prime minister Maliki”.
In a letter, US representatives said that while the selection of the prime minister is an Iraqi decision, “the United States will make its own sovereign decisions regarding the next government in line with American interests”.
The US wields key leverage over Iraq as the country’s oil export revenue is largely held at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York, in an arrangement reached after the 2003 US invasion toppled military dictator Saddam Hussein. Iraq’s parliament meets Tuesday to elect a new president, who holds a ceremonial role but will appoint a prime minister.
A US-based rights group claimed on Monday it had “confirmed” reports of deaths of 5,848 people in a wave of protests in Iran suppressed by security forces.

MINNEAPOLIS: In a bid to regain control over an escalating crisis sparked by the second killing of a protester against his administration’s militarised immigration raids, US President Donald Trump dispatched his top border official to Minnesota on Monday.
Trump said that Tom Homan, his point man for border security, would arrive in the state later and “will report directly to me”.
As Minneapolis has become ground zero in the clash between Trump and growing numbers of Americans over his nationwide immigration crackdown, Trump’s deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, described the city on Fox News as a ‘powder keg’.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been transformed under Trump into the United States’ most heavily funded law enforcement body.
But polls show growing anger over its frequently brutal tactics.
A huge rally took place despite bitter cold in Minneapolis on Friday to protest the raids and the point blank shooting by an ICE agent of protester Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three on Jan 7. Then on Saturday, immigration agents gunned down Alex Jeffrey Pretti, also 37, after having already tackled him to the ground.
Like Good, the intensive care unit nurse was a US citizen.
More rallies erupted after his death in Minneapolis, New York and other major cities across the United States.
Minnesota’s sovereignty
On Monday, a federal judge in Minnea­polis was hearing arguments on whether the deployment of federal officers — often masked, heavily armed and unidentified — violates the state of Minnesota’s sovereignty.
The judge would consider a request to temporarily stop Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota, following the fatal shooting of a second US citizen over the weekend that sparked a fierce backlash.
The state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul are asking the court to pause the 3,000-agent operation, calling it a “completely disproportionate” violation of state sovereignty. The Trump administration, in a court filing, called the request an “absurdity” that would make federal law an afterthought.
In Congress, Democrats are threatening to hold up funding for the US government unless immigration enforcement agencies are reformed.
Trump has so far dismissed concerns. The 79-year-old Republican’s first reaction to Pretti’s killing was to suggest that the nurse had come intending to shoot at the police.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison then accused Trump of pushing a “flat-out insane” narrative.
In Monday’s court action, the judge was hearing arguments from state and city lawyers that the federal deployments amount to an occupying force.
Also under consideration was a bid to force federal officials to preserve evidence related to Pretti’s killing.
The lawsuits highlight the deep rift between local and federal law enforcement over the deployment, dubbed “Operation Metro Surge”. Trump’s immigration raids have focused deliberately on Democratic-run cities, pitting mayors and governors against the president.
Local police have repeatedly confronted federal agents and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has even suggested he could call out the state’s National Guard to push back against Trump’s forces.
Trump will also be watching signs of growing disenchantment from his Republican Party in Congress. The party is usually in lockstep with Trump but it has only a slender majority.
One of the most prominent cautions came from House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer, who signalled on Sunday that federal agents should withdraw from Minneapolis — an intervention that would normally be unheard of from a figure considered one of Trump’s staunchest loyalists.
Sixty of the state’s largest businesses, including Target, 3M, UnitedHealth and US Bancorp, have called for an immediate de-escalation of tensions between the state and the Trump administration.
Trump claimed that the immigration agents would leave Minneapolis “at some point”.

The SBP’s cautious approach is baffling, given the ground realities – with core inflation stabilised at around 5 per cent over the past many months and major economic indicators pointing to the need for growth. However, the status quo in interest rates at 10.5pc will continue to hamper the industry’s access to finance, local businessmen said.
In contrast, Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry Secretary General M. Abdul Aleem told Dawn that the State Bank’s decision to retain the interest rate without a prudent reduction may have surprised many who were looking for a minor cut.
However, these are decisions made on economic fundamentals, not on the wishes of some key stakeholders, he said, adding that the economy is doing reasonably well. Still, some challenges and opportunities may have led to no change in the decision. “We support the State Bank’s decision,” Aleem concluded.

Leaders criticise central bank for ignoring calls for a single-digit rate to revive economy

Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Atif Ikram Sheikh stated that the business community had categorically demanded a substantive reduction of 350 basis points to bring the policy rate down to 7pc to kickstart the economy immediately, as the industry is currently battling an existential crisis due to exorbitant energy tariffs and high borrowing costs.
Holding the interest rate would not help move the needle on the cost of doing business, he said, reiterating that the high cost of capital is the primary driver of industrial closures and the inability of Pakistani exporters to compete globally.”
If the monetary policy is not aggressively corrected in the following review to reach single digits, the target for export growth and industrial expansion for the fiscal year will remain elusive,” Atif warned.
FPCCI Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon said the real interest rate in Pakistan remains unsustainably high compared to regional competitors. Keeping the policy rate at double-digit levels is unjustified given that inflation has receded.
This State Bank’s decision would continue to penalise the private sector, restricting access to finance for SMEs and hampering export competitiveness. The SBP has missed a crucial opportunity to align monetary policy with the government’s vision for industrial growth and export facilitation, he added.
President of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI), Muhammad Ikram Rajput, said in view of the inflation rate and declining exports, there was sufficient room for at least a one-percentage-point reduction in the policy rate. Still, the central bank opted for an overly cautious approach.
The decision, he said, appeared to align more with expectations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) than domestic economic realities, he said, questioning the State Bank’s projected economic growth forecast of 3.75-4.75pc, terming it inconsistent with ground realities.
Mr Rajput stressed that sustainable economic growth is not possible without promoting industrialisation. A persistent increase in imports coupled with a decline in exports has put the survival of industries at risk.
President of the SITE Association of Industry (SAI), Ahmed Azeem Alvi, said the State Bank Governor himself has acknowledged that exports have declined while imports have risen. This clearly shows that keeping interest rates high has stalled economic progress.
He argued that this was the right time to take a chance and reduce the policy rate by at least one to 150bps.
Timely decisions could benefit businesses, boost exports, and support overall economic growth. Expressing regret, Mr Alvi noted that Pakistan had failed to learn from regional countries and had not capitalised on opportunities presented by global exhibitions.
Pakistan Chemical and Dyes Mer­­chants Association Chair­man Salim Valimuhammad said commercial importers warned that the move would further strain businesses and delay economic recovery.
“The policy rate should ideally be brought down to 8-9pc,” he said.

President Asif Ali Zardari and First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari meet UAE Minister of Justice Abdullah bin Sultan bin Awad Al Nuaimi.—White Star

ISLAMABAD: Pre­si­dent Asif Ali Zardari on Monday gave assent to the seven bills passed by parliament, including some controversial bills, turning them into laws, before leaving for the United Arab Emirates on an official tour.
Last month, the president had returned the bills unsigned when they were passed by the Senate and the National Assembly.
According to the Presidency, the approved legislation includes The National Tariff Comm­ission (Amendment) Bill, 2026; the Export Deve­lopment Fund (Amen­dment) Bill, 2026; the Transfer of Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2026; the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Prot­ection) Bill, 2026; the Daanish Schools Aut­hority Bill, 2026; the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2026; and the National Commission for Human Rights (Amen­dment) Bill, 2026.
A joint sitting of parliament, which was summoned last week after the bills were returned uns­igned, passed the three bills including Daanish Schools Authority Bill, 2026, Domestic Violence Bill, 2026, and the Human Rights (Amendment) Bill, 2026.
Although the domestic violence bill was introduced by a lawmaker from his own party MNA Sharmila Faruqui, the president refused to sign it in December apparently considering the objections raised by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F). Similarly, the human rights bill was also opposed by the JUI-F.
About the Daanish schools bill, the PPP was of the opinion that education was a provincial subject and the centre should not lay a network of Daanish schools across the country.
The PML-N addressed the PPP concern before tabling the bill in the joint session.
After signing the seven bills, President Zardari, accompanied by a high-level delegation, left for the UAE on an official visit from Jan 26 to Jan 29.
During the visit, the president would hold high-level meetings with the UAE’s leadership to review the full spectrum of bilateral ties, especially in the domains of trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties.
The discussions would also focus on regional and international issues of mutual interest, the Foreign Office spokesperson said.
“The visit of the President, subsequent to the recent visit of the President of the UAE to Pakistan, reflects the deep brotherly ties between the two nations and reaffirms commitment to transforming the strong friendship between Pakistan and the UAE into a mutually rewarding partnership,” he added.

ISLAMABAD / RAWALPINDI: Opposition parties have chalked out plans for Feb 8 to protest against the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections, with Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) hinting that it may announce a Jail Bharo Tehreek (court arrest movement) and urging people to keep their shutters closed, while the JUI-F has decided to stage a public gathering in Rawalpindi.
TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday said that the call for a countrywide protest on Feb 8 — the second anniversary of the 2024 general polls —would not be withdrawn under any circumstances. He urged the masses to shut down everything on that day, which falls on a Sunday.
Suggesting that the alliance might announce a Jail Bharo Tehreek, he said it would be just the beginning and that more moves would follow.
Mr Achakzai was chairing a meeting of the TTAP, attended by alliance’s vice chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, former Sindh governor Zubair Umar, Asad Qaiser, Dr Ammar Ali Jan, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai and Advocate Khalid Chaudhry.

 

The participants decided that Feb 8 would be observed as a Black Day and that a nationwide strike would be ensured.
Ten committees formed
They said 10 committees had been formed at international, national and provincial levels to ensure the success of the strike.
They termed Feb 8 a day of humiliation for the entire nation, saying people had been deprived of their basic right to elect representatives and rendered powerless.
The meeting also expressed concern over the sentences awarded to rights activist, Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, terming them a violation of constitutional rights to freedom of expression and a fair trial.
The participants warned of a looming humanitarian crisis in Khyber Agency’s Tirah valley, saying millions could be forced to migrate in harsh weather.

 

They said any deviation from resolutions passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and decisions of the national jirga would be against provincial autonomy.
They further criticised the government’s decision to join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking parliament and the public into confidence, questioning Pakistan’s participation when Palestinians were excluded from the forum.
Later, a TTAP delegation led by Mr Achakzai visited the residence of former PTI leader Dr Shireen Mazari to express solidarity with her over the arrest and conviction of her daughter and son-in-law, Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha.







JUI-F rally
Meanwhile, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has announced that his party would stage a rally in Rawalpindi on Feb 8 to protest against the alleged rigging in the last general elections.
According to JUI-F Rawalpindi district spokesperson Hafiz Ziaullah, the party chief will address the public gathering.
The party spokesperson said the Feb 8 elections were “tantamount to the killing of the public mandate” and an “insult” to the nation’s vote, and “would not be accepted under any circumstances”.
He said the government formed as a result of the 2024 polls would be “rejected through public power”, and the struggle would continue to protect the original principles of democracy.
According to the spokesperson, preparations for the rally have been formally started, and instructions have been issued to all tehsils, workers and officials of the Rawalpindi district to ensure full participation.
“A large number of people, workers and people belonging to different schools of thought will participate in the rally,” he said.
The JUI-F Rawalpindi chapter initially appealed to the public to reach Dera Taji Khokhar on Feb 8 to raise their voices against the “fake” elections and the “illegitimate” government, and to stand with the JUI-F for the restoration of democracy.
The spokesperson said under the initial plan, the public gathering would be held at Dera Taji Khokhar near the old airport, but the venue was likely to change.
Responding to a question about seeking permission from the district administration, he said a meeting of the JUI-F general council would be held on Jan 31, after which the venue would be decided and an application submitted to the district administration by Feb 1.
Hafiz Ziaullah said preparations had already begun and all office-bearers had been informed about the decision to launch a protest against the “rigged” 2024 general elections.
He added that tehsil chapters had been asked to form committees for public mobilisation, and the general council would task these committees with bringing the maximum number of people to the meeting.
Meanwhile, the district administration has imposed Section 144 in the district since December and extending it on a weekly basis. Under Section 144, public gatherings are not permitted. The current one has been imposed from Jan 23 till Feb 6.
A senior district administration official told Dawn that if an application was received from any party, it would be forwarded to the Punjab government after a report from the District Intelligence Committee.

At the close of last fiscal year on June 30, 2025, the circular debt had been reported at Rs1.614tr, scaled down by Rs780bn through capital injections and around Rs1.225tr commercial borrowing purportedly at cheaper markup rates. It had gone up by Rs79bn in the first quarter ending September 30, 2025, to Rs1.693tr.
Official data compiled by the power division suggested a relatively improved performance in the second quarter (October-December 2025) as circular debt inched down by Rs4bn to Rs1.689tr, chiefly because of stock payments worth Rs224bn. This is on top of Rs801bn stock payments of circular debt during FY25.
Otherwise, performance indicators showed a mixed trend, with system inefficiencies increasing by Rs101bn over six months and non-payments from K-Electric rising to Rs115bn. As a consequence, the total circular debt stock dropped to Rs1.689tr by December 31, compared with Rs2.384tr in the same period last year, following a capital injection of Rs780bn. The decline was partly reversed, with almost Rs85bn added to Rs695bn.
The data showed that payables to power producers, which stood at Rs861bn at the close of FY25, increased again to Rs903bn in the following six months. Circular debt financing in the first half of the current year amounted to Rs694bn.
The containment of circular debt was also contributed to by a Rs42bn decrease in budgeted but unreleased subsidies, while interest charges dropped to Rs10bn when compared to Rs56bn of the comparable period last year on account of power holding company debts and IPPs’ dues.
Prior year adjustments from consumers were reduced by Rs140bn in the first half of FY2024 but increased by Rs95bn in the first half of FY25. The non-payments from K-Electric, which had amounted to Rs12 in the first half of FY24, increased to Rs115bn this year, as the power division reported total receivables from the Karachi-based utility to Rs329bn as of December 31, 2025, including a principal amount of Rs136bn and a Rs193bn markup.
It may be noted that FY26 began with Rs1.614tr, compared with Rs2.467tr in the same period a year earlier. The payables to power producers had increased to Rs944bn at the close of September, which were curtailed to Rs903bn in the following quarter.
The circular debt had increased by Rs224bn at the close of the first five months (July-November 2025), but was brought down in December through a stock payment of Rs224bn. A power division spokesperson said the debt stock at the close of June 2025 should not be compared with its stock at the end of November 2025.
He said the commercial borrowing from banks worth Rs1.225tr was primarily meant for PHPL’s expensive debt replacement with a much cheaper loan, and that too with a five- to six-year plan to repay the loan itself through a debt servicing surcharge.
The spokesperson explained that the increase during the July-November period was primarily attributable to seasonal factors that influence monthly circular debt movements and were typically reversed by the end of the fiscal year on half-yearly payments. As such, circular debt flow declined in December 25, “resulting in a net circular debt flow of less than Rs80bn for the period from July-December25”.
He said the circular debt declined significantly during FY25 to Rs1.614tr through improvements in Discos’ operational efficiencies, strengthening of macroeconomic variables, and the waiver of late payment interest following successful negotiations with power producers.
“It is expected that by the close of the current fiscal year, the Circular Debt position will be fully contained, with no net addition to the overall stock. This expectation is consistent with historical trends, wherein seasonal fluctuations typically normalise in the latter part of the fiscal year”, the spokesperson said.
He said the seasonal variations in circular debt flow had no implications for consumer-end electricity tariffs and claimed that Disco’s inefficiencies in FY25 were reduced by Rs193bn when compared to FY24.
The power division also said that the Rs1.225 trillion circular debt settlement plan was to be implemented over a six-year period, during which the existing circular debt stock would be refinanced on favourable terms. To date, the first tranche of the settlement has been received.

Railway officials in Sultankot confirmed that the blast occurred on the railway track between Sultankot and Jacobabad in Sindh.
“Four bogies have derailed after a blast that damaged the track,” a senior official of the Pakistan Railway told Dawn, adding no deaths or injuries were reported in the blast.
The railway officials added that repair on the track had begun after the area was cleared. They said a relief train had also reached the site to resume railway traffic on the main line.

 

The Jaffar Express has come under attack several times over the past year. Last November, it had escaped an ar­­m­­ed attack in the Bolan Pass area of Kachhi distr­i­­ct, Balochistan. The same month it also escaped a bomb attack in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district.
In October 2025, at least seven people were injured after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of the Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district. The same month, it escaped another rocket attack in the Notal area of Nasir­abad district.
In September 2025, twelve people, including women and chil­dren, were injured wh­en the Quetta-bound Jaf­far Express was targeted in a bomb blast in the Spizend area of Mas­tung

According to a handout from the Presidency, the president was received by UAE Justice Minister Abdullah bin Sultan bin Awad Al Nuaimi at Zayed International Airport in Abu Dhabi.
It said that First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi were accompanying the president on the trip, adding that Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE Shafqat Ali Khan was also present on the occasion.







Shortly after arriving, he held a meeting with the UAE justice minister at the presidential flight terminal at the airport.







A statement released by the Foreign Office earlier in the day said that the president, accompanied by a high-level delegation, will undertake the visit from January 26 to 29.
“During the visit, the president will hold high-level meetings with the UAE’s leadership to review the full spectrum of bilateral ties, especially on the domains of trade and economic people-to-people ties,” the statement said.







The discussion will also focus on regional and international issues of mutual interest, the FO added.
It highlighted that Zardari’s trip, which follows the brief visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Pakistan last month, “reflects the deep brotherly ties between the two nations and reaffirms commitment to transforming the strong friendship between Pakistan and the UAE into a mutually rewarding partnership”.
During the UAE president’s first official visit to Pakistan on December 26, the leadership of the two countries had held “substantive talks” focused on further strengthening the longstanding bilateral relations.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Al Nahyan also met in Rahim Yar Khan on December 30, where they both discussed ways to enhance cooperation in a wide range of sectors.
On January 13, the two countries agreed to sign a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals visiting the Gulf country.</p><small>2026-01-26 18:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2622571434034e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969198/us-deploys-aircraft-carrier-to-middle-eastern-waters-as-iran-warns-against-attack' target='_blank'><strong>US deploys aircraft carrier to Middle Eastern waters as Iran warns against attack</strong></a><br><p>A US naval strike group led by an aircraft carrier has deployed to Middle Eastern waters, the United States said on Monday, as Tehran warned it was ready to hit back at any American attack launched in response to a crackdown on anti-government protests.
The protests started in late December, driven by economic grievances, but turned into a mass movement against the Islamic Republic, with huge street demonstrations for several days from January 8.
But rights groups have accused authorities of quelling the movement with unprecedented violence, shooting into crowds of protesters under the cover of an internet shutdown that has now lasted 18 days — the longest Iran has ever imposed.
US President Donald Trump has previously threatened to step in, saying last week that Washington was sending a “massive fleet” to the region “just in case”.
The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group dramatically boosts American firepower in the region.
The United States backed and briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against Iran in June, and while Trump last week appeared to step back from his threats of new military intervention, he has never ruled the option out.
The Lincoln’s strike group has arrived in the region, US Central Command said in a post on X, adding the ships were “currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability”.







‘Regret-inducing response’
Iran’s foreign ministry warned on Monday of a “comprehensive and regret-inducing response to any aggression”.
Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said Iran was “confident in its own capabilities”.
In apparent reference to the Lincoln, he added: “The arrival of such a battleship is not going to affect Iran’s determination and seriousness to defend the Iranian nation.”
Meanwhile, a new anti-US billboard has appeared in the central Enghelab Square in Tehran that appears to show an American aircraft carrier being destroyed.
“If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind,” its English-language caption reads.
State news agency IRNA quoted the commander of the Iranian navy Shahram Irani, as saying on Monday: “Iran’s naval power is not merely defensive but also acts as an anchor of stability in the region.”
In Lebanon, Hezbollah organised a rally in support of the Islamic Republic featuring an address by its leader, Naim Qassem, who warned, “a war on Iran this time will ignite the region”.
Iran’s Gulf neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, which hosts a US airbase, said it would not allow attacks on Iran to be launched from its territory.</p><small>2026-01-26 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647359-in-letter-to-pm-cm-afridi-warns-delay-in-funds-pushing-kp-into-fiscal-governance-crises' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to PM, CM Afridi warns delay in funds pushing KP into ‘fiscal, governance crises'</strong></a><br><p>

In the notification seen by Dawn, the Punjab Home Department notified the imposition of Section 144 prohibiting the purchase and use of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party in an effort to “avoid any discrimination or disruption of public order”.
The department said that it had been reported that to disrupt the festival, miscreants may use images of holy scripture, religious places and flags of countries and political parties.
“Only plain, uni-coloured or multi-coloured kites (i.e. gudda or patang) shall be allowed during kite flying in the district of Lahore from February 6 to 8,” the department said.
It asserted that the government had permitted kite flying solely for “recreation and festivity”, while banning “the manufacturing, trade, transport, storage, sale, purchase” of kites bearing pictures, flags and places for 30 days from Monday onwards.
Basant is making a comeback after 18 years, with the festival set to be celebrated in Lahore from February 6 to 8. The festival will coincide with a nationwide protest announced by the opposition on Feb 8.
Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025, the Punjab government has prohibited flying kites with metallic wire, nylon cord or strings coated with glass or other sharp materials, along with the manufacturing, transport, storage and sale of kites and hazardous strings.
The violators could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5 million.
On Friday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had finalised all preparations for the three-day Basant festival, urging people to celebrate it in a safe manner.
Announcing strict safety measures, the chief minister said a comprehensive Basant safety plan had been finalised to prevent accidents associated with kite flying.
“Lahore has been divided into Red, Yellow and Green zones, and only cotton kite string made of nine threads will be allowed. Nylon and metallic strings are strictly banned, with violators facing up to five-year jail terms and fines up to Rs5 million,” she said and added that illegal kite flying, other than the notified dates, would invite imprisonment and fines, while parents and guardians would be held responsible for underage or illegal kite flying.</p><small>2026-01-26 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/262055101dd7800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969192/kp-cm-pens-letter-to-pm-shehbaz-over-centres-persistent-failure-to-release-constitutionally-guaranteed-funds' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM pens letter to PM Shehbaz over Centre’s ‘persistent failure to release constitutionally guaranteed’ funds</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over what he dubbed the Centre’s “persistent failure” to release “constitutionally guaranteed” funds, demanding the “full and unconditional” release of all outstanding federal dues.
Since becoming the provincial chief executive in October last year, Afridi has repeatedly accused the federal government of stalling the release of funds allocated for KP, particularly those committed for the merged districts under the National Finance Commission (NFC).
In a fresh call for the release of funds, the KP CM said: “I am compelled to place on record the deep and mounting concern of the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regarding the persistent failure to release constitutionally guaranteed federal transfers.”
This failure, he added, “has now translated into an acute fiscal and governance crisis for the province”.







Afridi underscored that KP’s budget for fiscal year 2025-26 was framed and approved “strictly on the basis of clear constitutional entitlements”, including net hydel profit, oil and gas royalties, post-merger NFC shares, and regular monthly releases under the NFC.
“These were not discretionary assumptions but binding fiscal obligations,” he emphasised, adding that “contrary to these commitments, actual releases have consistently fallen short of budgeted levels”.
Moreover, “of even greater concern is the withholding of routine monthly NFC transfers, a practice that finds no sanction in the Constitution and strikes at the core of cooperative federalism”, he said.
The KP CM maintained that his province was entitled to receive Rs658.4 billion under the NFC, but it had received just Rs604bn so far, leading to a shortfall of Rs54.4bn.
“This is not an accounting variance; it represents a material breach that has directly impaired cash management, disrupted budget execution, and constrained service delivery across critical sectors of governance,” he asserted.
He added, “The impact is most stark in the merged districts, where development, stabilisation, and state consolidation are acknowledged national priorities. Despite a provincial allocation of Rs292bn, federal releases amount to only Rs56bn thus far.
“This severe and continuing gap has undermined the provision of essential public services and development interventions in these historically marginalised areas, eroding the objectives of the merger and weakening national cohesion.”
The KP CM also highlighted that these fiscal constraints were unfolding at a time when the province remained on the frontline of counter-terrorism, while simultaneously shouldering extraordinary and unavoidable expenditures arising from flood response and rehabilitation, as well as the management and support of temporarily displaced persons.
“These are national responsibilities; however, the financial burden continues to be borne disproportionately and unsustainably by the province,” he said.
In view of the above, he said, the KP government expected “immediate corrective action by the federal government, including the full and unconditional release of all outstanding federal dues, particularly routine monthly NFC transfers, net hydel profit, oil and gas royalties, and allocations for the merged districts, strictly in accordance with constitutional provisions and agreed fiscal arrangements”.
“Any further delay will only compound the province’s fiscal stress and weaken governance capacity at a critical juncture,” he warned, telling the premier that given the seriousness of the matter, it warranted his “urgent and personal attention”.</p><small>2026-01-26 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647322-pakistan-launches-shikra-system-for-real-time-passport-tracking' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan launches 'Shikra' system for real-time passport tracking</strong></a><br><p>
