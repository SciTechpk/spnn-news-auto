The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Today, petitioner Muhammad Akram Sheikh, one of the founding leaders of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and its former president, began his arguments in the case.
 


Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi have presented their arguments.
They have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
 
 

In recent hearings, Justice Ayesha has noted that there seemed to be no absolute bar on the CB from issuing any judicial order requiring the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to nominate members to the bench under Arti­cle 191A — the new provision added under the 26th Amendment to create the CB.
Justice Mandokhail has wondered whether judges comprising the current CB could hear petitions against the 26th Amendment if they were its “beneficiaries”.
The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Mandokhail asked Sheikh whether he was also appearing on behalf of other petitioners in the case, to which the senior advocate replied that he was only representing himself.
Justice Mandokhail noted that Sardar Latif Khosa was stated as Sheikh’s counsel, at which the lawyer sought the judges’ permission to present his arguments, saying he had the right to do so.
Justice Aminuddin then asked Sheikh to apprise the bench of a “constitutional path to form a full court”.
“We are bound by our oath. So far, not a single lawyer has presented their arguments as per the Constitution. One sahib also said to keep the Constitution aside,” the judge remarked.
Upon Justice Aminuddin asking Sheikh what a full court meant according to him, the latter termed the question a “futile debate”.
Then, as opposed to the other requests made so far for a “pre-Amendment” full court, Sheikh sought a full court comprising “all 24” of the present SC judges.
“This Constitutional Bench cannot hear this case,” he asserted, at which Justice Aminuddin noted that the question was how to include a “non-Constitutional Bench judge” in the CB.
Justice Mandokhail then asked, “Are you saying that even if there are 24 judges, it should not be called a Constitutional Bench but the Supreme Court?”
Calling the 26th Amendment “controversial”, Sheikh said, “Not even any of the dictators dented the Constitution as much as the 26th Amendment did.”
The lawyer contended that the CB judges had two roles at the moment, out of which one was “controversial”. “I hope that God gives you the courage to strike down this Amendment,” he said.
Sheikh argued that the current eight-member CB was not eligible to strike down the 26th Amendment as it was constituted under the same legislation.
He added that it was a set principle that a smaller bench could not reverse the ruling of a larger bench.
Here, Justice Mazhar remarked, “The matter is new now. The Constitutional Bench has been formed. Give arguments based on the new circumstances.
“You say that this Constitutional Bench cannot strike down the 26th Amendment as it would be a conflict of interest. On the other hand, you say that a full court comprising all 24 judges should be formed. Will that full court of all 24 judges not have a conflict of interest?” Justice Mazhar asked.
In February, six judges were elevated to the SC — namely Justices Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, Salahuddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq, and Ishtiaq Ibrahim.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail also wondered whether having all 24 judges in the bench would mean that “they would have the right to declare void an older decision”.
Sheikh replied, “You yourself said that all Supreme Court judges may be nominated as a judge of the Constitutional Bench. Whatever the Supreme Court decides, it will be acceptable to all parties.”
The ex-SCBA president further said, “There is an impression that the standard of the judiciary’s independence in Pakistan does not meet international standards.
“There was an election in our country. Some people thought that the election would be scrutinised. Then, a commission was made to stop that scrutiny and accountability. This Constitutional Amendment came as a result of it,” Sheikh claimed.
He termed the background of the Amendment as “extremely important”. Justice Mandokhail told the lawyer to present his arguments on the Amendment later on, as first the CB had to decide which bench would hear the case.
“Keep talking about the world, but you have not said a word about the bench’s constitution,” Justice Aminuddin quipped.
Justice Mandokhail asked that if Sheikh’s argument that the CB could not hear the case was accepted, then who would issue orders for the formation of a full court.
Justice Bilal also questioned Sheikh about which bench had the power to strike down the 26th Amendment if the CB did not, to which the lawyer replied that the SC had to decide about the Amendment.
“Unless you prove that this bench is not eligible to hear the case, we cannot accept your request,” Justice Aminuddin remarked.
The petitions
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
 
 

These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

Diwali is a colourful festival involving lighting candles, worship, celebrations and prayers. It is celebrated to mark the day when Lord Rama returned home after his 14-year exile. It is a five-day festival and during this time, houses are cleaned and windows are opened to welcome Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth.
According to Radio Pakistan, the president said that the festival of Diwali “reminds us of the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil”.
He noted that the Constitution guaranteed equal rights and complete freedom of religion to all citizens.
“Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah envisioned a Pakistan where minorities would enjoy equal rights and opportunities,” he added. Zardari also lauded the services of Hindu community in education, commerce, and public service.
 
 

In his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended his “heartfelt greetings” to the Hindu community in Pakistan and around the world, wishing them a happy Diwali.
“As homes and hearts are illuminated with the light of Diwali, may this festival dispel darkness, foster harmony, and guide us all toward a future of peace, compassion, and shared prosperity,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
“The spirit of Diwali that embodies light over darkness, good over evil, and hope over despair inspires our collective resolve to overcome the challenges confronting our societies, from intolerance to inequality.”
He called on people to work together to ensure that all citizens could live in peace and contribute to progress, regardless of their faith or background.
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also extended his warm greetings to the Hindu community and around the world, calling Diwali the “festival of lights, hope, and renewal”.
In a press release issued by Bilawal House Media Cell, Bilawal said Diwali reminded us that “light always triumphs over darkness, and truth, peace, and love prevail over hate and division”.
 
 

He reaffirmed that in line with the vision of his mother, former premier Benazir Bhutto, and grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the PPP remained committed to building a “progressive and inclusive Pakistan where all faiths coexist in dignity and harmony”.
The PPP MNA lauded the Hindu community’s “invaluable contributions to Pakistan’s cultural and national life and urged all citizens to embrace Diwali’s true spirit of compassion, unity, and hope”.
Bilawal expressed the hope that the Hindu community’s lives “shine brightly — like the lights of Diwali — with happiness, harmony, and prosperity”.
 






Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori and Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also extended greetings to the Hindu community.
According to state-run APP, they said in their separate messages that Diwali was a festival of joy, lights, peace, and love.
The two also emphasised promoting interfaith harmony.</p><small>2025-10-20 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201123186a2caf4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950137/anger-after-israeli-police-cancel-tel-aviv-derby-amid-chaotic-scenes' target='_blank'><strong>Anger after Israeli police cancel Tel Aviv derby amid chaotic scenes</strong></a><br><p>There was anger on Monday in Israel after police banned the Israeli Premier League’s Tel Aviv derby amid chaotic scenes, triggering complaints from the clubs and political opposition.
The crowd trouble at Sunday’s abandoned match between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Hapoel Tel Aviv comes amid tensions over a ban preventing Israeli fans from attending an upcoming Europa League away game against English side Aston Villa.
The match in Tel Aviv was called off after what a police spokesman described as “disorderly conduct, riots, the hurling of objects, smoke grenades, fireworks, injured officers and damage to the stadium infrastructure”.
Speaking to public broadcaster KAN, he said: “This is not a soccer game: this is severe disorder and violence.”
After the police order, the Bloomfield Stadium, the home ground for both teams, was evacuated, with police on horseback intervening to control the 30,000 fans.
Hapoel’s management was infuriated by the police decision and tactics.
“From the preliminary discussions before the game, it seemed that the police were preparing for a war rather than a sports event,” the club said in a statement published on social media.
“Everyone saw the harsh videos, children trampled by horses, police officers beating fans indiscriminately,” it said, accusing the police of taking over the sport and demanding football authorities regain control.
 






Opposition leader Yair Lapid also seized upon the incident to attack Israel’s far-right interior minister.
“To the endless list of failures of the incompetent minister Itamar Ben Gvir, tonight was added the inability to facilitate a soccer game in the State of Israel,” Lapid posted on social media.
 






Maccabi Tel Aviv was less outspoken. The club was already embroiled in disagreements over the upcoming match in Birmingham, where a local safety committee has tried to ban Israeli away fans from Aston Villa’s stadium.
The UK government is trying to reverse the ban, which has been criticised by Israeli ministers, the UEFA football governing body and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said: “We will not tolerate anti-Semitism on our streets. “</p><small>2025-10-20 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/201218561db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950144/notices-issued-to-adiala-jail-superintendent-others-on-kp-cms-plea-seeking-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>Notices issued to Adiala jail superintendent, others on KP CM’s plea seeking meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday removed the registrar’s objections on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s plea seeking a meeting with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and issued notices to the Adiala jail superintendent and others for October 23.
Afridi had filed the plea on Oct 17, two days after he was sworn in as the provincial chief executive on Oct 15. He had gone to Adiala jail — where Imran has been imprisoned since September 2023 — after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court on Oct 16. However, he was denied the meeting; Afridi has stated that he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran. He had then filed a plea with the IHC, however, the registrar’s office had objected to the maintainability of the plea.
Today, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir took up the matter and overruled the objections of the registrar office.
Afridi’s lawyer Advocate Ali Bukhari said that the registrar’s office had raised the objection that the petition was filed “without the provincial cabinet and government’s decision”.
“This objection has no standing as the cabinet has not been constituted as yet,” he contended.
Subsequently, the court removed the objections and issued notices to the interior secretary, the Punjab Home Department secretary, the Punjab inspector general of prisons and the Adiala jail superintendent for Oct 23.
The petition filed by Afridi had contended that the KP government had earlier submitted formal requests to the federal interior ministry and the Punjab home department to allow a meeting with Imran, but no approval was granted.
The plea maintained that consultation with the PTI founder was “legally and ethically necessary” for the chief minister in connection with key administrative and political decisions, including cabinet formation.
Meanwhile, in its objections the IHC registrar’s office had noted that the court had already adjudicated similar matters and had laid down a procedure for seeking permission to meet the PTI founder. The office questioned how a new petition could be filed without following the prescribed process.

Correction: This story previously incorrectly stated that the Islamabad High Court had issued a notice to the Punjab inspector general of police. However, the notice has been issued to the Punjab inspector general of prisons. The error is regretted.</p><small>2025-10-20 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20124135dbb404f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939877/heavy-vehicles-are-killing-hundreds-in-karachi-why-does-no-one-seem-to-care' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy vehicles are killing hundreds in Karachi. Why does no one seem to care?</strong></a><br><p>At the far corner of a garage near Karachi’s Water Pump Chowrangi, two isolated trunks sit open, their stomachs half full with embroidered shalwar kameez, fancy sandals and henna. At the top are two boxes: a 62-piece dinner set and a six-piece bath set, with ‘Mahnoor’ scribbled on them with a pencil.
“This is the dowry we had been collecting for Mahnoor,” her uncle Zakir said. “We were to visit the groom’s house tomorrow to finalise the wedding date.”
But then, tragedy struck. On August 10, a wayward dumper truck, driven way above the allowed speed, crushed Mahnoor and her youngest sibling, leaving their father critically injured. Following the accident, a mob gathered and torched a total of seven dumpers in protest.
The garage at her house, which previously served as a stockroom for the 22-year-old’s upcoming wedding, has since been converted into a visiting area. Her father, Shakir, bandaged from head to toe, lay on a charpoy at the centre of the room. He drifted in and out of consciousness as a swarm of people surrounded him. When he is awake, all he talks about is the screams of his children moments before they were crushed by a dumper truck.
 

The dowry Shakir and his family collected for Mahnoor’s wedding.

“Mahnoor shouted ‘papa’ …  Ahmed screamed in shock,” the father, 47, cried. “When I looked back, neither of them was on the motorcycle … before I could register what happened, my bike lost balance,” he recalled. Shakir passed out on the road, which was almost deserted at 3am. He woke up at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where he found out that his youngest and eldest children were no more.
While he narrated the incident to Dawn.com, Shakir kept saying: “Main barbad hogaya (I am ruined)”. Beside him, Alishba and Hamza — the remaining two siblings who survived — wept profusely as the family’s elders moved forward to comfort their father.
Shakir’s loss is part of a much larger pattern — one that has claimed hundreds of lives in Karachi this year alone.
The city has witnessed a steep rise in traffic accidents over the last several months, particularly those involving heavy vehicles, such as dumper trucks and water tankers. According to official data, at least 538 people lost their lives in traffic accidents across the city during the first seven months of the year. The victims included 274 motorcyclists, 179 pedestrians, 51 women, and 68 children.

In the first half of this year, the numbers have significantly risen compared to 2024, when a total of 771 citizens were killed in 9,000 traffic accidents.
When tragedy strikes
Shakir’s two-storey house is a witness to the trend — in the last year, his family has lost four people, including children, to road accidents, particularly those caused by dumper trucks.
“Every time, a group of officials came to our house and left after making empty promises,” said Zakir, now the head of the house, as he instructed some boys seated nearby to make arrangements. The head of the Karachi Dumper Truck Association, along with the police and local leaders, was coming over to meet the barely conscious Shakir.
Soon, they arrived with an entourage of private guards and gathered around Shakir in a circle, hands raised as they prayed for the deceased. They offered condolences to Shakir, who did not open his eyes once in their presence.
When they left, Zakir told Dawn.com that the first information report of the accident had been registered by the state. “We no longer have a fight left inside us … we just want Shakir to recover,” he resigned. The FIR was not brought up again.
 

Members of the dumper truck association visit Shakir’s house.

Shakir’s tragedy is not isolated — across Karachi, families like his have been torn apart by the city’s heavy vehicles, while others have narrowly escaped with their lives.
At Ali Zeeshan’s house, most of the conversations centre around the FIR and the “dumper mafia”. He and his wife are among those fortunate enough to have come out unscathed from an accident on Rashid Minhas Road earlier in February this year, when a dumper truck descending from the Jauhar Flyover hit multiple vehicles.
“At first, we thought an explosion had taken place nearby,” said Zeeshan, whose newly bought car, an MG SUV, was rammed from the rear by the dumper truck. “The second time it hit us, the windshield burst, airbags in my car flew open, and there was smoke everywhere,” he said. The couple was on the way to the airport to pick up a relative.
Zeeshan recounted that the first thing he told his wife was to get out of the car. “When I opened the door, I saw a pool of blood everywhere,” Faiza said. “As I got out, I saw a woman’s lifeless body in the middle of the road.”
A motorcycle and a rickshaw had been hit in the accident as well. Unfortunately, none of those aboard the two vehicles survived.
“There was a commotion in the area,” Zeeshan recalled to Dawn.com. “Scores of people had gathered at the accident site … some of them were filming videos of the incident, others were helping the injured.” So Faiza was sent home, and Zeeshan headed to the Sharea Faisal police station for a car fitness check and registration of an FIR.
By the time he came back home, he was tired and shaken, but more so, disappointed at the police apathy — the state registered the FIR, there was no compensation for his loss, and he was “actively discouraged” from pursuing the matter. “Aap jaise log kahan thaanon aur katcheri ke chakkar lagayen gain (people like you can’t keep going between the courts and police stations),” Zeeshan was told.
The dumper truck driver, on the other hand, was arrested a week after the incident and subsequently granted bail.
‘Just an accident’
Unlike Shakir, Zeeshan was fortunate to have remained unhurt in the accident, which took the lives of three people that day. “One can only imagine the agony of their families,” he sighed.
According to a 2018 World Health Organisation report, road accidents in Pakistan result in 14.3 deaths per 100,000 population. For Karachi’s 20.3 million population, this amounts to at least 2,800 fatalities annually. These are not just 2,800 funerals, but also 2,800 broken families whose entire lives have been upended.
 

Zeeshan’s car post the accident.

But for the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, Karachi, these incidents are “just” accidents. “They are natural, they happen,” said Sardar Hameed, the body’s president. He had just got back to his one-room office in the Sohrab Goth area after a day-long hearing at the city court, on an accident that took place in Malir.
“They [the accidents] are not in control of the drivers,” he went on to add. “They are from God. We try our best, but it is out of our control.” Hameed insisted that dumper trucks were responsible for the least number of accidents in the city, claiming that the public’s attention was brought to them after “some people in power made irresponsible statements”.
“So now, the finger is just pointed at us,” he said, highlighting the recent incidents where citizens set dumper trucks on fire. “These accidents used to take place earlier as well…”
Yet, Hameed continued, the association has implemented a new set of rules for its vehicles and drivers, one of them being installing trackers inside the trucks to monitor their location and speed, which should be under the speed of 40km/hr — the data for which is collected in real time at the traffic police control room.
He explained that around 400 to 500 dumper trucks operate across Karachi every day, for two reasons: to deliver construction material (crush, sand, cement) and to dump garbage, the contract for which was given by the government. The men behind the steering wheels, who Hameed said hailed from all ethnicities, work shifts from 10pm to 6am, from which they earn Rs3,000 per day.
Earlier this year, the government imposed a ban on heavy vehicles after Karachiites took to the streets against the rise in fatal accidents caused by dumper trucks. Consequently, the government decided that heavy vehicles in the city would only operate at night. Initially, for two months, but later the order was extended.
However, dumper trucks are a common sight for commuters in the city throughout the day, which again raises the question of whether the government orders were actually implemented. “I got into the accident at around 5pm on a public holiday — Feb 5. We were coming down the busy Rashid Minhas Road flyover when it occurred,” recalled Zeeshan.
“The truck must have been at a speed of 50km/hr-60km/hr.”
He recollected how, after hitting his car, the truck driver tried to flee and, in the process of escaping with the vehicle, recklessly hit more people. “What were these trucks doing there during peak traffic hours? Why didn’t the police stop them? Do these drivers even know how to drive?” Zeeshan questioned.
Dawn.com made several attempts to contact Traffic Police DIG Pir Muhammad Shah to get answers to some of these questions, but failed to get a response.
Money for blood
For his part, Hameed said all dumper truck drivers hold a heavy transport vehicle driving license, which was why they were able to secure bail in case of an accident. In such a scenario, when the driver possesses a driving license, the case may be dealt with under Section 322 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The law states: Whoever commits qatl bis-sabab shall be liable to diyat. A person is said to commit qatl bis-sabab when they, without any intention, cause death or harm to another person.
The person who commits such an offence is liable to diyat, a form of compensatory punishment — a practice that is very common in the city. Case in point: when members of the dumper truck association visited Shakir’s residence, they announced a compensation of Rs500,000 for the grieving family.
 

Heavy vehicles parked outside the office of the dumper truck assocation in Sohrab Goth.

Meanwhile, when the driver causes an accident due to irresponsible driving, they are charged under Section 320 of the PPC — punishment for qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving. Per the law, any person who unintentionally causes a person’s death by rash or negligent driving shall be punished with imprisonment for a term that can extend to 10 years, in addition to paying diyat (blood money), taking into account the case’s specific facts and circumstances.
Drivers without a license are primarily charged under this section if their negligence leads to a fatality, alongside other relevant PPC sections.
However, the offence is bailable, and thus, the grief of hundreds of families who have lost their loved ones in these accidents rarely finds justice. Only recently did the government move to change that when, in August, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Interior approved a significant amendment, declaring Section 320 non-bailable in cases where a person dies due to reckless driving.
But the amendment is part of a proposed legislation — Criminal Law Amendment Bill 2024 — which is awaiting final approval and thus implementation. Until then, perpetrators charged under Section 320 of the PPC continue to secure bail.
The FIR registered for Zeeshan’s accident invoked the same section. “Within a few days of the incident, the driver’s family began reaching out to me, insistent that I forgive him in exchange for diyat,” he said. “But they weren’t even ready to pay half of the total cost of damages.”
There was back and forth for some days, but when Zeeshan refused to budge, they began harassing him and his family. “They visited my house at odd hours and kept tabs on my children,” he added. And so eventually, he decided to take a step back.
The practice of visiting the victim’s house is protocol for the association. As Hameed explained, “We try our best to be there for the bereaved families, so we visit them and offer a helping hand, whether through money or anything else.” There is a widespread sentiment among dumper truck drivers and owners of being wrongly “targeted” and “misunderstood”, both by the government and the people.
They lay the blame on motorcyclists and rickshaw drivers. “We are tired of them … they try to pass through even the tiniest of spaces, lose balance and crash,” said Zaman Khan, a dumper truck driver who came to Karachi from his hometown of Dera Ismail Khan in 1998. “I have been driving for at least the last 20 years, and not once have I gotten into an accident. But I have seen many, and in most of them, the motorcyclist is at fault.”
“Yet, we are the ones who are blamed, our vehicles are burnt down, and we are beaten up by the public,” Zaman told Dawn.com.
Hameed, the president of the dumper truck association, agreed, adding that illegal parking and encroachments on roads across the city were another factor contributing to traffic accidents. “Shops, garages, and showrooms sit on main arteries and cars are parked right in the middle of the roads … so if we are driving at the speed of 40km/hr, even abrupt brakes cannot save us from an accident.”
Here, he pointed out, it was the responsibility of the government to enforce adherence to the law.
Dawn.com also reached out to Sindh Minister for Transport Sharjeel Inam Memon, but he did not respond to requests for comment.
However, during a Sindh Assembly session held after public outrage over Shakir’s accident grew, Memon said that only the dumpers equipped with trackers and cameras would be allowed to enter the metropolis, and the complete record and licence of every driver, regardless of which city they came from, would be checked.
More than just rash driving
On the flip side, experts say Karachi’s traffic chaos is rooted not only in reckless driving but also in systemic failures — neglected road infrastructure, weak enforcement, and mismanaged traffic flow.
At a dialogue, titled “Traffic and Transport Issues in Karachi — Proposed Solutions”, organised by the Concerned Citizens Alliance (CCA) earlier this year, architect and urban planner Arif Hasan said all these issues were part of a larger cultural attitude “sab chalta hai [everything works]” which affects laws and their enforcement as well as the proper execution of projects.
He said there were no management and maintenance plans in place for Karachi and stressed that a special management system was needed to resolve traffic and transport issues in the metropolis.
According to senior academic and researcher Prof Dr Noman Ahmed, the primary issue behind the rising number of fatal accidents is the overall status of roads across the city. “The condition of most roads is such that there are potholes at every corner and the asphalt is uneven, which is hindering the routine operations of heavy vehicles.”
 

The dilapidated condition of major arteries in Karachi. — File photo

He explained that asphalt played a key role in creating friction during contact with the tyre, so the better the asphalt, the stronger the brakes. Such anomalies are prevalent on major arteries across the city, raising questions regarding their maintenance and operability.
Then there are some main thoroughfares where a different set of challenges occurs, such as the University Road and Shahrah-i-Sher Shah Suri, located in the North Nazimabad town, where major projects — Green and Red Line — have been under construction for years now. This has left the roads in a state of perpetual disrepair. The NIPA flyover and Civic Centre traffic sections are another two visible examples.
Residents and urban planners alike point out that Karachi’s road problems are persistent, with poor quality control ensuring that even new projects quickly deteriorate. “This is because we have very poor quality control,” Dr Noman pointed out. “Even when roads are reconstructed, they are back to a dilapidated state as soon as the first raindrop of the monsoon season drops.”
Secondly, there was a need to construct major arteries in a way that could sustain the everyday movement of heavy vehicles. This must also be implemented in neighbourhoods where construction work is underway because that is where most dumper trucks are headed.
For example, a lot of houses are being built in DHA Phase VIII, and so there are a lot of dumper trucks travelling in and out of the area to deliver gravel, sand and other materials. But the roads of these areas are not built in a way that they can withstand the daily movement of heavy vehicles.
 
 

Another big challenge in Karachi that Dr Noman highlighted was the lack of safety infrastructure on the city’s roads. “Leaving a few arteries, you may not find any road here with proper lane markings,” he said, explaining that these markings are essential for road safety because they guide drivers, cyclists and pedestrians while also improving traffic flow and helping to prevent accidents by providing clear instructions.
Hence, they are critical for navigation.
Similarly, we have plenty of traffic signals, but how many actually do work? “Most of them are made dysfunctional, and then a traffic constable takes their place, which creates more chaos because signals are synchronised and can be timed according to peak and off-peak hours.” They don’t just reduce human labour but are also efficient in traffic management.
Another problem is black spots — specific and limited stretches of roadway that have an unusually high frequency of road accidents due to poor road design or lack of surveillance. Many of these spots are found in District South, particularly DHA. Identifying and rectifying these spots is a crucial aspect of road safety management, involving detailed investigations to diagnose the causes and implement engineering solutions, said Dr Noman.
Misplaced speed breakers also contribute to accidents. “It has become quite a nightmare,” he said, referring to speed breakers built on main roads instead of neighbourhood lanes. “You don’t make speed breakers on main roads; they should instead be on secondary streets and neighbourhood lanes.”
For throughways, speed neutralisers can be used — they are very small speed breakers placed in quick succession. “So even if a vehicle is speeding, it will automatically slow down, and the neutralisers act as warnings. This won’t just protect the citizens but also their vehicles, whether big or small,” Dr Noman added.
Finding hope in a haystack
Karachi’s crumbling infrastructure — from broken roads to dilapidated buildings — is a daily reminder of systemic neglect. For residents like Lubna, Mahnoor and Ahmed’s mother, this neglect translates into constant grief. “Living in this city is akin to living in tragedy. All the time,” she said.
Experts, however, stress that solutions exist — if only the will to enforce them does.
 
 

“First of all, we have to undertake a kind of profiling and categorisation of heavy vehicles,” Dr Noman said. This involves looking at the number of heavy vehicles moving through Karachi and their destinations, which would help in their management. Once this happens, authorities would be able to find out which vehicles are used predominantly in the morning, and then they could be assigned specific routes.
These routes can thus be marked for commuters. What can also be done is that heavy vehicles involved in the functioning of daytime enterprises — such as dumper trucks carrying construction material or waste and water tankers — can be assigned out-of-city routes.
Then come the drivers, who must be given some kind of training. Hameed, the president of the dumper truck association, mentioned that drivers first have to spend three years as conductors, during which they learn the tricks of the trade. But formal training was still missing.
“A common observation is that when a heavy vehicle is loaded, it has a stipulated velocity at which it should be operated because the braking systems of the vehicle are affected by the weight it is carrying, especially when it climbs a slope and comes down from the bridge,” said Dr Noman.

Here comes engineering, because it teaches how vehicles have their own operational considerations. The driver should not just be limited to the brakes, clutch or the gear; they should also be aware of the vehicle’s vulnerabilities and critical areas.
Here, Dr Noman stressed, motorcyclists are also an important stakeholder because there are four million of them in Karachi and they are the most vulnerable to accidents. Shakir and his children, too, were on a motorcycle when they were hit.
“If you look at this figure, it would be very difficult to expect that all these motorcyclists would have received any kind of proper training about traffic rules and regulations.” And a chunk of this responsibility falls on the traffic police, which is slacking when it comes to proper surveillance.
“The biggest problem is that when they execute their regulatory checks, their emphasis is more on documents, based on which fines are imposed. But they are not looking at how big a crime is being committed. Ultimately, there is rarely any accountability,” the academic pointed out.
He suggested that cameras must be installed for road surveillance, and along with that, special attention should be paid to black spots, so that the physical arrangement of traffic can be improved.
“Without these changes, the fatalities from traffic accidents will continue to rise,” he warned.
Back in the garage at Shakir’s house, Mahnoor’s dinner set waits in its taped box. The FIR is filed, the association has offered Rs500,000, and the trucks still roll past Lucky One day in and day out. Until Karachi can slow them down, fix its roads and enforce its own rules, those boxes will keep outliving the people they were meant for.

According to the World Bank, borrowing in foreign currencies exposes clients to the risk that debt and debt service payments (as measured in local currency) increase when the local currency depreciates. However, by converting to local currency, clients are able to address that risk.
The statement released by the central bank today said that the agreement, signed under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) framework, would enable the IFC to “manage currency risks more effectively” and increase its investments in Pakistani rupees.
“This is an important step towards unlocking financing for critical sectors of the economy and creating jobs across the country,” the SBP statement said.
 






It also quoted SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad as saying that promoting private sector growth in Pakistan was “paramount to successful, sustainable economic development of the country”.
He added that partnership with the IFC was aimed at enhancing financing opportunities for the private sector.
John Gandolfo, IFC vice president and treasurer for treasury and mobilisation, said: “With currency volatility posing significant risks to developing economies, access to local currency financing has never been more important.“
He said promoting this type of financing was a “strategic priority” for the World Bank Group and a catalyst for economic growth in Pakistan.
The statement noted that exchange rate risks remain a major challenge for companies in developing economies that borrow in hard currencies such as the US dollar while earning revenue in local currencies.
“The IFC is committed to leveraging innovative financial instruments and strengthening partnerships to address the growing need for local currency financing in emerging markets. Through this partnership with IFC, the SBP aims to bolster economic resilience, promote private sector development and improve foreign exchange liquidity in Pakistan,” the statement said.
The development comes after Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, during a week-long visit to Washington, discussed private sector investment, infrastructure financing, and development cooperation in meetings with senior officials of the IFC and the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB).
During his meeting with Riccardo Puliti, IFC regional vice president, the minister  had highlighted Pakistan’s improving macroeconomic indicators and the importance of strengthening IFC’s partnership with the country.
“We value IFC’s role in scaling up private sector investment, particularly through multi-billion-dollar commitments under the 10-year Country Partnership Framework,“ he had said.
Both sides had agreed to work toward early financial closure of IFC’s flagship Reko Diq project, and the minister welcomed IFC’s new regional set-up, including a regional office in Islamabad, describing it as a “significant step to deepen collaboration and support sustainable investment in Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-10-20 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629511-islamabad-police-given-three-day-ultimatum-to-recover-kidnapped-nccia-deputy-director' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad police given three-day ultimatum to recover 'kidnapped' NCCIA deputy director</strong></a><br><p>

The ceasefire was agreed early yesterday morning during talks between Afghan and Pakistani delegations in Doha with the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye. A next round of negotiations between the two sides is scheduled to be held in Istanbul on October 25.
A statement posted on the Saudi foreign ministry’s X account said it “expresses the kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s welcome of the signing by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan of an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries, during the round of negotiations held in Doha.”
 






“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security that achieves stability and prosperity for the brotherly peoples of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“This kingdom hopes that this positive step will lead to an end to tensions on the border between the two countries,” the statement said.
Saudi Arabia — which signed a defence pact with Pakistan last month under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both —  also appreciated the “diplomatic efforts and constructive role” of Turkiye and Qatar in mediating the ceasefire between Islamabad and Kabul.
Yesterday, Turkiye’s, Oman’s and Qatar’s foreign ministries had also issued statements welcoming the ceasefire.
Border clashes
The skirmishes on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan began on the night of October 11, when Afghan forces launched an attack on Pakistani border posts. According to the media affairs wing of the Pakistani military, its 23 troops were martyred in the clashes that continued into Oct 12 while over 200 Taliban and affiliated militants were killed.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
Later, clashes again broke out on the night of Oct14 along the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram sector. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said
the Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khawarij — the term state has designated for the banned  terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had tried to attack Pakistani border posts in the area but the attacks were effectively repulsed.
Subsequently on Oct 15, the ISPR said security forces had repulsed another attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban.
However, the Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid alleged earlier in the day that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
Later in the day, state media reported citing security sources that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghan capital Kabul and the province of Kandahar, targeting terrorists’ hideouts and leadership.
This was a little before a 48-hour ceasefire was announced between the two sides. Dawn reported that it was the second ceasefire between the neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. It quoted diplomatic insiders as saying that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions.
The ceasefire was extended on October 17.
While delegations from Pakistan and Afghanistan were expected to meet in Doha for talks to end border hostilities, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Oct 17, according to a Dawn report.
It said incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
This development followed a gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan.
The border clashes had erupted against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Pakistan has been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan, since the TTP broke a ceasefire deal with the government and vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations.</p><small>2025-10-20 06:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629498-president-pm-reaffirm-commitment-to-minority-rights-on-diwali' target='_blank'><strong>President, PM reaffirm commitment to minority rights on Diwali</strong></a><br><p>

“I spoke with Prime Minister Modi of India, and he said he’s not going to be doing the Russian oil thing,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.
Asked about India’s assertion that it was not aware of any conversation between Modi and Trump, Trump replied: “But if they want to say that, then they’ll just continue to pay massive tariffs, and they don’t want to do that.”
Russian oil has been one of the main irritants for Trump in prolonged trade talks with India — half of his 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods are in retaliation for those purchases.
The US government has said that petroleum revenue funds Russia’s war in Ukraine.
India has become the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian oil sold at a discount after Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Trump on Wednesday said Modi had assured him that day that India would stop its Russian oil purchases.
 






India’s foreign ministry said it was not aware of any telephone conversation between the leaders that day, but said that New Delhi’s main concern was to “safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer.”
A White House official said on Thursday that India has halved its purchases of Russian oil, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen.
The sources said Indian refiners already placed orders for November loading, including some slated for December arrival, so any cut may start showing up in December or January import numbers.
India’s imports of Russian oil are set to rise about 20pc this month to 1.9 million barrels per day, according to estimates from commodities data firm Kpler, as Russia ramps up exports after Ukrainian drones hit its refineries.</p><small>2025-10-20 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20082547f481156.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950082/climate-change-support-surges-to-34pc-in-pakistan-world-bank-survey' target='_blank'><strong>Climate change support surges to 34pc in Pakistan: World Bank survey</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Climate change along with water and sanitation have become higher priorities in Pakistan, while perceptions of the World Bank Group’s support have declined in key sectors, according to the results of ‘Pakistan Country Opinion Survey for Pakistan’, commissioned by the World Bank.
The survey found that support for climate change initiatives increased from 5 per cent in fiscal year 2021 to 34pc in fiscal year 2025. Similarly, support for water and sanitation rose from 9pc to 35pc in the same period.
While the World Bank Group’s (WBG) work in pandemic preparedness, gender equity, and disaster risk management received the highest effectiveness ratings, the overall perception of its support has decreased significantly since 2021 in other areas, especially for governance, education, and water and sanitation.
In qualitative comments, respondents called for the WBG to deepen its local engagement in Pakistan, “moving beyond federal-level interactions to more meaningful collaboration at the grassroots, provincial, and community levels to better understand local needs and ensure effective implementation”.

Perceptions of the World Bank Group’s support have declined in key sectors

The survey showed that financial resources were considered the WBG’s greatest value to Pakistan at 48pc, followed by knowledge products (33pc), technical assistance (32pc), and capacity development (24pc).
While ratings for many key performance indicators remained largely consistent with 2021 findings, the survey noted that the only rating to show a significant improvement was the perception of the WBG’s effectiveness in achieving development results in Pakistan.
More than half of respondents felt that the WBG has strengthened its work in improving people’s lives (52pc) and in being easy to work with (51pc).
Additionally, just under half believed the Bank has somewhat or significantly improved the technical quality of WBG-supported projects and partnered with others to increase development finance (49 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively).
A government institution respondent stated that “capacity building of the local stakeholders and impact assessment of the projects should be necessary in the project design”.
A parliamentarian suggested the WBG “develop people-to-people contact, and engage civil society along with the government for better results of project implementation.” The parliamentarian added that Parliament and local body members “must be taken in decision and implementation of projects”.
Collaboration with the national government received the highest ratings this year, but this perception has decreased significantly since fiscal year 2021. At the same time, perceptions of effective collaboration with civil society have improved significantly.
However, the group’s collaboration with the parliament and local government received relatively lower ratings, with stakeholders from the office of a parliamentarian giving some of the lowest ratings.
Respondents were most familiar with the WBG’s and the United Nations’ work among development institutions. The survey found the WBG to be one of the most trusted institutions in Pakistan, alongside the UN and the Asian Development Bank.
Significant differences emerged in how various groups perceive the WBG. Respondents from bilateral agencies and government institutions were more positive about WBG staff accessibility than those from the offices of parliamentarians, civil society, and academia. Respondents from local government organisations tended to be more critical of the WBG’s work.
The Country Opinion Surveys, which are part of the World Bank Group’s programme series, explore stakeholder opinions on the economy, future priorities, and perceptions of the WBG’s effectiveness, relevance, and ability to influence the development agenda.

Officials said a team of 60 investigators were working on the theory that the raid was planned and executed by an organised crime group.
In France, it reignited a row over the lack of security in France’s museums, which the new Interior Minister Laurent Nunez acknowledged on Sunday was a “major weak spot”.
The thieves arrived between 9:30 and 9:40am Sunday, shortly after the museum opened to the public at 9:00am, a source close to the investigation said.
They used a furniture hoist to get access to the Apollo Gallery, home to the royal collection, and cutting equipment to get in through a window and open the display cases.
A brief clip of the raid, apparently filmed on the phone of a visitor to the museum, was broadcast on French news channels.
The masked thieves stole nine 19th-century items of jewellery, one of which — the crown of the Empress Eugenie — was dropped and damaged as they made their escape.
Seven-minute raid
Eight “priceless” items of jewellery were stolen, the culture ministry said on Sunday. The list they released included an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon gave his wife Empress Marie Louise.
Also stolen was a diadem that once belonged to the Empress Eugenie, which has nearly 2,000 diamonds; and a necklace that once belonged to Marie-Amelie, the last queen of France. It has eight sapphires and 631 diamonds, according to the Louvre’s website.
The whole raid took just seven minutes and was thought to have been carried out by an experienced team, possibly “foreigners”, said Nunez.
The intervention of the museum’s staff forced the thieves to flee, leaving behind some of the equipment used in the raid, said the culture ministry in a statement.
The loot would be impossible to sell on in its current state, said the president of the leading auctioneer Drouot Patrimoine, Alexandre Giquello.
National ‘humiliation’
It was the first theft from the Louvre since 1998, when a painting by Corot was stolen and never seen again.
Sunday’s raid relaunched a debate over what critics says is the poor security at the nation’s museums, far less secure than banks and increasingly targeted by thieves.
Last month, criminals broke into Paris’s Natural History Museum, making off with gold samples worth $700,000.
The same month, thieves stole two dishes and a vase from a museum in the central city of Limoges, the losses estimated at $7.6 million.
Sunday’s robbery sparked angry political reactions.
“How far will the disintegration of the state go?” said far-right National Rally party leader Jordan Bardella on social media, calling the theft “an unbearable humiliation for our country”.
President Emmanuel Macron said on social media that “everything is being done” to catch the perpetrators and recover the stolen treasures.

Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi has taken oath on October 15 but since then the provincial government has been functioning without cabinet.
He has said time and again that he would announce names of his team members with the consultation of Imran Khan.
 
 

On the second day of his oath-taking, Mr Afridi rushed to Adiala Jail to meet his incarcerated ‘boss’ and take instructions from him about future line of action but he was not allowed to meet him.

Provincial govt working without cabinet since Oct 15; participants of a recent party meeting say protest march on Islamabad to be ‘last option’ for Imran’s release

Sources in PTI told this scribe that some leaders of the party told Mr Afridi during a recent meeting that ‘corrupt’ ministers and ‘people with bad reputation’ should be kept away from the new cabinet.
The meeting was also attended by PTI provincial president MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, general secretary Ali Asghar, central leader and former speaker of National Assembly Asad Qaiser, MNAs Atif Khan and Shahram Tarakai and former finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra.
Sources said that during the meeting, it was discussed that fair people should be inducted in the new cabinet.
It is pertinent to mention here that making frequent changes in the previous cabinets of the PTI governments in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained its hallmark.
Recently ministers for elementary and secondary education department and public health engineering department resigned from Ali Amin Gandapur’s team while the ministers of several other departments were reshuffled.
Besides formation of new cabinet, sources said, the release of Imran Khan from jail and volatile law and order situation were also discussed in the meeting.
They said that the new chief minister and party leadership discussed in detail how to resolve the issue of law and order situation and bring peace in the province.
They said that they discussed in detail prospects about the release of Imran Khan. When asked whether PTI would march on Islamabad by the end of November, sources said that the date was not decided yet.
They said that protest march on Islamabad would be the last option with PTI and before the march, the party would take other steps for the release of Imran Khan.
Sources said that election of Sohail Afridi as chief minister was an indication to deal things with the federal government and powers that be with aggression. They said that all organisations of PTI were fully supporting their new chief minister.
In another development which took place on Sunday, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan directed general secretary Ali Asghar to issue show-cause notices to district presidents for not holding protest demonstrations against the alleged killing of workers of Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan. PTI founder Imran Khan had given the call to stage protest demonstrations at district level on Friday last.
Sources said that most of the district organisations of PTI staged protests while reportedly several of them did not obey the directives of Imran Khan.
A senior PTI leader told Dawn that strict action should be taken against such district presidents because holding demonstrations was not a big task rather the protest was peaceful and there were no probabilities of registration of FIRs and any other action against them by police or government.

• Officials say Ajrak-themed plates for those who applied in June are ready
• Claim over 50,000 plates lying uncollected at Civic Centre
KARACHI: As the deadline for vehicle owners to obtain new number plates draws near, those who applied months ago are thronging the Civic Centre to collect their retro-reflective plates, only to be returned disappointed due to a backlog of at least four months.
Many of these people had appl­ied months ago for the replacement of their old number plates with the new Ajrak-themed ones. However, they had to return empty-handed from the offices of the Excise and Taxation Depar­tment after being informed that their plates had not yet been delivered.
During visits to the Civic Centre and Executive Centre in Clifton, Dawn saw a large number of people arriving either to collect their number plates — those who had applied after January — or to complete the process of transfer of ownership.
Officials and visitors said the main reason for the rush was the deadline announced by the Excise Department, which expires on Oct 31.
However, if not extended, acco­rding to the department, both the buyer and seller will be required to appear in person at the centre for biometric verification to complete the transfer process.
An excise official told Dawn that number plates for vehicle owners who had applied for replacements by June have either been delivered to the respective centres or collected by vehicle owners. However, he said that over 50,000 plates were still lying uncollected at the Civic Centre.
“I had applied for the number plate in January but have come to collect it now,” said a vehicle owner waiting for his turn to collect new Ajrak-themed number plates at the centre.
He acknowledged that he had already received a message from the excise department, but only decided to obtain the plate after learning that the traffic police would begin issuing challans from the last week of October against vehicles not affixed with new number plates.
However, another vehicle owner, who had also come to collect his number plate, claimed that he had not received any message from the department. He said he was informed by a traffic police officer during a routine check that his number plate had already been delivered to the centre.
“I had applied two months ago for ownership transfer and for the replacement with the new Ajrak-featured plate, but while the file has been received, the number plate has still not arrived,” a vehicle owner said.
Number of applicants surges to 10,000: official
A senior official in the department told Dawn that number pla­t­es for those who had applied for replacements by June had already been delivered to the centres or collected by the respective vehicle owners. Without giving a specific time frame, he claimed that the remaining backlog would be cleared soon.
He also claimed there was no backlog in the issuance of Ajrak-featured number plates for newly registered vehicles.
The official said that while around 300 to 400 applications or receipts were being received daily initially, the number has now surged to over 10,000 per day. Complaining about the situation, he added that more than 50,000 plates remain uncollected, causing “space constraints at the centre”.
He further said that over 650 new Ajrak-featured number plates were being delivered to the centre daily.
Responding to a question about what applicants should do if their replacement plates have not yet been delivered, the official said they are required to visit the centre.
“If their number plates have not been delivered, a stamp reading ‘number plate not issued’ will be placed on their receipt,” he explained.

In video after video, we have seen not only the depredations and war crimes of Israeli forces, but also the joy and pride on the faces of the genocidaire soldiers and the generals and government officials who direct their actions. For the vast majority of us, these images cannot be viewed with anything other than revulsion and disgust; it’s the most human of instincts to feel sympathy for Israel’s victims and rage against the unrepentant perpetrators.
But when Israel and its supporters look out at this new world, they don’t see that all this fury is caused by their actions; instead, they blame ‘antisemitism’, a tropey accusation that has long since lost its sting, and they point to social media — and in particular TikTok — for spreading anti-Israel sentiments. It’s not the atrocities that make us so hated, they believe, it’s the algorithms. And so, the thinking goes, if we can bully, buy or otherwise control social media platforms the way we control the bulk of mainstream Western media, anti-Israel sentiment could be managed. If we scrub the digital archives of our genocide, then it will be forgotten. And this is exactly what they’re doing.
First, they came for TikTok, and with good reason; Northeastern University conducted a study on pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli messaging on TikTok in the immediate aftermath of Oct 7. They found that there were 170,430 pro-Palestinian posts while pro-Israel posts numbered 8,843. But as we all should know, it’s not just about volume but about engagement too, and here we see that there were 236 million views for pro-Palestinian posts and a comparatively measly 14m for pro-Israel posts.
And in the following two years, the trend has not reversed but has in fact become progressively more and more pro-Palestinian. In fact, while pro-Israel posts and views spiked immediately after Oct 7, as a reaction to the event and then started to decline (as is typical of posts related to a major development), the pro-Palestinian posts are increasing in the pattern one ascribes to a sustained and broad-based movement.

Netanyahu is already celebrating.

Zionists identified this issue early on with Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of America’s Anti-Defamation League saying in a leaked audio “we have a TikTok problem, a Gen Z problem”, which needed to be solved. In typical Zionist fashion, they did so by manipulating the levers of US politics and throwing money at the problem. Suddenly a campaign started in the US accusing the Chinese government of manipulating TikTok’s algorithm and of accessing the private data of American users and demanding that TikTok’s American operations be sold off. It was a transparent ploy, because the real reason TikTok is being targeted has nothing to do with China and everything to do with Israel and its image.
 
 

And so we saw Republicans and Democrats alike line up against TikTok in the attempt to make Israel great again, and TikTok was forced to divest its US operations. But who would buy TikTok? Here we see a consortium of buyers emerge, with the primary one being Oracle. Oracle itself was founded by US billionaire Larry Ellison, who was (for a short while) the richest man in the world. Ellison is also the single largest private donor to the Israeli army and otherwise a staunch ‘Israel first’ Zionist. As for Oracle, its former CEO Safra Catz openly wrote in a private email to former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak that “we have to embed the love and respect for Israel in American culture”, while adding in an­­o­ther statement that Oracle’s commitm­ent to Israel was “second to none”. You can then imagine what TikTok will look like once Oracle is in control.
Netanyahu is already celebrating; in a recent talk with his cronies he said that “the most important [battlefield] is social media and the most important purchase that is going on right now is … TikTok”.
And with that battle won their sights are now not just on other social media outlets with the next major target being X (Twitter). And on cue, we see a slate of articles in Israeli media decrying X as the new home of antisemitism. Netanyahu isn’t worried though.
“Elon is a friend … we should talk to him,” he says. And he will. And Elon will obey. They’re coming for AI as well; the government of Israel has awarded a $6m contract to a former Trump campaign manager to create new pro-Israel websites and videos which LLMs like ChatGPT and others will be trained on.
The goal is to feed them Israeli propaganda so that they will, in turn, churn it out. This, then, is how a genocide is forgotten.

Dramatic developments that culminated in the US president’s visit to the Middle East and the ‘peace summit’ in Sharm el-Sheikh aroused hopes of an ‘era of peace’. But that may be a distant possibility given the fragility of the ceasefire and the stumbling blocks facing the critical next phases of the peace process.
The peace declaration signed by Trump and leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye at Sharm el-Sheikh contains general principles. It states the commitment to implement the Trump peace agreement but without detailing or elaborating its various elements. The signing ceremony neither had a representative from Hamas nor Israel, the two parties to the ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire, in any case, marks the beginning of a process not its culmination.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu proclaimed victory after Hamas released all the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But his commitment to honour the ceasefire and implement other steps of Trump’s 20-point plan, especially withdrawal from Gaza, is yet to be tested. His record is not encouraging. The last ceasefire in January was unilaterally ended by Israel after two months when it restarted its military onslaught. Tel Aviv also refused to negotiate further phases of what was earlier agreed.
This time Hamas sought written guarantees that Israel would not resume fighting once hostages were released. But it was unable to secure this. Instead, it got verbal assurances from the Americans. It will need Trump’s sustained engagement and pressure on Netanyahu to keep the peace process on track. Trump has staked his prestige on the Gaza deal, casting it as a “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. But he is not known to involve himself in detail that the plan’s implementation will require in the weeks ahead. Trump’s attention span is famously short.

With a fragile ceasefire in place, the path to peace in Gaza is strewn with formidable obstacles.

The next phase will involve intense negotiations to reach agreement on key aspects of the Trump plan, including demilitarisation of the territory, dismantling Hamas, pullout of Israeli forces from Gaza and deployment of a multinational stabilisation force. These are all vexing issues on which there is a yawning gap between the positions of Hamas and Israel. On Gaza’s post-conflict governance, convergence has yet to be evolved between the Palestinians/ Arab governments and Washington. The US has baulked at addressing the all-important issue of Palestinian statehood, for which Muslim countries want some assurance beyond the vague reference in Trump’s plan to “a pathway” to statehood.
Hamas is expected to disarm under the plan but has given no unequivocal assurance to give up arms as there is no commitment from Israel to withdraw from Gaza. Hamas leaders have indicated that without a comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the territory they will not lay down their arms. A senior Hamas leader, Mousa Abu Marzouk, has said his organisation would only hand over weapons “if the occupation ends and Palestinians can govern themselves”. Others have said they want an iron-clad assurance about the establishment of a Palestinian state.
 
 

Trump’s 20-point plan does not address how to sequence Gaza’s demilitarisation with an Israeli pullout. It does not specify a timetable to achieve these two evidently linked goals. This will have to be negotiated which will not be easy, especially as Netanyahu has not committed to a full withdrawal from Gaza. With Israeli officials already claiming Hamas is tightening control over areas that their forces initially vacated, Netanyahu can indefinitely delay the drawdown. Tel Aviv can even derail the process, citing lack of movement on disbanding Hamas.
There are also many unanswered questions about the ‘temporary stabilisation force’ envisioned for Gaza to secure the Strip. The US has already sent 200 troops to Israel to be deployed as part of the so-called civil-military coordination centre to help the stabilisation force monitor the ceasefire and oversee the peace. The terms and rules of engagement of the international stabilisation force (ISF) are purposely absent in the plan and will need to be thrashed out. Negotiations are said to be underway on this.
Will this force have a UN mandate authorised by a Security Council resolution? Several Arab states have shown preference for that. Western members of the P5 are said to be working on a resolution to establish a stabilisation force but not one that operates under the UN flag. Any expectation for its role to involve counter-insurgency or disarm Hamas would be hard for potential troop-contributing countries to accept. No Muslim/ Arab state would want to be seen as acting against Palestinians on Israel’s behalf or protecting Israel. ISF’s size, composition, who will lead it, precise role and how long it is deployed all have to be figured out in negotiations.
Its deployment has to be closely synchronised with the post-conflict governing arrangement in Gaza. Under the plan, a ‘Board of Peace’ headed by Trump is to supervise the temporary transitional governance by a committee of Palestinian technocrats and international experts who are to be responsible for day-to-day affairs. Again, who will constitute this committee and how legitimate will it be, are questions that still have to be grappled with. This international trusteeship arrangement, until a reformed Palestinian Authority takes over, will basically mean Gaza is run by outsiders for an unspecified period in a colonial-style enterprise. How viable this will be — and acceptable to the Palestinians — is an open question. Authority after all depends on legitimacy.
The challenges ahead are daunting. There are already signs of brewing trouble that can unravel the peace plan. Israel has continued to shell Gaza and kill Palestinians during the tenuous ceasefire and delayed full access for humanitarian aid. Hamas has handed over a list of Israeli violations to mediators. Israel has threatened to resume fighting if Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal. Echoing Israel’s threat, Trump has said he would allow Israel to restart military action if the organisation does not lay down its arms. All this suggests that the path to what Trump envisions as a “new dawn” in the Middle East remains a long and uncertain one.

While sacrilege can never be condoned, it is the misuse of these laws to settle personal scores and persecute vulnerable groups that has led to frequent bouts of violence in society.
In this regard, the government has stated its intent to reform the laws in order to prevent abuse. While speaking at an event at the Supreme Court recently, the federal law minister said that “procedural safeguards” were being introduced in blasphemy-related cases to prevent misuse. At the same event, the chief justice of Pakistan highlighted the need for interfaith harmony.
 
 

While specifics are not available, any progress in this regard should be welcomed, though it must be remembered that previous efforts at reform — even those led by the higher judiciary — have stalled due to the pushback from extremist lobbies.
Calls for reform of the blasphemy laws, and legal safeguards, are by no means a defence of sacrilege. For harmony in society, no abuse against the revered figures and scriptures of all faiths can be tolerated, and there can be no room for hate speech. Instead, what activists have been saying for decades is that the misuse of the laws has to be prevented. We have seen far too many incidents where personal disputes have led to accusations of blasphemy, while in other instances, sacrilege allegations have been used to dispossess minorities of their land.
 
 

Moreover, recently a gang of criminals was uncovered that would trap people online and blackmail them, threatening to go public with false blasphemy allegations against the victims unless they paid up.
Clearly, steps need to be taken, as innocent people have lost their lives simply on the basis of unproven claims and spurious ‘evidence’. Even the head of the Council of Islamic Ideology said last year that certain “religious elements” were misusing the laws and resorting to “mob justice”, which is “un-Islamic”.
If the state’s latest attempt to reform the said laws is to succeed, then there needs to be buy-in from mainstream clerics. Unless clergymen of all sects endorse the state’s move, and extremist voices are isolated, the initiative is unlikely to succeed. But beyond legal changes, to end the troubling culture of false blasphemy allegations, there needs to be grassroots change in society, so that sensitive religious issues are not used to target people.
Countering violent extremism has been highlighted both in NAP and NAP 2.0, yet beyond solemn promises, successive administrations have done little on the ground to translate these aims into policy. Holding conferences and issuing statements is not enough. Conversations must be held in neighbourhood mosques, madressahs, schools and bazaars to communicate the message, and adopt a ‘whole-of-society’ approach against extremism.

Pakistan loses an estimated 30–40 per cent of its food production each year, largely after harvest and during transport.
According to multiple assessments, including the Asian Development Bank, the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, and data cited by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, this wastage is valued at roughly $4 billion annually, or about Rs700–850bn.
The Food and Agriculture Organisation similarly reports that post-harvest losses in perishable crops such as fruits and vegetables can reach 20–44pc, underscoring the scale of inefficiency across Pakistan’s agribusiness food value chain.
 
 

This is not an accounting anomaly; it is a structural leak in the national purse, one that drives food inflation, weakens export competitiveness, and drains the incomes of rural producers.

The absence of an end-to-end cold chain network has led to chronic food spoiling and wastage during transportation costing the nation billion

Food loss and waste have moved beyond humanitarian concern. They now represent one of Pakistan’s greatest economic frontiers a sector where smart investment could deliver out-sized national returns.
The cold chain deficit — cracks in the system
Pakistan’s most glaring weakness lies in its absence of an end-to-end cold chain network.
According to the Pakistan Horticulture Development & Export Company, fewer than 6pc of perishable goods move through temperature-controlled logistics. Beyond the main urban centres, cold storage is almost non-existent.
The result: rapid spoilage of high-value perishables, such as mangoes, dairy, meat, and tomatoes, often occurs within hours of harvest.
“The mango that leaves Multan is a different product when it reaches the port,” noted one Karachi-based exporter, “Without data or refrigeration, the farmer always pays the price.”
To close this gap, Pakistan must invest in solar-powered, modular cold storage units placed at farm gates and collection centres. These small, off-grid systems are more cost-effective to operate and less susceptible to power outages.
Such investments should be structured through public–private partnerships and farmer cooperatives, ensuring shared ownership and long-term sustainability.
The logistics sector also demands modernisation. Reliance on open trucks and poor farm-to-market roads causes massive wastage. The World Bank estimates that inefficient post-harvest transport alone adds up to 20pc more losses to the value chain.
The solution lies in refrigerated trucks, equipped with temperature and humidity sensors for monitoring in transit. For grains, hermetic silos must replace the traditional mud-and-brick storage that welcomes rodents, moisture, and decay.
Innovation and the circular economy
Even with an improved cold chain, a fraction of produce will never make it to market shelves — too bruised, overripe, or oddly shaped. Today, most of it is simply discarded.
Yet this “imperfect produce” can be turned into economic gold. Overripe mangoes can be made into pulp and puree for export; tomatoes into paste and sauces; apples and citrus into vinegar and jams.
These products are in high demand across the Middle East, Central Asia, and markets within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where Pakistan already has trade channels.
Meanwhile, waste from urban mandis (wholesale markets) can power biogas and bio-fertiliser plants. A 2023 United Nations Industrial Development Organisation pilot project in Lahore found that using organic market waste for biogas saved up to 15pc in fertiliser costs while generating renewable energy for cold storage operations.
This shift toward upcycling and energy recovery can transform the food sector from a linear economy — grow, sell, discard — to a circular one that recycles and reinvests value.
Policy and finance — making it bankable
Rebuilding Pakistan’s post-harvest ecosystem will require capital and policy muscle. The State Bank of Pakistan should direct commercial banks to provide low-interest, long-tenure credit lines for cold chain and food processing infrastructure, much like existing Green Banking initiatives.
The government can further ease the burden by waiving import duties and taxes on cold storage and food processing machinery.
On the human capital front, agricultural extension programmes must be revitalised. Farmers need practical training in grading, packing, temperature control, and storage, as well as digital literacy to access market information.
A national commodity grading and certification system, aligned with Codex and ISO standards, would help Pakistani exporters meet the stringent requirements of European Union and US buyers, rewarding quality and consistency over volume.
A national priority, not an afterthought
Food loss reduction is not charity; it’s a sound economic strategy. Curbing waste could save billions in lost revenue, stabilise prices, and boost farmer incomes. It could also help Pakistan conserve precious water and energy, since nearly one-third of agricultural water goes into growing food that never gets eaten.
Pakistan has the know-how, the sunlight, and the market. What it needs now is coordination and the political will to prioritize efficiency over expansion.

• Calls for ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’
ISLAMABAD: The PTI’s Kisaan Wing (PTI-KW) has urged the federal and provincial governments to prioritise the restoration of agriculture sector, which suffered large-scale devastation due to the recent floods across the country, calling for the immediate formulation of a ‘National Agriculture Restoration Policy’.
This demand was made through a unanimous resolution passed at the PTI-KW meeting held on Sunday. The meeting was chaired by PTI-KW Organiser and MNA Sheikh Waqqas Akram, and attended by Central Information Secretary Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich, PTI Kisan Wing Punjab President Major (R) Ghulam Sarwar, General Secretary Muhammad Ijaz Shafi, MNA Khurram Shahzad Virk and a number of office bearers from various farmers’ organisations.
 
 

Briefing the media after the meeting, PTI-KW spokesperson Khalid Nawaz Sadhraich expressed deep concerns over the authorities’ handling of the post-flood situation. He said the recent floods caused a large-scale destruction across the country, resulting in estimated losses exceeding Rs822 billion. “The federal government’s preliminary flood damage assessment report admitted this loss, but the actual losses could be even higher as a detailed post-disaster assessment is still underway”, he added.
Mr Sadhraich said the meeting expressed dissatisfaction over the government’s post-flood relief and rehabilitation measures, terming them “highly disappointing” for the affected people, particularly farmers. He noted the initial estimates put the losses in agriculture sector alone at around Rs430 billion, excluding livestock and damage to the canal system.
“With the Rabi season fast approaching, helpless farmers have no access to basic inputs for sowing their crops, while they are being offered a mere Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 as compensation against losses worth millions,” he said.
The meeting emphasised the urgent need for rebuilding the destroyed agricultural infrastructure and called on the government to give the matter top priority. It also stressed the immediate formulation of a National Agriculture Restoration Policy and the creation of a committee comprising senior government officials and farmers’ representatives to rebuild the country’s agricultural economy, Mr Sadhraich concluded.

• 95 bank accounts identified; parleys continue over fate of seminaries administered by the group
LAHORE: Authorities in Punjab claim to have traced the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the Muridke crackdown.
A senior official told Dawn that law enforcers had shared this information with AJK authorities and sought their help to nab the TLP leaders. The development follows speculation — fuelled by TLP circles — that their party chief was in custody.
The official said following the crackdown, several teams comprising senior officers from Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies had been tasked with tracking down the TLP chief and his brother.
He said Saad Rizvi and his brother were first spotted walking away from the protest camp in Muridke, and then fleeing on a motorbike.
At that time, an emergency message was circulated among the LEAs that a motorcycle rider carrying the TLP chief and his brother had moved towards nearby streets.
The three suspects, however, managed to dodge law enforcement personnel, any many rumours started to surface on social media regarding possible injury to them.
The officer said the special teams eventually traced the last location of the TLP leaders somewhere in AJK and sought the regional government’s help for their arrest.
It may be recalled that the Punjab government has formally sought the proscription of TLP and has sent a summary in this regard to the federal government.
Meanwhile, the Federal Inves­tigation Agency also traced nearly 95 bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, Saad Rizvi, the official said.
Of them, 15 were interest-bearing accounts, and the FIA was trying to get more details from the relevant banks to check the transactions made by the TLP chief, he added.
TLP seminaries
As a part of a wider crackdown on the radical outfit, the Punjab government also identified 61 seminaries run by the TLP across the province. The issue of these seminaries also came up during a meeting of Sunni clerics with the provincial authorities, as both sides discussed proposals about the fate of these institutions.
During the meeting, two proposals came under discussion to decide the future of these seminaries. It was suggested in the meeting that these seminaries be given under the administrative control of the Punjab Auqaf Department — this suggestion, however, was opposed by the majority of the participants who feared such a move would aggravate the situation. They said this action may create controversies in the future, particularly due to the huge financial expenses.
The second proposal pertained to handing over these seminaries to the moderate Sunni clerics – a move deemed workable. However, the authorities said in such a case, the clerics would run the TLP seminaries without the element of ‘militancy’. But a final decision on the fate of these seminaries is yet to be taken.
Meanwhile, the Multan district administration sealed 10 TLP seminaries and handed several over to the Auqaf department in line with the Punjab government’s orders. These seminaries were located in Multan, Shujabad, and Basti Malook.

• Urges overhaul of slow, debt-heavy climate finance system
ROME: Climate finance is being held back by bureaucracy rather than a lack of funds, Adviser to the Prime Minister Dr Syed Tauqir Shah told a global forum last week, stressing that frontline countries like Pakistan have been left struggling to access vital support.
Addressing the FAO’s Rome Water Dialogue, where he presented Pakistan’s national statement to an audience of leaders, ministers and civil society representatives, Dr Shah said, “Water crises are no longer an abstract policy discussion but an existential challenge for many countries in the Global South.”
 






He said Pakistan is among the wor­ld’s most climate-vulnerable nations and has now crossed the threshold into official water scarcity, with national food security threatened by extreme weather and chronic resource stress.
The crisis, he noted, manifests both as “devastating abundance” — the 2022 floods that affected over 33 million people, destroyed four million acres of crops and left 10 million without safe drinking water, with this year’s floods “equally catastrophic” — and as crippling scarcity, with total storage limited to about 30 days’ supply.
“Our need is clear and urgent: we require massive, timely investments in climate-resilient water infrastructure. This must be a mix of traditional, high-storage solutions alongside nature-based solutions like restoring floodplains, developing resilient irrigation techniques, and implementing watershed management,” he added.
Calling out the global climate finance institutions, Dr Tauqir said Pakistan requires an estimated $7-14 billion annually for adaptation efforts alone by 2030. “Yet, we are met with a global finance architecture that has turned the required investment into a paradox,” he said.
 
 

While building a case for reform of glo­bal climate finance institutions, he opined that the current global climate fund mechanism is characterised by critical failings that directly hamper our ability to invest and innovate in water resilience.
He said that despite the staggering national need, Pakistan has been unable to fully utilise available global climate funds because international criteria often demand highly specific, technically complex and “bankable” project proposals, requiring a level of institutional capacity that takes years to build.
He further highlighted that even once approved, funds are subject to slow disbursement rates and multi-year legal processes.
Criticising the climate finance modalities, Dr Shah said, “We find that the maximum available climate finance takes the form of debt and concessional loans, with only a small fraction available as grants.”
He lamented that debt is being loaded onto vulnerable economies that are already struggling with macroeconomic stability.
Citing the Green Climate Fund, he said the average time from concept to board approval is 24 months or more, and stressed that the first disbursement typically takes months after approval.
He referred to the GCF Independent Evaluation Unit’s finding that internal processes are “complex, fragmented and marked by bottlenecks”.
He said major climate funds are criticised by development experts for sluggish processing, excessive bureaucracy and disbursement delays.
“We call upon our global partners to shift the paradigm from an architecture of complexity and debt to one of speed and trust,” Dr Tauqir Shah said. “We need a financial innovation component which focuses on leveraging blended finance, green bonds, insurance mechanisms and incubation programmes to de-risk private investment and increase access to finance for smallholder farmers.”
While flagging the 2030 global development agenda, Dr Shah said, “The Sus­tainable Development Goals, especially SDG 6 (clean water) and SDG 2 (zero hunger), will remain beyond reach unless we confront this challenge head-on.”

Party officials said Pun­jab Chief Minister Mar­yam Nawaz also joined the meeting, where subjects such as the ongoing talks with Afgha­nistan, a crackdown against the TLP, as well as the forthcoming local government polls in Punjab also came under discussion.
According to reports, PM Shehbaz briefed his elder brother on the ongoing talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
During the meeting, Nawaz Sharif reaffirmed that “no one will be allowed to look at Pakistan with malicious intent”, adding that “Pakistan is our red line, and the sons of this nation are defending their motherland without regard for their own lives”.
Views were also excha­nged on the party’s strategy to ensure the victory of its candidates in the local government polls, following the Ele­ction Com­m­ission of Pak­istan’s decision to hold the long-delayed elections in December.
They said that as the first phase of the electoral exercise in which 9-member panels will be elected in each union council, will be party-less giving the winning candidates 30 days to join a political party of their preference, the meeting discussed holding the second phase of the polls in selected districts first where the PML-N has a strong following.
It was decided to take other party leaders onboard for selecting districts for the second phase of polls.
Separately, PM Shehbaz also met with Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the minister briefed the premier on the law and order situation in the country, as well as ongoing development projects in Islamabad.

• Remarks come as credit agencies, banks seek clarity on country’s security outlook
WASHINGTON: Cur­bing militancy is essential for financial stability, Fin­ance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said as he wrapped up a week-long visit to Washington.
Officials accompanying the minister to the World Bank and IMF annual meetings said the security-economy link surfaced repeatedly in many of the delegation’s 65 meetings during the seven-day visit.
“From credit rating agencies to commercial banks, everyone wanted to understand whether Pakistan’s security environment is now aligned with its economic recovery,” one official said.
In a media briefing, Mr Aurangzeb acknowledged that sustained stability and investor confidence depend on internal peace and political cohesion. “From a financial angle, this action is necessary,” he said, a rare admission that the country’s economic prospects are inseparable from its ability to curb extremism.
His remarks came at a time when Pakistan’s strategic significance is being increasingly recognised in world capitals. Under US President Donald Trump’s second term, Islamabad has regained Washington’s attention after years of estrangement.
 
 

Mr Trump’s unconventional approach has brought former adversaries into dialogue, and Pakistan has leveraged this moment adroitly.
Earlier this week, Mr Aurangzeb held an exclusive meeting with US Congressman French Hill, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee — the first time a Pakistani finance minister met the head of this key congressional panel.
Mr Aurangzeb used the meeting to stress the importance of enhancing economic ties between Pakistan and the US.
 






As the finance minister emphasised the link between geopolitics and economics, Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz told CNN that Pakistan’s ability to defend itself against a much larger adversary has impressed the US leader.
“Trump likes winners,” he said, noting that the US president sees the Pakistan army chief as “a winner who is willing to make quick decisions”.
That rapport, and the growing security cooperation — from rare earth exports to US arms sales — form a new strategic backdrop for Mr Aurangzeb’s economic diplomacy.
 
 

Michael Kugelman of the Asia Pacific Foundation added, “The current global moment does benefit Pakistan due to its geographic proximity to the Gulf and its close partnerships with key stakeholders there.”
Analysts say Washington’s renewed interest in Pakistan is shaped by both geopolitical convenience and economic opportunity.
Fiscal credibility
Against this evolving backdrop, Mr Aurangzeb’s Washington visit served to consolidate a narrative of fiscal stability and policy credibility. Pakistan’s credit ratings have improved, with Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global all upgrading their outlooks. The IMF’s recent staff-level agreement for a $1.2 billion disbursement further signalled institutional confidence in the country’s reform trajectory.
The IMF’s World Economic Outlook projected 3.6 per cent growth for FY2025, though it noted that the economic impact of this summer’s floods is still being assessed.
Still, global investors are beginning to return. Institutional funds, banks and advisory firms that had long viewed Pakistan as high-risk are reopening conversations — a shift attributed by senior officials to consistent fiscal signalling and a more stable security environment.
Privatisation
Mr Aurangzeb’s meetings with Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) and JP Morgan reflected a focus on diversification and modernisation of Pakistan’s financing instruments. He briefed ADCB executives on the launch of the Panda Bond and the refreshing of the Global Medium-Term Note (GMTN) programme.
At a news briefing, the minister expressed optimism about the accelerated privatisation of the national carrier and disclosed that the government was close to achieving financial close on the Reko Diq project. He urged ADCB to expand its participation in Pakistan’s financial markets and trade flows.
At JP Morgan, Mr Aurangzeb discussed the forthcoming Green Panda Bond in China and the federal cabinet’s approval of the government-to-government sale of First Women Bank to a UAE conglomerate.
He also emphasised emerging digital cooperation with Saudi Arabia through the GO AI Hub and growing US interest in the Reko Diq mining venture.

The minister assurance came while presiding over a meeting to address the bottlenecks faced by meat exporters in exporting meat to Malaysia.
The meeting was attended by secretary of industries and production, Saif Anjum, along with representatives from both the public and private sectors.
The meeting discussed issues and recommendations related to meat exports to Malaysia. Exp­orters identified main challenges including feed quality, livestock breed, high production costs, lack of cold chain facilities, limited banking support, and documentation hurdles.
Exporters emphasised that the banking sector is not providing adequate support, forcing them to make cash payments in cattle markets. They also highlighted the absence of cold storage facilities at airports, compelling them to store meat in vehicles.
Representative of meat exporters pointed out that while India exports meat at USD 3.5 per kilogramme, Pakistan’s export cost stands at USD 5 per kilogramme. They further said that Pakistan currently exports meat to Taji­kistan at the same rate. The minister acknowledged the concerns raised by exporters and affirmed that Pakistani meat is of superior quality and capable of competing in international markets.

Police said in a statement that terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)  — tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance.
However, it added, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement using the “latest technology”. As a result, the statement said, the terrorists couldn’t come near the police station and fled.
According to police, “residents from nearby areas also fired at the attackers” and helped law enforcers.
The statement did not mention any loss of lives or property in the incident, which was earlier confirmed by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan. He told Dawn.com that the attackers had used a hand grenade to target the police station.
“Unidentified attackers threw a hand grenade toward the police station, but it fell at a distance, causing no damage,” he said.
The RPO added that the attackers fled after the attempt and a search operation to hunt them was under way.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
On Friday night, police intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.
On Saturday, unkn­own assailants launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan’s
According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the FC personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident.</p><small>2025-10-19 19:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/19213757b1d63ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949961/govt-approves-2025-26-wheat-policy-says-there-will-be-no-restriction-on-inter-provincial-movement-of-the-crop' target='_blank'><strong>Govt approves 2025-26 wheat policy, says there will be no restriction on inter-provincial movement of the crop</strong></a><br><p>The government has approved the wheat policy for 2025-26, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Sunday, adding there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to ensure its availability across the country.
The development comes against the backdrop of the Punjab government tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a restrictive permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid soaring prices and wheat shortage there.
According to the PMO statement, a high-level meeting was held yesterday (Saturday) to discuss the 2025-26 wheat policy. It was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and attended by the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The statement said a representative of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM was also present at the meeting while the Azad Jammu and Kashmir PM and relevant stakeholders also attended the meeting.
It quoted PM Shehbaz as saying that Pakistan was an agricultural economy, for which wheat was of key importance.
“Wheat is not just a staple food item for the people of Pakistan but also the biggest source of earning for the farmers of the country,” he said, adding that the government was well aware of the difficulties of the farmers.
He assured that the all possible efforts were being made for the welfare of the farmers, the PMO statement said, further stating that the premier termed farmers the “backbone of the economy”.
PM Shehbaz told the participants of the meeting that the the government had consulted all stakeholders, including provincial governments, farmers’ associations and industrialists, over the wheat policy.
“We appreciate the cooperation of the provinces for this policy based on consensus,” PM Shehbaz stated.
He said the policy was aimed at safeguarding people’s interests while ensuring profits for farmers and hoped that it would contribute to progress in the agriculture sector.
The PM asserted that the policy would result in an increase farmers’ incomes and play an important role in in ensuring food security in the country.
According to the PMO statement, the meeting was told under the new policy, the federal and provincial governments would be able to acquire “strategic reserves of about 6.2 million tonnes” from wheat harvest in 2025-26.
It added that wheat would be procured at Rs3,500 per maund (40 kilogrammes), in accordance with the international import price.
“This measure will ensure market competitiveness along with fair prices and profits for farmers,” the PMO statement said, citing the briefing given to the meeting.
It further stated that the national food security would head committee, which would oversee the policy’s implementation. It would include representatives from all provinces and and meet every week, the statement said, adding that it would directly report to the prime minister.
According to the statement, the meeting’s participants were assured that fair pricing would be ensured for farmers and the government would by sufficient stock to ensure their security as well as “stable reserves”.</p><small>2025-10-19 19:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629430-pakistani-smuggler-jailed-for-40-years-after-shipping-ballistic-missile-parts-from-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani smuggler jailed for 40 years after shipping ballistic missile parts from Iran</strong></a><br><p>

England had posted a competitive 288-8 thanks to Heather Knight’s century and held their nerve in the field to defend it, despite their bowling, usually their strong suit, being a touch off colour.
 






India looked to be cruising towards victory, needing just 62 runs off the last 10 overs with seven wickets in hand. But the dismissal of Smriti Mandhana turned the tide, as scoreboard pressure crept in and dot balls piled up. Soon after, Richa Ghosh and Deepti Sharma departed in quick succession, leaving the tail high and dry.
Reckless batting cost India dear. Mandhana’s downfall opened the floodgates when she danced down the track to left-arm spinner Linsey Smith but failed to clear long-off. Then, after reaching her half-century, Deepti Sharma perished trying to take on Sophie Ecclestone, a slog sweep that found deep mid-wicket to perfection. From there, the writing was on the wall.
“We probably needed 300, but we did well to pull things back and I’m very happy. Didn’t contribute much in the last couple of games, so it felt good to come up with a match-winning hundred,” said Knight, whose classy 109 off 91 balls, laced with 15 fours and a six, was the backbone of England’s innings.
England’s openers gave them a brisk start with 73 runs for the first wicket before Knight joined captain Nat Sciver-Brunt in a 113-run stand that kept the scoreboard ticking.
At one stage, England looked set to go past 300, but Knight’s run out attempting a second run triggered a slowdown, as India tightened the screws and conceded only 74 runs in the final 10 overs. Deepti Sharma was the pick of the bowlers, finishing with four wickets.
It was India’s third successive defeat, leaving their next clash against New Zealand a virtual knockout. With both teams locked on four points, it’s a case of do or die to stay in the hunt for the last semi-final berth, with Australia, England and South Africa already safely through.
England, meanwhile, have been clinical, through to the semis with two games in hand. They sit second on the table with nine points, level with defending champions Australia, separated only by a whisker in Net Run Rate.
“Not sure how we lost this game. We had it in the bag. We’ve worked so hard and when the last five overs slip away from you, it’s heartbreaking. This is the third straight game we’ve lost after coming so close,” lamented India captain Harmanpreet Kaur.</p><small>2025-10-19 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1922520051acfad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949968/manchester-united-stretch-liverpool-losing-streak-to-four-games' target='_blank'><strong>Manchester United stretch Liverpool losing streak to four games</strong></a><br><p>Liverpool slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time in 11 years as Manchester United won 2-1 on Sunday to end their near decade-long wait for victory at Anfield.
Harry Maguire’s 84th-minute header secured back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time in Ruben Amorim’s tenure as United boss.
Twelve minutes from time, Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo’s opener after just 61 seconds.
Defeat leaves Liverpool four points adrift of Arsenal at the top of the table and Arne Slot still searching for answers in how to get the right blend after splashing out nearly £450 million ($604 million) on new players in the transfer market.
United close to within two points of their historic rivals and up to ninth in the table to ease the pressure on Amorim after his biggest win in nearly a year in charge.
Liverpool had only lost one of the previous 14 Premier League meetings between the sides and United had not tasted victory at Anfield since the early days of Jurgen Klopp’s reign in January 2016.
However, the Reds are in a state of flux after transforming the squad that stormed to the title last season and the tragic loss of Diogo Jota, who died in a car accident in July.
After three consecutive defeats for the first time in Slot’s reign, Liverpool could barely have imagined a worse start.
Mbeumo sped past Virgil van Dijk with ease before firing past Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo’s pass after barely a minute.
The home side and support were furious that play was not stopped in the build-up after Alexis MacAllister went down with a head injury, inflicted by his own captain Van Dijk.
Slot left £100 million signing Florian Wirtz on the bench for the second consecutive game as he looked in vain to find the right balance between defence and attack.
Gakpo should have levelled for the defending champions when he hit the post from Mohamed Salah’s through ball in Liverpool’s one flowing move of the first half.
However, it was United who should have been further in front by half-time.
Bruno Fernandes spurned a glorious chance to double the Red Devils’ lead when he hit the outside of the post when unmarked from the edge of the area.
At the other end, Senne Lammens was rarely troubled in the first 45 minutes, but produced a big save when called upon to deny Alexander Isak his first Premier League goal since joining Liverpool for a British transfer record £125 million.
A Gakpo deflected cross then came back off the post and the Dutchman rattled the woodwork for a third time early in the second half.
Slot turned to his near £200 million in forward options off the bench as Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike were introduced on the hour mark to join Salah, Gakpo and Isak in a five-man attack.
Salah has scored more goals than any other player in this fixture, but his lack of form showed in a wild finish to slice wide with just Lammens to beat at the back post.
Liverpool’s wealth of attacking talent finally broke the door down when Federico Chiesa, who had replaced Isak moments earlier, drilled in a low cross that Gakpo converted from point blank range.
Yet, their defensive frailties meant parity only lasted six minutes as Maguire was left unmarked to head in Fernandes’s looping cross.
Gakpo should still have rescued a point when he headed wide with the goal gaping from Jeremie Frimpong’s inviting delivery.
But Liverpool fell to their first league defeat at Anfield in over a year in another blow to their hopes of usurping United with a record 21st English top-flight title.</p><small>2025-10-19 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/191917017424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949953/lahore-ranks-second-most-polluted-city-in-world-in-terms-of-air-quality' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ranks second most polluted city in world in terms of air quality</strong></a><br><p>Lahore was ranked the second most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality on Sunday, according to air quality monitoring platform IQAir.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”.
The AQI reading for Lahore stood at a very unhealthy 189; it was just beaten by Delhi, which registered a reading of 212 around 7:30pm.
 


Additionally, levels of the pollutant PM2.5 were measured at 109 microgrammes per cubic metre of air (μg/m³), 21.8 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual PM2.5 guidelines.
PM2.5 particles are floating particulate matter in the air measuring 2.5 micrometres in diameter or less, according to IQAir. PM2.5 is so small that it can be absorbed into the bloodstream upon inhalation.
IQAir recommended on its website that residents in Lahore avoid outdoor exercise, run air purifiers and prioritise wearing masks. It also recommended closing all windows to avoid dirty air from outdoors.
Lahore has historically dealt with smog and poor air quality in the winter months.
Around this time last year, the air quality in Lahore was recorded at 394 amid the smog crisis, primarily fuelled by crop residue burning and industrial emissions. The smog caused widespread health issues among residents, including coughing, breathing difficulties, eye irritation and skin infections.
To combat smog this year, the Punjab government has introduced ‘smog guns’, with Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb stating that they were already in use across Lahore.
“Through this modern machine, tiny droplets of water are sprayed into the air to combat smog,“ she explained. “The water mist helps clean pollution and dust particles present in the atmosphere. This modern machinery is also being used in countries like China, India, and others to reduce smog.”</p><small>2025-10-19 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629386-fc-arrests-afghan-suicide-bomber-during-raid-in-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>FC arrests 'Afghan suicide bomber' during raid in South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>
