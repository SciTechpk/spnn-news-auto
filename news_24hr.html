With this latest accomplishment, he becomes the first Pakistani in history to complete all 14 of the world’s 8,000-metre peaks — commonly referred to as the eight-thousanders — without any oxygen support, a feat achieved by only a handful of elite mountaineers globally.
Sirbaz had earlier become the first Pakistani climber to have summited all 14 mountains with the height of over 8,000m in the world in October last year.
 






Imagine Nepal, the tour organisers of Sirbaz in a statement congratulated the climber, saying, “ We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Mr Sirbaz Khan — our dear friend, client, and partner from Pakistan — on his incredible achievement of summiting Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, without supplemental oxygen this morning, May 18, 2025.
Alpine Club of Pakistan Secretary Karrar Haidri, said, “With this summit, Sirbaz Khan becomes the first Pakistani to climb all 14 highest peaks without oxygen.
“Sirbaz Khan has made the entire nation proud. Completing all 14 eight-thousanders without oxygen is a rare and heroic achievement. He is a symbol of Pakistani resilience, skill, and courage on the highest peaks of the world,” he added.
Sirbaz achieved a landmark in the history of high-altitude climbing by successfully summiting Mt. Kangchenjunga this morning at 5:00am local time (4:15am PKT).
What makes this feat extraordinary is that Sirbaz scaled the world’s third-highest mountain without the use of supplementary oxygen, in true alpine style — marking a defining moment in Pakistan’s mountaineering legacy.
Sirbaz’s journey to this historic milestone has spanned over a decade of determination, discipline, and sheer courage. He has successfully scaled the following 14 peaks over 8,000m — all without bottled oxygen:

Everest (8,848m)
K2 (8,611m)
Kangchenjunga (8,586m)
Lhotse (8,516m)
Makalu (8,485m)
Cho Oyu (8,188m)
Dhaulagiri (8,167m)
Manaslu (8,163m)
Nanga Parbat (8,126m)
Annapurna I (8,091m)
Gasherbrum I (8,080m)
Broad Peak (8,051m)
Gasherbrum II (8,035m)
Shishapangma (8,027m)

This record-breaking summit of Mt. Kangchenjunga not only cements Sirbaz Khan’s place among the greatest mountaineers of all time but also brings immense pride to the people of Pakistan, particularly the mountaineering community of Gilgit-Baltistan, where Sirbaz hails from.
His accomplishment was made in the spirit of pure alpine climbing — minimal gear, no fixed ropes or camps set by Sherpas, and no oxygen support — a style that represents the truest and most demanding form of mountaineering.
Sirbaz’s mission has always been to represent Pakistan on the world’s highest stages and inspire the next generation of climbers to follow his path with the same passion and perseverance.
Sirbaz, 35, hails from the Aliabad area of Hunza in Gilgit-Baltistan and began his climbing career in 2016.
On four of these expeditions, he had been accompanied by late Muhammad Ali Sadpara.
Before setting on the mission to summit Dhaulagiri peak last year, he had said: “I am looking forward to his expedition and reaching closer to the dream of my mentor Ali Sadpara, who had the similar dream of scaling the 14 highest peaks, but tragically lost his life earlier this year during a winter expedition on K2.”
Pakistani climbers including Naila Kiani, Sajid Sadpara, civil society members, and politicians have congratulated Sirbaz for his historical feat.</p><small>2025-05-18 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1813071510dc4ab.png?r=130955' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911773/several-held-in-india-over-alleged-links-to-pakistan-remarks-on-military-officers' target='_blank'><strong>Several held in India over alleged links to Pakistan, remarks on military officers</strong></a><br><p>Indian police have arrested multiple people in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi —including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan and comments pertaining to the recent escalation between the two countries, Indian media reported on Sunday.
The development follows a military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Haryana’s Ashoka University, was picked up from his home in Delhi for his comments about the Indian army’s press briefings on its actions targeting Pakistan, termed as “Operation Sindoor”.
The complaint against Mahmudabad was filed by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, in Haryana’s Sonepat district, the academic’s lawyer confirmed to Scroll.
Mahmudabad was arrested under offences pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, making assertions likely to cause disharmony, inciting secession, armed rebellion or subversive activities and insulting religious beliefs.
In a social media post on May 8, Mahmudabad, the head of the university’s political science department, had highlighted the apparent irony of right-wing Hindutva commentators praising Colonel Sofia Qureshi, who had addressed the media briefings.
He wrote: “Perhaps they could also equally loudly demand that the victims of mob lynching, arbitrary bulldozing and others who are victims of the BJP’s hate mongering be protected as Indian citizens.
“The optics of two women soldiers presenting their findings is importantly [sic] but optics must translate to reality on the ground otherwise it’s just hypocrisy,” Mahmudabad noted.
“The grassroots reality that common Muslims face is different from what the government tried to show but at the same time the press conference shows that an India, united in its diversity, is not completely dead as an idea,” he further said.
 
 

The Haryana State Commission interpreted his remarks as “an attempt to vilify national military actions”, the Hindustan Times reported.
The Haryana State Commission for Women had taken suo motu cognisance of his remarks on Col Qureshi, saying they undermined women officers in the Indian armed forces and fomented communal discord.
ThePrint, in an editorial, said: “The vicious hounding and egregious arrest of Ali Khan Mahmudabad for expressing his opinion is a shameful insult to our millennia-old democratic tradition.
“His argument about war and domestic politics is a constitutional freedom. As is your right to disagree. Calling it an insult to women or military is senseless.”
Separately, Indian police have arrested travel vlogger Jyoti Malhotra along with five others from Punjab and Haryana over alleged espionage for Pakistan, according to Indian media.
Malhotra, a 33-year-old from Haryana’s Hisar district who runs the YouTube channel ‘Travel With Jo’, was detained under India’s Official Secrets Act 1923 for allegedly “transmitting sensitive information to Pakistani operatives”, according to India News Network (INN).
 
 

According to the FIR, she came into contact with the alleged Pakistani operative two years ago and visited Pakistan twice, The Hindu reported.
Dawn.com has reached out to the Foreign Office for a comment on the claims.
Malhotra had uploaded videos on her YouTube channel of her visits to renowned Sikh sites Gurdwara Darbar Sahib and Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Pakistan’s Punjab, with the latest published in March 2025.
According to the Minority Rights Group, Sikhs have a “significant” presence in Haryana and form a majority in Punjab.
The vlogger’s father, who retired from the Haryana electricity department, denied the allegations and said her daughter was being implicated, The Hindu added.
Those arrested with Malhotra included a security guard, a university student and civilians alleged to have “received money or instructions from Pakistani contacts”, according to INN.
Among the suspects are Guzala from Malerkotla in Punjab and her “friend” Banu Nasreena, who were granted Pakistani visas in April 2025, the report claimed.
Also named in the case is Arman from Haryana’s Nuh district, who allegedly provided Indian SIM cards and transferred money on behalf of the operatives.
In another crackdown, Assam Police, acting on army intelligence, arrested seven people and busted a racket allegedly using fake SIM cards to share sensitive information with “Pakistani agents”, Times of India reported.
Other than those seven, 14 were under interrogation.
 
 

Times of India quoted Assam police chief Harmeet Singh as saying that police teams were dispatched to Telangana’s Hyderabad as well as cities in Rajasthan and Assam.
Saddik, Arif Khan, and Sajid were arrested in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur and Alwar, while Akeek was taken into custody at the airport in Assam’s Guwahati, Singh said.
Arsad was arrested at the New Delhi airport, Mofijul in Telangana, Jakariya in Assam’s Bilasipara town, Time of India reported.
Pakistani journalists take reports with a grain of salt
On the other side of the border, Pakistani journalists and commentators have cast doubts on the reports by Indian media, which aired multiple fake news stories during the recent tensions between the two countries.
 
 

A New York Times article yesterday also highlighted how Indian media “amplified falsehoods”, noting that “anchors and commentators became cheerleaders for war”.
Journalist Hamid Mir, while responding to an Indian user who shared videos of her blog and accused her of being a spy, wrote on his X account that Malhotra “was not spying and only making a video for her YouTube channel”.
“Spies don’t make videos for public use […] they make secret videos for secret use. Pakistan doesn’t need these kind of spies.”
 






Another Pakistani journalist, Ammara Ahmed, wrote: “Jyoti Malhotra deserves a good lawyer and a fair trial.”
 






Journalist Ailia Zehra, who covers politics and human rights, described the entire episode as “ridiculous”.
“What state secrets could a YouTuber possibly have? Ridiculous,” she wrote.
 






Podcaster Shehzad Ghias Shaikh noted: “The message is quite clear, no Indian content creator is to have any interaction with Pakistan or they will be penalised.

A high-level delegation from Pakistan, led by the federal minister, participated in the Kazan Forum organised under the auspices of the Russian Federation in the capital of Tatarstan.
“Gwadar Port has already started shipment and cargo services, while Pakistan intends to facilitate Central Asia’s access to warm waters,” Radio Pakistan quoted the minister as saying while addressing the closing session.
Aleem said the Mazar-i-Sharif to Kohat Railway Project is expected to cost around $633 million. He spoke about Pakistan’s strategic plans to connect Karachi, Quetta and Gwadar cities with Central Asia and Europe through road networks.
The minister welcomed the holding of the Kazan Forum and reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment to playing an active role in regional development.
On the opening day on Friday, while addressing the session on Cultural Dialogue, the minister emphasised that Pakistan possesses a rich historical and social heritage, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
He welcomed cultural exchanges with Russia and Central Asian states, terming such initiatives a positive and promising step towards achieving a peaceful world and paving the way for harmony.
Aleem underscored the importance of preserving multifaceted cultural heritage and stressed that through mutual dialogue and understanding, the world can become more peaceful, diverse and harmonious.
He appreciated the organisation of the ‘Russia-Islamic World Kazan Forum 2025’ and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to playing an active role in the region, particularly in the communications sector, to enhance trade and strengthen the national economy.
On the sidelines of the forum, the minister held a meeting with the chairman of Dubai Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. They discussed matters related to shipping and cargo logistics between Pakistan and Dubai ports.
Aleem highlighted Pakistan’s keen interest in ‘North to South’ land connectivity and noted that the country is modernising its communications infrastructure. He mentioned that in the first phase, the use of M-Tag has been made mandatory for toll collection on motorways and highways.
The chairman of the Dubai ports expressed strong interest in expanding bilateral trade relations and deliberated on various projects, including investing in Pakistan’s M6, M9, and N-25 Highways.
Both sides discussed the broader agenda of the Kazan Forum and expressed their commitment to enhancing future cooperation and strengthening bilateral relations.</p><small>2025-05-18 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/181526163421a56.jpg?r=155921' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911785/pope-leo-urges-unity-for-divided-church-vows-not-to-be-autocrat' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Leo urges unity for divided Church, vows not to be ‘autocrat’</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo XIV formally began his reign on Sunday by reaching out to conservatives who felt orphaned under his predecessor, calling for unity, vowing to preserve the Catholic Church’s heritage and not rule like “an autocrat”.
After a first ride in the popemobile before tens of thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square, Leo was formally installed as the 267th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church and sovereign monarch of Vatican City at an outdoor Mass.
Well-wishers in the crowd waved US and Peruvian flags, with people from both countries claiming him as the first pope from their nations.
Born in Chicago, the 69-year-old pontiff spent many years as a missionary in Peru and also has Peruvian citizenship.
Crowds chanted “Viva il Papa” (Long Live the Pope) and “Papa Leone”, his name in Italian, as his distinctive, open-topped popemobile weaved around St. Peter’s Square.
Robert Prevost, a relative unknown on the world stage who only became a cardinal two years ago, was elected pope on May 8 after a short conclave of cardinals that lasted barely 24 hours.
He succeeded Francis, an Argentine, who died on April 21 after leading the Church for 12 often turbulent years during which he battled with traditionalists and championed the poor and marginalised.
US Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert who clashed with Francis over the White House’s hardline immigration policies, led a US delegation alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also Catholic.
Vance briefly shook hands with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the start of the ceremony. The two men last met in February in the White House, when they clashed fiercely in front of the world’s media.
In his sermon, read in fluent Italian, Leo said that as leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics, he would not shrink before modern challenges and that, at least on social issues such as combating poverty and protecting the environment, he would continue the legacy of Pope Francis.
Leo said the cardinals who elected him had chosen someone “capable of preserving the rich heritage of the Christian faith and, at the same time, looking to the future, in order to confront the questions, concerns and challenges of today’s world”.
Appeal for unity
Francis’ papacy left a divided Church, with conservatives accusing him of sowing confusion, particularly with his extemporaneous remarks on issues of sexual morality such as same-sex unions.
Saying he was taking up his mission “with fear and trembling”, Leo used the words “unity” or “united” seven times and the word “harmony” four times.
“It is never a question of capturing others by force, by religious propaganda or by means of power. Instead, it is always and only a question of loving, as Jesus did,” he said, in an apparent reference to a war of words between Catholics who define themselves as conservative or progressive.
“Brothers and sisters, I would like that our first great desire be for a united Church, a sign of unity and communion, which becomes a leaven for a reconciled world,” he said.
Conservatives also accused Francis of ruling in a heavy-handed way and lamented that he belittled their concerns and did not consult widely before making decisions.
Referring to St. Peter, the 1st century Christian apostle from whom popes derive their authority, Leo said: “Peter must shepherd the flock without ever yielding to the temptation to be an autocrat, lording it over those entrusted to him. On the contrary, he is called to serve the faith of his brothers and sisters, and to walk alongside them.”
Underscoring the unbroken lineage of popes from St. Peter, the choir chanted the traditional hymn “Tu es Petrus”, Latin for “You are Peter”.
Many world leaders attended the ceremony, including the presidents of Peru, Israel and Nigeria, the prime ministers of Italy, Canada and Australia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. European royals also took their place in the VIP seats near the main altar, including Spanish King Felipe and Queen Letizia.
As part of the ceremony, Leo received two symbolic items: a liturgical vestment known as a pallium, a sash of lambswool representing his role as a shepherd, and the “fisherman’s ring”, recalling the first pope, St. Peter, who was a fisherman.
The ceremonial gold signet ring is specially cast for each new pope and can be used by Leo to seal documents, although this purpose has fallen out of use in modern times. It shows St. Peter holding the keys to Heaven and will be broken after his death or resignation.</p><small>2025-05-18 10:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605044-first-in-pakistan-sirbaz-khan-scales-all-8000m-peaks-without-supplemental-oxygen' target='_blank'><strong>First in Pakistan, Sirbaz Khan scales all 8,000m peaks without supplemental oxygen</strong></a><br><p>

The large blaze broke out in the early hours of the day in a three-storey building which houses a jewellery store.
A statement from the fire disaster response emergency and civil defence department in southern Telangana state, where Hyderabad is located, said they had received the call for help just after 6am local time (5:30am PKT).
“The fire broke out on the ground floor and spread to the upper floors. Firefighting, search & rescue operations were carried out simultaneously,” it said.
The statement also listed the names of 17 individuals who lost their lives.
“The suspected cause of the fire is under investigation,” it said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his “deep grief” over the loss of life and announced compensation of 200,000 rupees (around $2,300) to the next of kin of each victim.
“Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to a fire tragedy in Hyderabad, Telangana,” Modi said in a statement released by his office.
“Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon.”
Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.
Last month, a fierce fire broke out in a hotel in Kolkata, killing at least 15 people. Some people clambered out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.
And last year, least 24 people died after a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat.</p><small>2025-05-18 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1814050408e7385.jpg?r=140744' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911673/hbl-psl-2025-warner-inspired-karachi-kings-upstage-peshawar-zalmi-to-make-playoffs' target='_blank'><strong>HBL PSL 2025: Warner-inspired Karachi Kings upstage Peshawar Zalmi to make playoffs</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: Babar Azam played a masterpiece here at a jam-packed Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday. But the captain’s knock could not help Peshawar Zalmi cross the line thanks to an imposing total put up by Karachi Kings.
Babar’s 49-ball 94 — studded with 10 fours and four sixes — was the standout innings of the high-scoring match in which Zalmi sought to overhaul the 238-run target as the HBL Pakistan Super League X resumed with a bang after a nine-day hiatus due to military clashes between India and Pakistan.
But despite Babar’s show, Zalmi fell short by 23 runs in the end with the victory securing Kings a spot in the playoffs.
 


Zalmi, on the other hand, will now need to beat Lahore Qalandars in their last league stage match to make the playoffs.
The drone strike by India very close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium last week seems to have only rejuvenated the tournament, with great fanfare and renewed fervor marking the PSL’s resumption.
Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir, Inter-Services Public Relations director general Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi were all present at the stadium to witness and encourage the spirited crowd.
Before the start of match, the national anthem was played and tributes were paid to the martyrs of Pakistan’s recent military conflict with India.
The ceremony also featured fireworks as national flags dotted the stadium. Soon, there were fireworks from the Kings thanks largely due to captain David Warner and James Vince.
Kings, who were put into bat, had a disastrous start to their innings when pacer Luke Wood cleaned up Ben McDermott on the very first ball of the match with a slightly short ball that nipped back sharply.
But Vince joined Warner to resurrect the innings and in the process helped Kings cross 50-mark in five overs. After Warner welcomed part-time spinner Saim for a couple of fours on the off-side in the second over, right-handed Vince belted three fours in the fourth bowled by pacer Ali Raza. Vince in the next over struck a six over deep square leg and a four while Warner contributed a boundary as medium-pacer Ahmed Daniyal started off with an 18-run over.
Kings collected 57-1 in the powerplay.
Warner and Vince continued to trouble Zalmi bowlers after the powerplay. While Warner smashed a six off leg-spinner Arif Yaqoob in the eighth over, both the batters took a boundary each off Ali in the next over. Vince completed his half-century off just 29 balls as he pulled Arif for a boundary lifting Kings to a solid 100-1 at the halfway stage.
Ahmed in the 11th over conceded 14 runs as Warner hit him for back-to-back fours while Vince collected a boundary with a straight shot. Warner got to his half-century off 31 balls with a four in the 12th over by Hussain Talat.
Warner in the 13th over thumped Saim for a four with a reverse sweep before lifting him for a six on the on-side. Vince’s straight four made it a richer.
Hussain was walloped for three fours by Warner in the 14th as Kings crossed 150 in 13.4 overs.
Vince’s superb 42-ball 72 — laced with 11 fours and a six — was finally ended in the 15th over by Ali who induced the batter to play a faster ball that nibbled away as wicket-keeper Haris took the catch. The dismissal ended a marathon 162-run partnership off 89 balls.
Wood dismissed Irfan Khan Niazi who was caught by Babar at long-on in the 16th as Kings slumped to 165-3.
After making 86 off 50, Warner was caught by Saim on the mid-wicket boundary off Arif in the 17th over. The southpaw struck 11 fours and two sixes.
From 167-4, Khushdil Shah (43 not off 15) and Mohammad Nabi (26 not out off 10) steered Kings to a massive 237-4 adding 70 runs off just 25 balls.
Zalmi made a brisk start to the chase that included back-to-back fours by Saim off paceman Hasan Ali in the third over, Mohammad Haris (nine) in an attempt to play a lofted shot was caught by James Vince off paceman Hasan Ali in the same over.
At 30-1 in the third over, entered Babar. Saim and Babar helped their team post 59-1 in the powerplay as the former in a ramp shot lifted pacer Abbas Afridi for a six over fine leg.
Both the batters got reprieve. In the fifth over, Babar was dropped by Abbas at third man off fast bowler Mir Hamza in the fifth over while Saim got a life in the ninth over when wicket-keeper Saad Baig failed to grab a high ball off Hasan Ali.
Saim and Babar added 77 off 47 balls before the former was sent back to the pavilion by Abbas in the 11th over, caught by Vince. The left-hander made 47 off 31 balls with the aid of five fours and a couple of sixes.
Tom Kohler-Cadmore played a 15-ball cameo of 20 before getting caught by Warner at point off pacer Mir Hamza in the 17th over. This ended a 62-run stand between Kohler-Cadmore and Babar. Max Bryant (seven) soon followed as the asking rate touched an almost-impossible 22-plus.
When Babar was run out while trying to take a second run in the 18th over, it was all over for Zalmi.
Maaz Sadaqat and Hussain Talat tried hard but it was too little too late as Zalmi ended their innings at 214-5.

• Clashes in exam schedules caused by numerous subjects offered by the board, claims Cambridge representative
KARACHI: With several examples of clash of paper schedules in the current Cambridge exams, students and parents have been demanding a revision in their date sheets as it is putting extra pressure on the candidates who then have to sit for two exams, sometimes even three, in one day.
Besides the mental stress, students have also been complaining of their hands getting tired while sitting for back-to-back exams. Their parents, too, are saying that they drop everything to be available for their children during exam time. They wait in the sitting areas outside exam centres during every paper and when there are two papers, they have to be there for the entire day.
“We are paying lacs of rupees for the exams. The least that Cambridge can do for us is listen to us and see our plight and reschedule the exams where there are any such clashes of papers taking place on the same day,” said one parent.
Some private school associations have also raised their voices over this matter in the hope that the Cambridge management in Pakistan would pay some heed.
Academic and activist Kashif Mirza, who is the president of All Pakistan Private Schools Federation (APPSF) was of the opinion that Pakistanis are paying billions to Cambridge as these are expensive exams. Cambridge should at least be considerate enough to not put so much stress on the candidates despite taking so much money from them.
 
 

“You also have the poor parents sitting outside exam centres. And when the children are appearing in two or more papers in a day, it means double duty for the parents,” he pointed out.
“Besides, two exams in one day means that a candidate cannot do justice to both the subjects he or she is appearing in,” he added.
“My request to Cambridge under these circumstances is that since they are making so much money here at our expense, they should at least upgrade their infrastructure instead of stressing out the candidates just because they couldn’t come up with a better schedule.
“They should keep a cushion of days in their exam schedules to address the clash of subjects,” he suggested, adding that such issues of paper clashes in exam schedules are usually seen happening in South Asian countries, not in Europe where Cambridge follows a different strategy.
“Cambridge needs an overhaul here. They should design a software, maybe using AI, if they can’t do it themselves, to come up with better exam schedules. In this day and age, students are also sitting for their exams online. Such mechanisms should also be developed and introduced by Cambridge,” said the APPSF president.
Cambridge International’s Country Director Uzma Yusuf, meanwhile, said that they are the biggest exam board in the world, which comes with plenty of responsibility. “We are not deliberately putting undue pressure on students,” she said.
“We are there in some 160 countries of the world. It is a huge responsibility. We are the Cambridge University’s exam board. The clashes in exam schedules happen due to there being so many subjects on offer by Cambridge,” she said.
 
 

“Besides,” she said, “there is a general perception here in Pakistan that every paper is of a duration of three hours only but there are also Cambridge exams which may be of durations of 40 minutes or maybe one hour and 10 minutes.”
“So a student is not sitting in the examination hall for three hours in the morning and coming back for another three hours in the afternoon,” she said.
“Where there may be a clash between papers, a student may sit for his or her morning paper, take a break, rest, have something to eat or drink under centre supervision and then sit for the other paper,” she said.

The matter was pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Rafaqat Ali, father of Shakeel Tanoli, had lodged FIR with the Khanna Police Station, Islamabad on June 19, 2022.
A local court of Islamabad had acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed Khan in February.
As per the FIR, a Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) allegedly driven by the daughter of the Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed Khan ran over two Savour Foods workers near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway at midnight and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.

Victim’s father says he lodged FIR out of misunderstanding

As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague Hasnain Ali were going home after the work when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
While the judge’s family reportedly reached a settlement with the family of Hasnain Ali, Rafaqat Ali vowed to pursue the case legally.
Rafaqat Ali has now changed his mind and stated in the affidavit that he nominated Shanzay Malik because of misunderstanding.
He further stated that he verified with different sources and found that neither Ms Malik nor anyone from his family was involved in the incident.
“Subsequently, I am withdrawing the appeal in this case and have no objection over her acquittal in the case.”
According to the details brought to the judicial record, the woman fled, leaving behind the vehicle.
The police took the vehicle into custody, which was later given to an official of the Lahore High Court on ‘superdari’ in July 2024 upon assurance that ‘he shall produce the vehicle in the court as and when required’.
In July 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the Islamabad High Court (IHC) that the luxury vehicle of the Lahore High Court (LHC) involved in hit and run case in which two persons were killed was driven by a woman and was in the use of Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed, who was elevated to the Supreme Court after the incident.
In February this year, judge’s daughter Shanzay Malik was acquitted by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.
Advocate Siddique Awan, counsel for Ms Malik, argued before the court that police could not produce any substantial evidence as the entire story of prosecution was based on secondary facts.
He argued that the case was registered 11 days after the accident, and the police could not give any explanation for the delay. He contended that the police could not produce any video evidence, and the photos submitted in the court did not clearly identify his client.
He also pointed out that Shanzay Malik was nominated only after the plaintiff’s delayed statement in July 2024.
Earlier, reports indicated that Ms Malik had been granted pre-arrest bail after being on the run for more than two years.
Legal proceedings saw the deletion of Section 322 of the Pakistan Penal Code (causing death by rash or negligent driving), which is a non-bailable offence, and replacing it with Section 320 (causing death without intent), a bailable offence.
Rafaqat Ali has challenged the acquittal order before the Islamabad High Court.
Following submission of the affidavit, IHC Justice Mohammad Asif dismissed the appeal against acquittal.

• Experts say drivers often lack patience, refuse to give way to others
• Law enforcement, public awareness stressed to tackle rising accidents
KARACHI: Amid a sharp rise in accidents mostly involving heavy vehicles resulting in deaths of hundreds of people in Karachi in recent months, officers of law enforcement agencies, healthcare providers and civil society members have stressed the need for strict implementation of traffic laws, their awareness among the public and sought urgent reforms in road infrastructure and safety systems in the metropolis.
They were speaking at a seminar, “Road Traffic Accidents in Karachi: Causes and Solutions”, which was organised at the Arts Council of Pakistan by its Medical and Social Welfare Committee here on Saturday.
The event started with a presentation by Ali Suhag, in charge of Sindh Police Accident Analysis Research Centre (SPAARC). He pointed out that education and information about traffic laws were key elements in prevention of accidents, but 98 per cent of people only knew how to operate vehicles and lacked basic knowledge of rights of others on the road, traffic rules and safe and responsible driving practices.
Mr Suhag also highlighted behavioural issues and said that drivers often lack patience and refuse to give way to others, even in emergencies.
 
 

He also criticised the common refusal to wear helmets and gave the example of a case where a man told him that his son avoided wearing helmet because it “ruins his hairstyle”. Such attitudes reflected a dangerous ignorance that must be addressed through consistent education and law enforcement, he concluded.
Dr Sabir Memon of the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma asked citizens to act responsibly and highlighted the global impact of traffic accidents.
“Around 1.3 million people die each year in road accidents worldwide, with most incidents occurring in middle-income countries,” he said.
About Karachi, Dr Memon said that a sharp rise in accident cases had been seen lately. “Previously, we received about 100 cases daily, but now that number has grown to nearly 150 per day,” he said, adding that two-thirds of the victims were motorcyclists, many of whom were young boys and teenagers.
He also spoke about the serious consequences of such accidents and pointed out that many accident victims were sole breadwinners of their families who suffered life-altering injuries and then were unable to return to work.
 
 

Those injuries didn’t just affect individuals; they impacted entire families and caused social and economic loss and burden of healthcare sector, he said.
Speaking on the occasion, DIG-Traffic Pir Mohammad Shah said that while law enforcement was a key issue, public awareness of traffic laws was equally important.  Providing statistics, he said that 55pc of road accident victims were motorcyclists, 32pc pedestrians and the rest involved cars and other vehicles.
He then outlined multiple causes behind road accidents, which included over-speeding, lack of lane discipline and the absence of a proper system to monitor the load carried by heavy vehicles.
He said overloaded trucks without under-run bars, side under-run rails or guards often led to fatal accidents, especially when motorcyclists were run over during collisions.
The officer also pointed out that motorcyclists overtaking from the left side of heavy vehicles was a major contributor to such accidents.
He also raised concerns about the mental and physical fitness of heavy vehicle drivers, which he said was currently under investigation.
DIG Shah noted that the shortage of traffic signals was another major issue. That was primarily due to insufficient funding for the Traffic Engineering Bureau. He added that efforts were underway to make the department more autonomous in the near future.
 
 

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Qaisar Sajjad said that up to 207 deaths had been reported in the city so far this year, most of which involved heavy vehicles.
He said lack of law enforcement, poor infrastructure such as broken roads and weak coordination between departments were significant problems. There were also widespread encroachments on roads and footpaths which left no space for pedestrians and created serious hazards, he added.
He emphasised that these issues must be urgently addressed to reduce the rising number of traffic-related fatalities.
Faisal Edhi of the Edhi Foundation also spoke.

The court turned down the application moved by suspect Natasha Danish after hearing arguments from both sides and announced that she will be indicted in the case on June 21.
Initially, the suspect was booked and arrested for recklessly driving the Toyota Land Cruiser and killing 60-year-old Imran Arif and his 22-year-old daughter, Amna, and wounding three others in an accident near Karsaz in August last year.
Later, another FIR was lodged against her after medical reports confirmed that she was under the influence of methamphetamine (ice) at the time of driving.
The applicant, through her lawyer, filed an application under Section 249-A of the criminal procedure code, seeking her acquittal in the case registered under Section 11 (drinking liable to tazir) of the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order (PEHO), 1979.
 
 

The lawyer for applicant argued that the entire case was based on concocted statement and double jeopardy and the case in question was registered after a delay of 11 days, despite the fact that an FIR was already lodged at the same police station for the said incident.
The defence counsel also contended that registration of the second FIR was made in violation of the law and a judgement of the Supreme Court.
A public prosecutor opposed the plea and argued that the prosecution has sufficient evidence to connect the applicant with the offence. He argued that the case was also still at the pre-trial stage.

Imran alias Manu was taken into custody for trying to create public unrest during the recent Indo-Pak border tensions by “posting derogatory words” against the Pakistan Army’s chief, Inter-Services Public Relations director-general and security agencies through his Facebook account, according to an FIR registered at the Tordher police station on Friday.
The police said an inquiry had been initiated against the accused.
They said the accused had been sent to Swabi judicial lockup after appearing in a local court. Also, the Kalu Khan police arrested Zahid Zaman of the Sheikh Jana village in Razaar tehsil on Thursday after booking him under Peca.
The FIR said that Zahid had tried to “create distrust and hatred among the public by using malicious words” against the Pakistan Army’s chief and ISPR DG through his Facebook account.
The police said an inquiry had been launched against the accused, while his Facebook posts had been obtained for use against him.
Meanwhile, a cleric from Tordher village has mysteriously gone missing, with residents declaring him a case of enforced disappearance.
Maulana Fatehullah is a prayer leader in a Jahangira mosque near his village. He allegedly used “inappropriate words against Pakistani officials and praised India” during a recent sermon.
In the video available with Dawn, the cleric said Pakhtuns no longer supported Pakistani officials for pursuing a policy against the former’s interests.
There is no word from the PTI about the detention of its workers.
A senior police official said an action had been initiated under Peca against all those who were “bent on harming the country and its prestigious institutions.”
CHARAS SEIZED: The police foiled an attempt to smuggle charas and ice drug by seizing them in a large quantity from the secret compartment of a motorcycle.
Tehsil Chota Lahor DSP Mohammad Noman told reporters that 8,092 grams of charas and 1,553 grams of ice drug were recovered from detainee Mashal Khan.
Also, drug supplier Niaz Mohammad was arrested after the recovery of three packets of hashish and 533 grams of ice drug along with a gun and a pistol.

The ship snapped all three of its masts as it collided with the New York City landmark late on Saturday, while onlookers enjoying the balmy spring evening watched in horror.
“At this time, of the 277 on board, 19 sustained injuries, 2 of which remain in critical condition, and 2 more have sadly passed away from their injuries,” Adams posted on X.
 






Footage shared online showed the Mexican Navy ship Cuauhtemoc, its sails furled and festive lights draped in its rigging, as it tried to pass beneath the bridge, which sheared off the masts and sent them crashing into the East River.
Hundreds of cheering spectators had gathered minutes earlier to bid farewell to the ship, which had been docked at a pier in southern Manhattan since Tuesday.
The Mexican Navy said in a statement that two crew members died in the crash, with a further 22 injured — half of them critically.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum wrote on X that she was “deeply saddened” by the two crew members’ deaths.
The ship lost power at around 8:20 pm (7am PKT on Sunday) while the captain was manoeuvring the vessel, forcing it to head for the bridge abutment on the Brooklyn side, New York police chief of special operations Wilson Aramboles told a press conference.
Several sailors at the top of the ship were injured when it crashed into the bridge, Aramboles said.
It is not clear if these sailors are among the dead.
There was “panic on the ship,” Brooklyn resident Nick Corso, 23, who was standing near the water, told AFP.
He had been poised to take a photo, but when he realised what was happening, he switched to video.
“Lots of screaming, some sailors hanging from the masts, looked like panic happening on the ship,” he said.
“I didn’t see anyone fall into the water, but lots of people up top. People ran back and were screaming!” Corso, who does marketing for the entertainment company VeeFriends, said.
“The one thing that stood out to me was the panic on the ship, and there was a guy at the back waving for people to move away from the walkway we were on,” he said.
Bridge reopens
The Mexican Navy said in its statement that no one had fallen into the water, and that no rescue operation had been launched.
The ship had been departing New York at the time, and flags also fluttered in the rigging, while an enormous Mexican flag waved off its stern.
Seconds after the ship left the dock, “suddenly we saw all the lights, how they collided, hit the bridge, and they (the sailors) all fell down,” Arturo Acatitla, a 37-year-old New York resident, told AFP.
“While inspections will remain ongoing, there are no signs of structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge,” the New York transport department posted on X.
The bridge, which leads from Brooklyn into Manhattan, was closed for some 40 minutes before reopening.
Victims were taken to the hospital, Mexican ambassador Esteban Moctezuma Barragan told a news conference, and sirens could be heard near the scene.
New York Police Department’s Aramboles said the Cuauhtemoc, a barque built in 1982, which had a mast height of 48.2 metres (158 feet), was sailing to Iceland when it crashed.
“With mariachi, folk ballet and a community full of emotion, we celebrated its arrival at Pier 17 in Manhattan,” the embassy post said.
The Cuauhtemoc was damaged in the “mishap,” the Mexican Navy confirmed in a statement on X.
“The Ministry of the Navy reaffirms its commitment to the safety of its personnel, transparency in its operations and excellence in the training of future officers of the Mexican Navy,” it said.
The ship was later moved to near the Manhattan Bridge, an AFP journalist saw.
The New York Police Department advised residents on X to avoid the area due to “heavy traffic” and “a large presence of emergency vehicles.”

The incident is the second deadly ship crash into a bridge in the United States in little over a year, after a vessel smashed into a bridge in Baltimore in March 2024, causing it to collapse and killing six road workers.</p><small>2025-05-18 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/68270bf49c8a4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911409/smokers-corner-indias-failed-gambit' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: INDIA'S FAILED GAMBIT</strong></a><br><p>India will never be the same again. Or at least not like what it has been since Narendra Modi came to power in 2014.
On May 7 and 10, Indian forces were rather confidently subdued by the Pakistani army and air force. On May 7, when the wreckages of India’s highly-touted Rafale fighter jets were discovered, the tone of the Indian government suddenly lowered. That’s when one felt that the May 7 battle was not turning out the way India had hoped. 
This war was initiated by India on the assumption that Pakistan was a highly polarised society with an “unpopular army” and an equally unpopular government. Indian strategists were convinced that Pakistan would not be able to withstand an attack by its much larger neighbour with a ‘very popular’ government and superior war machine. 
But during the conflict, India — figuratively speaking — was first served a black-eye, and then, on May 10, a bloody nose. It eventually called for a ceasefire mediated by the US. This was first reported by the veteran journalist Nic Robertson on CNN. 

India stoked a war expecting a ‘fractured’ Pakistan to crumble. Instead, it was met with unexpected national unity, military pushback and global scrutiny — thus reshaping the regional narrative

Pakistan successfully withstood a major Indian offensive and scored some vital military and diplomatic victories. India, on the other hand, has very little to show for its gambit. Let’s see how India’s infamously loud, jingoistic and fact-free media spins this because, by the evening of May 10, it had started to sound rather disoriented. 
One of the most bizarre episodes of the conflict, though, unfolded on Indian TV channels during the night/early morning of May 8/9. For hours, the Indian media kept ‘reporting’ the fall of major Pakistani cities and the country’s government, and the arrest of Pakistan’s military chief. This bewildering tidal wave of fake news kept rising, despite Pakistanis posting videos of complete normality in their country (and, understandably, laughing their heads off). More so, no news outlet outside India reported anything at all about this “sweeping Indian victory.”  
One day this episode will (and should) be studied more closely by sociologists (or, for that matter, by psychologists as well). My immediate understanding is that it was a case of a collective fantasy that kept gaining momentum as more and more Indians got sucked into a whirlpool of outright fibs, so much so that they lost all contact with reality. 
I guess, the ecstasy and frenzy of those mad hours on Indian media were such that all ability to think rationally and mindfully was sucked out from a lot of Indians — especially middle class Indians, who are Modi’s core constituency. A collective fantasy of the total and absolute destruction of a hated neighbour was played out that night on Indian news channels and on social media. It soon mutated and took the shape of a frenetic ritual. 
Most participants of this ritual woke up the next morning with a terrible hangover. Pakistan was still there, as it has always been. The hangover worsened when Pakistan successfully retaliated on May 10 with a barrage of missile strikes. By then, the Indian media and its audience were visibly exhausted. So was the Modi regime. The gambit had failed. 
Indeed, Pakistan was/is a polarised society. But it is remarkable the way the country’s many divergent social, economic and political segments almost instantly came together to support the country’s armed forces and government against the Indian offensive. The Indians were not expecting this. 
Their understanding of the political situation in Pakistan seems to have been based on an exaggerated perception of the economic and political crisis that Pakistan plunged into in 2022. A perception — which one can now safely claim — was largely formulated by Indian ‘psyop’ (psychological operation) experts on social media through their own ‘trolls’ (pretending to be Pakistani), and through the usual cast of ‘useful idiots’ within Pakistan who readily hitch a ride on any narrative that undermines the “unpopular” armed forces. 
This is not to suggest that the narratives in this regard are entirely wrong. Far from it. But they do tend to be exaggerated and are framed to fish for emotions and beliefs that have turned into dogmas. These dogmas are mostly views about Pakistani state institutions and politics. Even though the institutions and the country’s politics have been evolving, their understanding in certain fixed minds seems to have stalled or stopped at some previous point in time. This tendency can be found on the left as well as on the right. 
 


However, many who (I believe) carry this tendency were also openly supportive of the country’s response to Indian hostilities. There were those among them who were clearly struggling, even though they weren’t as vehement in their criticisms as they often are. Most from this segment decided to talk about ‘peace’. Nothing wrong with this, really — but here’s the thing: one is often impressed by the long tradition of anti-war and/or peace marches in Europe and the US. But these marches make sense because they were (and still are) held against one’s own country because its forces have invaded and occupied another country. Think Vietnam, think Iraq, think Afghanistan, think Palestine. 
But do you think peaceniks in the US would’ve been singing ‘Give Peace a Chance’ had it been the Vietnamese forces invading the US? Were the Iraqi soldiers singing ‘All We Need is Love’ when facing US troops in Iraq? Of course war can be hell on so many levels. But it wasn’t Pakistan who started the war. 
The country’s sovereignty had been breached by a neighbour that has never hidden its desire to break Pakistan into several pieces. Calls for peace had to come from peaceniks in India, the initiator of the war. One just couldn’t expect the Pakistani armed forces and government to pull out acoustic guitars instead of guns and start singing ‘All We Need is Love.’ 
Perhaps the silliest were many fans of Imran Khan. Some continued their so-called ‘anti-establishment’ tirades, but most, in a rather surreal manner, tried to posit that Pakistan’s victory was somehow dependent on Khan’s release from jail. They didn’t explain how. Take for example the following X post by the official Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) account when India launched its second attack: “Pakistan is under attack. Release Imran Khan now!” To do what? Hold a rally? Organise a dharna? What? 
Nevertheless, the Indian government’s reading of present-day Pakistan was exposed as one-dimensional. This understanding became trapped in its own exaggerations and formulations. Even these realities changed with the aggression against Pakistan, surprising the Indians.

It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth.”

Those unfortunate enough to be following Indian television ‘news’ channels on the night of May 7 — a day after India launched missiles on civilian targets in mainland Pakistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir — could be forgiven for being thoroughly confused.
While the Indian media was in a state of frenzy over alleged Pakistani strikes in “15 locations”, including in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and Indian Punjab, Pakistan was officially denying any such operation. In fact, the Director-General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Lt Gen Arshad Sharif claimed that the sound and fury coming from India signified nothing other than an attempt to create war hysteria among its own populace.
He referred to it as India’s “phantom defence” against imaginary attacks. Of course, very few in India would have heard him, since Pakistani channels and many Pakistani social media sites are officially blocked in that country.
To be fair, many Pakistanis were also completely nonplussed. It didn’t help that there was soon a sort of panic in Pakistan with the intrusion of Indian drones across multiple cities and their being engaged with anti-aircraft guns was already making it sound as if a full-fledged war had broken out, at least in Punjab. But with all the media hysteria coming out of India, they couldn’t understand why Pakistan was not taking credit for its expected retaliation.
 
 

If one were being charitable, one could say the Indian media was simply guilty of being taken in by the hysteria spun by its government sources — loud firing at non-existent missiles can still sound threatening and cause panic — and swallowing their line, hook line and sinker that all the alleged multiple attacks by Pakistan had been repulsed and neutralised, without any damage or casualty or a single shred of evidence presented in terms of the debris of any incoming missiles or drones.

The past few weeks have made it evident that India’s mainstream media has traded fact for fantasy, devolving into a propaganda machine that espouses delusional narratives, endangers regional peace and erodes public reason

But nothing could have prepared any viewer of Indian TV channels with what came a day later. And this was far more sinister.
FAKE NEWS GALORE
On the night of May 8, Indian television channels were glutted with news first of a Pakistani attack on the Sikh heartland of Amritsar, which nobody in Pakistan could make sense of. Why would Pakistan alienate the Sikh community in particular and to what purpose would Amritsar be attacked?
The Pak military spokesman himself looked shocked at the turn of events, saying that India had attacked its own areas. He would later show real-time digital maps tracking the projectiles fired, which seemed to indicate that the four missiles that apparently landed near Amritsar and which India claimed had been fired from Pakistan had been launched from an Indian air base in Adampur.
 
 

But soon, all this was left behind as Indian anchors on mainstream news channels went into overdrive and were doing their best to out-shout each other about one alleged Indian “victory” after another alleged advance.
“Karachi Port Destroyed” screamed one headline along with the channel’s anchors. One notorious ex-military Indian “analyst” exulted that India should subsequently destroy all of Karachi with Brahmos missiles from the INS Vikrant, the Indian aircraft carrier that was actually hundreds of miles away. Another channel had Indian ground forces in Lahore.
A third announced the takeover of Quetta by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army and the secession of Balochistan. Then one broke the “news” that Pakistan army chief Gen Asim Munir had been arrested and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had been scuttled off to a secure location. Another shrieked that Islamabad had fallen and the Indian flag had been flown in the capital.
It was apparently a resounding victory for the Indian military and the end of Pakistan as a country.
 
 

Pakistanis, meanwhile, watching all this unfold on social media, sat eating their popcorn and laughing their heads off in disbelief. The so-called news coming out of Indian channels was so absurd that most did not know where to begin, though some intrepid souls did put videos out on social media of the prevailing calm and normality in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad.

India’s entire adventure with its so-called Operation Sindoor was predicated on wrong assessments and hubris. It assumed Pakistan was on the point of fracturing, that the Pakistan military did not have the wherewithal to respond in kind, that it could bully Pakistan and establish a new norm, and that it needed to present no evidence of its alleged involvement in the tragic Pahalgam incident. Each one of those assessments, fed in part by Modi Media, turned out to be false.

As one sober Indian commentator put it, the Indian public woke up the next morning with a very bad hangover. Nothing of what they had been fed the night before had come to pass. Pakistan still existed. Life went on as normally in its cities as it can in the middle of such tensions. And soon a few ethical voices across the border began to criticise the madness that India’s media has become under Narendra Modi.
One TV channel, out of the scores that had participated in the mass hysteria, attempted to apologise to its viewers with a mealy-mouthed statement about “inadvertent mistakes” in its reporting.
“All of this ‘reporting’ by major news channels was not just fake news but also inflammatory and provocative, and clearly intended to ensure the very escalation (from the Pakistani side) that the Indian government has cautioned against from the outset,” tweeted Siddharth Varadarajan, founding editor of The Wire, whose website was ironically blocked in India under Indian government orders around the same time.

‘GODI MEDIA’
This hangover would be broken by the news on Pakistani media on the night of May 9 that a few Pakistani airbases had indeed come under Indian missile attack, including the Nur Khan airbase in Chaklala, Rawalpindi. Soon after that came Pakistan’s actual “notch above” military retaliation, fully owned by Pakistan and partly beamed live on Pakistani television screens.
Interestingly, while Pakistanis only had the Pak military’s version of the number of targets hit in India, the Indian government corroborated that 26 purely military locations had been hit, though it disputed Pakistan’s version of how much damage had been incurred by those sites.
The military and diplomatic successes and failures have been debated continuously on both sides and will no doubt continue to be debated for a long time to come. But it is important to also consider what exactly has happened to the Indian media under Modi’s proto-fascist Hindutva regime.
 
 

Over the last decade or so, the Modi-led government has deliberately shrunk the space for India’s independent media. Some, like Prannoy Roy’s NDTV have been forced to sell. Others have had to toe the line. At the same time, there has been a rise of what is termed in India itself as ‘Godi Media’, a pun on Modi’s name and the Hindi/Urdu word for ‘lap’, implying its status as lapdogs of the Hindutva regime. A combination of financial inducements to media owners and direct attacks from armies of Hindutva trolls have made independent reporting in India a very risky venture.
This is not to say that parts of Indian media have not resisted — parts of the old print media continue to hold out. But even they are under pressure. An example of this can be seen with how The Hindu — long a bastion of old world journalism — was forced to remove a report from its website that raised questions about the Indian government claims that none of its fighter jets had been downed on the night of May 6 and 7.
 

Some of the sensationalist and factually incorrect reportage by the Indian media: when the mainstream media is feeding you completely manufactured stories and one-sided analyses, you are unlikely to take more rational, considered decisions

The removal of the reporting from the ground, which indicated that people had seen the wreckage of at least two jets, may have been prompted by recent Indian government stipulations that only official statements regarding military matters could be carried by the media during the war. But the end result was the same: silencing of dissent and any narrative that goes against the official one.
Of course, one can argue that the lot of the Indian media, in matters related to hostilities with Pakistan, is not very different from Pakistan’s media. Pakistani media too cannot afford to counter the military line in such matters and many so-called journalists in the electronic media go out of their way to propagate whatever they are fed without question. However, India had always prided itself on having a freer media, protected by constitutional and democratic ideals, unlike its neighbour who they assume work under far greater constraints.
But whereas Pakistan’s media has indeed worked under greater constraints to its freedoms — resisting and often using ingenious methods to carve out space for itself — Pakistan’s political history has also led to the Pakistani populace having greater skepticism about the official narrative. And to be fair, it has never had the kind of no-holds-barred, jingoistic and inflammatory mainstream electronic media that India now seems to have.
Perhaps even more troubling is the general acceptance of such narratives in India. The psychological repercussions of a widespread acceptance of such bigotry and falsehood is something for sociologists to delve into in more detail.

DELUSIONAL BUBBLES
“The lowest form of popular culture — lack of information, misinformation, disinformation and a contempt for the truth or the reality of most people’s lives — has overrun real journalism.”
— Carl Bernstein, American journalist
Perhaps the most revealing element of the psycholo­gical make-up of the new Modi Media is what the buffoonish former Major Gaurav Arya — who regularly calls for Pakistan to be annihilated on various Indian TV channels and recently caused a diplomatic ruckus by labelling the Iranian foreign minister a “pig” — himself admitted in a video.
Justifying his spreading of disinformation, he told his viewers, “This work was begun by Hitler in the Second World War. His minister for propaganda was a man named Joseph Goebbels. There is a famous saying by Joseph Goebbels that if you repeat a lie many times, people begin to believe it. There is truth to this. Whether you like it or not, it’s true.”

Using the example of genocidal maniacs Hitler and Goebbels to explain yourself must surely rank as a new low in Indian media and Arya did not delve into the fate that befell both. But it also showcases what the models of the Hindutva brigade are. Ironically, the same brigade is also the greatest cheerleader for Israel, which also regularly uses disinformation tactics as a matter of policy, although it would not like its Hasbara antecedents to be traced to Hitler and Goebbels.
Quite aside from the frightening aspect that a large swathe of India’s population now salivates over genocide, one must also consider the internally deleterious effect of living in delusional bubbles. When the mainstream media is feeding you completely manufactured stories and one-sided analyses, you are unlikely to take more rational, considered decisions. More likely, emotions are going to cloud your thinking and get the better of you.
In fact, India’s entire adventure with its so-called Operation Sindoor was predicated on wrong assessments and hubris. It assumed Pakistan was on the point of fracturing, that the Pakistan military did not have the wherewithal to respond in kind, that it could bully Pakistan and establish a new norm, and that it needed to present no evidence of Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the tragic Pahalgam incident. Each one of those assessments, fed in part by Modi Media, turned out to be false.

ENFORCING A CONSENSUS
Aside from uniting a politically polarised Pakistan, India was surprised by the ferocity of Pakistan’s military response, it inadvertently internationalised the Kashmir issue again and re-hyphenated India and Pakistan in global discourse, and it received no diplomatic backing — aside from Israel — from the international community.
It now also realises, irrespective of Modi’s faltering bluster, that it faces a far more implacable regional adversary in the synergy between a rising China and Pakistan combined. The new norm it wished to establish has in fact happened, but not in the way it had envisaged.
It is not that there are no intelligent, thinking individuals in India who have a nuanced worldview. In fact, there are probably many more in sheer numbers in India than in Pakistan. But it is that they are increasingly sidelined or marginalised from positions of decision-making or influence. Two examples immediately come to mind.

Pravin Sawhney, a well-known defence analyst and former Indian army major, presented perhaps the most calculated initial assessment of the air battle on May 6/7, which flew in the face of the official Indian narrative. He explained through clear evidence and logic that it was quite likely that at least four Indian jets had been downed. For his troubles, his YouTube channel was banned in India and his interview by Karan Thapar for The Wire was probably also the prompt for the latter to be censored.
Another, surprisingly, was a former secretary of the Indian Research & Analysis Wing (R&AW), Rana Banerji, again recently interviewed by Karan Thapar for The Wire. His analysis of the Pakistan Army and Pak army chief Gen Asim Munir was perhaps the most knowledgeable and nuanced you could find in India, but it was also the exact opposite of the consensus that the Indian media has built around itself. Sadly, there is no place for such voices in the Modi’s Media.
The Modi regime has been on a banning and blocking spree recently. Over 8,000 websites and social media Pakistani, Indian and international accounts have apparently been proscribed in India, some simply for disagreeing with the official Indian government narrative or for presenting alternative viewpoints. Among them are the Chinese Global Times and Xinhua News and the Turkiye-based TRT World.
Meanwhile, despite voices of criticism from within India, the mainstream electronic media continues unashamedly spreading fake news and hysteria. And Hindutva trolls continue to attack any voices on social media that don’t toe the Modi line — Indian or not — with abuse, filthy language and sometimes even physical threats.

One of its ‘star reporters’ recently claimed the downing of a Pakistani F-16 and the capture of its pilot by India, again without evidence. Social media warriors also started spreading the ‘news’ that a Pakistani nuclear weapons storage site was hit — even a denial by the Indian Air Force Director General Military Operations was presented as tongue-in-cheek. Later, more ‘news’ was circulated that there had been a nuclear radiation leak in Islamabad that was making scores of people ill.
If this is the sort of information Indian analysts base their decisions on, is it any surprise about the kind of decisions made?
In this, there is a lesson for Pakistan too. Delusional bubbles and enforced consensus are a recipe for disaster, not only because they vitiate the atmosphere of the free exchange of ideas, but because they inevitably lead to bad decision-making.
When hubris is the only coin you deal in and you can’t bear to listen to disagreement, the long-term results can never be good. Hitler and Goebbels taught us that.

New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
“We are not a violent nation, we are a serious nation. Our first priority is peace,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told RT Arabic in an interview, according to PTV News.
“Great and sensible powers like the United States understand better what the spirit of Pakistan’s people is,” he added.
 






Detailing the ceasefire process, the DG ISPR said the Indian defence ministry’s spokesperson “personally requested a ceasefire”. It was unclear if the request was made to the US, which acted as a mediator, or Pakistan.
“We desire peace and stability, so we said, why not?” the military spokesman was quoted as saying by PTV News.
Lt Gen Chaudhry hailed the “tremendous work” done by diplomats by “engaging the international community with great wisdom and in an extraordinary manner”.
“Pakistan, with great maturity, responded promptly, firmly and effectively, forcing the enemy to face reality,” the DG ISPR asserted, referring to the downing of five Indian air jets in response to New Delhi’s deadly strikes on the night of May 6-7.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, killing over 30 civilians. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets and later also intercepted dozens of its drones.
 
 

India then attacked Pakistani airbases and military targets on the night of May 9, prompting Pakistan to target its military installations using missiles and airstrikes under “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.
“The nation and the Pakistan armed forces stood united like an unbreakable wall,” he said.
Recalling the events of May 9-10, when the tensions between the two neighbours reached their peak amid airstrikes, the DG ISPR stated: “The enemy fired more missiles on the night of May 9 and 10 to scare us. India forgot that Pakistan’s nation and its forces neither bow nor can be made to bow.
“On the morning of May 10, we responded, targeting only their military objectives with utmost responsibility and caution,” he added.
The military spokesperson stressed, “Not a single civilian target was harmed; it was an appropriate, just and balanced response.”
‘India rejected logical neutral probe’
During his conversation reported by PTV News, Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that to understand the Pak-India tensions, it was “essential to look into its background”.
“India is hiding behind a false narrative to conceal the truth,” the ISPR official said. He noted that while the Indian media started blaming Pakistan “within minutes of the Pahalgam incident”, its foreign ministry spokesperson admitted two days later that the investigation was underway.
 
 

“Where is the wisdom in making allegations without investigation and evidence?” Gen Chaudhry asked rhetorically.
He highlighted that the government had taken a clear stance that if there was any evidence, it should be given to an impartial institution, and Pakistan was ready to cooperate.
“India rejected this logical offer and, acting unilaterally, fired missiles at our mosques, martyring children, women, and elders,” the DG ISPR said.
“The sacred responsibility entrusted to the Pakistan armed forces is to protect the country’s sovereignty and borders,” Lt Gen Chaudhry stated, adding that forces had fulfilled the duty and would “continue to do so at all costs”.
 
 

The DG ISPR reiterated the military’s stance that India was “sponsoring terrorism in this region, particularly in Pakistan”.
“India is the real sponsor of ongoing terrorism in Pakistan, whether it is the khawarij or terrorist groups active in Balochistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) that the state refers to as Fitna Al Khawarij.
Last month, the military’s chief spokesperson had detailed that a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India was arrested in Punjab’s Jhelum.</p><small>2025-05-18 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1811381185dc612.jpg?r=115110' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911767/fbi-calls-deadly-california-fertility-clinic-bombing-an-act-of-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>FBI calls deadly California fertility clinic bombing an ‘act of terrorism’</strong></a><br><p>A bomb exploded on Saturday outside a California fertility clinic, killing one person in what the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) labelled a terror attack.
The blast tore through downtown Palm Springs, ripping a hole in the clinic and blowing out the windows and doors of nearby buildings, an AFP journalist on the scene reported.
“Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,” Akil Davis, the head of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, told reporters near the site of the fatal explosion.
“This is probably one of the largest bombing investigations that we’ve had in southern California,” he added.
He confirmed that one person near the clinic at the time of the blast had been killed and that four others were wounded. Work was ongoing to identify the deceased, he added.
Asked whether the clinic was deliberately targeted, Davis answered: “We believe so, yes.”
The city’s mayor, Ron deHarte had earlier told AFP that investigators confirmed a bomb exploded in or near a vehicle outside the clinic.
Eyewitnesses told local media they had seen human remains near the American Reproductive Centres clinic, with aerial footage of the scene showing the building’s roof had collapsed.
Debris for ‘several blocks’
The charred remnants of a vehicle lay in a parking lot, some distance from the apparent epicentre of the explosion.
Debris was blown straight through the building and scattered across the road, while the roofs of a number of nearby buildings had been damaged, indicating the intense force of the blast.
Davis of the FBI described the explosion as “significant” and said debris had been thrown more than two hundred yards (180 meters) from the scene, but declined to comment further on the characteristics of the bomb.
The local ABC affiliate, which cited an unnamed law enforcement source, said the person who died was a suspect in the blast.
Davis told reporters that though the FBI was working to identify the deceased, “we are keeping that close hold in order to protect the integrity of the investigation”.
A statement posted on social media by the clinic said no staff had been hurt, and that its lab — “including all eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials — remains fully secure and undamaged.”
It said that “a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near our building.”
Reproductive care, including abortion and fertility services, remains controversial in the United States, where some conservatives believe the procedures should be outlawed for religious reasons.
Violence against clinics providing such services is rare, but not unheard of.
‘Unforgivable’
President Donald Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents were working to determine exactly what had happened.
“But let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America. Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable,” she said in a statement on social media.
People living near the clinic reported feeling the shaking from the blast throughout the city.
Matt Spencer, who lives in a nearby apartment complex, told the Palm Springs Post he ran outside as soon as he heard the blast, and was confronted with the sight of the burned-out car and what appeared to be a body in the middle of the road.
“In front of the building [the car] was blown clear across four lanes into the parking lot of [Desert Regional Medical Centre],” he told the paper.
“I could see the back of the car still on fire, and the rims, that was the only thing that distinguished it as a car.”
The Centre for Reproductive Rights, a global advocacy group, described the bombing as “horrific” and “unconscionable.”
“The history of violence against reproductive health centres is why clinics need protections and patients must feel safe,” its president, Nancy Northup, said in a statement.</p><small>2025-05-18 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605021-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-hit-by-nearly-300-terror-attacks-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa hit by nearly 300 terror attacks in 2025</strong></a><br><p>

The government of the occupied state in Srinagar approved a “proposal for mobilising ex-servicemen (ESM) to safeguard vital infrastructure”, according to a government press release.
Around 4,000 veterans have been “identified” as non-combatant volunteers, out of which 435 have licensed personal weapons, it said.
This will help by “significantly enhancing the capacity to respond effectively to localised security situations”, the government added.
 
 

Veterans will work in “static guard” roles, focusing on “presence-based deterrence and local coordination”.
India already has an estimated half a million soldiers permanently deployed in held Kashmir.
But last year, thousands of additional troops, including special forces, were deployed across the occupied territory’s mountainous south following a series of deadly attacks that had left more than 50 soldiers dead in three years.

• Malnutrition affected 2.1m children in 10 months
ISLAMABAD: High levels of acu­te food insecurity persisted in Pak­istan between November 2024 and March 2025, with 11 million people facing crisis or worse, says the ‘2025 Global Report on Food Crises’.
The report published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations on Friday, says these 11 million people or 22 per cent of the analysed population are projected to face acute food insecurity in 68 flood-affected rural districts across Balochistan, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
This include 1.7m people in em­­ergency. The population coverage increased by 38pc between the 2024 peak and 2025 current analysis, from 36.7m people to 50.8m people, with 25 additional distri­cts, making the 2024 peak and the projection for 2025 not comparable.
The situation was better than the previous year’s lean season but weather extremes continued to affect livelihoods. The peak for 2024 in Pakistan remained the same as in 2023, with 11.8m people facing high levels of acute food insecurity between November 2023 and January 2024.
The report says Pakistan experienced persistently high levels of ac­­u­­­te malnutrition between 2018 and early 2024 in analysed areas of Ba­­l­ochistan and Sindh, with global acu­te malnutrition (GAM) prevalence consistently above 10pc and reaching more than 30pc in certain districts. Insufficient funds also limit­­ed nutrition service coverage. In 2025, climate shocks and acute food insecurity risk further aggravated alrea­­dy high acute malnutrition levels.
 
 

According to the report, 11.8m people or 32pc of the analysed population were projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity in 43 rural districts of Balochistan, KP and Sindh during the winter lean season. Of them, 2.2m were in emergency under the Integrated Food Insecurity Phase Classifica­tion (IPC) during November 2023 to January 2024.
The report further said acute malnutrition burden during March 2023 and January 2024 affected 2.1m children aged 6 to 59 months. Children’s diets were of insufficient quality and quantity, exacerbated by acute food insecurity which worsened during the winter months (December–February) when food prices are higher, livelihood opportunities are restricted and access to markets is reduced.
A high prevalence of acute malnutrition among pregnant and breastfeeding women was accompanied by a high proportion of children being born with a low birth weight, particularly in Sindh and KP. Levels of diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections and malaria were high, worsening during the winter months. Inadequate coverage of sanitation facilities and safe drinking water was a significant concern, partly following the heavy monsoon floods in 2022.
These floods damaged most water systems in Sindh and, to a lesser extent, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. Across all three provinces, poor healthcare-seeking behaviours and blocked roads limited access to healthcare. Insuffi­cient funds also limited nutrition service coverage. In 2025, climate shocks and acute food insecurity risk further aggravated already high acute malnutrition, report says.
History of food crisis
A lower-middle-income country, Pakistan is susceptible to weather extremes, including floods and drought, especially in the provinces of Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh.
The geographical coverage of IPC analyses has varied but focused primarily on Sindh in 2017-2018, and Balochistan and Sindh in 2019 and 2021. Major floods affected all three provinces in 2022, with the highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity reaching 49pc in 16 districts of Balochistan and Sindh.

In Kentucky, Governor Andy Beshear said early on Saturday at least 14 people were killed in his state.
Kentucky, were starting today with the tough news that we lost at least 14 of our people to last night’s storms, but sadly, this number is expected to grow as we receive more information, Beshear said in a post on social media platform X.
 






At least nine of the fatalities were in Laurel County, about 150 miles south of Louisville, when a tornado touched down just before midnight on Saturday, Sheriff John Root said in a social media post, describing it as “a mass casualty event.”
There were numerous severe injuries, he said, and a search for survivors was underway.
Aerial images posted on social media showed scenes of complete destruction in Laurel County, with entire blocks of houses reduced to splinters, and cars and pickup trucks left battered or crushed in the tornado’s wake.
In Union County, near the Illinois border 250 miles west of Laurel County, a reported twister levelled mobile homes in the city of Morganfield, according to broadcaster WLKY in Louisville, but there were no immediate reports of casualties in that area.

Earlier, officials said a tornado ripped through the Missouri city of St. Louis, killing at least five people and damaging 5,000 properties as it tore off roofs.
It also knocked down power lines and swept through a major thoroughfare during rush-hour traffic on Friday, officials said.
Five people were killed in St. Louis, and two others in Scott County, in southeastern Missouri, according to officials.
“Our city is grieving tonight,” St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer, who was sworn in a month ago, told reporters on Friday night. “The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous.”
St. Louis resident Joan Miller recounted her narrow escape when a tornado struck her brick house.
“The wind started, the tree out front was shaking so violently,” she said.
“And suddenly all the doors shut, the windows flew out from the bedroom … the entire back of my house … you can see straight into the alley now.”
A spokesperson for both St. Louis Children’s Hospital and Barnes-Jewish Hospital told NBC News that at least 35 people had been admitted to the facilities, with the children’s facility receiving 15 and Barnes-Jewish taking in at least 20, possibly 30, people who were injured as a result of the severe weather.
The city imposed a curfew from 9pm to 6am in two police districts where most of the damage took place to prevent injuries from dangerous debris and reduce the potential for looting.
The National Weather Service said thunderstorms were widespread across portions of the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys on Friday.
At least half a dozen tornadoes touched down in Missouri and neighbouring Illinois and other severe weather stretched all the way to the Atlantic Coast, including another tornado in New Jersey.
As of Saturday morning, about 334,000 customers were without power, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks electric blackouts across the country.
Most of the outages were Missouri, Kentucky and Michigan, where the storm system travelled after causing the destruction in the other states.

“We request Army Chief General Asim Munir to keep a vigilant eye on the country’s policymakers who are bent on causing irreparable losses to the country,” said Nasir Khan, vice president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), during a press conference on the amendments held at the Federation House on Saturday. He was accompanied by other FPCCI leaders.
Nasir Khan recalled that the army chief had assured the business community of safeguarding investments in Pakistan. “The enemy is not only on the border — it is also formulating destructive policies that are forcing investors and citizens to flee the country,” he added.
FPCCI Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon expressed concern over the sweeping powers granted to tax officials under the new ordinance, adding that under the amendments, a Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officer can penalise a taxpayer without due process, depriving the individual of the right to appeal.
He said FBR officials have been given authority to recover amounts without issuing prior notice and to monitor industrial operations directly — moves that, he warned, would open floodgates to corruption.
Mr Magoon questioned whether FBR officials had been granted a “certificate of honesty” to justify such unchecked powers. He criticised SRO55 and SRO69 relating to sales tax, pointing out calculation errors that are causing delays in the filing of sales tax returns. Additionally, he noted that in SRO55, the measurement units have been changed to kilograms, which would create operational complications for businesses.
He also pointed to a contradiction in FBR’s approach: while a faceless system with no human intervention has been introduced for goods clearance, the Inland Revenue continues to create hurdles for taxpayers.
Mr Magoon accused the FBR of pursuing its own policy in contradiction to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), which is working to attract investors. “While SIFC aims to create investor confidence, the FBR is actively harassing them,” he stated.
He reiterated national support for the prime minister’s vision to achieve $100 billion in exports, but said the FBR’s actions directly conflict with this goal.
Mr Magoon also hinted at a possible new ordinance that would abolish the captive power option — a move he urged the government to reconsider. He pointed out that industries have invested billions in captive power and called for dialogue with stakeholders before taking such a drastic step.
Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani termed the Tax Ordinance Amendments 2025 regressive and anti-business, warning that they pose a serious threat to Pakistan’s already fragile economy.
He said the ordinance directly contradicts the government’s stated objective of providing a business-friendly environment. Mr Bilwani criticised the lack of consultation, questioning why such critical changes were made without parliamentary debate or industry input.
He also condemned the excessive advance tax demands based on presumed income, calling it a flawed approach that ignores business cycles and seasonal fluctuations. He warned that this would hit small and medium enterprises and export-oriented units hardest, potentially paralysing their working capital and pushing many into default or closure.
He noted that the ordinance criminalises procedural non-compliance, adding that even minor clerical errors or delays caused by technical issues could now result in severe penalties, heavy fines, or even criminal prosecution. He emphasised that the amendments do nothing to broaden the tax base.
“Once again, the burden is being placed on those already in the system, while vast informal sectors, including retail, real estate and agriculture, remain untouched.”
He also criticised the government’s decision to promulgate the ordinance via executive order, bypassing the parliamentary process.
SITE Association of Industry (SAI) Chairman Ahmed Azeem Alvi urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to withdraw the ordinance, warning that its provisions undermine the documented economy, discourage compliance, and risk reversing the progress made in broadening the tax base.
He warned that the ordinance would damage investor confidence at a time when Pakistan urgently needs economic stability.

The organisation called for strengthening the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre to function as a dedicated facility for wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and veterinary care.
“A move to transfer the snow leopards from Gilgit-Baltistan to Moscow not only contradicts national and international conservation commitments but also risks setting a highly detrimental precedent for future transfer of threatened and iconic wildlife species from Pakistan,” WWF-Pakistan said in a letter to the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination on the proposed transfer of two snow leopards, currently housed at the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre, to the Moscow Zoo, Russia.
According to WWF-Pakistan, the snow leopard is listed as a threatened (vulnerable) species on the IUCN Red List (2017), and it receives the highest level of legal protection under Pakistan’s national and provincial wildlife legislation.
 







Body says no ‘compelling conservation rationale’ for transferring these animals

Additionally, the species is included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which strictly prohibits international trade except under exceptional, non-commercial circumstances.
It further said there was no compelling conservation rationale for transferring these snow leopards to Russia, a country that already hosts a significantly larger wild population of the species.
WWF-Pakistan recommended that instead of exporting the country’s unique natural heritage, Pakistan should demonstrate global leadership by reinforcing its commitment to conservation and the protection of its remaining wild snow leopard populations.
 
 

It also highlighted the risk that once the snow leopards were transferred, it would be difficult to monitor or ensure the well-being of these animals under Russian jurisdiction.
Remarking on the proposed move, Hammad Naqi Khan, WWF-Pakistan director general, said that approval of this export would undermine decades of conservation progress and significantly damage Pakistan’s standing in the global conservation community.
This moment called for reaffirming stewardship of national biodiversity and strengthening the institutions responsible for its protection, rather than yielding to external pressures that compromised long-term conservation goals.
“We need to uphold Pakistan’s obligations under international agreements such as CITES and the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) by prioritising the protection of vulnerable and critically endangered species within national borders,” Mr Khan added.
WWF-Pakistan said it strongly recommended steps to strengthen the Naltar Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre to function as a dedicated facility for wildlife rescue, rehabilitation, and veterinary care, equipped to manage future confiscations and care cases.
It also asked for enhancing the capacity of the Gilgit-Baltistan Parks and Wildlife Department through targeted technical training, adequate financial support, and provision of essential operational equipment.

While incarcerated PTI leaders including ex-ministers Dr Yasmin Rashid, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, ex-governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Senator Ejaz Chaudhry were produced before Judge Manzer Ali Gill, who conducted the hearing inside the Kot Lakhpat jail, the latter was informed that ex-minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi was shifted to Punjab Institute of Cardiology for a cardiac complaint before the hearing commenced.
Also, PTI’s former lawmakers Aliya Hamza Malik and Rubina Jamil, social media activists Sanam Javed and Tayyaba Raja, fashion designer Khadija Shah and other suspects out on bail attended the hearing inside the jail.
Senior lawyers Burhan Moazam Malik and Rana Mudassir Umar appeared on behalf of the suspects.
 
 

After being provided with the copies of the charge-sheet, the suspects were informed that they would be indicted on May 24 in the case.
Judge Gill of the ATC-1 later adjourned the proceedings.
Sarwar Road police had registered an FIR against the PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking and vandalising the Jinnah House, which also serves as residence of corps commander, during the May 9 protests against the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan in a graft case by National Accountability Bureau.
Terrorism charge under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, and various other offences, including waging or attempting to wage war or abetting waging of war against Pakistan, abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier from his duty and rioting were added to the FIR.
Meanwhile, another ATC court extended the pre-arrest bail of former legislator Aliya Hamza Malik till May 26 and two sisters of Mr Khan in multiple cases of attacks on police till May 30.
Ms Malik appeared before the court on the expiry of her bail period while Aleema Khan and Uzma Khan sought one-time exemption from personal appearance.
A lawyer informed the court that both sisters had to appear before a court of Rawalpindi.

The increase was primarily driven by higher imports of edible oil, tea and sugar to meet domestic demand.
According to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, palm oil constituted the largest share among imported food items, followed by pulses, tea, soya bean oil and sugar.
The value of palm oil imports surged to $2.87bn during July-April FY25, up from $2.30bn a year ago, reflecting a growth of 24.78 per cent. In response to escalating domestic consumption, Pakistan imported pulses worth $917.89 during the period compared to $687.74m in the same period last year, showing an increase of 33.5pc.
The import bill for all other food items rose 0.54pc to $1.841bn in the 10-month period from $1.831bn a year ago. The imports of tea experienced a slight decrease of 5.13pc during the reviewed months, with its value dropping to $519.37m from $547.43m.

Exports slip slightly to $6.2bn

The import of soya bean oil soared 140pc to $279.63m compared to $116.60m a year ago. The US government has expressed its concerns to Pakistan regarding the import of soya bean oil, highlighting that failure to comply could result in a 29pc tariff on Pakistan’s exports to the US market.
The import of milk, cream and milk food for infants grew 18.35pc to $103.32m in July-April against $87.31m last year. The growth in imports was recorded despite the tax introduced in last year’s budget.
Export bill
Contrary to this, the exports of Pakistan’s raw food exports fell slightly by one per cent to $6.16bn during July-April compared to $6.23bn last year, mainly driven by a decline in sugar and non-basmati rice shipments.
The food exports have increased for 20 straight months, despite unparalleled food inflation in the country’s history. Because of supply and demand imbalances, consumers across the country are paying more for food items, particularly sugar, meat and poultry products.
In the 10-month period under review, the overall rice shipments declined by 9.7pc year-on-year to $2.96bn from $3.28bn. This decline is mainly due to a drop in exports of non-basmati rice.
Product-wise details show that the quantity of basmati rice shipments rose 14.8pc to 702,598 tonnes year-on-year and its value by 3.4pc to $722.71 million.
Exports of non-basmati rice dipped 13.2pc year-on-year to $2.24bn. However, the export quantity dropped 2.05pc to 4.383m tonnes.
Meat exports also dipped slightly by 1.2pc during the period. Vegetable exports fell 13.5pc, mainly due to falling shipments of onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Fruit exports also dropped by 5.7pc. Fish and seafood exports recorded modest growth of 8.4pc during the period under review.

• Describes his Gulf tour as ‘a major, major success’, issues another warning to Iran
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has said the United States intervened to prevent a possible “n-war” between India and Pakistan after the two nuclear-armed neighbours had already begun targeting each other with missiles and drones.
Discussing the May 10 ceasefire between the two nations with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, President Trump described the situation as intensifying.
“They were angry, and the next phase was probably — did you see where it was getting? It was tit-for-tat. It was getting deeper and more, I mean, more missiles. Everyone was stronger, stronger, to a point where the next ones are going to be you know what: the n-word.”
The Trump administrat­ion’s decision to mediate was repo­rtedly influenced by remarks from Vice President James David Vance. In a previous Fox News interview, Mr Vance commented that the con­flict was “fundamentally none of our business”. According to The New York Times, this statement “caused alarm in the administration that things could get out of hand if the US sat on the sidelines”.
 


As the situation escalated, the US recognised that public statements urging de-escalation were insufficient, the reports added. Contrary to his earlier statement, VP Vance then called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he had met during a trip to India the previous month, stating that the US believed the conflict could lead to a full-scale war between the two nations, according to The New York Times.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio contacted top Pakistani officials before the two sides established the foundations for a ceasefire.
Following the agreement, Pakistan commended Presi­dent Trump “for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region”. India did not acknowledge the US role in the ceasefire.
This is the fourth time President Trump has highlighted his administration’s role in defusing tensions between India and Pakistan, clearly ignoring India’s policy against third-party mediation. His remarks contradict PM Modi’s claim that the ceasefire was enacted on Pakistan’s request.
 
 

President Trump, who wrapped up his high-stakes Middle East tour on Friday, covered a sweeping range of subjects in his interview, ranging from the tour itself to a $400 million personal gift from Qatar and record-breaking investment commitments totalling an estimated $2 trillion.
But he insisted that “one of (his) biggest successes no one ever gives me credit for” was calling both Indian and Pakistani leaders by phone and persuading them to “step back from the brink” of a potential nuclear clash mere hours before his departure to the Gulf.
President Trump, who wants to be seen as a man of peace, said this was a “bigger success than I’ll ever be given credit for”.
India and Pakistan, he said, “are major nuclear powers. Those are not like a little bit. And they were angry. And the next phase was probably… you know what the ‘n’ word is, right?”
He then lauded his use of trade incentives as a peace-building tool. “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,” he said, pledging to reduce tariffs by “100 per cent” for US exports to India once full calm was restored.
President Trump described his three-nation tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates from May 13 to 15 as “a major, major success” in strengthening US engagement with the energy-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. He attributed the success of the trip to his personal friendships with the leaders of the three countries.
 
 

In the interview with Fox News, the network noted that Mr Trump created geopolitical shockwaves by lifting decades-old sanctions on Syria. His meeting in Saudi Arabia with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa was described by his officials as a turning point for the war-torn nation.
Mr Trump also issued another warning to Iran, claiming that his sanctions policy had prevented Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
President Trump again defended his decision to accept a luxury jet worth hundreds of millions of dollars from the Qatari government to replace Air Force One, while also dismissing bipartisan criticism as a “radical left story”.

Additional District and Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani conducted the hearing. PM Shehbaz and his counsel Mustafa Ramday joined the proceedings via a video link.
At the outset, when def­e­nce counsel Muham­mad Hussain asked the prem­ier whether he had a copy of the suit, the latter resp­onded in negative and sou­ght some time to obtain the documents from his legal team via WhatsApp.
The judge accepted the request and adjourned the hearing for a short break.
As the hearing resumed, the defence counsel asked abo­ut the alleged audio reco­rding of late Justice Malik Muhammad Qay­um. How­ever, PM Sheh­baz’s lawyer objected, ass­erting that such a question could not be asked during the cross-examination.
 
 

Advocate Ramday further pointed out that the high court had dismissed the def­endant’s right to file a counterclaim, therefore, no questions could be asked regarding the facts stated in that counterclaim. Asking about Justice Qayum’s alleged audio recording amounted to scandalizing, he said, adding that the plaintiff was not obligated to comment on that particular recording.
The judge, however, remarked that it would be decided later whether questions about the counterclaim could be asked.
At this, the prosecution said the questions raised by the lawyer of ex-PM Khan could be addressed during final arguments.
Responding to the queries of the defence counsel, PM Shehbaz said he was unaware if Mr Khan had personally distributed posters or pamphlets against him, but he did know that baseless allegations were made against him on TV, which had a greater impact than millions of pamphlets.
The plaintiff said Mr Khan had accused former premier Nawaz Sharif of offering him a bribe of Rs10bn through his brother. He explained at the time the alleged offer was made, his brother Abbas Sharif had already passed away, thus only he himself and his brother Nawaz Sharif were alive.
In his defamation suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations against him. He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content.
 
 

Mr Khan in his reply to case pointed out that the suit was filed after a delay of four years in 2021, saying one of his friends had told him that someone known to him and also the Sharif family had approached him with an offer to pay billions of rupees if he could convince him (Mr Khan) to stop pursuing the Panama case.
He disclosed it for the consumption of the public at large, he claimed, adding that an act in the interest of the public good does not constitute any defamation. He maintained that he did not specifically attribute any statement to the plaintiff (PM Shehbaz) while narrating the incident.
The judge adjourned further hearing till May 24 to resume PM’s cross-examination.

The objection was raised through an application filed by senior counsel Faisal Sid­diqi on behalf of the SIC after the party had requested the constitutional bench to decide the 26th Amendment issue before hearing the review petitions against the apex court decision of July 2024 in the reserved seats case.
Also through senior counsel Hamid Khan, the SIC had requested the constitutional bench to postpone the next hearing of the review petitions scheduled for May 19 (tomorrow).
Mr Siddiqi, who filed the application seeking reconstitution of bench, had also expressed an intention of challenging the composition of the 11-judge bench during the May 13 proceedings after which the court postponed the proceedings till May 19 to allow the party to file a formal application.

Five major objections to the composition of the 11-judge constitutional bench raised

In the fresh application, the party raised mainly five objections to the composition of the bench hearing the review petitions in the reserved seats case.
 
 

It highlighted that the July 2024 judgement was issued by a full court comprising 13 judges. It pointed out that the constitutional bench while taking up the review petitions comprised 13 members but later the strength was reduced to 11 members. It argued that the any judgement can only be reviewed by a bench having same numerical strength that the original bench had. Thus, the existing 11-judge constitutional bench could not review the petitions, the SIC reiterated.
Besides, it argued, since the two dissenting judges of the original 13-judge bench namely Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Justice Aqil Ahmed Abbasi had not recused themselves from hearing the matter, they could not be excluded from the review bench.
It was a settled law, the SIC added, once a bench was constituted and seized of a matter on the judicial side, it could not be reconstituted in exercise of any administrative powers by the SC unless those members had recused themselves or there was some constitutional or legal bar requiring the reconstitution of the bench.
 
 

Otherwise, it would amount to stifling the independent view of an individual judge, the party argued. “Any effort to muffle disagreement or to silence dissent or to dampen an alternative viewpoint of a member on the bench, would shake the foundations of a free and impartial justice system, thereby eroding the public confidence on which the entire edifice of judicature stands,” the party emphasised.
According to the SIC, if the two dissenting members were excluded by the present CB, then under no provision or principle of constitutional and statutory law, could they be considered a part of the existing bench by fictional irrationality making it a 13-judge bench and then again by fictional irrationality counting their dismissal decision at the time of final adjudication. “There is no principle of the constitution or law that allows judges, by fiction, be considered to be sitting on a bench, hearing and adjudicating a particular case without these judges being actually present during such hearings,” it reasoned.
The SIC further argued that the July 2024 judgement was not delivered under pre-existing appellate jurisdiction as envisaged under Article 191A(3) and thus, the present challenges could not be considered review petitions to be transferred to the existing constitutional bench under Article 191A(5) of the Constitution. The review petitions must be heard and adjudicated by all the same serving judges who were part of the full court that delivered the July judgement, it emphasised.
Also, the SIC argued that since the constitutional bench under Article 191A(6) had not formulated any rules regulating its practice and procedure, the SC Rules, 1980, Order 26 dealing with review jurisdiction would apply to the CB under which the review applications have to be placed before the same bench that had delivered the original decision.

Just two days after India, without any evidence, blamed Pakistan over last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, Iran had offered to mediate between the two as tensions escalated.
A press release from the PM’s Office said the premier had a telephonic conversation with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.
“During their warm and cordial conversation, the prime minister conveyed his warm regards to Supreme Leader Ayatullah Khamenei and thanked President Pezeshkian for Iran’s sincere and brotherly diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions in South Asia. He particularly thanked the president for his telephone call to the prime minister last month as well as for sending Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to the region during the crisis,” the PMO said.
Strongly condemning India’s unprovoked attacks against Pakistan that led to the deaths of innocent civilians, including women and children, PM Shehbaz said the military had given a “responsible, measured yet befitting and forceful reply to the enemy”.
He said Pakistan had always desired peace and it was in this spirit that it had agreed to the ceasefire understanding with India and would remain committed to upholding it. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm resolve to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
However, PM Shehbaz expressed his concern over India’s attempt to unilaterally hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, which he pointed out was unlawful and constituted a “red line” for Pakistan as these waters were the lifeline for the nation.
“The prime minister emphasised that Jammu and Kashmir dispute remained the root cause of instability in South Asia. He called for its just resolution, in accordance with the UN Security Council’s resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, as key to enduring peace in the region.
“The president of Iran expressed heartfelt condolences over the loss of civilian lives. He welcomed the ceasefire understanding, while appreciating Pakistan’s efforts for peace. He said Iran was committed to promoting peace and stability in the region,” the PMO said.
It added that two leaders also exchanged views on Pakistan-Iran bilateral relations and agreed to enhance cooperation in all areas of shared interest, especially trade, connectivity, security and people-to-people contacts.
The Iranian president extended an invitation to PM Shehbaz to undertake an official visit to Tehran, which was accepted.
 






Meanwhile, DG Chaudhry told IRNA in an interview published today, the first by any Pakistani armed forces’ spokesperson to an Iranian outlet, that “Pakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
He added: “We should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers.”
 






According to IRNA, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the “importance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions”. He also “focused” on the recent visit of FM Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.
During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had met with PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir. He later also made a trip to New Delhi, reiterating his call for restraint.
 
 

The DG ISPR appreciated Tehran’s efforts and support to help de-escalate tensions in the region.
“We are pleased with all the efforts of the international community and brotherly countries, especially Iran, which played a role in reducing tensions,” he was quoted as saying.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
The Pakistani army spokesman emphasised that Iran and Pakistan “have very historical and brotherly relations and have always stood by each other in all challenges and trials”.
 
 

Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted that the two nations were “neighbouring and friendly countries that are in contact with each other on many issues and fields”.
“Pakistan is eager and pursues that the borders of the two countries are the borders of peace and friendship, and we look forward to it,” the DG ISPR told IRNA.
The military’s spokesperson stressed that Tehran and Islamabad were “cooperating together for lasting peace and stability in the region”.
President visits Gujranwala Cantonment
Separately, the ISPR said President Asif Ali Zardari visited Gujranwala Cantonment today where he lauded the “exemplary conduct and professional excellence” of the military in the successful execution of Marqa-i-Haq, acknowledging their “resolute determination and unshakable courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.
“He paid solemn tribute to the military and civilian martyrs who laid down their lives in defence of the motherland, affirming that their sacrifice remains a sacred trust and a source of enduring national pride. He underscored that the sons of the soil, fortified by the enduring spirit of the nation, stood with unwavering resolve to defend the motherland and thwarted hostile designs with exceptional valour and operational acumen.”
The president said history would bear witness to how, “within a matter of hours, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled aggression with unmatched precision and resolve, sending an unequivocal message” of the country’s strength, resilience and national unity.
During his interaction with officers and troops, the president commended their “exemplary morale, combat readiness and devotion to duty”.
The ISPR added that he extended congratulations on the successful culmination of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, and expressed “profound pride in the defenders of the nation, affirming that the people of Pakistan hold their brave soldiers in the highest esteem as the true custodians of national honour and sovereignty”.
 






Separately, PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif praised the armed forces and parliament for national unity.
A statement issued by the PML-N said Nawaz lauded the professionalism and bravery of the armed forces, saying they “defended the motherland like an iron wall against Indian aggression”.
“We offer our deepest gratitude to God for granting us success,” he was quoted as saying during a meeting with PML-N Parliamentary Leader in the Senate and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who called on him in Raiwind.
Nawaz also lauded the role of parliament, saying that “setting aside all political differences and speaking with one voice for the sake of national security” was a welcome and commendable step.
“By reflecting the emotions of 240 million citizens, the people’s representatives boosted the spirit of the brave armed forces,” he said.
He also commended Pakistani media for “presenting the truth before the world and exposing the enemy’s falsehoods”.
Senator Siddiqui briefed the PML-N president on the parliamentary party’s performance during the session. Nawaz underscored the importance of institutional collaboration, stating that parliament’s unified stance had reinforced national resolve and showcased Pakistan’s democratic maturity in times of crisis.

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
 
 

The military flare-up saw China expressing solid diplomatic support to Pakistan, but there wasn’t a country other than Israel to stand with India without hyphenating it with Pakistan. Reports said a day ago that finding itself friendless in the conflict, India has started taking revenge on countries who helped Islamabad in the recent military flare-up.
Amid the current situation, Bilawal posted on X that he was contacted earlier today by the prime minister who requested that the former top diplomat “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
Bilawal said he was honoured to accept the responsibility and remained committed to serving the country in “these challenging times”.
 






The PPP said the committee would also “inform the international community about Indian aggression and its false propaganda”.
 






The government has yet to share more details on who else would be included in the delegation and which specific countries would be engaged.
In a similar development, the Indian government announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
“Members of parliament from different parties, prominent political personalities and distinguished diplomats will be part of each delegation,” said a press release from India’s Press Information Bureau.
It said the following Indian lawmakers would lead the seven delegations: Indian National Congress’ Shashi Tharoor; Bharatiya Janata Party’s Shankar Prasad and Baijayant Panda; Dravid Munnetra Kazhagam’s Kanimozhi Karunanidhi; Janata Dal-United’s Sanjay Kumar Jha; Nationalist Congress Party’s Supriya Sule and Shiv Sena’s Shrikant Eknath Shinde.
Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire remains fragile.
US President Donald Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.
PM Shehbaz’s peace offer
A day ago, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered India to sit for a comprehensive dialogue to settle contentious issues, including Kashmir and joi­ntly fight terrorism, remi­nding New Delhi that the neighbouring countries fought three wars in the past and gained nothing but miseries of the people.
“After settling disputes like Kashmir and water distribution, we can talk on trade and counter-terrorism as Pakistan is the worst affected country by terrorism which lost 90,000 lives and over $150 billion economic losses,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing a ceremony marking Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanks­giving Day) at Pakistan Monument.
Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz had said, “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression. We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.”
