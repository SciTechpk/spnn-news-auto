The incident came to light after a video clip showing street vendors subjecting both brothers to torture went viral on social media. The suspected attackers were spotted holding clubs in their hands and beating the victims at a public place in Raiwind. One brother died of severe torture marks at the spot, while the other succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.
Ali Ahmed Awan, the lawyer representing the victims’ father, told Dawn.com a day prior that a total of six suspects were named in the case, out of which three — including the main suspect — had been arrested.
“Two of the suspects, Owais and Shahzad, were killed in a police encounter after their accomplices attempted to attack the police,” Awan said today. “The CCD is still searching for the rest of the suspects.”
No case has been registered regarding the police encounter yet, he said.
On August 22, a first information report (FIR) was filed on the complaint of the victims’ father at the Raiwind City Police Station under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, the incident occurred on August 21 at 5:45pm when the brothers were returning home and stopped to buy some fruit.
“Due to a dispute over money, the owner of the fruit cart … and his brother … began beating my sons and called some other people,” the complainant said.</p><small>2025-08-28 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620759-imran-khans-nephew-sent-on-14-day-judicial-remand-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's nephew sent on 14-day judicial remand in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

Under a proposed change, foreigners would not be allowed to stay for more than four years on student visas in the US.
Foreign journalists would be limited to stays of just 240 days, although they could apply to extend by additional 240-day periods — except for Chinese journalists who would get just 90 days.
The US, until now, has generally issued visas for the duration of a student’s educational programme or a journalist’s assignment, although no non-immigrant visas are valid for more than 10 years.
 
 

The proposed changes were published in the Federal Register, initiating a short period for public comment before they can go into effect.
Trump’s Department of Homeland Security alleged that an unspecified number of foreigners were indefinitely extending their studies so they could remain in the country as “‘forever’ students.”
“For too long, past administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the US virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars and disadvantaging US citizens,” the department said in a press statement Wednesday.
The department did not explain how US citizens and taxpayers were hurt by international students, who according to Commerce Department statistics contributed more than $50 billion to the US economy in 2023.
The United States welcomed more than 1.1 million international students in the 2023-24 academic year, more than any other country, providing a crucial source of revenue as foreigners generally pay full tuition.
A group representing leaders of US colleges and universities denounced the latest move as a needless bureaucratic hurdle that intrudes on academic decision-making and could further deter potential students who would otherwise contribute to research and job creation.
“This proposed rule sends a message to talented individuals from around the world that their contributions are not valued in the United States,” said Miriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.
“This is not only detrimental to international students — it also weakens the ability of US colleges and universities to attract top talent, diminishing our global competitiveness.”
Backlash
The announcement came as universities were starting their academic years with many reporting lower enrollments of international students after earlier actions by the Trump administration.
But Trump also heard rare criticism within his base when he mused Monday that he would like to double the number of Chinese students in the United States to 600,000 as he hailed warm relations with counterpart Xi Jinping.
His remarks marked a sharp departure from Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s earlier vow to “aggressively” rescind visas of Chinese students.
The State Department said last week it had overall revoked 6,000 student visas since Trump took office, in part due to Rubio’s targeting of campus activists who led demonstrations against Israel.
 
 

Trump has also suspended billions of dollars in federal research funds to universities, with his administration contending they have not acted against antisemitism, and Congress has sharply raised taxes on private universities’ endowments.
In a speech before he was elected, Vice President JD Vance said conservatives must attack universities, which he described as “the enemy.”
Trump, at the end of his first term, had proposed curbing the duration of journalist visas, but his successor Joe Biden scrapped the idea.</p><small>2025-08-28 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620760-saeed-ghanis-brother-remand-extended-by-three-days-in-govt-employee-assault-case' target='_blank'><strong>Saeed Ghani's brother remand extended by three days in govt employee assault case</strong></a><br><p>

The committee, chaired by Syed Naveed Qamar, was told by audit officials that the original Toshakhana rules from 1973 had been amended in violation of proper procedures. The Auditor General’s office had previously objected to the repeated changes.
Cabinet Division Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal explained that a new Toshakhana Act was enacted in 2024, which mandates that all gifts, except those of historical or cultural significance, must be auctioned.
“The law does not forbid accepting gifts, but requires their disposal through auction,” he clarified.
 







Probes improper rule amendments, flawed auctions and missing records

Mr Afzal added that a proposal for new amendments has been submitted under which dignitaries would not be allowed to accept gifts from foreign counterparts.
However, Mr Qamar, the acting chairman, noted that a complete ban was not practical. The committee decided to defer the audit objection until new amendments are made and rules are drafted for clarity.
 
 

The PAC also addressed the non-availability of Toshakhana records. The Cabinet Division secretary revealed that all records prior to 1997 were missing.
“As Secretary Cabinet it is also concerning for me that pre-1997, records are untraceable,” Mr Afzal told the meeting. He confirmed that records from 1997 onward have been provided to audit authorities and efforts were underway to trace earlier files through the National Archives.
The Auditor General confirmed that records after 1997 were available. The committee directed the division to present a final report on the missing files within 30 days.
Furthermore, the committee objected to the irregular auctions of Toshakhana items.
It noted the government’s failure to hold public auctions at least twice a year, instead conducting closed auctions for federal government and armed forces organisations.
 
 

Officials also noted these auctions were held without proper appraisals and that no auctions have occurred since 2018.
The meeting was presided over by Mr Qamar after the regular chairman, Junaid Akbar, declined to chair the session, saying he would not lead the proceedings for the day.
PCB audit review postponed
Meanwhile, the PAC postponed a review of audit objections related to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) because of its chairman Moshin Naqvi’s absence.
PCB officials informed the committee that the PCB chief, who is also an interior minister, was in a meeting with a visiting Belarusian delegation. The committee deferred the examination until his presence could be ensured.

Alcaraz, who could meet Djokovic in the semi-finals at Flushing Meadows if the draw follows the seedings, blew away Italy’s Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 in just one hour 36 minutes on the Arthur Ashe Stadium main court.
The 22-year-old Spanish second seed unfurled a stream of 32 winners in a dominant display against the 65th-ranked Bellucci, whose best performance in a Grand Slam came with a run to the third round at Wimbledon earlier this year.
“I played great to be honest, from the beginning until the last ball,” said Alcaraz, who will face another Italian, 32nd seed Luciano Darderi, in the next round.
“The less time I spend on court the better for me, to go to bed early,” he added.
 






Elsewhere on Wednesday, Serbian legend Djokovic kept his dream of a record 25th Grand Slam singles title alive after a four-set defeat of American qualifier Zachary Svajda.
Djokovic though was forced to dig deep after losing the first set before claiming a 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win.
Djokovic, 38, said that while not at his best, he is hoping to play himself into form as the tournament progresses.
“That’s what I’m hoping, the deeper I go into the tournament the better I feel about my game,” he said.
Djokovic’s victory sees him into the third round at the US Open for a record-equalling 19th time, where he will face Britain’s Cameron Norrie, who defeated Argentina’s Francisco Comesana 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 6-7 (0/7), 7-6 (7/4).
In other men’s action on Wednesday, Norwegian 12th seed Casper Ruud, the 2022 US Open finalist, exited to Belgium’s Raphael Collignon, losing 6-4, 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5.
Fourth seed Taylor Fritz advanced safely, beating South Africa’s Lloyd Harris 4-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2, 6-4, while American compatriot Frances Tiafoe, seeded 17, also progressed with a four-set defeat of qualifier Martin Damm.
Tiafoe won 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (8/10), 7-5.
‘No class’ rant
In the women’s draw, meanwhile, defending champion and world number one Aryna Sabalenka moved into the next round with a workmanlike display to dispatch unseeded Russian Polina Kudermetova 7-6 (7/4), 6-2.
Sabalenka started slowly but after taking the first set on a tie-break, asserted her control to pull away in the second. The Belarusian will play Canada’s Leylah Fernandez in the third round.
“The first set was super-tight, super-aggressive. I was glad I was able to handle that pressure and put it back to her. In the second set I felt much better in the return game.”
 






Elsewhere Wednesday’s Latvia’s 25th seed Jelena Ostapenko was upset 7-5, 6-1 by Taylor Townsend before unleashing a furious on-court tirade at the American.
Townsend said Ostapenko accused her of lacking “class” during her rant.
“She told me I have no education, no class, and to see what happens if we play each other outside of the US,” Townsend said.
“It was unfortunate, but, you know, it’s something I can put on my Tiktok.”
Ostapenko said on Instagram she had been angered by Townsend’s failure to acknowledge a net cord in her favour during the match.
In other matches, Britain’s Emma Raducanu continued her solid start to the tournament after dispatching Indonesian qualifier Janice Tjen in straight sets, winning 6-2, 6-1.
Tjen had become the first Indonesian player to reach the main draw of a Grand Slam in 21 years and followed that up with a first round upset of 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova.
But she was beaten comfortably by Raducanu, who is aiming to recapture the US Open title she won as an 18-year-old qualifier in 2021. Raducanu will face ninth seed Elena Rybakina in the next round.
While Tjen headed for the exit, another player from Southeast Asia, the Philippines’ Alexandra Eala, also saw her tournament come to an end.
Eala, the first player from the Philippines to win a Grand Slam singles match with her defeat of 14th seed Clara Tauson on Sunday, was beaten 6-4, 6-3 by Spain’s Cristina Bucsa.
Fourth seed Jessica Pegula is also into the third round after beating Russian Anna Blinkova 6-1, 6-3.
There was a win too for veteran Victoria Azarenka, the 36-year-old two-time Australian Open champion from Belarus, who defeated Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-3, 6-3.</p><small>2025-08-28 05:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/280901030a4807c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937787/irsa-turns-off-tap-at-tarbela-as-sindh-prepares-for-surge' target='_blank'><strong>Irsa ‘turns off’ tap at Tarbela as Sindh prepares for surge</strong></a><br><p>• Lower riparian takes measures to tackle inflows from swollen Indus tributaries at Guddu Barrage
• Irsa director says flood of about 650,000 cusecs likely at Guddu if current situation persists
HYDERABAD: As Sindh anticipates a very high flood between Sept 1 and 3 at Guddu Barrage — its first barrage on the Indus River — due to the swollen eastern rivers currently wreaking havoc in Punjab, the downstream province has asked the authorities to reduce outflows from Tarbela Dam to help it manage the deluge.
As multiple rivers submerge Punjab, Sindh has reached out to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) to reduce outflows from Tarbela and retain water at Chashma Barrage — a request accepted by the authority.
The provincial irrigation authorities are keeping an eye on flows generated in the Chenab, Sutlej, and Ravi rivers, as all these rivers converge in the Indus at Mithankot after passing the Panjnad Barrage built over the Jhelum River. At Panjnad, all tributaries of the Indus meet on their way to the sea through Sindh.
“As of today, I foresee a flow of between 650,000 and 700,000 cusecs at Guddu Barrage once the flows start reaching here from the eastern rivers,” Jam Khan, Sindh’s irrigation minister, told Dawn on the phone from Karachi. “Right now it is a guessing game because nobody knows how the rainfall pattern behaves but we are making full preparations and accordingly managing staff at the dykes,” he added.
Zarif Kharif, the Sindh irrigation secretary, said a similar situation was witnessed in 2014 when Khanki Barrage on Chenab reported 947,000 cusecs flow on Sept 7, 2014 and Sindh had received about 475,000 cusecs.
“This time, the situation is a bit different because Guddu passed a high flood of 510,798 cusecs on Aug 24. As of Wednesday, Guddu was still showing an upstream discharge of 335,196 cusecs, he said, adding that the flows would increase once water from Punjab reached the barrage.
 
 

In order to manage the surge, the secretary confirmed that they reached out to Irsa Director Operations Khalid Idrees Rana for controlling outflows at Tarbela. An outflow of 154,500 cusecs was recorded at Tarbela at 6am on Wednesday, which notably increased to 256,200 cusecs at 6pm. This, coupled with the Kabul River, will reach Sindh’s barrages within a few days.
Tarbela Dam had attained the maximum storage level of 1,550 feet on Aug 21. After Irsa started discharging flows, the dam’s level stood at 1549.66ft on Wednesday at 6pm. Against this backdrop, the irrigation secretary asked Irsa to retain water at Chashma so that Sindh could manage its flows from the swollen eastern rivers.
“Yes, we have reduced flows from Tarbela (at Sindh’s request), where 155,000 cusecs outflow was recorded at 8pm Wednesday,” the Irsa operations director told Dawn. He also confirmed that “storage can be taken slightly higher than maximum storage of 1,550 feet. We can take it to 1550.2 or 1550.3 feet for now,” he argued.
He said that a positive sign was that there were no back-up flows in the Chenab. “We are observing nullahs like Palkhu, Basantpur and Bhimber currently,” he said. He pointed out that in view of the current situation, a flood of 650,000 cusecs or so was likely at Guddu and that too may last five to six hours. “We are struggling to manage flows in a way that Guddu’s discharge should remain below 600,000 cusecs.”

According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data, no gold was imported in June or July. Only nine kilograms of gold worth $927,000 were imported in May — primarily shipments made before the SRO’s suspension.
In contrast, gold imports in July 2024 had stood at $2.2 million.
Jewellery exports have also plunged. PBS data shows exports totalled just $17,000 in July 2025, $27,000 in June, and $617,000 in May — down sharply from $2.6m in July 2024.

FPCCI warns of reputational damage, legal action from global buyers

Industry leaders say the situation has effectively paralysed the sector, with exporters unable to fulfill orders despite having received raw gold under legal contracts from international buyers.
Habib ur Rahman, the former chairman of the Pakistan Gems and Jewellery Traders and Exporters Association, cited an example involving a UAE-based company that had provided 860 grams of pure gold in March for manufacturing purposes. The order was to be delivered within 120 days, but 164 days had passed by August 19 without fulfilment.
The UAE firm has now demanded the return of its gold, warning that payment of $17,268 would only be released upon delivery of the jewellery. In a letter to Pakistan’s ambassador, the company expressed frustration over repeated halts in exports, comparing the situation unfavourably with its uninterrupted trade experience with Indian suppliers.
The disruption is causing international buyers to reconsider sourcing from Pakistan, leading to reduced orders and potential legal action, Mr Rahman warned.
In a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Atif Ikram Sheikh called for the immediate restoration of SRO 760 to protect the jewellery export industry.
He noted that many exporters had already received raw gold under legally binding contracts and had prepared jewellery for shipment when the notification was suspended without warning. This, he said, had disrupted supply chains and eroded global buyer confidence.
Mr Sheikh said a high-level government committee had reviewed past transactions under SRO 760 and found no misuse or irregularities. A clean report has been submitted, and the Ministry of Commerce has forwarded a summary recommending revival of the SRO, which is currently pending at the PM Office.
Patron-in-Chief of the United Business Group, S.M. Tanveer, warned that delays in reviving the SRO could trigger legal claims from buyers, result in market losses, and damage Pakistan’s reputation in the global gold trade. He urged the Prime Minister to authorise the SRO’s revival at least for pending export consignments.
“This is critical to restoring confidence, preserving Pakistan’s export markets, and protecting the country’s standing in international trade forums,” he said.

Speaking at a conference on “Building a Resilient Public Financial Management Ecosystem”, jointly organised by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA), Mr Aurangzeb emphasised that implementation, rather than policy debate, is now the government’s primary focus.
The new tax return form, published on the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) website for a 40-day public consultation, is expected to benefit nearly 80pc of salaried taxpayers. “Our goal is to make the tax system more people-friendly,” the minister said, urging stakeholders to provide feedback.
Mr Aurangzeb also announced that tax policy-making functions have been shifted from the FBR to the Ministry of Finance, a move aimed at enhancing strategic coherence and improving fiscal governance.

Aurangzeb unveils simplified returns which will benefit 80pc of salaried taxpayers

He called for rational and predictable taxation, warning against ad hoc measures used to plug revenue shortfalls. “Tax policy must be grounded in sound economic reasoning. Erratic decisions have long challenged the domestic industry,” he noted.
The finance minister outlined plans for a new industrial policy aimed at attracting long-term investment and rebuilding investor trust. “Inconsistent past policies have eroded confidence. We’re committed to delivering stable, forward-looking frameworks,” he said.
As part of ongoing reforms, Mr Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to accelerate privatisation, including the merger or closure of loss-making state-owned enterprises to reduce corruption and enhance institutional efficiency.
On trade, he said tariff reforms were underway to address the impact of excessive protectionism, which has hindered the competitiveness of local industries. “We must recalibrate policies to drive innovation and support global integration,” he said.
 
 

Highlighting broader national challenges, the minister identified population growth and climate change as the country’s most pressing existential threats. “Climate change is already unfolding in Pakistan. This is not a future concern,” he said, calling on the accounting community to support efforts to mobilise financing for sustainable development.
He also emphasised the importance of aligning Pakistan’s financial systems with international standards and pledged to expedite fiscal reforms to enhance governance and institutional accountability.
ICAP President Saif Ullah reiterated the institute’s commitment to transparency and capacity-building in the public sector. He thanked policymakers, development partners, and industry leaders for their collaboration in advancing governance reforms and embedding ESG principles.
Federal Minister for Climate Change Musadik Malik highlighted the need for sustainable practices, while Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali shared updates on public financial reforms. Ross Smith, Programme and Technical Director of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB), delivered a presentation on promoting transparency through global accounting standards.Other speakers included: ICAP Public Sector Committee Chairman Khalid Rahman; CIPFA Director International Khalid Hamid; SECP Chairman Akif Saeed; Additional Auditor General Dr Iram Anjum Khan; former SBP Governor Shahid Kardar; FBR Member Dr Najeeb Ahmad; former ICAP President Farrukh Rehman; Climate Change Secretary Aisha Humera Chaudhary; SECP Executive Director Musarat Jabeen; State Bank Director Dr Mian Farooq Haq; and Senior Financial Management Specialist Akmal Minallah.

• President asks Sindh to gear up for large flows; Nawaz asks lawmakers to help their constituents
• Minister announces compensation for Danyore nullah victims
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The co­­u­­ntry’s federal and provincial lea­d­ership is overseeing a coordinated em­ergency response to the unprecedented flood crisis across the country.
No province or territory has escaped the water’s wrath — be it destruction from flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, devastating glacial lake outburst floods in Gilgit Baltistan, crippling rains in Sindh or the overflowing rivers in Punjab.
Chairing an emergency meeting on Wedn­e­sday, Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif directed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to take immediate measures to address potential urban floo­ding in Punjab, particularly Lahore, Sialkot, and Gujrat.
 
 

The PM was briefed on high wat­er discharge pressure in the Ravi River at Jastar and Shahdara, and in the Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki, with monitoring stations also tracking conditions at Khanki, Balloki, and Qadirabad.
He emphasised the need to enhance flood and rainfall warning effectiveness, stressing timely information sharing between NDMA and Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) to minimise losses. He instructed key ministers and officials to reach Lahore immediately to ensure uninterrupted power supply, communication channels, and road restoration.
 
 

NDMA Chairman Lt-Gen Inam Haider Malik briefed the prime minister on pre-emptive evacuations, safe relocations, and relief supply delivery, while army personnel and police services have been engaged for damage mitigation in flood-affected Punjab areas.
Zardari directs Sindh preparations
In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed deep grief over the devastating floods, extending heartfelt condolences to families who suffered losses of life, property, livestock, and farms.
While appreciating the “exemplary valor and commitment” demonstrated by armed forces and eme­rgency rescue teams during this crisis, he specifically directed the government of Sindh — ruled by his own PPP — to immediately begin preparations to cope with the massive amount of water that is expec­ted to flow into the province in the coming days.
Expressing confidence in the nation’s resilience, President Zardari referenced Pakistan’s successful response to previous floods in 2010 and 2022, stating the country would overcome this trial with similar determination.
PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has reportedly directed the party’s federal and provincial ministers and lawmakers to immediately reach their constituencies and actively take part in flood relief activities. The directions came at a Sharif family meeting in Murree, where Nawaz, PM Shehbaz and CM Maryam discussed the devastation caused by the floods.
 
 

Nawaz Sharif reportedly asked the federal and Punjab governments to effectively coordinate with each other to deal with flood devastation and subsequent relief work.
Meanwhile, the Punjab chief mi­­nister spoke to commissioners and deputy commissioners via video link, and directed them to moblise all resources for rescue and relief operations in the areas affected by flood across the province. She asked the participants of the meeting to ensure tents, food and medicines for the people affected by the flood.
CM Maryam also visited Shah­d­ara to review the flood situation and inspect the safety dam and other measures taken by the administration.  The CM directed the administration and other relevant departments engaged in the rescue and relief activities to complete the evacuation process of the population and livestock from the river crossings at the earliest.
Muqam visits GB
Meanwhile, Kashmir, GB and Safron Minister Amir Muqam arrived in Gilgit on a three-day visit to monitor flood rehabilitation and relief activities, highlighting the ongoing threat posed by glacier lake outburst floods in the region.
During his visit, he met families of seven volunteers who lost their lives while attempting to restore water supply in the Danyore nallah. He announced Rs2 million in compensation for each slain volunteer’s family and promised the establishment of a memorial centre.
 
 

GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza briefed the Federal Minister on glacier lake vulnerability, noting that many downstream areas face risks of Glofs. The minister annou­nced that water supply to Danyore, Sultan­abad, and Mohammadabad would be restored soon as rehabilitation work continues.

Coupled with two other flood peaks in the Ravi and Sutlej rivers, both totalling half a million cusecs each, this peak now represents a rare meteorological event the likes of which we have seen only a few times in our history.
I counted up all the times the Indus river system — the main stem as well as the five eastern rivers — has seen a 1m cusec flood peak in recorded history. I found nine other instances since 1959 when the Indus river system saw a flood peak of around 1m cusecs or larger. Three of those instances were in the summer of 1959, when rains ravaged Jammu for months on end and the water coursed through the western rivers with relentless ferocity.
 
 

Over the next couple of days, this flood peak will converge at Punjnad in southern Punjab, from where it will then enter the main stem of the Indus river. This is the critical moment to watch out for. In 2022, Punjnad flooded under a flood peak of 200,000 cusecs, which was well below its stated capacity but nevertheless caused at least one embankment to collapse. Before that, in 2014, another flood peak of 415,000 cusecs caused an even larger flood. Now we wait to see what will happen when three flood peaks in three rivers totalling 1.5m cusecs converge on the same point.
After Punjnad, the waters will pass through the Guddu and then Sukkur barrages. Both of these structures are designed to handle 1.2m and 1.5m cusecs at a maximum, although given their age it would be a good idea if this limit were not to be tested.
The last time they saw a flood peak of such magnitude was in 2010, when just over 1.1m cusecs passed through them. Those were catastrophic floods, the worst Pakistan had probably ever seen, and the flood peak took many days to pass, rising and falling for more than a week. The current flood peak is comparable in size, but will likely pass in much less time than the one in 2010 so its risks are probably much lower.

Rather than heckling and abusing each other, the ruling political parties need to realise that they are all facing a common enemy: climate change.

Nevertheless, the stretch of territory lying between Punjnad and Sukkur Barrage is now at high risk of flooding.
Now we will see whether the provincial governments of Punjab and Sindh learned any lessons from the previous episodes of flooding, the most recent one being in 2022, and if they’ve done any work to strengthen the embankments along the river and introduced effective early warning systems to move vulnerable populations out of danger. If southern Punjab and northern Sindh once again resemble a catastrophe, the provincial governments should be made to answer for their failure to anticipate this event and upgrade the infrastructure accordingly.
 
 

In 2022, a number of embankments in Sindh around Manchhar Lake, Dadu and down to Thatta could not handle the pressure of the water flowing through the river. Have these been upgraded? We will soon find out.
In Punjab, in 2014, they had to breach almost 193 embankments in order to drain enough water out of the Chenab river to protect the city of Multan. That flood peak was smaller than the one coursing through the Chenab today. Soon we will find out whether the Punjab government has learned any lessons and strengthened its water infrastructure to withstand water flows of design capacity.
Technically, none of these breaches should have been necessary. Given the design capacities of the barrages, the associated infrastructure should have been able to handle flood peaks of the magnitude that flowed through the rivers in those years. Now we’ll find out whether that failure has been addressed or not.
 
 

This is the million cusec problem we are all facing now. Such flood events, which have thus far been rare, are becoming more frequent now. Since the super floods of 2010, there have been seven severe flooding events in Pakistan, which have resulted in large-scale displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, with millions impacted, thousands of acres of agricultural land destroyed and hundreds dead in their wake.
Following such flooding events comes a lasting impact measured in heightened food insecurity among the displaced population, higher rates of child malnutrition among them, greater stunting and greater vulnerability to disease. The story does not end once the floodwaters pass. In fact, for many, the story only begins at that point.
The worst, cheapest and most mindless reaction to these floods is to turn them into an opportunity to heckle, mock and abuse the political leadership of the ruling party in these provinces. For many people, this is the only mode of engagement possible in politics. What is needed is an environment of cooperation between the three main parties that control the three most populous provinces in the country. Each of them has seen a climate-related catastrophe this summer. Two of them are now seeing a second round as this flood surge makes its way down the Indus river system.
 
 

Rather than heckling and abusing each other, they need to realise that they are all facing a common enemy: climate change. They need to appoint serious individuals from among their midst to first tally up the nature of this threat in their particular province, then coordinate with their counterparts in the other provinces, and help draw up an action plan of what all is required to meet this challenge.
Much of what will be required will be actions under their control. Some of it will come under the federal government, such as upgrading weather forecasting to enable greater lead times to prepare before catastrophe strikes. But the old reflex to simply hurl abuse at each other must be resisted. If they cannot work together, at least don’t sink together.

Over the past week, as Punjab’s rivers have swollen, these technical terms have dominated official updates. Behind these terms lies a simple story about water, river capacity and the limits of infrastructure.
What is a cusec?
Flood levels are measured in cusecs — short for “cubic feet per second“.
One cusec equals the flow of one cubic foot of water every second, or about 28 litres.
Put simply, a flow of 100,000 cusecs means nearly 283,000 litres of water rushing past in just one second. On Wednesday, the Ravi at Jassar was recorded at 229,000 cusecs at one point — enough to overwhelm the river’s safe capacity.
How flood levels are decided
However, flood intensity is not judged by one number alone. It depends on the size of each river and how much water it can normally carry. Smaller rivers such as the Ravi and Sutlej reach critical levels quickly — 200,000 cusecs here is already “very high flood”.
Larger rivers such as the Chenab or the Indus can hold far more. At Head Marala, the Chenab swelled to over 750,000 cusecs this week and was declared in “very high flood”. By contrast, the Indus at Chashma carried 284,000 cusecs but remained below flood level, thanks to its massive capacity.

Medium vs high flood
Officials use categories to describe the severity of flooding:

Medium flood: The river is within capacity but under pressure.
High flood: Water far exceeds normal limits, threatening banks, farmland and villages.
Very high flood: Extreme pressure where engineers may need to breach embankments or canals to save a barrage.
Exceptionally high flood: The most dangerous category, when water flow is far beyond a river’s design capacity and poses a risk to major infrastructure and large populations.

What are headworks and barrages?
Headworks and barrages are built across rivers to regulate flow, divert water into canals and maintain levels for irrigation. Each has a design limit for maximum water passage.
If inflows exceed those limits, all gates are opened — but if pressure still builds, authorities may deliberately cut embankments or canals to protect the structure, even if that means sacrificing farmland or nearby villages.

Both exercises will need to converge on the local sources of Pakistan’s climate vulnerability and financing. The seesawing between the federation and provinces over the distribution of finances has cast a dark shadow over national climate and economic vulnerabilities. With the cost of reconstruction, development, debt and defence increasing, the resource trickle is dwindling further. Are there any lessons in the NFC awards to help respond to the PM’s lament?
 
 

Climate vulnerability at the district level has three basic drivers:
Population growth: In what constitutes Pakistan today, the population has exploded from 33.7 million in 1951 to 242.7m in 2025, and is projected to reach 380-403m by 2050, making it the world’s third most populous nation. This demographic explosion, coupled with economic stagnation and declining per capita income, creates escalating climate vulnerability.
Currently, 108m people, or 42.3 per cent of the population, according to a recent World Bank study, live below the poverty line with limited adaptive capacity.
Under business-as-usual scenarios, 190-200m people could be in poverty by 2050 — nearly half the projected population. In brief, every other child born in Pakistan will now be born to families below the poverty line — leaving them unable to afford climate adaptation and disaster recovery. This vast population spread in the high-risk areas of 169 districts with about 1,200 tehsils represents Pakistan’s most critical vulnerability driver.

Are there any lessons in the NFC awards to help respond to the PM’s lament?

Disproportionate exposure: The second key driver is the disproportionate concentration of the poor in high-risk areas. Data shows that in recent years, 18-26 districts have faced droughts in Balochistan and Sindh, 18 faced glacial lake outburst floods in Gilgit-Baltistan and KP, six faced tropical storms in Sindh and Balochistan and 84 districts were hit by floods across the provinces, not to mention urban flooding, forest fires, landslides and cloudbursts. Each district is exposed to two or more types of climate disasters.
 
 

The vulnerable populations are clustered in regions that are most susceptible to climate shocks, including low-lying floodplains, marginalised farmland and unauthorised settlements on riverbeds and urban peripheries. This geographical alignment guarantees that in the event of a climate disaster, the poor are hit first and the hardest, as their settlements are the most exposed and least resilient.
Limited adaptive capacity: Finally, low per capita income severely limits the adaptive capacity of our population. With a 2024 GDP per capita of just $1,485, and projections suggesting a decline to $1,200-$1,300 by 2050, the poor have virtually no financial buffer to absorb climate shocks.
The massive economic losses from climate events further drain resources, making it nearly impossible for individuals to invest in their assets: housing, livestock, standing crops, lives and microenterprises. This lack of financial capacity creates a vicious cycle of poverty and disaster.
Against this backdrop, what lessons can be drawn to respond to the PM’s remarks?
Incremental changes: Some answers by policy managers can be inferred: more resources for infrastructure to fill the financial gaps for recovery, reconstruction and rehabilitation from previous disasters; early warning systems; financing for the staggering 1,071 pending PC-1s; and upgradation of equipment or building new infrastructure. Other important elements include improved inter-agency cooperation, capacity-building, and access to international climate finance.
Many of these won’t be new lessons, but it is still important for each agency to develop and share its lessons. While these needs are necessary for government efficiency, where are the transformative lessons?
Transformative changes: Several initiatives remain trapped in approval processes: promoting land-use planning to guide human settlements away from low-lying flood-prone regions to designated safer areas; adaptive social protection to invest precious resources in damage prevention rather than post-disaster recovery; creation of sub-national disaster risk financing facilities; adoption of resilient construction standards; mandatory insurance for public sector infrastructure in PC-1 proposals; risk transfer and insurance mechanisms to prevent governments from harvesting unspent funds from development projects; and earnest implementation of climate risk screening for public sector portfolios.
 
 

The delays in their operationalisation and absence of prioritisation erode the synergistic impact necessary for transformative change. All of them, however, establish project-level, not policy-level, programmatic and strategic direction for our safe journey into the future.
Four transformative lessons: Pakistan’s climate adaptation demands structural governance transformation. Top-down interventions have failed to generate ownership. Globally, bottom-up initiatives by elected local governments increase implementation and accountability systems. Four key lessons emerge from entrusting district-level decision-making.
First, local communities, and not distant bureaucrats, must manage land-use planning at the tehsil and district levels. Second, locally developed zoning laws must protect shamilaat, communal and state lands from vested interests and ban high-risk development. Third, reclamation of the encroached commons must be achieved through local-level resilience management action plans that restore the natural flood management capacity. Fourth, districts must develop asset inventories as revenue sources using credible valuation mechanisms for standardised property assessments.
Given this scale, it’s the right time to establish a ‘National Reclamation Commission’ to develop a national framework and provincial guidelines for local actions.
Learning challenge: Learning is expensive. To learn from climate disasters, Pakistan must ‘unlearn’ destructive practices: ending floodplain encroachment and not treating communal lands as private profit centres. This process can be negotiated but requires decisive political pushback against powerful networks.
Despite decades of disasters, Pakistan repeats its mistakes: allowing encroachment, enabling elite capture, treating prevention as an expense rather than an investment. Lessons remain unlearned because learning requires confronting power, not merely studying flood patterns or providing relief assistance.
True climate adaptation demands political consensus and the courage to implement what we already know but refuse to do. Let the NFC award spearhead this transformation.

Trump on Monday said the United States was trying to pursue denuclearisation with both countries.
“I think the denuclearisation is a very – it is a big aim. But Russia is willing to do it and I think China is going to be willing to do it too,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
“We can’t let nuclear weapons proliferate. We have to stop nuclear weapons,” he added.

North Korea slams S. Korean president’s remarks on denuclearisation of peninsula

Russia and the United States — former Cold War rivals — possess almost 90 per cent of the world’s nuclear weapons between them, but Moscow pulled out of the last remaining arms control agreement with Washington in 2023.
When asked about Trump’s comments, Beijing’s foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Wednesday it was “neither reasonable nor realistic” to expect China to participate in trilateral nuclear disarmament negotiations with the United States and Russia.
“China and the United States are not at the same level at all in terms of nuclear capabilities,” Guo told reporters.
“The countries with the largest nuclear arsenal should earnestly fulfil their special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament,” he said.
Beijing says it favours disarmament in principle but has regularly rejected Washington’s invitations to join US-Russian talks on reducing their nuclear arsenals.
According to 2024 estimates by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the United States has 3,708 nuclear warheads and Russia 4,380, excluding retired warheads.
China had 500, 90 more than in 2023. Behind them were France (290) and Britain (225).
Beijing said on Wednesday it maintains its nuclear forces “at the minimum level required for national security, and does not engage in an arms race with any country”.
North Korea criticises South Korea president’s remarks
In a related development, North Korea called South Korean President Lee Jae Myung a “hypocrite” on Wednesday over remarks he made about the denuclearisation of the peninsula during a visit to the United States this week.
Since taking office in June, Lee has sought warmer ties with the nuclear-armed North and has vowed to build “military trust” with Pyongyang.
But North Korea has said it has no interest in improving relations with Seoul, a key regional security ally for Washington.
During his Monday visit to the Center for Strategic and International Studies in the American capital, Lee said Seoul and Washington’s alliance would be “upgraded to a global level” when “there is a path for denuclearisation, peace and coexistence on the Korean Peninsula”.
Since a failed summit with the United States in 2019, North Korea has repeatedly said it will never give up its nuclear weapons and declared itself an “irreversible” nuclear state.
Lee had “pretended that he had a will to restore the relations” with North Korea, but had revealed “his true colours as a confrontation maniac” and a “hypocrite” with his recent remarks, Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.
Lee’s mention of “denuclearisation is little short of a naive dream like trying to catch a cloud floating in the sky,” it added.
After meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in Tokyo last week, Lee also said the two countries — both security allies of Washington — had “reaffirmed our shared commitment to the complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula”.
KCNA said on Wednesday that North Korea would “remain unchanged in our stand not to abandon the nuclear weapons, the prestige and honor of the state”.
During his meeting with Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, Lee asked the US president — who has often boasted of his personal relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — to help make peace between the North and South.
“The only person who can make progress is you Mr President,” Lee said, adding: “If you become the peacemaker, then I will assist you by being a pacemaker.” Kim’s 2019 summit with Trump in Hanoi, Vietnam, which discussed North Korea’s denuclearisation, collapsed because the two sides disagreed on what Pyongyang would concede in return for sanctions relief.
During his meeting with Lee, Trump — who met Kim three times in his first term — said he hoped to meet again with the North Korean leader, possibly this year.
Trump once famously said he and Kim had fallen “in love”, but ultimately failed to yield a lasting agreement.
Kim has since been emboldened by the war in Ukraine, securing critical support from Russia after sending thousands of North Korean troops to fight alongside Moscow.

Aside from Russian President Vladimir Putin, leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, to be held in the port city of Tianjin from Aug 31 to Sept 1.
 
 

The summit will feature Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first visit to China in more than seven years as the two neighbours work on further defusing tensions roiled by deadly border clashes in 2020, though the former last shared the same stage with Xi and Putin at last year’s BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia.
Russian embassy officials in New Delhi said Moscow hopes trilateral talks with China and India will take place soon.
“Xi will want to use the summit as an opportunity to showcase what a post-American-led international order begins to look like and that all White House efforts since January to counter China, Iran, Russia, and now India have not had the intended effect,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of China-Global South Project, a research agency.
 
 

This year’s summit will be the largest since the SCO was founded in 2001, a Chinese foreign ministry official said.
Modi is expected to depart after the summit, while Putin will stay on for a World War Two military parade in Beijing later in the week.

“This unconscionable and heinous attack on a medical facility, as well as the continued targeting of civilians and journalists, represents a grave violation of international human rights and humanitarian law, as well as freedom of the press,” the Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement.
“We reiterate our call on the international community to hold Israel accountable for such heinous crimes and to take concrete steps towards ending Israel’s impunity,” the spokesperson said.
 






Israel struck Nasser Hospital in the south of the Gaza Strip on Monday, killing at least 20 people, including five journalists who worked for Reuters, Associated Press, Al Jazeera and others.

Terms Nasser Hospital attack ‘unconscionable’, grave violation of human rights

Global media and humanitarian organisations condemned the attack. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that at least 189 Palestinian journalists have been killed during the 22-month conflict.
Meanwhile, the United Nations insisted on Tuesday that Israel must not only investigate alleged unlawful killings in Gaza but also ensure those probes yield results.
“There needs to be justice,” United Nations rights office (OHCHR) spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told reporters in Geneva, adding that the large number of media workers killed in the Gaza war “raises many, many questions about the targeting of journalists”.
 
 

Pakistan also condemned in the strongest possible terms the Israeli occupying forces’ incursion into the Syrian Arab Republic in contravention of international law and principles of the UN Charter.
Pakistan expressed its full support for the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria, and called on the international community to prevent Israel from undermining the peace and stability of the entire region.
On Wednesday, Syria also condemned an Israeli drone strike that killed six soldiers the previous day, calling it a “clear violation” of the country’s sovereignty.
Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria since an alliance of opposition forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December. It has also opened talks with the interim authorities in Damascus.
In a statement, Syria’s foreign ministry called the strike “a gross violation of international law and the United Nations Charter”.
It added that the attack represented “a clear breach of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic”.
State television reported six army personnel “were killed in strikes by Israeli occupation drones” near Kisweh, outside Damascus in the Tuesday attack.

• Save the Children chief says starving children are too weak to even cry
GAZA CITY: The Israeli military pressed operations around Gaza City on Wednesday, as President Donald Trump prepared to host a White House meeting on post-war plans for the shattered Palestinian territory.
Israel is under mounting pressure both at home and abroad to end its almost two-year campaign in Gaza, where the military is preparing to conquer the territory’s largest city and the United Nations has declared a famine.
Mediators have circulated a draft ceasefire and prisoner deal that has been accepted by the Palestinian group Hamas, but Israel has yet to give an official response. Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari on Tuesday said that mediators were still “waiting for an answer” from Israel.
On the ground, the Israeli military said its troops were “operating on the outskirts of Gaza City to locate and dismantle terror infrastructure sites above and below ground”.
Israeli army’s Arabic-language spokesman, Avichay Adraee, wrote on X that the evacuation of Gaza’s largest city was “inevitable”.
The vast majority of Gaza’s population has been displaced at least once during the war, and aid groups working in the territory consider the plan “unrealistic and dangerous”.
 






The UN estimates that nearly a million people currently live in Gaza City and its surroundings in the north of the territory.
Residents of Gaza City’s Zeitoun neighbourhood spoke of heavy Israeli bombardment overnight. “Warplanes struck several times, and drones fired throughout the night,” said Tala al-Khatib, 29.
 
 

“Several homes in Zeitoun were blown up. We are still in our house — some neighbours have fled, while others remain. But wherever you flee, death follows you,” she said.
AFP footage on Wednesday showed thick smoke rising into the sky following air strikes on the Abu Iskandar and Sheikh Radwan neighbourhoods in the north of Gaza City.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz last week announced that the forces would destroy the city if Hamas did not agree on terms acceptable to Israel. The announcement was made after the ministry approved the military’s plan to seize the city.
‘Comprehensive plan’
Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said the US president was hosting top officials at the White House on Wednesday to thrash out a detailed plan for post-war Gaza.
“We’ve got a large meeting in the White House, chaired by the president, and it’s a very comprehensive plan we’re putting together on the next day,” Witkoff said on Fox News, without disclosing more details.
Trump stunned the world earlier this year when he suggested the United States should take control of the Gaza Strip, clear out its inhabitants and redevelop it as seaside real estate, which sparked an outcry in Europe and the Arab world.
As Israel’s security cabinet convened on Tuesday evening, tens of thousands of protesters massed in Tel Aviv to demand an end to the war.
Death toll nears 63,000
Since October 2023, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 62,895 Palestinians, including hundreds of journalists, according to figures from the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza that the United Nations considers reliable.
At least 51 more Palestinians, including 12 waiting for aid, were killed on Wednesday, according to Al Jazeera. Gaza’s health ministry the total number of deaths due to famine and malnutrition has reached 313, 119 of whom were children, over past two months.
The head of Save the Children described in horrific detail on Wednesday the slow agony of starving children in Gaza, saying they are so weak they do not even cry.
Addressing a Security Council meeting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the president of the international charity, Inger Ashing, said famine in Gaza was not just a dry technical term. “When there is not enough food, children become acutely malnourished, and then they die slowly and painfully. This, in simple terms, is what famine is,” said Ashing.
She insisted aid groups have been warning loudly that famine was coming as Israel prevented food and other essentials from entering Gaza over the course of two years of war. “Yet our clinics are almost silent. Now, children do not have the strength to speak or even cry out in agony. They lie there, emaciated, quite literally wasting away,” said Ashing.
“Everyone in this room has a legal and moral responsibility to act to stop this atrocity,” she said.
The UN officially declared famine in Gaza on Friday, blaming what it called systematic obstruction of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of war.
A UN-backed hunger monitor, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative, said famine was affecting 500,000 people in the Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory. The IPC projected that the famine would expand by the end of September to cover around two-thirds of Gaza.

• ADB president says ready to assist in launch of inaugural Panda Bond, welcomes market diversification efforts
ISLAMABAD: Paki­stan on Wednesday sought deeper collaboration and fresh support for policy-based lending from the Asian Development Bank for vast sectors of the economy, from climate to infrastructure to resource mobilisation, thro­ugh global capital instruments, like green bonds and debt-for-nature swaps, under the new 10-year partnership.
The wish-list for future direct financial support and collaborations for market-based financing instruments was shared by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb with ADB President Masato Kanda — a former finance minister of Japan — during his maiden visit to Pakistan after assuming the charge of his office in February this year.
Senator Aurangzeb discussed “Pakistan’s priorities for deeper collaboration with ADB across key areas, including energy transition, climate resilience, transport and logistics, human capital development, and resource mobilisation”, an official statement said.
The minister also welcomed ADB’s strong medium-term commitment to Pakistan and encouraged enhanced collaboration in policy-based financing, capital markets development, private sector participation, and innovative instruments, such as green bonds, blended finance, and debt-for-nature swaps.
 
 

The finance minister emphasised the importance of ADB’s partnership in supporting the government’s PPP pipeline and sectoral reforms to build long-term resilience. The two sides are currently in the process of 10-year Country Partnership Strategy (2026-35) on the pattern of a similar $20 billion long-term financing collaboration with the World Bank over the 2026-35 period announced in January this year.
The finance minister reassured the ADB president of Pakistan’s strong commitment to reforms in taxation, tariff rationalisation, SOE restructuring, and regulatory modernisation, while appreciating ADB’s role as a dependable and long-standing development partner. The minister “extended an invitation for enhanced collaboration under the upcoming ADB Country Partnership Strategy 2026-2035, aligned with Pakistan’s medium-term development priorities”, the statement said.
In reciprocation, the ADB president expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s economic reforms and resilience, commending the progress achieved in stabilising the economy and advancing structural reforms.
“He assured ADB’s continued support in key areas, including climate change adaptation, population challenges, infrastructure development, and resource mobilisation,” a statement issued by the finance ministry said.
Mr Kanda also welcomed Pakistan’s efforts towards market diversification and pledged ADB’s readiness to assist in the launch of the inaugural Panda Bond and other innovative financing instr­­­­­uments.
The ADB president reaffirmed ADB’s willingness to partner with Pakistan on its reform agenda, emphasising that ADB would continue to work closely with the Government of Pakistan to ensure sustained progress and prosperity.
The minister expressed his gratitude to the ADB president for prioritising Pakistan and choosing to visit it as the first country after assuming office, recalling with appreciation his earlier meetings with the president in Washington in April this year.
He also appreciated the ADB country team led by Emma Fan for their constructive engagement and continued support extended to the Ministry of Finance and the Government of Pakistan in advancing economic reforms and development priorities.
 
 

Senator Aurangzeb briefed the delegation about Pakistan’s steady economic progress despite multiple challenges in recent years, saying Pakistan had successfully stabilised its macroeconomic framework, with inflation declining sharply, a turnaround in the current account, and recent upgrades in Pakistan’s sovereign ratings by international credit agencies, which have helped lower the cost of borrowing.
He also acknowledged ADB’s continued and substantial support to Pakistan in recent years, pointing to the Bank’s strong backing for reforms in resource mobilisation, women’s financial inclusion, disaster risk financing, and the clean energy transition.

The office cited legal lacunas, including the abs­e­nce of a duly signed pow­er of attorney, as the reason for rejecting the plea.
The petition was moved under Article 184(1) of the Constitution which grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction to hear disputes between two or more governments through declaratory judgements.
In his plea, the KP chief minister sought directives for the federal government to allow him to meet the PTI founder for consultation and guidance on matters relating to the governance of the province. The petition contended that Imran Khan has been “illegally detained” in the Rawalpindi prison since August 2023.
The petition named the federal government through the interior ministry, Punjab chief secretary and Adiala Jail superintendent as respondents.
 
 

This was the KP chief minister’s second such attempt. Earlier, on June 25, Mr Gandapur had entered a court proceeding in the middle of a case to seek the urgent attention of senior puisne judge Syed Mansoor Ali Shah over what he described as being denied a meeting with Imran Khan for consultation on provincial budget.
According to media reports, the KP chief minister has not been allowed to meet the PTI founder for several months.
Mr Gandapur had also filed a similar petition before the Supreme Court, seeking a declaration that the respondents — the federal government, Punjab chief secretary and Adiala Jail superintendent — be directed to arrange his meetings with Imran Khan, arguing that denial of regular access to the PTI founder amounted to a violation of articles 9 and 10A of the Constitution.
 
 

The petition had requested the apex court to direct the respondents to ensure compliance with any judicial order regarding visitation rights, stressing that the chief minister’s role necessitated consultation with the party’s founding chairman.
It contended that the restriction on access undermined the democratic rights of PTI members and supporters, who represent over one-fourth of Pakistan’s population, adding that the failure of earlier petitions filed in the Islamabad High Court on the same subject underscored the urgency and necessity of the Supreme Court’s intervention.

LAHORE: Large swa­thes of Punjab are submerged as catastrophic flooding in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers forced hundreds of thousands from their homes, causing significant damage to infrastructure and devastates millions of acres of agricultural land.
The three trans-boundary rivers have swollen to exceptionally high levels due to a combination of heavy rains and the excess water India is releasing from dams, which then flows across the border.
The crisis, which affects central districts, now threatens south Punjab as the combined thrust of four rivers is set to converge on Thursday.
The flooding has prompted the government to call in the army for assistance in eight districts: Sialkot, Narowal, Hafizabad, Sargodha, Lahore, Kasur, Okara and Faisalabad.
 
 

Gujranwala’s commis­sio­ner said in a statement 15 people have lost their lives in the floods, including five in Sialkot, four in Gujrat, three in Nar­owal, two in Hafiza­bad and one in Gujranwala.
Official figures confirm that over 150,000 people and 35,000 livestock heads were shifted to safe places, and relief camps, along with medical and veterinary camps, were established in flood-affected areas.
Punjab estimates that over 600,000 people have been affected, while UN-OCHA said the death toll from this monsoon season is almost three times the fatalities recorded in the same period last year.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said 39,638 people were evacuated from different districts, including Sialkot, Sargo­dha, Chiniot, Gujran­wala, Nankana, Hafiza­bad, Man­di Bahauddin, Guj­rat, Lahore, Narowal, Ka­­s­ur, Okara, Pakpattan, Ba­h­­­a­­walnagar, Vehari, Bah­­a­­w­alpur and Lodh­ran.
As of midnight Thur­sday, three points were classified under “exceptionally high flood”: Khanki Headworks on the Chenab River, with an outflow of 966,427 cusecs and a falling trend; Qadirabad Headworks on the Chenab, with 1,054,883 cusecs on a steady trend; and Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River, recording 261,053 cusecs, also steady.
A cusec is a volume  equ­­­i­valent to one cubic foot, or 28 cubic litres, per second.
The Ravi River at Jassar was in “very high flood”, with a steady outflow of 166,500 cusecs. “High flood” was reported at Marala on the Chenab, with 246,970 cusecs and a falling trend, and at Shahdara on the Ravi, with 99,700 cusecs on a rising trend.
 
 

Meanwhile, “medium flood” conditions were observed at Balloki on the Ravi, recording 82,070 cusecs with a rising trend, and at Sulemanki on the Sutlej, with 109,305 cusecs on a steady trend.
The PDMA on Wednes­day warned of a possible breach at the Qadirabad He­­adworks, raising fears of severe flooding in Hafiz­abad and Chiniot districts.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said water pressure at the headworks had been increasing steadily, creating a critical situation. “If the structure gives way, both Hafizabad and Chiniot will be badly affected,” he cautioned.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia told rep­orters that a major flood surge is moving through the river system, with key infrastructure remaining secure and large-scale evacuations underway in vulnerable areas.
He said the Head Ma­­r­a­­la structure is safe, and water levels there are now receding, while the flood surge is currently passing through Khanki Head­works and is expected to reach the Panjnad area without causing damage.
DG Kathia reported that approximately 150,000 pe­­o­ple have been relocated to secure locations so far. He said the government has allocated Rs 900 million for emergency response.
 


Affected areas
More than 150,000 people have been affected in 333 villages along the banks of the Chenab River. Some 133 villages in Sialkot, 16 in Wazirabad, 20 in Gujrat, 12 in Mandi Bahauddin, 100 in Chiniot and 52 in Jhang have been worst affected due to the flood.
Some 380,768 citizens from 335 villages along the banks of the Sutlej River have been affected by the floods. As many as 104 relief camps and 105 medical camps are functioning to help and provide care to the flood victims.
The cities affected due to the flood in the Sutlej River include Kasur, Oka­ra, Pakpattan, Multan, Vehari, Bahawalnagar and Bahawalpur.
Some 72 villages and 450,000 people in Kasur district, 12 villages in Pakpattan, 23 in Vehari, 75 in Bahawalnagar and 15 villages in Bahawalpur were badly affected by the high level of flooding in the Sutlej River.
The Communication and Works Department rep­or­ted that several highways were submerged in the flood-affected districts, particularly Narowal, Shakargarh and Sialkot.
The Sialkot-Pasrur dual carriageway has been submerged for nearly one kilometre, while at Kotli Cha­hoor, the Naala Dek emb­ankment breach has affec­ted the highway and the Kona Drain Bridge was also damaged.
According to BBC Urdu, the Ravi swelled with wat­er flowing in from Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir, submerging dozens of villages in Narowal district.
According to residents and rescue workers, bet­w­een 35 and 40 villages in Na­­rowal have been subm­erged due to the rising river.
Local journalist Raheel told the BBC that the surge in the Ravi had inundated parts of the Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib complex under several feet of water.
Sikh pilgrims and employees who had come to the gurdwara were trapped in the flood.
Planning Minister Ah­­san Iqbal, Narowal Deputy Commissioner Syed Has­san Raza and Provincial Minister for Minority Affa­irs Punjab Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora supervised the Kartarpur rescue operation and rescued the people trapped in the flood.
Four teams rescued more than 150 Sikh pilgri­­ms and employees of Gurd­wara Darbar Sahib and shi­­­fted them to a safe place.
The Narowal-Shakar­garh road was also submerged along a three- to four-kilometre stretch, leaving surrounding villages completely cut off.
In Zafarwal tehsil of Narowal, dozens of villages were reported underwater due to the overflowing streams. The town of Kanjroor, with a population of nearly 20,000, was said to be at high risk of flooding.
Rising waters in Nala Dek have worsened the sit­uation, with protective em­­bankments breached at se­­veral points and the bri­dge at Hanjli comple­t­e­­ly wa­­s­hed away. The overflowing stream has also inundated parts of rural Sialkot, disrupting the Chawinda-Zafarwal road.
The Ravi’s floodwaters have spread downstream, affecting Sheikhupura, Na­­nkana Sahib and Oka­ra, while also threatening Faisalabad’s Tandlian­wa­­la tehsil and parts of Sahiwal.
In Nankana Sahib, areas including Hira, Jattan Da­­wara, Nawan Kot, Khizra Abad and Lalo Ana were inundated, alongside Shei­­kh Datol, Gujran da That­­ta, Khoh Sadiq, Dera Hak­im and Dera Mehr Ashraf.
In Okara, floodwaters from the Ravi entered Jandran Kalan village, home to more than 30,000 people, as well as Jehdu and Jhandu Manj.
In Faisalabad, authoriti­­es warned that Ravi floodwaters could affect Tand­l­ianwala tehsil, with over 100 settlements at risk, including Basti Jamun Dol­on, Jali Taryana, Jali Fat­yana, Mari Patan, Shi­raza and Thatta Dokaan. Floods in the Chenab Riv­er have impa­cted districts including Sialkot, Mandi Baha­uddin, Sargo­dha, Gu­­jrat, Wazir­abad, Hafiz­abad, Chiniot and Jhang.
Wazirabad-based journalist Aqeel Lodhi told BBC Urdu that Chenab waters had entered parts of the city, severely affecting Sohdra and surrounding areas. In northern Sialkot, the Bajwat region — situated between the Chenab and the Tawi rivers — was heavily inundated, submerging nearly 70 villages. Rescue officials confirmed that access roads linking these villages to Sialkot city were completely cut off.
Rescue, relief operations
A meeting chaired by Pu­­njab Chief Minister Ma­­r­­yam Nawaz was infor­med that some 601,126 citizens of 769 villages of the province had been affe­c­ted due to floods in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers.
Some 263 relief camps and 161 medical camps have been established to help and look after the flood victims, along with providing them with food, medical treatment and temporary shelters.
Food, water and other items are being provided to the flood victims in Sam­­­brial, Sialkot and Pasrur.
An operation has been carried out to relocate citizens from other flood-affected areas, including Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, and Pulkho Nullah Wazirabad.
Pakistan Army, district administration, police, Rescue 1122, PDMA and other relevant departments are jointly participating in the rescue and relief operation.

The incident went viral on social media when a video clip showed some street vendors subjecting both brothers to severe torture on a road in the Raiwind area a few days back. They were lying in a pool of blood, and the suspected attackers, holding clubs in their hands, were spotted torturing them at a public place with many onlookers and passersby standing around. One brother died of severe torture marks at the spot, while the other succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.
The main suspect was arrested and handed over to the Crime Control Department (CCD) on Tuesday.
Ali Ahmed Awan, a lawyer representing the victims’ father, told Dawn.com that police have arrested the main suspect from Sahiwal.
 






“A total of six suspects are named in the case and so far, three have been arrested,” Awan said. “Police arrested the suspect from Sahiwal with the help of modern technology.”
The lawyer added that the suspect fled Raiwind after the incident and went into hiding in Sahiwal.
“The police are cooperating with us and we are satisfied with their performance,” Awan said. “Police raids are also being carried out to arrest the other suspects.
“All the suspects should be arrested and strict action should be taken,” he continued.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was filed on the complaint of the victims’ father on August 22 at the Raiwind City Police Station under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
It said the incident occurred on August 21 at 5:45pm when the brothers were returning home and stopped to buy some fruit. “Due to a dispute over money, the owner of the fruit cart … and his brother … began beating my sons and called some other people,” the complainant said.
In June, Karachi police arrested a main suspect along with his two employees over charges of beating a citizen after a video of the incident went viral on social media, prompting authorities to take notice of it.</p><small>2025-08-27 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/27220529af8f4ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937655/three-dead-17-injured-in-shooting-at-minneapolis-catholic-school-authorities-say' target='_blank'><strong>Three dead, 17 injured in shooting at Minneapolis Catholic school, authorities say</strong></a><br><p>A black-clad gunman killed two children and wounded 17 other people on Wednesday when he opened fire on students attending Mass at a Minneapolis Catholic school, authorities said.
The assailant, a man in his early 20s, fired dozens of rounds through the church windows and then took his own life, officials said. He was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol, they said.
“This was a deliberate act of violence against innocent children and other people worshipping. The sheer cruelty and cowardice of firing into a church full of children is absolutely incomprehensible,” Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told reporters.
The shooting occurred two days after school started at Annunciation Catholic School, a private elementary school with about 395 students, connected to a Roman Catholic church in a residential area in the southeast part of
Minnesota’s largest city.
Local TV showed parents ducking under yellow police crime tape and leading students out of the school.

Officials said the shooter did not have an extensive criminal history. They did not provide his name and said they were trying to identify a motive. Law enforcement was investigating multiple online videos to determine if they were posted by the shooter, according to two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Local hospitals said they were treating 15 children and two adults, with many suffering gunshot wounds.
School shootings occur on a regular basis in the US, spurring ongoing debates about gun laws and school safety. There have been more than 140 such incidents so far this year, according to the K-12 School Shooting Database.
“Don’t just say this is about thoughts and prayers right now. These kids were literally praying. It was the first week of school. They were in a church,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a news conference, visibly angry.
Earlier, police and paramedics were responding to an active shooter situation at a church, local news reported, citing the Minneapolis Police Department.
“There is no active threat to the community at this time. The shooter is contained,” the City of Minneapolis said on X.
The shooting occurred at the Annunciation Church, which is also home to a grammar school.
“The families of children at the school can go to the reunification zone at the Annunciation School,” the city said in a second post on X.
 






Meanwhile, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said in a post on X that he had been briefed on the shooting and would continue to provide updates.
“I’m praying for our kids and teachers whose first week of school was marred by this horrific act of violence,” Walz said, without providing details on potential victims.
 






Later, United States President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he had been fully briefed on the incident and that the White House “will continue to monitor the terrible situation”.
 


“The FBI quickly responded and they are on the scene,” Trump added. “Please join me in praying for everyone involved!”
The confirmed shooting comes after a wave of false reports of active shooters at US college campuses around the country as students return from summer break.</p><small>2025-08-27 17:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/27220959ab223f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937671/afghanistan-bus-crash-kills-25-injures-27-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>Afghanistan bus crash kills 25, injures 27: authorities</strong></a><br><p>At least 25 people were killed and 27 injured when a bus overturned in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, authorities told AFP, a week after the country’s deadliest road accident in years.

Qani said 25 people were killed and 27 were being treated at hospitals for injuries, the extent of which was not specified.
Deadly traffic crashes are common in Afghanistan, due in part to poor roads after decades of conflict, dangerous driving on highways and a lack of regulation.
Last Tuesday, 78 people, including more than a dozen children, were killed in western Herat province when a bus carrying migrants returning from Iran collided with a motorcycle and a truck, according to authorities.

The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in July and August disqualified a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots against Imran’s arrest, sparking protests in the National Assembly.
NA Director General (Media) Zafar Sultan Khan told Dawn.com today that Ali Asghar Khan and Faisal Amin had sent their resignations as standing committee members to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
A statement from PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar also said: “PTI members of the National Assembly have started acting on the instructions of founding chairman Imran Khan. PTI members of standing committees have started sending their resignations. Many members have submitted their resignations to the National Assembly Secretariat.”
He said the remaining lawmakers would send their resignations to the NA Secretariat tomorrow.
The resignation announcement took place following a meeting of PTI’s political committee that ended at 3:30am this morning, according to PTI MNA  Sanaullah Khan Mastikhel.
The MNA today said that PTI members were resigning from memberships and chairmanships of all standing committees.
“PTI has resigned from the PAC (Public Accounts Committee) and other committees,” he said in a video announcement before the Public Accounts Committee meeting, adding that political matters would be handed over to the political committee for further consultation.
According to the opposition leader’s chamber, the decision on resignations had been made, and members, including Junaid Akbar, had written their resignations, but the resignations had not been formally submitted to the speaker as yet.
Confirming his move to Dawn.com, Akbar said there was no room nor desire for any other decision once Imran had ordered the resignations. “There is no use in remaining in the standing committees if there is no momentum towards further relief for Imran or his release.”
Meanwhile, Mastikhel added that the resignation from the committees was decided on the instructions of Imran after a meeting of four and a half hours, extending his thanks to the PTI founder for reposing his full trust in the political committee.
“As the decision was taken in the late hours of the night, today we also have a parliamentary party meeting … whatever Mr Khan orders, we will follow accordingly,” he said.
 
 

Mastikhel also added that the second decision made by the political committee was to field a candidate in the vacant seat of the late Mian Azhar’s constituency following his death.
The late Azhar’s son, Hammad Azhar, clarified in a post on X yesterday that the decision to boycott by-elections was due to the PTI members in those areas being “unjustly disqualified”, while the matter of Mian Azhar’s natural death was a different case, according to Imran.
“He (Imran) also said that due to the demise, someone from Mian Azhar’s family or a candidate nominated by Hammad Azhar will contest the election from here,” Hammad added.
 






Chairman Junaid Akbar did not attend the PAC meeting today, where the Cabinet Division, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) audit objections were under consideration. The meeting instead took place under the chairmanship of Naveed Qamar.
The political committee expressed deep concern over the daily hearings related to the Toshakhana trial in Adiala Jail, saying they would “affect the fundamental rights of the accused” and create obstacles in the delivery of justice.
“The PTI considers the members disqualified in the May 9 cases as its true representatives,” the committee added, saying it would boycott by-elections being held in the constituencies of disqualified members.
According to the announcement, elections will be held in the NA-129 constituency of Lahore.
Earlier this month, members of the opposition party staged a vociferous protest in the NA against the continuing convictions of its leaders and subsequent disqualifications of its lawmakers.
Tarar says PTI lawmakers should not resign
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’ that PTI MNAs should not resign from standing committees, saying he particularly attended every session of the Senate standing committee by Barrister Ali Zafar out of respect and the government complied with his orders.
He also appreciated the input of PTI lawmakers in standing committees and said attempts were always made to engage them in dialogue and address their concerns.
“I think the standing committees have a very important role so they should review the decision to resign from them.”
Meanwhile, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja blamed the government as well for the decision to resign from the standing committees, saying the orders of committee chairmen were not heeded.
He also alleged there was no use to contesting the by-elections since the results were already rigged and predecided.</p><small>2025-08-27 16:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620670-pti-lawmakers-start-quitting-parliamentary-committees-on-imrans-orders' target='_blank'><strong>PTI lawmakers start quitting parliamentary committees on Imran's orders</strong></a><br><p>
