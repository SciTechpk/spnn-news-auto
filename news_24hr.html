Passengers jumped overboard with lifejackets after the fire broke out on Sunday at the stern of the KM Barcelona 5, as it sailed to Manado, according to the Indonesian coast guard.
A video released by the Manado rescue agency showed a coast guard vessel spraying water on the ferry, which was emitting black smoke.
Indonesian authorities previously reported five people died in the accident, but later revised the death toll to three.
“Until now, the joint rescue team is still conducting the search and rescue operation because the data is still developing,” Manado rescue agency head George Leo Mercy Randang told AFP on Monday.
“Our post is still open 24 hours a day, in case families want to report about their missing relative.” At least 568 people were rescued from the ferry and water while three others were found dead, the national search and rescue agency said in a statement Monday.
 
 

The ferry’s log had only registered 280 passengers and 15 crew on board.
Local media reported that the ship had a capacity for 600 people.
Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in the Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to lax safety standards or bad weather.
Sunday’s fire came just weeks after another ferry sank off the popular resort island of Bali due to bad weather, killing at least 19 people.
In March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person.
And in 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world’s deepest lakes on Sumatra Island.</p><small>2025-07-21 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/211007267323854.png?r=100801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925607/alaska-airlines-requests-grounding-of-fleet-citing-it-outage' target='_blank'><strong>Alaska Airlines requests grounding of fleet citing ‘IT outage’</strong></a><br><p>Alaska Airlines has requested a ground stop for all its mainline aircraft according to an advisory notice by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with the company citing an “IT outage.”
The airline told AFP that on Sunday it “experienced an IT outage that’s impacting our operations” and that it “requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop for Alaska and Horizon Air flights until the issue is resolved.”
The FAA status page showed all destinations being impacted by the ground stop of Alaska’s mainline aircraft.
It did not immediately respond to AFP’s requests for comment.
The incident comes more than a year after a door plug section of a newly delivered Boeing 737 Max 9 blew out during an Alaska Airlines flight between Portland, Oregon and Ontario, California in January last year.
The 171 passengers and six crew members survived the rapid decompression, but the incident focused minds at the FAA, which grounded many Boeing 737-9 aircraft operated by US airlines.
Last month, US investigators said Boeing’s failure to provide adequate training to manufacturing staff was a driving factor in the near-catastrophic Alaska Airlines mid-flight blowout.</p><small>2025-07-21 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614996-all-set-for-senate-polls-in-kp-as-four-pti-dissenters-pull-out-of-race' target='_blank'><strong>All set for KP Senate polls as 4 PTI dissenters pull out of race</strong></a><br><p>

Immigration officials at the Quetta airport info­rmed Mr Mengal that his name has been placed in the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL), a temporary travel ban to stop people from going abroad.
After the incident, Mr Mengal issued a statement on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), saying he has been stopped from travelling abroad without prior notice or any explanation.
“Today I was stopped at Quetta Airport from flying to Dubai. Airport officials informed me that my name is on the PNIL. This decision was made without my knowledge and without any clear reason,” Mr Mengal wrote on X.
 






A BNP spokesperson condemned the move, calling it another example of political victimisation and an attack on democratic values.
The spokesman demanded that Mr Mengal’s name be immediately removed from the list and those responsible for the decision be held accountable.
No official reason has been given by the government so far for placing Mr Mengal’s name on PNIL.
BNP’s central information secretary, Agha Hassan Baloch, also condemned the travel restriction placed on the BNP president and termed the government move unconstitutional and politically motivated.
 
 

He said the action of the government was a clear violation of Mr Mengal’s constitutional right to freedom of movement and an attempt to suppress fundamental human rights.
“We demand an immediate explanation from authorities concerned. Such repressive tactics are unacceptable in a democratic setup. Political dissent and public representation must not be criminalised,” Mr Hassan said.
Sana Baloch, another BNP leader, said: “We demand a prompt explanation from authorities concerned and immediate removal of Sardar Akhtar Mengal’s name from the PNIL. These authoritarian measures are unacceptable. Targeting political opposition and elected representatives is incompatible with constitutional democracy.”

The report ‘Pakistan Energy Efficiency: Industrial Energy Efficiency and Decarbonisation (EE&D)’, outlines strategies, targeting the cement, steel, fertiliser, textile, and paper and pulp industries.
These plans aim to advance Pakistan’s energy conservation objectives and shape policy discussions between the WB Group and the government.
The strategies are based on a comprehensive study the bank conducted from mid-2022 to 2023.
While some manufacturers have already implemented EE&D technologies, the report identified major information, policy and financial barriers hindering wider adoption.
“Many companies in Pakistan believe that investments in energy efficiency raise production costs and erode competitiveness,” the report noted. “This wariness substantially increases when the term ‘decarbonisation’ is used instead of ‘energy efficiency’.”
Textile
In the textile industry, the dyeing and finishing stages are the most energy-intensive, offering the greatest potential for EE&D gains.
It can be achieved through multiple pathways such as energy efficiency and conservation interventions, fuel switching, electrification of heat, process improvement, implementing circularity and deploying innovative technologies.
According to the bank, the existing technologies can save 50pc to 60pc energy and cut emission by up to 13pc.
Cement, fertiliser
Several Pakistani cement plants have already implemented EE&D interventions, including installing waste heat recovery systems and adopting alternative energy sources.
The WB estimates that the industry can further reduce its emissions impact by 3pc to 35pc and decrease energy consumption by 6pc to 20pc by adopting existing and emerging technologies.
The fertiliser sector’s heavy reliance on natural gas makes it vulnerable to price volatility.
The report suggests that government policies providing a fixed and considerably low gas price for fertiliser manufacturers discourage investments in energy efficiency.
Steel, paper and pulp
All steel in Pakistan is produced from scrap metal in an electric induction furnace, the more efficient of the two applicable technologies.
The World Bank suggests that additional investments could reduce emissions from steel plants by 5pc to 12pc and lower energy consumption by 8pc to 10pc.
A better understanding of the financial impacts of decarbonisation could prompt more interest in these investments, the report added.
Paper and pulp industry has seen a compound annual growth rate of 7.2pc over the past five years. While some plants have invested in efficiency measures, the sector can further improve by adopting new technologies.

His reason for labelling them fictitious was because they are exchanged in markets, like any other commodity, even though their existence and creation is unlike all others, which are usually produced to be consumed.
Money is a creation of governments to facilitate exchange and has no actual use value beyond it. Outside of the most extreme examples, humans do not give birth to children to create more labourers. And no human creates nature, yet fields, forests, mountains, mines and even the seas are commodified through legal wizardry and bought and sold freely.
While much can be said about the complete degradation of human life to merely its worth as labour, and the corrosive role of money in shaping all aspects of life stripped of moral and ethical dimensions, it is the third fictitious commodity that weighs heavy on Pakistani lives today.
 
 

By latest estimates, over 100 people have died in monsoon rainfall incidents across the country these past few weeks. The tail-end of last week was marked by extreme flooding and devastation across the Potohar plateau, with towns and villages in Chakwal and Rawalpindi heavily impacted by several days of continuous rain.
As others point out, there are two aspects to this ecological carnage. One is the general impact of climate change across the world. Extreme weather events are now far more common. The amount of rainfall previously witnessed across one season now routinely takes place in a few days. While cloud bursts and rainfall-induced flooding was particularly devastating in 2022 in Sindh and Balochistan, each successive year has also seen significant loss of life and property in all four provinces.
Pakistani state authorities are quick to highlight the climate change aspect of monsoon catastrophes. This focus serves to underscore the country’s vulnerability to climate change, which is far higher than its historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, and helps make its case for greater climate financing for mitigation and adaptation purposes.
Yet, this narrow focus also detracts from the other, and arguably more important, aspect of ecological carnage: the way in which nature is used and regulated in the country; or, in other words, the political economy and governance-based causes of climatic vulnerability.

It is during the monsoon months that the existential impact of real estate fever becomes truly apparent.

Anyone possessing an even cursory familiarity with Pakistani cities and towns will know how unchecked and unfettered urban expansion has dramatically altered the rural-urban frontier.
In the plains of Punjab, this has come at the cost of farmland and rural commons, via their conversion into low-density, plot-based housing schemes for speculative capital. Originating in the hinterlands of bigger cities like Karachi, Lahore and Faisal­abad, this rapid conversion is now commonplace acr­­oss second- and third-tier cities across the country.
 
 

The outcomes of this conversion are apparent for all residents. These cities have become dependent on privatised modes of transport, contributing to greater air pollution. The concretisation of large tracts of agricultural land has both destabilised food supply chains and raised average ground temperatures during the summer months. Even the electricity grid is afflicted by the development of low-rise, single-family dwellings which remain highly energy-inefficient and contribute to transmission losses.
But it is during the monsoon months that the existential impact of real estate fever becomes truly apparent. Paved surfaces become inadvertent reservoirs for rainwater, where in the past unpaved ground would have absorbed it. The underpasses and flyovers constructed to ease vehicular flows (and improve real estate values) block the natural flow of water, rendering the few remaining stormwater drains redundant.
These trends are highly visible in Lahore, where such real estate development remained the norm for decades, but they are now afflicting other cities as well. In the absence of meaningful regulation of urban growth that keeps water drainage and climatic factors in mind, images of submerged towns will become even more commonplace across the country.
This year, such images came in droves from the Potohar plateau, an area where the commodification of nature is of an even more extreme form. Rather than just eating into agricultural land, real estate developers in Rawalpindi and adjoining districts have built across seasonal river paths and floodplains, cut open and flattened hills, blocked natural drainage channels, and radically altered the local topography. It come as no surprise, then, that the most visceral impact of rainfall this past week was felt in areas that were built on the floodplain and river path of the seasonal Soan river.
DHAs and Bahria Towns remain the primary ‘protagonists’ of this transformation, enabled by their capture of laws and bullying of municipal authorities, but many others now draw inspiration from them.
 
 

Merely travelling towards Islamabad via the Motorway shows how drastically the landscape stands changed, with under-construction housing developments dotting the landscape all the way to the Salt Range. They are solely being built for the purpose of feeding the insatiable appetite of speculators, investors and profiteers.
In his writings, Polanyi was clear that the unchecked exploitation of human labour would eventually produce a ‘double-movement’. Humans would fight back against their immiseration and seek a better bargain to reassert their humanity in a world that treated them merely as labour. This bargain eventually took the shape of mid-20th-century social democracy, which offered better labour protections and greater welfare for workers.
In the same vein, climate change and ecological catastrophe can be seen as nature’s double movement against its immiseration and exploitation at the hands of capitalist development.
The stark reality, though, is that while overworked labourers can be placated by being offered better wages, past destruction to our natural landscape cannot be reversed. At best, we can hope that immediate course correction limits the extent of nature’s revenge in the future.

Expectations that Trump’s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month would pave the way for a truce have not materialised. There was no breakthrough despite two meetings between them at the White House.
This has left Israel free to escalate its military onslaught on Gaza even as it continues negotiations with Hamas. Talks in Doha are aimed at reaching agreement on a 60-day ceasefire, exchange of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, inflow of humanitarian assistance and the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. This is supposed to lead to negotiations for a permanent ceasefire, which Netanyahu still opposes.
The Doha talks are bogged down principally on Israel’s demand to retain control of large parts of the Strip as ‘occupation zones’. This is obviously unacceptable to Hamas, which also wants guarantees that any ceasefire would lead to a permanent end to the war.
As disagreements persist over the withdrawal map, the Israeli military offensive continues to claim more Palestinian lives, aid remains sharply limited with Israel using starvation as a weapon and conducting daily bombings of schools serving as shelters, refugee camps, residential areas and hospitals. Over 58,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s war began in October 2023.
 
 

Among Israel’s most abhorrent acts is its soldiers shooting and killing hapless, starving Palestinians standing in line for food at controversial military-run aid distribution sites. Almost 900 people have been killed while seeking aid so far, many of them children. Israeli soldiers have told an Israeli newspaper that they are ordered to deliberately shoot at unarmed Palestinians waiting at aid hubs. Israeli forces have also attacked and killed children trying to get water at collection points as a water crisis takes hold in addition to the spread of famine.

Israel’s forced displacement plan will create concentration camps and depopulate Gaza.

To cap these crimes, Israel has unfolded a forced displacement plan to set up what will be a concentration camp in southern Gaza. An announcement by its defence ministry said most of Gaza’s population will be forced into a small and destroyed part of the Strip to be controlled and sealed by the Israeli military.
Demolition operations in Rafah that have levelled large areas show preparations are underway to implement this plan. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has declared that within 60 days of any ceasefire agreement, 600,000 Palestinians will be ‘relocated’ to Rafah to what he disingenuously called a “humanitarian city”. Eventually, Gaza’s over two million population will be transferred and confined to the ruins of this southern city. The city would be ‘locked’ with Palestinians not allowed to leave the area except if they “voluntarily migrated” from Gaza to other countries. Emigration, Katz asserted, would be encouraged as part of this plan.
 
 

The proposed plan has been widely denounced as “an organised act of genocide” and ethnic cleansing aimed at depopulating the Strip. It has outraged Gaza’s citizens and been condemned by the UN, members of the international community, human rights groups and several prominent Israelis including former prime ministers.
All of them see this as a dangerous scheme leading to the establishment of mass concentration camps for internment and expulsion. The Israeli move would clearly be a violation of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention as well as a crime against humanity. Hamas has firmly opposed the plan and described it as the latest obstacle to the Doha talks.
Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNWRA), has slammed the move and said this will “create massive concentration camps at the border with Egypt for the Palestinians, displaced over and over across generations”. It would, he said, “deprive Palestinians of any prospects of a better future in their homeland”.
Two former Israeli prime ministers have also assailed the plan. Ehud Olmert said the project amounted to interning Palestinians into a concentration camp, and if Palestinians are deported to the so-called ‘humanitarian city’ it would be part of an “ethnic cleansing” operation. Former prime minister Yair Lapid also criticised the plan, pointing out that if “exiting it is prohibited, then it is a concentration camp”.
Meanwhile, a hard-hitting analysis in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz titled ‘Concentration camp, illegal orders and war crimes: Israel’s madmen have a grim new plan’ assesses the plan and its ramifications and leaves no doubt it would constitute a war crime. It also cites an open letter written to Katz by 16 top Israeli scholars of international law presenting legal arguments to establish that the plan represents a “manifestly illegal order” which soldiers should refuse to obey. The letter also says “Executing this plan … would represent a list of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and under certain conditions … the crime of genocide”.
In their recent meeting and earlier ones too, Trump and Netanyahu have discussed the relocation of Gazans to neighbouring states. Both have publicly stated that they are discussing this with “surrounding countries”.
Their reference to this as ‘voluntary’ does nothing to obscure the forced nature of such an exodus. In fact, the Israeli plan seeks to implement Trump’s vision of emptying Gaza of Palestinians to ostensibly build a ‘Riviera of the Middle East’. Trump has continued to refer to Gaza as a real estate site. After his recent White House meeting, Netanyahu again attributed his plan to relocate Palestinians to what he called Trump’s “brilliant vision”. All this suggests that not only is the US on board with the Israelis on the plan but it may also be the prime mover.
The question then is what is the rest of the world, especially Arab and Muslim countries, going to do to thwart this insidious move. Resort to more words but no action? Surely it is time for them to shake off their passiveness, show some spine and take collective measures to prevent this from happening. Inaction is complicity. The implementation of the US-backed Israeli plan will not just plunge the Middle East into greater turmoil but it would also be a perfidy perpetrated on the Palestinians.

According to the NDMA, over 200 lives have already been lost since late June, and the country has experienced 80pc more rainfall than average. This is climate change in motion.
The recent River Swat tragedy, where tourists were swept away by a sudden surge of water, and the glacial floods submerging villages in Gilgit-Baltistan show clearly how global warming is reshaping our landscape and our vulnerabilities with it.
The loss is not just human or environmental. It is also economic. Every year, floods and climate-induced disasters wipe out crops, destroy infrastructure, displace communities and derail economic activity. These are costs we can ill afford. Our economic recovery is fragile, and yet, the billions spent on post-disaster relief and reconstruction remain a growing burden.
The fiscal cost of inaction, year after year, is far greater than what preventive infrastructure, climate-smart planning and resilience-building would require. Moreover, climate change should be viewed as a national security concern. Unpredictable monsoons, water scarcity, glacial melt and population displacement risk triggering social unrest over dwindling resources. The security establishment, quick to deploy personnel for rescue efforts, must also recognise that climate resilience is integral to long-term stability — as vital as any defence imperative.
 
 

Each disaster also reflects failed governance — at both the centre and the local level. Disaster management remains overly centralised, while municipal bodies and district administrations remain underfunded, disempowered and paralysed by red tape dysfunction. Climate adaptation can only succeed when local institutions have the autonomy, resources and capacity to act decisively. It is also a generational betrayal.
Each year of delay condemns future generations to greater hardship, fewer resources and a degraded environment. The political class must be held accountable not only for current failures but also for endangering the country’s long-term future and compromising its development trajectory.
What Pakistan needs is not just preparedness, but a climate-resilient economic vision that entails sustainability in agriculture, urban planning, water management and energy. The Living Indus Initiative must become more than a talking point. It should anchor a strategy linking glacier dynamics, river systems and urban planning in every province. Pakistan has every right to demand compensation under the Loss and Damage Fund.
But waiting for global payouts while lives are lost is an abdication of responsibility. To ensure accountability, the federal government should publish an annual disaster preparedness scorecard for each province, making transparent who has planned — and who has not. More rains are expected. Will Pakistan continue to pay in lives, livelihoods, and economic stability, or will it finally invest in survival?

The pledge comes despite Mr Trump’s broader immigration restrictions, as the Republican president suspended refugee resettlement after taking office in January, while his administration terminated temporary deportation protections for thousands of Afghans in the US in April.
The UAE, a close US security partner, agreed in 2021 to temporarily house several thousand Afghans evacuated from Kabul as the Taliban seized power during the final stages of the US military withdrawal.
The evacuees have remained there since.  The number of Afghans still detained in the Gulf remains unclear.

A ceasefire announced on Saturday appeared to be holding after earlier agreements failed to end fighting between Druze and the Bedouin that spiralled to draw in the Syrian government, the Israeli military and armed tribes from other parts of Syria.
Journalists on the outskirts of Sweida city reported hearing no clashes on Sunday morning, with government forces deployed in some locations in the province to enforce the truce and at least one humanitarian convoy headed for the Druze-majority city.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that since around midnight (2100 GMT Saturday), “Sweida has been experiencing a cautious calm”, adding government security forces had blocked roads leading to the province in order to prevent tribal fighters from going there.
 
 


UN agency says over 128,000 displaced; ceasefire appears to be holding after earlier arrangements failed to end fighting

The Britain-based Observatory gave an updated toll on Sunday of more than 1,000 killed since the violence erupted a week ago, including 336 Druze fighters and 298 civilians from the minority group, as well as 342 government security personnel and 21 Bedouin.
Witnesses, Druze factions and the Observatory have accused government forces of siding with the Bedouin and committing abuses, including summary executions when they entered Sweida days ago.
Totally calm
The interior ministry said overnight that Sweida city was “evacuated of all tribal fighters, and clashes within the city’s neighbourhoods were halted”.
The Observatory had said Druze fighters retook control of the city on Saturday evening.
Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Saturday announced a fresh ceasefire in Sweida and renewed a pledge to protect Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities in the face of the latest sectarian violence since longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December.
A spokesman for Syria’s tribal and clan council told Al Jazeera late Saturday that fighters had left the city “in response to the call of the presidency and the terms of the agreement”.
Another medic inside Sweida said on Sunday that “the situation is totally calm… We aren’t hearing clashes.” “No medical or relief assistance has entered until now,” the medic added, requesting anonymity due to the security situation.
State news agency SANA published images showing medical aid being prepared near the health ministry in Damascus and quoted Health Minister Musab al-Ali as saying assistance would be delivered to Sweida’s main hospital, where bodies have piled up.
Inside the city, where around 150,000 people live, residents have been holed up in their homes without electricity and water, and food supplies have also been scarce.
The United Nations migration agency said more than 128,000 people in Sweida province have been displaced by the violence.
Brutal acts
US special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack said on Sunday that the country stood at a “critical juncture”, adding that “peace and dialogue must prevail — and prevail now”.
“All factions must immediately lay down their arms, cease hostilities, and abandon cycles of tribal vengeance,” he wrote on X, saying “brutal acts by warring factions on the ground undermine the government’s authority and disrupt any semblance of order”.
 






Sharaa’s announcement on Saturday came hours after the United States said it had negotiated a ceasefire between Syria’s government and Israel, which had bombed government forces in both Sweida and Damascus earlier in the week.
Israel, which has its own Druze community, has said it was acting in defence of the group, as well as to enforce its demands for the total demilitarisation of Syria’s south.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday urged the Syrian government’s security forces to prevent militants from entering and “carrying out massacres” in the south, and called on Damascus to “bring to justice anyone guilty of atrocities including those in their own ranks”.

Iran’s Tasnim news agency reported that Tehran had agreed to hold talks with the three European countries, citing an unnamed source. Consultations are ongoing regarding a date and location for the talks, it added.
“Iran must never be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon. That is why Germany, France and the United Kingdom are continuing to work intensively in the E3 format to find a sustainable and verifiable diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear programme,” the German source said.

Putin meets top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader

Israel and Western nations have long accused Iran of seeking to develop nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran has consistently denied.
Strikes derailed talks
On June 13, Israel launched a wave of surprise strikes on its regional nemesis, targeting key military and nuclear facilities. Nine days later, the US launched its own set of strikes against Iran’s nuclear programme, hitting the uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, in Qom province south of Tehran, as well as nuclear sites in Isfahan and Natanz.
 
 

Iran and the United States had held several rounds of nuclear negotiations through Omani mediators before Israel launched its 12-day war against Iran. However, US President Donald Trump’s decision to join Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities effectively ended the talks.
The E3 countries last met the Iranian representatives in Geneva on June 21, just one day before the US strikes.
Kremlin meeting
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a surprise meeting in the Kremlin with Ali Larijani, top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader on nuclear issues.
Mr Larijani “conveyed assessments of the escalating situation in the Middle East and around the Iranian nuclear programme”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said of the unannounced meeting.
Putin had expressed Russia’s “well-known positions on how to stabilise the situation in the region and on the political settlement of the Iranian nuclear programme”, he added.
Moscow has a cordial relationship with Iran’s clerical leadership and provides crucial backing for Tehran but did not swing forcefully behind its partner even after the US joined Israel’s bombing campaign.
Snapback mechanism
While Iran and six world powers struck a deal in 2015 called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which placed significant restrictions on Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief, but the United States during Trump’s first presidency walked away from it.
European countries, however, recently threatened to trigger the deal’s “snapback” mechanism, which allows the re-imposition of sanctions in the event of non-compliance by Iran.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi after a call with his European counterparts said the Western allies had no grounds for reactivating sanctions. “If EU/E3 want to have a role, they should act responsibly and put aside the worn-out policies of threat and pressure, including the ‘snap-back’ for which they (have) absolutely no moral (or) legal grounds,” Araghchi said on X.
 






But the German source insisted, “Snapback remains an option for the E3 if no solution is reached over the summer.”
Last week, Iran made it clear that there would be no new nuclear talks with the United States if they were conditioned on Tehran abandoning its uranium enrichment activities.

• Health officials say hundreds of people could soon die due to starvation
CAIRO: At least 115 people seeking aid were killed by Israel while they waited for UN aid trucks in northern Gaza on Sunday, Gaza’s health ministry said, as Israel issued new evacuation orders for areas packed with displaced Gazans, some of whom began to leave.
The ministry said dozens of people were also wounded in the incident in northern Gaza, in one of the highest reported tolls among repeated recent cases in which aid seekers have been killed. Six other people were killed near another aid site in the south, it said.
In total, health authorities said 88 people had been killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes across Gaza on Sunday.
After Israel’s military dropped leaflets urging people to evacuate from neighbourhoods in central Gaza’s Deir al-Balah, residents said Israeli planes struck three houses in the area.
 
 

Dozens of families began leaving their homes, carrying some of their belongings. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans have been sheltering in the Deir al-Balah area.
Starvation on the rise
Much of Gaza has been reduced to a wasteland during more than 21 months of war and there are fears of accelerating starvation.
Palestinian health officials said hundreds of people could soon die as hospitals were inundated with patients suffering from dizziness and exhaustion due to the scarcity of food and a collapse in aid deliveries.
“We warn that hundreds of people whose bodies have wasted away are at risk of imminent death due to hunger,” the Palestinian health ministry said.
The United Nations also said on Sunday that civilians were starving and needed an urgent influx of aid.
Residents said it was becoming impossible to find essential food such as flour. The Gaza health ministry said at least 71 children had died of malnutrition during the war, and 60,000 others were suffering from symptoms of malnutrition.
Later on Sunday, it said 18 people have died of hunger in the past 24 hours.
Food prices have increased well beyond what most of the population of more than two million can afford.
Several people said they either had one meal or no meal in the past 24 hours.
“As a father, I wake up in the early morning to look for food, for even a loaf of bread for my five children, but all in vain,” said Ziad, a nurse.
“People who didn’t die of bombs will die of hunger. We want an end to this war now, a truce, even for two months,” he said.
Others said they felt dizzy walking in the streets and that many fainted as they walked. Fathers leave tents to avoid questions by their children about what to eat.
UNRWA demands more aid
UNRWA, the UN refugee agency dedicated to Palestinians, demanded Israel allow more aid trucks into Gaza, saying it had enough food for the entire population for over three months which was not allowed in.
 






Some Palestinians suggested the move on Deir al-Balah might be an attempt to put pressure on Hamas to make more concessions in long-running ceasefire negotiations.
Israel and Hamas are engaged in indirect talks in Doha aimed at reaching a 60-day truce and Israeli prisoners’ deal, although there has been no sign of breakthrough.
Pope seeks end to ‘barbarity’ of Gaza war
Pope Leo XIV slammed the “barbarity” of the war in Gaza on Sunday and urged against the “indiscriminate use of force”, just days after a deadly strike by Israel’s military on a Catholic church.
“I once again ask for an immediate end to the barbarity of the war and for a peaceful resolution to the conflict,” Leo said at the end of the Angelus prayer at Castel Gandolfo, the papal summer residence near Rome.

The pope, who spoke by telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the morning after Thursday’s strike, spoke of his “deep sorrow” for the attack on the Holy Family Church.
The church was sheltering around 600 displaced people, the majority of them children.

This will be the first cabinet-level meeting since President Trump’s unprecedented White House lunch with Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir. Such senior-level contacts had remained dormant since 2016, marking this as a significant diplomatic reset.
Mr Dar is arriving in New York on Sunday afternoon to participate in Pakistan’s high-level engagements under its current presidency of the UN Security Council (UNSC), before traveling to Washington for bilateral meetings.
In New York, he will chair an open debate on “Promoting international peace and security through multilateralism and peaceful settlement of disputes.”

Foreign minister due in New York today

He will also preside over the quarterly UNSC debate on the “Situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian Question” and lead a high-level briefing focused on enhanced cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. He will also attend a conference on “Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution.”
Still, the most consequential part of his visit remains the upcoming meeting with Secretary Rubio — signalling a resumption of strategic dialogue after years of limited contact.
Mr Dar’s visit follows Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s meeting with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington where they discussed a long-anticipated trade and tariff agreement.
 
 

Mr Aurangzeb called the talks “very constructive” and emphasised that the bilateral relationship must go beyond trade. “We have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative,” he said.
“For the Pakistan-US relationship to move to the next level, investment is the key — and we believe areas like minerals, AI, and crypto could be real game changers,” the finance minister said before returning to Pakistan on Saturday.

• Seven police officials abducted in separate incidents
PESHAWAR/ QUETTA: Security forces killed 13 terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations in Malakand and Kalat districts, the military said on Sunday.
Nine terrorists were eliminated and eight arrested in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, while four others were killed in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in separate statements.
The four-day intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Malakand was conducted in coordination with police, Levies, the Counter-Terrorism Dep­art­ment (CTD) and the district admi­nistration in Malakand district. The ISPR said the operation was launched after reports of the presence of militants linked to what the statement described as an “Indian proxy”.
The troops surrounded and effectively engaged the militants’ location and killed nine and arrested eight others after intense and multiple fire exchanges, the ISPR said, adding that two hideouts used by militants were also busted and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered.
“Locals of the area appreciated the operation and expressed their full support to the state’s counterterrorism efforts,” the statement read.
It said that sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other militants in the area, as the security forces and law enforcement agencies, in step with the nation, were determined to wipe out the menace of militancy from the country.
In Kalat, four terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation conducted by security forces, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
The ISPR said the operation targeted the reported presence of militants associated with the Indian proxy group ‘Fitna al Hindustan’.
“During the conduct of the operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense exchange of fire, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.”
President, PM commend security forces
President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday commended the security forces and Levies for eliminating “Khwarij terrorists” in the Malakand operation.
In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, he said the nation was united in its resolve to root out terrorism and vowed that “terrorists of Fitna al-Hindustan” would be brought to justice.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the army, police, Levies, CTD and district administration for the successful joint operation against “Fitna al-Khawarij terrorists” in Malakand.
“This successful operation against terrorists is a great example of coordination between different agencies,” he said. “The entire nation stands with security forces in the war against terrorism.”
He expressed the government’s resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.
Woman killed in ‘drone strike’
In a separate development, a woman was killed and two others injured in a suspected quadcopter drone strike, while seven police personnel were allegedly abducted in two separate incidents in Upper South Waziristan district on Sunday.
According to local sources, the drone strike occurred in Malikshahi, a locality in the Zhawar area of Shaktoi tehsil. The attack killed a woman on the spot, while another woman and a young girl were injured and shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.
The incident sparked panic among residents, who condemned the strike as a blatant violation of human rights. Locals called on authorities to take immediate notice and ensure justice for the victims.
The district administration confirmed the incident and expressed support for the affected family. However, District Police Officer (DPO) Arshad Khan said the department had “no idea” about the source or motive behind the attack.
 
 

No official statement was immediately issued regarding responsibility for the strike, further fuelling fear and speculation in the area.
Seven policemen abducted
Meanwhile, seven police officials, including a sub-inspector, were reportedly abducted in two separate incidents in Upper South Waziristan.
DPO Khan confirmed that three policemen from Ladha police station went missing during routine patrol duty near the Chalerai area of Makin tehsil. Communication with the team was abruptly lost and their whereabouts remain unknown.
In a second incident, four more officers, including a sub-inspector, went missing from the Shahoor area within the jurisdiction of the Sararogha police station. The incidents have raised serious concerns among law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the region.
DPO Khan said a comprehensive investigation had been launched to determine all possible angles. Joint efforts by police, security forces and intelligence agencies are underway to locate the missing personnel.
The incidents have increased tensions and anxiety among locals.
Residents have demanded a transparent inquiry and swift action to bring the perpetrators to justice.
The law and order situation in the tribal districts, particularly Upper and Lower South Waziristan and North Waziristan, has deteriorated significantly over the past year. The region has witnessed a sharp increase in militant activity, including bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom and coordinated attacks on security forces and police.
 
 

The increasing frequency of such incidents has instilled widespread fear among citizens, who are urging the government and security institutions to take swift and effective measures to restore order and ensure the safety of citizens.

A notification issued to deans of all 10 MTIs has sought details about the number of civil servants, filled and vacant posts in their respective hospitals and colleges as per directives of competent authorities.
The one-page letter doesn’t provide further details but sources say that the issue of civil servants has been the bone of contention between health department and architects of Medical Teaching Institutions Reforms Act (MTIRA). The latter wanted to expel all civil servants from MTIs as they were government’s employees and did not come under MTIRA, they added.
However, health department has been dragging its feet on the issue because repatriation of all civil employees would create a big problem.

Architects of MTIRA want to send back such employees to health dept

“If all the civil servants are sent back to health department, it will create a surplus pool as most of them cannot be posted in the department,” sources said.
 
 

They said that there re were scores of faculty members including assistant, associate and professors in clinical and basic science departments in MTIs. They are actually civil servants and working in the institutions well before the imposition of MTIRA.
In case of transferring out those faculty members from MTIs, the department has no institution to post them there. Therefore, they will be placed in surplus pool.
“They include highly experience faculty members like surgeons, physicians and other academic staff, whose services couldn’t be required in other hospitals because they are fit only in teaching hospitals with medical and dental colleges which have now become MTIs,” said sources.
They said that civil servants were employed by health department but now the MTIs wanted to replace them with their own employees.
There are other types of servants, who are called institutional employees. They have been recruited after 2000 by their respective teaching hospitals. MTIs have been asking civil servants to leave their positions and go to health department but such directives issued from time to time have fallen on deaf ears because the department has no institution to accommodate them.
MTIs have also been facing problems with regard to promotion of civil servants. Before the imposition of new law, the department would promote officials to senior grades in the same institutions but now there is no grading system and most of the civil servants cannot be promoted.
Civil servants on their part complained that MTIs were abolishing their posts approved in budget which affected their promotions. Sources said that MTIs transferred out several civil servants to health department and recruited their own employees.
They said that MTIs had already transferred bulk of nursing staff and paramedics to health department. They have been posted elsewhere in the hospitals but the main issue is the posting of clinical and basic science faculty members, who, if transferred, will find no place, and as a result, not only MTIs will suffer but a surplus pool will be created.
“However, pressure from the framers of MTIRA continues to swell on the department due to which the directives have been issued to identify the number of civil servants along with filled and vacant position,” said sources. They said that it was meant to send back civil servants to health department and fill their positions with the employees to be hired under MTIRA.

As of Sunday night, six PTI nominees and five opposition picks were in the running in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for the upper house of parliament. Late-night reports suggested that two more ‘disgruntled’ PTI candidates pulled out of the race hours after the exit of Mohammad Waqas Orak­zai and Syed Irshad Hus­sain. Khurram Zee­shan was the only disgruntled PTI member, till the filing of this report in the wee hours of Monday morning, vying for a general seat.
Proportional representation
Unlike the general elections, the ‘first past the post’ system (where the person receiving the highest number of votes is declared the winner) is not employed here.
Instead, the ‘single transferable vote’ system of proportional representation is used.
Under this system, voters cast a single ballot, which mentions all the candidates they would like to see elected, in order of their personal priority or preference (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and so on).
 
 

Each of these votes has a value. A quota calculated by the ECP determines how many votes each candidate needs to be considered elected.
The votes received by each candidate are tallied in each count. When a candidate receives enough votes to cross the quota, the extra value of his or her votes is transferred down to lower priority candidates (in the order mentioned by the voters).
The candidates who receive the fewest votes are eliminated and their votes are transferred to other candidates in the order of preference.
The process of transferring votes from successful and eliminated candidates continues until all vacant seats are filled.
How many votes needed?
Theoretically, for the KP Assembly — which has a total of 145 seats — a candidate for one of seven general seats requires at least 21 votes to succeed (calculated by dividing the total number of seats in the KP Assembly by the number of vacant seats being contested).
For each of the women’s and technocrat seats, this number is 72.
Currently, there are 92 PTI-backed members in the 145-member assembly, whereas the opposition’s strength has gone up to 53.
Among opposition parties, JUI-F is the largest with 18 seats, followed by PML-N with 17 seats. The PPP holds 10 seats, ANP four, while PTI-P has three seats in the assembly.
Who are the candidates?
The PTI-backed Senate candidates on general seats include Murad Saeed, Faisal Javed, Mirza Muhammad Afridi and Noorul Haq Qadri. For the technocrat and women’s seats, the party has named Muhammad Azam Khan Swati and Rubina Naz as its candidates, respectively.
The opposition-backed candidates include Attaul Haq of JUI-F, Muhammad Talha of PPP, Niaz Ahmad of PML-N on general seats, whereas Dilawar Khan of JUI-F is in the run for the technocrat seat, while the PPP has nominated Rubina Khalid for the women’s seat.
Based on the late-night reports, among the ‘disgruntled’ PTI members, Waqas Orakzai, Irfan Saleem, Irshad Hussain and Ayisha Bano had already exited the race, leaving Khurram Zeeshan in the race.

The incident purportedly took place around Eidul Azha and has been described as an act of ‘honour killing’. In the video, a group of people can be seen killing a woman and a man, apparently for contracting a love marriage.
After the clip went viral on social media, a case on terrorism charges was registered on the ord­ers of Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, and the Levies and the Counter-Terrorism Dep­artment subsequently arr­es­ted one of the key suspects.
“The case was registered under anti-terrorism laws…on behalf of the Balochistan government, as no one from the area, including the relatives or other people, submitted any application to the Levies or the CTD,” officials said, adding that efforts were underway to arrest more people.
 
 

The slain couple had reportedly married without the permission of their families and the matter was taken to the ‘elders’ of the area, who pronounced a death sentence.
Sources said the ill-fated couple, Ehsan Samalani and Bano Satakzai, were invited to the village for lunch and later taken to an abandoned place in Dagari, where they were informed about the decision of the elders.
“You are allowed to shoot me, but nothing more than that,” the slain woman told the perpetrators in Brahvi before her murder.
She asked her killers to let her walk seven steps before shooting her. She was shot thrice apparently by her brother, followed by the killing of her partner. The bodies have yet to be recovered, further complicating the investigation.
The video is believed to have been filmed just before Eidul Azha, and the authorities are conducting raids to apprehend the remaining perpetrators, whose identities have reportedly been established but not made public.
“The state will not remain a silent spectator to such barbarism,” said CM Bugti on X (formerly Twitter), vowing that justice would be served.
 






In a press conference at the Karachi Press Club on Sunday, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed that the individuals seen in the video had been traced through facial recognition and Nadra data.
“One suspect is in custody, and data of all visible individuals in the video has been handed over to Nadra. We are closing in on the rest,” he said.
Mr Rind clarified that the state itself had become the complainant in the case to ensure accountability and justice, emphasising that external pressure would not be tolerated during the investigation.
 
 

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, whose party rules Balochistan, condemned the cold-blooded killing, expressing profound grief and outrage over the incident. He said that those involved in this heinous murder are nothing less than beasts and deserve no mercy.
Aladdin Khilji, provincial director of Aurat Foundation and chairman of the Balochistan EVAWG Alliance (Ending Violence against Women and Girls), also condemned the act.
“This video has shaken us to the core. It is a stark reminder that honour killings remain a brutal reality in Balochistan. From 2019 to 2024, 212 people have been murdered in the name of honour,” he said in a statement.

• PDMA says 135 killed in Punjab
• Medium to high-level flow expected in rivers from tomorrow
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Authorities are bracing for another spell of rain and thunderstorms, which are expected to hit many parts of the country from today (Monday).
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the Malakand and Hazara divisions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the southern parts of Punjab and Sindh, eastern Balochistan and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are likely to receive rain and thunderstorms with strong winds.
According to the PMD’s detailed national forecast, Islamabad may receive rain and thunderstorms at night.
In KP, while most districts will stay hot and humid, scattered rain with thunderstorms and gusty winds are expected in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Kurram, and Waziristan.
Rain and thunderstorms are forecast for urban centres of Punjab in the south, such as Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan, though overall weather of the province will remain partly cloudy and humid.
Later at night, the rain spell is expected to reach Rawal­pindi, Murree, Gali­yat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Narowal and Lahore.
In Sindh, where the moderate to heavy rain has alre­ady been reported from some parts, several areas are bracing for more precipitation.
The PMD said Mir­purkhas, Mithi, Tharparkar, Badin, Sujawal, Umerkot, Chhachhro, Padidan, Khair­pur, Karachi, Thatta, Ghotki, Chhor, Sukkur, Kashmore, Shikar­pur, Jacobabad, Larkana, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Dadu, Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Matiari, and Shaheed Benazirabad are all expected to receive rain and thunderstorms, with heavy downpours likely in some areas.
 
 

In Balochistan, while most regions will remain hot and humid, the forecast includes rain and thunderstorms for Barkhan, Sibi, Kohlu, Musakhel, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, and Lasbela.
For Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, partly cloudy weather with rain and thunderstorms is expected, and heavy rainfall is likely at isolated places in Kashmir.
Rivers in high flood
A separate alert from the country’s  Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) echoed the warning, saying that  “moderate to strong monsoon activity is likely to start” over the upper catchments of those same rivers after 36 hours.
The division specifically predicted a medium to high-level flow in the Chenab and  Jhelum rivers, along with their associated nullahs and those of the Ravi river, from July 22 to 24.
The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Sunday released grim statistics, confirming 135 fatalities and 478 injuries across the province from monsoon-related incidents this year.
The casualties included 99 deaths from building collapses, 19 from drowning, 12 from electrocution and five from lightning strikes.
In response to the dire forecast, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed all district administrations to remain on high alert for what he termed a “dual threat.”
“We are facing dual threats of urban flooding in cities and flash floods in riverine areas,” Mr Kathia said, warning that heavy precipitation in upper catchment areas could cause dangerous water level rises in the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum, and Indus rivers between July 22 to 24.
The Punjab government has also activated its compensation policy, providing financial assistance ranging from Rs 1m to Rs 5m to the families of those who lost loved ones.

India were reportedly keen to host the next final in two years’ time but England have been awarded the finals of the 2027, 2029 and 2031 editions.

“We are absolutely delighted that England and Wales has been chosen to host the next three ICC World Test Championship finals,” said England and Wales Cricket Board CEO Richard Gould. “It’s a testament to the passion that fans in this country have for this treasured format of the game and the willingness of supporters from around the world to travel here for these games.”

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in 2023.
In May, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302B (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). After the ruling by the apex court, a presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could possibly provide Zahir pardon, or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
According to the letters, which are addressed to the hospital director at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) from the superintendent at Adiala Jail, Zahir requires an opinion from a medical or psychiatric board before submitting a presidential mercy petition.
“The appeal of above mentioned Confirmed Condemned Prisoner (Zahir) was pending at [the] Supreme Court of Pakistan and the same has been dismissed,” the letter, dated July 8, read.
“Now the mercy petition of [the] subject cited Confirmed Condemned Prisoner has to be submitted before the Honourable President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. For that, the medical board and psychiatric board opinion is mandatory.”
The letter requested that a time and date be chosen for the medical and psychiatric boards to come to Adiala and examine Zahir.
The superintendent made the same request in another letter dated July 14.
 
 

In response to the first letter, Pims stated in a document seen by Dawn.com that Dr Shafqat Nawaz from the psychiatry department and Dr Amir Naveed from the neurology department will comprise the medical board.
Zahir was not only convicted of the murder, but was also sentenced to 25 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs200,000 under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the PPC.
In October last year, Noor’s father had urged the apex court to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years.</p><small>2025-07-20 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/20225453a8326ba.jpg?r=230852' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925456/ex-epstein-lawyer-calls-for-release-of-additional-case-materials' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-Epstein lawyer calls for release of additional case materials</strong></a><br><p>One of Jeffrey Epstein’s former attorneys on Sunday called on the US Justice Department to release additional investigative records from its sex-trafficking investigation, and urged the government to grant Epstein’s former girlfriend immunity so that she can testify about his crimes.
In an interview on Fox News on Sunday, Alan Dershowitz said the grand jury transcripts that Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday asked a federal judge to unseal would not contain the types of information being sought by President Donald Trump’s supporters, such as the names of Epstein’s clientele.
“I think the judge should release it, but they are not in the grand jury transcripts,” Dershowitz said on Fox News.
“I’ve seen some of these materials. For example, there is an FBI report of interviews with alleged victims in which at least one of the victims names very important people,” he said, adding that those names have been redacted.
US President Donald Trump has been under mounting pressure from his supporters to release additional information related to the government’s sex-trafficking probe into Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.
Earlier this year, Bondi promised that the department would release additional materials, including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs”.
The department back-tracked on that promise earlier this month, after releasing a joint memo with the FBI which poured cold water on long-running conspiracy theories about Epstein by saying there was “no incriminating client list” or any evidence of blackmail.
The memo also backed a prior FBI investigation, which concluded that Epstein died by suicide and was not murdered in his jail cell.
Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel have faced a growing backlash from Trump’s supporters since the memo was issued, prompting Trump last week to order the department to ask a court to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Epstein case.
The US government on Friday filed a motion in a Manhattan federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in the cases of Epstein and former associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of five federal charges related to her role in Epstein’s sexual abuse of underage girls. Maxwell is appealing her conviction and 20-year prison sentence to the US Supreme Court.
 
 

The release of the grand jury documents may fall short of what many of Trump’s supporters have sought, including case files held by the administration, and a judge may reject the administration’s request to make the transcripts public.
Dershowitz on Sunday told ‘Fox News Sunday’ that the information that Bondi did not request to be unsealed would be “far more informative and far more relevant”.
He added that the government should also grant Maxwell immunity so that she could testify before Congress about what knowledge she has of Epstein’s alleged crimes.
“She knows everything. She is the Rosetta Stone,” Dershowitz said of Maxwell. “If she were just given use immunity, she could be compelled to testify.”</p><small>2025-07-20 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/202125390964fec.png?r=213352' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925440/interior-minister-naqvi-discusses-counterterrorism-in-kabul-meeting-with-afghan-counterpart' target='_blank'><strong>Interior Minister Naqvi discusses counterterrorism in Kabul meeting with Afghan counterpart</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Sunday discussed counterterrorism efforts in a meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul.
The visit comes after a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the upgrading of each country’s diplomats from the rank of chargé d’affaires to ambassador. Both countries also held the inaugural round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism talks earlier in the month.
“Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi holds an important meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani,” the Interior Ministry said in a post on X.
 






Naqvi was warmly welcomed by interim Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani upon arrival at the Afghan Ministry of Interior, the post said.
“Discussion on bilateral relations, particularly counter-terrorism, infiltration, and the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban [Pakistan],” took place, according to the interior ministry.
Effective management of the Pak-Afghan border, prevention of narcotics, and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement were also discussed, the post said.
“Terrorist organisations are causing chaos and instability; We must stop them together,” Naqvi was quoted as having said to his counterpart.
“Pakistan has selflessly hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades; the doors are open for the legal entry of Afghan citizens,” the interior minister said.
The process of repatriation of Afghan citizens illegally residing in Pakistan was also a subject of the conversation between Naqvi and Haqqani.
Afghanistan’s Senior Deputy Interior Minister Ibrahim Sardar, Pakistan’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq, Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha and other senior diplomatic officials were there as part of the country’s delegation. Officials from the Afghan Ministry of Interior were also present on the occasion.
Earlier in the day, Naqvi arrived in Kabul on a day-long visit to Afghanistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






On his arrival at the Kabul airport, Naqvi was received by Afghan Interim Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Nabi Omari.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan signed the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in Kabul.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had made the announcement in a post on X from Kabul, where he had arrived on a day-long visit for the signing.
On Wednesday, the UN special representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, proposed a ‘prioritised’ regional dialogue with Pakistan, Iran and Central Asian states to halt the disorderly return of Afghans and uphold the principle of voluntary, dignified and safe repatriation.
On Friday, security forces foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and arrested five “alleged suicide bombers”, state-run PTV News reported.</p><small>2025-07-20 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614945-suspect-in-viral-honour-killing-video-arrested-confirms-balochistan-cm' target='_blank'><strong>Viral murder video prime suspect among 13 arrested in crackdown: CM Bugti</strong></a><br><p>

Taskin finished with 3-22 while Rahman grabbed 2-6 in his four economical overs to dismiss the visitors in 19.3 overs for Pakistan’s lowest total against Bangladesh in all T20Is.
Parvez smashed five sixes and three boundaries in his 39-ball 56 not out to help the home team chase down the target in 15.3 overs, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
 


Debutant Pakistan pacer Salman Mirza (2-23) jolted Bangladesh with wickets of Tanzid Hasan (one) and Litton Das (one) early on but Parvez and Towhid Hridoy (36) added 73 for the third wicket to ease up the chase.
It was only Bangladesh’s fourth win over Pakistan in 23 T20Is.
For Pakistan, opener Fakhar Zaman top-scored with a 34-ball 44, which included six boundaries and a six, while Abbas Afridi scored 22 and Khushdil Shah 17.
Pakistan’s previous lowest T20I total against Bangladesh was 127-5 at the same venue in 2021.
Litton admitted batting was not easy on a slow pitch.
“It’s not an easy wicket to bat on, but the way we batted, it looked good,” said Litton. “We took early wickets and that’s the key point.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Agha blamed poor batting.
“It wasn’t enough on the board as we lost wickets at regular intervals which we have to talk about before the second game,” said Salman.
Sent into bat, Pakistan had a disastrous start, with half the side dismissed for 46 in the eighth over with Saim Ayub (six), Mohammad Haris (four) and Agha (three) falling cheaply.
Hasan Nawaz fell without scoring and Mohammad Nawaz made just three.
Zaman, dropped on four and 30, added 24 for the sixth wicket before he was run out after being sent back by Khushdil Shah but was caught out of his crease.
Shah and Abbas took Pakistan past the 100-mark during their 33-run stand for the seventh wicket, hitting four sixes during their short stand.
The remaining matches are on Tuesday and Thursday, also in Dhaka.
Last month, Pakistan had whitewashed Bangladesh in a three-match home T20I series at the Gaddafi Stadium. Das-led Bangladesh took the field today on the back of an away 2-1 T20I series triumph over Sri Lanka last week.
Pakistan are visiting Bangladesh for the first time since December 2021 as they arrived in the country on Wednesday, after taking part in an extensive training camp in Karachi, the PCB said.
Pakistan gave a T20 debut to 31-year-old left-arm fast bowler Salman Mirza, while spinning all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz returns for his first international appearance since January 2024.
Earlier in the month, the PCB anno­unced a 15-member squad for the series, with five frontline players, including former captains Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afr­idi, omitted for a second series in a row.
Squads:
Bangladesh: Litton Das (captain), Parvez Hossain, Tanzid Hasan, Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Jaker Ali, Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Tanzim Hasan, Mustafizur Rahman, and Taskin Ahmed.
Pakistan: Salman Agha (captain), Saim Ayub, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Haris, Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Nawaz, Khushdil Shah, Faheem Ashraf, Abbas Afridi, Salman Mirza, and Abrar Ahmed.</p><small>2025-07-20 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/20185119c28891f.jpg?r=191404' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925443/9-terrorists-killed-8-captured-in-malakand-joint-action-by-military-leas-during-four-days' target='_blank'><strong>9 terrorists killed, 8 captured in Malakand joint action by military, LEAs during four days</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists and captured another eight during a four-day joint operation with police, the Counter Terrorism Department, paramilitary organisations and the district administration in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, the joint intelligence-based operation was conducted on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Khawarij — a term used to designate members of the banned TTP.
“During the conduct of operation, spread over four days, [our] own forces skillfully surrounded and effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after intense multiple fire exchanges, nine Indian-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell, while eight [others] were apprehended,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that two hideouts used by terrorists were destroyed and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered.
“Locals of the area appreciated the operation and expressed their full support for the state’s counter-terrorism efforts,” the military’s media wing said.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan, in step with the nation, are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement read.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Eleven terrorists were killed, five were injured and seven were arrested during joint operations conducted in the Hangu and Malakand districts on Saturday.
A senior army officer and two police officials were also wounded during the clash.
In a separate incident, Bannu police claimed to have shot down two explosive-laden quadcopters intended to target police stations.</p><small>2025-07-20 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/202118132bd918e.jpg?r=211930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925450/iranians-told-to-use-less-water-as-heatwave-worsens-shortages' target='_blank'><strong>Iranians told to use less water as heatwave worsens shortages</strong></a><br><p>Iranian authorities have urged residents to limit water consumption as the country grapples with severe shortages amid an ongoing heatwave, local media said on Sunday.
Water scarcity is a major issue in Iran, particularly in arid provinces in the country’s south, with shortages blamed on mismanagement and overexploitation of underground resources, as well as the growing impact of climate change.
On Saturday, the national meteorological service said Iran was experiencing its hottest week of the year so far, with temperatures exceeding 50­ degrees Celsius in some areas.
Government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani announced in a post on X on Sunday that Tehran province would observe a public holiday on Wednesday due to the ongoing heatwave.
“In light of the continued extreme heat and the necessity of conserving water and electricity, Wednesday … has been declared a holiday in Tehran Province,” she wrote.
 






Temperatures in Tehran reached 40°C on Sunday, with a further rise to 41°C forecast for Monday, according to meteorological reports.
Tehran city council chair Mehdi Chamran urged people to “conserve water to avoid drops in supplies”, according to the ISNA news agency.
Authorities across Iran have issued similar appeals in recent days, asking residents in several provinces to limit water usage.
Tehran’s provincial water management company called to reduce usage by “at least 20 per cent” to help ease the shortages.
In a statement, it said that “the reservoirs of the dams supplying water to Tehran are currently at their lowest level in a century”, following years of steady decline in rainfall.
Javan, a conservative newspaper, reported on Saturday that authorities had reduced water supplies in parts of the capital in a bid to mitigate the crisis, resulting in “water outages lasting between 12 and 18 hours” in some areas.
Energy Minister Abbas Aliabadi apologised on Sunday over reduced water supplies, saying that the move comes “to better manage resources”.</p><small>2025-07-20 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/20214418d50ee2c.jpg?r=214636' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925451/trump-xi-might-meet-ahead-of-or-during-october-apec-summit-in-south-korea-scmp-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Trump, Xi might meet ahead of or during October APEC summit in South Korea, SCMP reports</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump might visit China before going to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit between October 30 and November 1, or he could meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC event in South Korea, The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, citing multiple sources.
The two countries have been trying to negotiate an end to an escalating tit-for-tat tariff war that has upended global trade and supply chains.
The two sides have discussed a potential meeting between the leaders in the region this year, but they have not confirmed a date or location yet, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Trump has sought to impose tariffs on US importers for virtually all foreign goods, which he says will stimulate domestic manufacturing and which critics say will make many consumer goods more expensive for Americans.
He has called for a universal base tariff rate of 10 per cent on goods imported from all countries, with higher rates for imports from the most “problematic” ones, including China: imports from there now have the highest tariff rate of 55pc.
Trump has set a deadline of August 12 for the US and China to reach a durable tariffs agreement.
A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment about the reported plans for a meeting with Xi in the autumn.
The two countries’ most recent high-level meeting was on July 11, when US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had what both described as a productive and positive meeting in Malaysia about how trade negotiations should proceed.
Rubio said then that Trump had been invited to China to meet with Xi, and said that both leaders “want it to happen”.
On Friday, China’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said China wants to bring its trade ties with the US back to a stable footing and that recent talks in Europe showed there was no need for a tariff war.</p><small>2025-07-20 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614926-mohsin-naqvi-arrives-in-kabul-on-day-long-visit-to-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan vow joint efforts against terrorism, border threats</strong></a><br><p>

The oath-taking issue has risen once again after the recent redistribution of reserved seats in the wake of a verdict by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats from the PTI and declared other political parties eligible for them.
 


Kundi delivered a press conference following the swearing-in ceremony, where he highlighted that the government reneged on an agreement it had made with the opposition.
“A formula of 6-5 was agreed upon and our opposition candidates withdrew,” the KP governor said. “All of them agreed that they will contest five seats — two will be contested by the JUI-F, two by the PPP, and the PML-N will for one.
“The PTI founder [Imran Khan] then made a decision, and their information secretary said, ‘our Senate candidates are not in our control’. If your Senate candidates are not in control, then how are the MPAs-elect in your control?” Kundi asked.
“The point is, we had a deal in place, we had an agreement. But their members were not completely on board.”
The KP governor highlighted that there are between 30 and 35 independent members of the assembly.
“We have spoken with them, and we are hopeful that we can move towards 6-5. As soon as the leader of the opposition briefs us, we will have a strategy ready for tonight and then we will contest tomorrow’s [Senate] elections,” Kundi said.
Earlier, the opposition MPAs could not take their oaths on reserved seats due to a lack of quorum in the provincial assembly.
At today’s assembly session, which had been called by the KP government, the 25 MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and minorities were expected to be sworn in. The session had assumed importance as the non-administration of oaths could lead to the postponement of Senate polls set for tomorrow for 11 seats from the legislature.
The session was scheduled for 9am but began with a delay of two hours and 20 minutes, with KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati presiding over it. As soon as the session started, MPA Sher Ali Afridi of the ruling PTI pointed out a lack of quorum, leading to the session being adjourned till July 24.
Upon Afridi’s remarks, PML-N’s Sobia Shahid contended that a lack of quorum could not be pointed out between the recitation of the Holy Quran and the oath-taking. “You (KP government) have been making a joke out of this province for a year,” she said.
Swati asked her to point out the legal provisions for her argument instead of giving a speech.

Ahmad Karim Kundi, the PPP’s parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly, also spoke on the floor of the assembly, backing Shahid. He asserted that the administration of oath was “mandatory”, citing Article 255 of the Constitution.
The speaker also asked Ahmad to state the relevant provisions requiring so and issued a ruling to count the MPAs in attendance, at which it emerged that only 25 lawmakers were present.
Addressing PML-N’s Dr Ibadullah, Swati said: “Opposition leader sahib, there are 25 members present. The quorum is incomplete; ring the bells.”
The opposition lawmakers then came to the front of the speaker’s dais to protest. Swati then adjourned the session, saying: “As the quorum is incomplete, the sitting is adjourned till 2pm on Thursday, July 24.”
Governor to administer oaths after PHC order
The ECP had approached the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday, requesting that Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect under Article 255(2) (oath of office) of the Constitution.
Subsequently, after today’s session, the PHC registrar issued an order by Justice Shah that accepted the ECP request and nominated Governor Kundi to administer the oaths “at the earliest”.
It stressed that the governor should ensure that the oaths are “administered in the manner prescribed and proper record be maintained in accordance with the official procedure”. The judge also directed the KP Assembly secretary to facilitate the newly notified MPAs to sign the Roll of the Members.
A notification by the KP Governor’s secretariat, seen by Dawn.com, said Kundi would administer the oaths to the MPAs-elect at 6pm today.
The ECP has changed the timing for the Senate elections from 9am to 11am.
 






Earlier in the day, the ECP had issued a statement announcing that Kundi will administer the oaths at 9am tomorrow at Governor House. It ordered KP Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed, the chief secretary and the Federal Constabulary IG to ensure foolproof security arrangements for the ceremony.
Speaking outside the KP Assembly after the session, Ibadullah said he would approach the courts against the delay in the oath-taking, assailing the PTI government.
“Do not hand over whatever political space is left to others,” he said. “No one can stop these oaths […] at which forum will they (PTI) challenge it?” the PML-N lawmaker said.
Ibadullah stressed that the opposition’s women and minority members had not had representation in the Senate for one and a half years, since the 2024 general elections.
Terming the PTI “politically immature”, he pointed out that it was the PTI government’s “responsibility” to ensure a proper quorum, given their majority in the KP Assembly.
Before the assembly session, the PTI held a parliamentary party meeting, in which it decided that none of its MPAs would attend the proceedings, calling the oaths a “theft of its right”.
 


Oaths an insult to public’s opinion: Barrister Saif
In a statement, PTI’s Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, public relations adviser to KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, called it a “black day for parliamentary politics” and a “murder of democracy”.
“The oaths of opposition MPAs on reserved seats are an insult to the public’s opinion. […] The opposition is dissatisfied despite winning, while the PTI is satisfied even after losing as it has the public’s support,” Saif said.
 
 

The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly. After the latest notifications by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the PML-N each hold 17 seats in the 125-member house, while the PPP holds 10 seats.
The Awami National Party (ANP) and PTI-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) each have three seats, while two seats were to be decided through a separate draw for each.
The PTI treasury and the joint opposition alliance had also agreed on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats will go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition.
Party will take action against ‘disgruntled’ Senate election candidates: Gandapur
KP Chief Minister Party Ali Amin Gandapur said that his party will take action against “disgruntled” Senate election candidates.
Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, Gandapur said, “Rejecting PTI founder Imran Khan’s decision is a defiance of his position as party founder.”
He added that the alliance with the opposition is only till the Senate elections.
Earlier, an agreement was reached with the opposition on the formula of PTI receiving eight seats and the opposition getting three in the upcoming Senate elections, he added.
“We suffered losses due to our candidates not withdrawing their papers,” he added, saying, “Now, we will get six seats and the opposition will get five seats.”

According to the Edhi rescue service, the bus overturned near the Thatta Bypass, following which a rescue team reached the site of the incident and transported the injured to a hospital.
“The bodies of the six victims were initially taken to a mortuary in Orangi Town,” the service said in a statement, adding that they were later transported to Edhi’s morgue in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth.
The bus was carrying a group of picnickers from Karachi to Keenjhar Lake when it overturned while taking a sharp turn, killing six passengers and injuring dozens others, state-owned Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Local authorities and rescue teams were quick to respond, reaching the crash site within minutes. The injured were rushed to Karachi hospitals, with several reported to be in critical condition,” it said.
In another incident, at least one person was killed and several others, including women and children, were critically injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Gambat National Highway in Sindh’s Khairpur district.
According to APP, the incident took place while the bus was en route from Karachi to Swabi. Rescue teams, along with local police, reached the incident site and rushed the injured to nearby hospitals for medical aid.
 
 

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the bus accidents, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.
Expressing sympathy with the Makli incident victims, he issued directives to the Thatta deputy commissioner (DC) to ensure the provision of immediate medical assistance to the injured. The chief minister further told him to immediately contact their families and fully cooperate.
Expressing sorrow over the Khairpur coach accident, CM Murad issued similar instructions to the Khairpur DC to ensure medical treatment of the wounded. He urged people to drive carefully to protect precious lives.
In a separate incident, two cousins aged 15 and 12 died in a road accident near Tooba Masjid in the vicinity of Kala Pul in Karachi, according to Edhi officials.
The bodies of the cousins were transferred to Jinnah Hospital.
Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
Earlier this month, four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a drain on Hawkes’ Bay Road in Karachi’s Mauripur area.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the family was returning from the Hawke’s Bay beach, and the accident most likely happened as a result of speeding.
In an incident on July 15, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near Karachi’s New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.
On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, killing a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.
On June 11, a young man was killed and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p><small>2025-07-20 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2016352650b2003.jpg?r=163739' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925436/4-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-kalat-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 terrorists killed in Balochistan’s Kalat operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed four terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. Earlier this week, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Kalat.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that the intelligence-based operation took place on the night of July 19-20, upon the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan”.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-Al-Hindu­stan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the statement read.
According to the ISPR, weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
Meanwhile, PTV News reported that security forces seized a Fitna Al Hindustan flag as well.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the statement concluded.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to security forces for killing the four terrorists in a statement from his office.
“The security forces are always determined to eradicate terrorism,” the president was quoted as saying. “Terrorism will be defeated at all costs with national unity.”
The statement added that operations against terrorism will continue.
“Fitna Al Hindustan will be pursued till the end,” the president was quoted as saying.
On Saturday, a senior officer belonging to the security forces was martyred in a bomb attack at the Western Bypass area, according to officials.
Police said a magnetic explosive device was attached to the officer’s vehicle, which exploded in the Jabl-i-Noor area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta.
CCTV footage from a nearby camera showed a motorcyclist passing close to the vehicle moments before the explosion. He reportedly attached the explosive device to the driver’s side door. A few seconds later, the blast took place.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.
Meanwhile, on Friday, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.
According to Rind’s statement, “A police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.
“Acting DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,” he said.
Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.
“Terrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished,” the spokesperson said.</p><small>2025-07-20 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/201609463c1b693.jpg?r=161348' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925434/seven-cops-abducted-in-south-waziristan-police' target='_blank'><strong>Seven cops ‘abducted’ in South Waziristan: police</strong></a><br><p>Seven police personnel of two police stations were allegedly abducted in two separate incidents on Sunday while patrolling in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan district, police said.
Upper South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Arshad Khan confirmed the incident and said efforts are underway to locate the policemen who went missing during routine patrolling.
“Seven police personnel were patrolling when unidentified individuals took them away,” DPO Arshad told Dawn.com.
He said three policemen — Insaf, Abid and Ismail — were on patrol in the limits of Ladha police station when they went missing.
In a separate but similar incident, four policemen went missing from Tanga Chagmalai in the limits of Sarwakai police station. They include sub-inspector Abdul Khaliq, and constables Irfanullah, Habibullah and Imran.
The police officer said no information has been received about the missing policemen and a search operation is underway to locate them.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
This comes a day after nine terrorists were killed and three security officers were injured during an exchange of fire as security forces and police carried out a joint operation in Hangu’s Zargari Shinawari area.
“Hangu DPO Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” a statement by KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed read.
On June 24, two soldiers were martyred and 11 “Indian Proxy” terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in South Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said.
 
 

A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and “11 Indian sponsored khwarij” were killed, while seven were injured. During the intense fire exchange, Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah and Lance Naik Jibranullah “fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice”, it added.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents. Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p><small>2025-07-20 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614904-four-indian-backed-terrorists-killed-in-kalat-ibo' target='_blank'><strong>Four Indian-backed terrorists killed in Kalat IBO</strong></a><br><p>
