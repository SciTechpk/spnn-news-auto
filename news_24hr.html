As part of its Vision 2028 agenda, the SBP launched Cyber Shield, a major initiative aimed at strengthening the safety and robustness of the country’s banking and financial system.
The banks have been facing increasing incidents of cyber crimes, while the international organisations believe that every second Pakistani is facing the cybersecurity problem.
With the rapid digitisation and very high growth of online payments, cyber threats have also increased. Bankers said the situation is not alarming, but there is a need to implement quick remedies to control it, which would help strengthen the banking system in Pakistan.

Outlines key priorities to counter growing threats by 2030

“The milestones laid down in the strategy will be implemented in a phased manner by 2030. All regulated entities are required to align their internal cybersecurity programs with the strategy to ensure compliance,” said the SBP.
The central bank said the strategy has been designed to better protect banks and financial institutions from cyber threats, thus ensuring that people and businesses can continue to access financial services safely.
The SBP said it set out a clear roadmap to help financial institutions strengthen their systems and controls, prevent cyber incidents, respond quickly when cyber threats materialise, and recover effectively from them.
“As the banking ecosystem faces increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, the strategy aims to enhance cyber defences of the regulated entities through a holistic, forward-looking and collaborative approach,” said the SBP.
Bankers said cybersecurity experts are not available to meet the growing demand in financial institutions, as many young Pakistani experts prefer jobs abroad with higher pay. There is no attractive policy to retain cybersecurity experts in the country.
The SBP said the Cyber Shield focuses on five key priorities: strengthening the ability of banks to withstand cyber incidents, improving governance and accountability for cybersecurity, encouraging cooperation and information-sharing across the financial sector, building skilled cyber talent, and continuously updating security practices to keep pace with new risks.
“The SBP will closely monitor both global and domestic cyber developments and will update the strategy as needed to address emerging threats,” said the SBP.
By strengthening cyber resilience across the banking sector, SBP aims to safeguard customers, support digital innovation in a secure environment and ensure financial stability, it added.
About 90 per cent of bankers believe that cybercrime is the biggest challenge confronting the banking industry in the country, according to a previous survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Pakistan.
Seventy per cent list fraud as their major concern, and 60 per cent believe terrorism financing is the biggest threat, the survey showed.
“Banks in Pakistan operate within an evolving financial crime compliance ecosystem,” said the survey report.

ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power and Regulatory Authority (Nepra) came under fire on Monday over abrupt changes to the net metering policy, as the National Assembly Stan­ding Committee on Industries and Production questioned the rationale of the move which would “shatter the trust of the investors in the government policies”.
In a meeting held under the chairmanship of MQM’s Syed Hafeezuddin, the parliamentarians and the government officials criticised the policy change from net metering to net billing.
Earlier this month, Nepra drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
According to the committee chairman, the policy will have serious implications for the government’s reputation. When the regulator can honour the commitments made to the independent power producers, it should also respect the response by industries and individuals who availed the net metering policy introduced by the government, he said.
Mr Hafeezuddin said the industrial units opted for this policy and invested in solar power systems, but they have been left in a lurch after the new net billing policy was introduced by the government.

 

Members of the committee and even the industries secretary expressed concerns that the policy change would shatter the trust of investors in government policies as well as discourage industries from adopting clean technologies. The com­m­ittee noted that the premise used by Nepra to change the policy was not based on any “rat­i­onal study” by the power ministry.
“Pakistan needs to promote solar and other clean energy for the industries; it will help reduce the cost of doing business on a long-term basis,” Mr Hafeezuddin added.
Development projects
The key agenda of the NA panel’s meeting was to review and approve the ongoing development projects under the various departments of the industries ministry. After strict scrutiny of the project, the committee turned down a large number of projects, demanding their monitoring reports from the Planning Commission. The delay and cost escalation particularly irked the panel members.
“I know and I understand that Covid and dollar crises, and a change in government had some impact on all matters,” Dr Mehreen Bhutto said, adding that all projects had been delayed by six to nine years and the briefs given to the lawmakers were “always incomplete — why is that the case”.
Committee members, including Abdul Hakeem Baloch and Shahid Usman, contradicted the claims made by the departments under the Ministry of Industries regarding several development projects. Responding to the projects in Hub and Karachi, the chairman reprimanded the officials that he had been to these areas and the ground reality was different.
While Shahid Usman had a different picture of the projects in Gujranwala, Dr Bhutto highlighted that the briefs presented to the committee lacked even basic details.
“There is no mention of rupees in millions or billions in the brief, the details are incomplete,” she added.
The committee members noted that departments opt to go for new buildings and purchase land for projects instead of using the land of non-functioning state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
“It is understandable why the SOEs are making losses,” Mr Hafeezuddin said.
The committee also discussed the case of a former employee of the Engineering Development Board, Engineer K.B Ali, who was transferred back to his parent department but he has approached the court of law and obtained a stay order.

PM Shehbaz arrived in Vienna a day earlier on a two-day visit, with the Foreign Office (FO) noting that it marked the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria since 1992.
PM Shehbaz and Stocker held a “restricted meeting” at the Federal Chancellery today, which was followed by delegation-level talks, a press release issued by PID said.
The delegation talks included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, and Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch.
The statement read: “Both leaders recalled the friendly and historic ties between the two countries and committed to work together more closely to further strengthen the bilateral relationship in diverse fields, including economic cooperation, trade and investment, tourism, hospitality, education, IT, healthcare and human resource development and mobility.
“To this end, they agreed to work for the early finalisation of MoUs (memoranda of understanding) under consideration related to these areas.”
The premier and the chancellor also “exchanged views on regional and global developments, and agreed on the central role of the United Nations in addressing the challenges of peace and security, peaceful settlement of disputes, sustainable development, climate action and protection and promotion of human rights”.

 

“They expressed their shared commitment to multilateralism and appreciated mutual support for each other’s candidatures, while working together with the international community for strengthening the UN system,” PID added.
PM Shehbaz thanked Stocker for the “meaningful and productive meetings” during the visit, which he said would lend fresh impetus to bilateral ties.
He also extended an invitation to the chancellor to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at his earliest convenience.

According to the PID statement, the premier and the chancellor co-chaired a meeting of chief executive officers (CEOs) from leading Austrian and Pakistani companies working in a wide range of areas.
“It was agreed to expand G2G (government to government), G2B (government to business) and B2B (business to business) engagements between the two countries through the effective utilisation of the existing platforms,” the statement read.
The prime minister invited the Austrian businesses and companies to participate in the upcoming EU-Pakistan Business Forum to be held in Islamabad in April this year.
PM Shehbaz and Austrian Federal Economic Chamber Vice President Carmen Goby also witnessed the signing ceremony of an MoU between Pakistani and Austrian companies.







In a post on X later, PM Shehbaz stressed that his visit “carries special significance as we are having a high-level visit after more than three decades”.
“It also coincides with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan–Austria diplomatic relations,” he noted.
He termed the meeting with Stocker “most warm and productive”, reiterating that the two reaffirmed their countries’ resolve to work closely in diverse fields.







‘Pakistan working to jointly ban illegal immigration’
Separately, PM Shehbaz stated that Pakistan was working with European partners to “jointly ban” illegal immigration.
Addressing the Pakistan–Austria High-Level Business Roundtable in Vienna, he affirmed Pakistan was “absolutely” against illegal immigration and was “working with our European friends — Austria, France, and Germany — to jointly ban this illegal immigration [and bring it] to a grinding halt”.
He assured Austria that Pakistan would fulfil its “demand for skilled labour” as per the international certification required by it.
Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities.
A 2023 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European Union (EU) found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.



At the outset of his address, the premier stressed that Pakistan and Austria shared “long-standing friendly relations”.
The premier outlined the areas in which the two countries remained “proactively engaged”, including mining and minerals and renewable energy.
He detailed that he held meetings with the leadership of Austria, stating that he aims “to take many of these discussions to their logical conclusion”.
He noted that 6o per cent of Pakistan’s population was young and “needed modern training in their hands, including laptops, AI, and IT-led initiatives”.
PM Shehbaz highlighted that Pakistan held “huge potential” in the field of agriculture.
“Here, Austria can be a great partner, providing Pakistan with experience and modern technology to have value-addition in the field of citrus root, and make marmalade, juices and export them to Austria, the Middle East and other parts of the world”, the premier added.
Pakistan–Austria high-level business roundtable
Meanwhile, FM Dar delivered the opening remarks at the Pakistan–Austria high-level business roundtable in Vienna, hosted at the Austrian Federal Economic Chamber and chaired by PM Shehbaz, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.
It added that the forum brought together leading businesses from both countries, reflecting the positive momentum in Pakistan–Austria trade and investment ties.
Speaking on the occasion, Dar emphasised expanding cooperation in trade, investment, technology, and innovation, while highlighting Pakistan’s ongoing economic reforms and focus on improving the ease of doing business.
He noted the “natural complementarities between Austria’s technological strengths and Pakistan’s dynamic market and young workforce”.
The FO statement said that he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to a stronger partnership with Austria and expressed confidence that enhanced business-to-business linkages, institutional collaboration, and sustained political engagement would open new avenues of growth, connectivity, and long-term economic partnership with Austria and across the European region.







Earlier on Monday, PM Shehbaz was welcomed by Stocker upon his arrival at the Austrian Chancellery and was presented with a guard of honour, the Prime Minister’s Office said.







The statement said that the national anthems of both countries were played at the arrival, and both leaders “introduced their respective delegations to each other before proceeding for tête-à-tête and the delegation-level talks”.
The premier also penned his remarks in the guest book at the Chancellery.
This visit marks 70 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</p><small>2026-02-16 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/162345164363909.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973718/kp-cm-says-no-official-call-given-to-pti-workers-for-protest-apologises-to-people-of-province-for-difficulties' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM says ‘no official call’ given to PTI workers for protest, apologises to people of province for ‘difficulties’</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi apologised to the people of his province on Monday, saying that PTI workers had taken to the streets of their own accord.
His statement comes against the backdrop of protests at multiple places by PTI activists in KP. The party workers have blocked entry and exit points to the province, resulting in inconveniences for the people and KP being cut off from the rest of the country.
The protests began on Friday, simultaneously with sit-ins by opposition parliamentarians and Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan leaders in Islamabad, over PTI founder Imran Khan’s health.
When KP CM was asked today about what would be the next line of action for PTI workers, he said: “We have not given any line of action to the workers. The workers have come out on their own. Our strategy was just for the parliamentarians.”







He said the plan devised for parliamentarians was to stage a “peaceful sit-in” outside the Parliament in Islamabad. “But, unfortunately, some of us were stopped at the KP House, some at the Parliament Lodges and some at the Parliament House.”
He again reiterated that “no official call” had been given to party workers for the protest, and they had taken to the streets of their own accord.
“They have shut down KP,” he acknowledged, apologising to the people of the province.
He said the PTI was facing a hard time, with its leader jailed and facing health issues.
“The [PTI] workers might have acted emotionally, but you [the people] please have patience. You have voted for the PTI, and you love Imran Khan. So if you have faced difficulties for two or three days for his sake, I apologise. Please wait a little more, and the situation will get better,” Afridi said.</p><small>2026-02-16 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1623331762fc921.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973697/iran-says-us-more-realistic-on-nuclear-issue-as-guards-begin-drills-in-hormuz-strait' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says US ‘more realistic’ on nuclear issue, as Guards begin drills in Hormuz Strait</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Monday that the United States’s position on Iran’s nuclear programme “has moved towards a more realistic one”, a day ahead of a second round of US-Iranian talks in Geneva.
Tehran’s foreign minister arrived in Geneva for the new round of indirect negotiations with the US, as the Revolutionary Guards began military drills in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping lane for oil and gas.
The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
“A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one,” said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, the official IRNA news agency reported.
According to Tehran, talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday in Switzerland.
Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.
The war games being conducted by the Guards, the ideological arm of the military, aim to prepare it for “potential security and military threats” in the Strait, Iranian state TV said.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic waterway through which about 20 per cent of global oil passes, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday, “We’re hopeful there’s a deal”.
“The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.”
Meanwhile, Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, wrote on X that he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, “for deep technical discussion”.







Grossi later confirmed the meeting on X, calling the conversation with Araghchi “in-depth” ahead of Tuesday’s “important negotiations”.







Protest crackdown
Araghchi is also set to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as other international officials, Iran’s foreign ministry said.
“I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal. What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araghchi added on X.







Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
The latest talks follow repeated threats from Trump of military action against Tehran, first over Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country’s nuclear programme.
The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.
His remarks came before demonstrations outside Iran against its authorities swept a number of cities, including in the US, over the weekend.
‘Viable’ deal
Iran’s deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy.
“If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement,” said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran’s ability to enrich more.
The whereabouts of Iran’s stockpile of around 400 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to 60 per cent remains unknown, with inspectors having last seen it in June.</p><small>2026-02-16 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651222-imran-khans-sons-fear-for-his-health-seek-visas-to-visit-him-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sons fear for his health, seek visas to visit him in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which said only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye.
This prompted a strong response from opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP), which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination.
The protest, which began on Friday, entered its fourth day today, with TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai saying that it would continue till Tuesday.
He shared this information with Dawn hours after a medical report was released following Imran’s examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
“We have gone through Imran Khan’s medical report, but we will not be satisfied unless his family and personal physicians are allowed to meet him,” he said, adding that the opposition had asked for Imran’s cousin Dr Nosherwan Barki and other family physicians to be provided access to him.
He also reiterated the opposition’s demand for shifting Imran to Shifa International Hospital, claiming: “We got a commitment from [Interior Minister] Mohsin Naqvi, [Parliamentary Affairs Minister] Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and [Prime Minister’s Assistant on Political Affairs] Rana Sanaullah that Imran Khan will be moved to the hospital.”
But, he continued, the government sent a team to the Adiala jail instead for Imran’s medical examination.
“The government deviated from its commitment,” he claimed.
Earlier in the day, routes to the Parliament House, which were blocked ahead of the sit-in on Friday, were cleared.
Speaking to Dawn in the morning, Yousafzai said it was a surprising step that all the routes had been cleared.
“First of all, we are going to have breakfast after four days, as previously we were eating only dates and biscuits and were being forced to drink tap water. It has been decided to merge the sit-in at the Parliament lodges with the one at Parliament House,” he had added.
The opposition’s sit-in was initially held at three places, including the Parliament House, led by TTAP head Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. The protest outside the Parliament Lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, KP CM Sohail Afridi led the demonstration.
The sit-in at the KP House was also ongoing on Monday night, in which KP Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi has also been participating.
Speaking to the media there, he stressed that getting medical treatment under the supervision of his personal physicians and in the presence of his family was Imran’s constitutional right.
“Imran Khan is not an ordinary prisoner. He is a former prime minister and the leader of a major political party,” Afridi said, adding that barring the PTI founder’s family and personal physicians from meeting him was increasing “apprehensions”.
He stressed that the health of Imran Khan was a matter “beyond politics and must be treated accordingly”.
If Imran’s medical report released today was accurate, “there is no justification for denying access to his personal doctors and family”, he said.
On Sunday, a team of doctors examined the PTI founder at Adiala Jail and left the premises after around an hour, sources said.
The party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital.
“We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party.
“We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad,” he told Dawn.</p><small>2026-02-16 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16224547c622ed5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973714/sri-lankas-8-wicket-win-over-australia-leaves-2021-champions-on-brink-of-exit-from-the-tournament' target='_blank'><strong>Sri Lanka’s 8-wicket win over Australia leaves 2021 champions on brink of exit from the tournament</strong></a><br><p>Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka scored the first century of the 2026 T20 World Cup on Monday to put his side into the Super Eights and leave Australia on the brink of elimination.
Nissanka scored 100 not out off 52 balls with five sixes and 10 fours as Sri Lanka, chasing Australia’s 181, reached 184-2 with two overs to spare in Kandy to win by eight wickets.
A victory by Zimbabwe over Ireland in Group B on Tuesday, or against Sri Lanka on Thursday, would eliminate the 2021 champions.
If Zimbabwe lose both, Australia will need to beat Oman in their final match on Friday by a big margin to get through on net run rate.
Nissanka was involved in a 97-run stand off 66 balls with Kusal Mendis for the second wicket with the wicketkeeper-batsman posting his third fifty in the competition.
Nissanka became the first Sri Lankan to score two hundreds in T20 internationals.
After Mendis’s dismissal, Nissanka and Pavan Rathnayake put on 76 off 34 balls to see Sri Lanka to victory.
Nissanka played some glorious cover drives off the spinners and played some elegant flicks against the quicks.
Sri Lanka came into the World Cup after a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of England, but have gained momentum and have won all three games so far.
Australia’s campaign has been plagued by injuries.
Their captain, Mitchell Marsh, who missed the first two games, returned and gave them a rollicking start by scoring 54.
Marsh and Travis Head (56) scored 104 runs off 51 balls for the first wicket.
With Australia eyeing a total in excess of 200, Sri Lanka’s slow bowlers kept them to 181 with leg-spinner Dushan Hemantha picking up 3-37.
Australia collapsed as they looked for quick runs, losing their last six wickets for 21 in 24 balls.</p><small>2026-02-16 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16214624e3caf94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973712/israel-police-to-deploy-around-al-aqsa-for-ramazan-palestinians-report-curbs' target='_blank'><strong>Israel police to deploy around Al-Aqsa for Ramazan, Palestinians report curbs</strong></a><br><p>Israeli police said on Monday that they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during the holy month of Ramazan, which begins this week, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.
Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Al-Aqsa — Islam’s third-holiest site, located in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed.
Arad Braverman, a senior Jerusalem police officer, said forces would be deployed “day and night” across the compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, and in the surrounding area.
He said thousands of police personnel would also be on duty for Friday prayers, which draw the largest crowds of worshippers.
Braverman said police had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.
He did not say whether age limits would apply, adding that the final number of people would be decided by the government.
The Palestinian Jerusalem Governorate said in a separate statement it had been informed that permits would again be restricted to men over 55 and women over 50, mirroring last year’s criteria.
It said Israeli authorities had blocked the Waqf — the Jordanian-run body administering the site — from carrying out routine preparations, including installing shade structures and setting up temporary medical clinics.
A Waqf source confirmed the restrictions and said 33 of its employees had been barred from entering the compound in the week before Ramazan.
The Al-Aqsa compound is a central symbol of Palestinian identity and also a frequent flashpoint.
Under long-standing arrangements, Jews may visit the compound, but they are not permitted to pray there.
Israel says it is committed to maintaining this status quo, though Palestinians fear it is being eroded.

The site was displaying content, allowing users to post and otherwise functioning normally again around 1530 GMT, after the Downdetector tracking website reported a spike in outage reports around two hours before.
Downdector showed that reports of issues peaked in Pakistan at 6:54pm, with 275 users flagging problems, before slowly tapering down to 8 by 7:54pm.
X had appeared to be suffering “international outages,” connectivity monitor Netblocks posted on the open-source social network Mastodon during the disruption.
The breakdown was “not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering”, added Netblocks, which regularly flags technical issues with popular online services and sites as well as interference by national governments.
Its most recent posts about similar outages for X came on February 9, the day after the Super Bowl in the US, and February 1.
AFP journalists in countries including France and Thailand had also been unable to access X on Monday afternoon.
Spokespeople for X did not respond to AFP’s request for comment on the outage before service was restored.
Musk laid off thousands of people at the former Twitter and changed its name after buying the service in 2022.
He has since merged it with his xAI company, which develops the Grok chatbot.
xAI is set to in turn be absorbed by Musk’s rocket firm SpaceX, with that merged entity expected to go public as early as summer this year.
Last month, the social media platform faced issues twice, on Jan 13 and Jan 16, with the outages affecting thousands of users globally.</p><small>2026-02-16 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16181718a934476.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973700/ppp-criticises-federal-govt-for-dropping-petrol-bomb-on-public-close-to-ramazan' target='_blank'><strong>PPP criticises federal govt for dropping ‘petrol bomb’ on public close to Ramazan</strong></a><br><p>PPP central spoke­sperson Shazia Marri criticised the federal government on Monday for dropping a “petrol bomb” on the public close to Ramazan, terming the latest hike in petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) prices “unjust” and “highly unfair”.
The government increased petrol and HSD prices by Rs5 and Rs7.32 per litre, respectively, on Sunday night. The ex-depot price of petrol now stands at Rs258.17 per litre and of HSD at Rs275.70 per litre.
The government said the new prices will continue till the end of February, owing to movement in international market prices.
A statement on the PPP’s website said Marri strongly rejected the federal government’s decision to increase the prices of petroleum products, terming it “unjust and ill-advised” ahead Ramazan.
According to the statement, Marri said that raising the price of petrol and diesel just days before Ramazan “is a highly unfair and unwise move”.
She described the increase as a “petrol bomb” dropped on the public at a time when people were already struggling with “record inflation”.
The PPP lawmaker said, “The government should have focused on providing relief to inflation-hit citizens instead of imposing additional financial burdens.”
“The hike in petroleum prices will severely affect the poor, labourers, and middle class and will trigger a fresh rise in food prices and transportation costs,” she warned.
The statement said Marri highlighted the “contradiction” in the federal government policies.
“On one hand, the government is announcing a Ramazan relief package, while on the other, it is fuelling inflation through price hikes. It is a clear policy failure,” Marri was further quoted as saying.
She urged the government to “concentrate on addressing unemployment, inflation, and the ongoing economic crisis rather than taking decisions that further aggravate public hardship”.
Marri demanded that the government immediately review and withdraw the increase in petroleum prices and take concrete steps to provide real relief to the people.
Meanwhile, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said that raising petrol and diesel prices before Ramazan would “add to inflationary pressure and further strain the budgets of the poor and middle class”.
“I urge the government to reconsider this decision and prioritise meaningful economic relief for the people,” he said.

Mobina Town police said that the fire broke out in the bushes near the university.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the rescue service received information about blaze around 4:00pm.
“Initially, two fire tenders were sent. However, due to heavy winds and dry bushes, the fire spread rapidly, engulfing a plant nursery near the varsity,” the rescue spokesperson said.
He said that due to the gravity of the situation, four more fire tenders were dispatched, which managed to extinguish the fire. He said the bushes were at a distance; therefore, no casualties were reported.
He said that the Rescue 1122 recently “rehabilitated” one fire tender at the university and advised them to utilise it in emergency cases to prevent the spread of flames.
Khan recalled that a few months earlier, a huge fire had erupted in the vicinity of the same area, which had claimed the life of one man residing in the area in a makeshift hut.</p><small>2026-02-16 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1620303449c4e9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973692/federal-govt-assures-sc-of-compliance-with-directives-issued-concerning-imran' target='_blank'><strong>Federal govt assures SC of compliance with directives issued concerning Imran</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Monday assured the Supreme Court (SC) that PTI founder Imran Khan had been allowed to speak to his children, adding that the medical examination of the ex-premier was also carried out by an expert team.
Last week, a two-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had instructed the government to form a medical team to examine incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan after a report submitted by his lawyer, Salman Safdar, revealed that the former prime minister had lost 85 per cent of the vision in his right eye. The court had also asked authorities to arrange calls between Imran and his children.
On Monday, the government, through Deputy Attorney General Raja Muhammad Shafqat Abbasi, filed a fresh application in the SC.
The government said it was placing on record the report prepared by the Adiala jail superintendent to highlight the SC’s earlier directions, issued on Aug 24, 2023, in exercise of powers under Article 184 of the Constitution (a provision now scrubbed through the 27th Constitutional Amendment).
“Otherwise, such an order was not germane or in any manner connected with the matter at hand, which arose out of criminal proceedings underway against Imran,” the report said, adding that in deference to the SC, proceedings culminating in the directions issued on Feb 12 were “not objected to”.
In its Aug 24, 2023 order, a three-judge SC bench, headed by then-CJP Umar Ata Bandial, had directed the attorney general for Pakistan to furnish an official report regarding the living conditions of the PTI founder in his jail cell. At that time, Imran was incarcerated at Attock jail.

 

The report submitted on Thursday highlighted that Imran had been given better class prison facilities while efforts were being made by the jail administration to keep his living conditions in line with ‘Better Class’ prisoners under the jail manual.
It said that Imran’s place of confinement at Adiala jail was safe, secure and was properly manned by the prison staff. The jail superintendent and other officers of the jail frequently check the security arrangements in place, the report added.
On the provision of food, the report said that Imran was eating meals of his own choice since being incarcerated. The federal government’s report said that his diet plan consisted of dates, honey, walnuts, coffee, porridge, lassi, milk, chia seeds, orange juice, chicken, mutton, lentils, salad, mixed pickle, dry fruits, and green tea.
The report said that for the purpose of cooking, a labourer had been provided, who prepared meals in a designated kitchen area adjacent to the compound. A separate safe and secure mechanism has been undertaken for purchasing raw material for cooking, the report said.
The report said that Imran was currently confined in a designed compound that comprised seven cells. It said that there was a corridor in front of the cells, which Imran used for walking and exercise. Further, there was an adjacent lawn, where the ex-premier read books and newspapers.
“It is worth mentioning here that keeping in view the increasing population trends in Central Jail, Rawalpindi, as many as 30-35 inmates can be accommodated in the compound where the petitioner is currently housed,” the report said.
The report said that Imran had been provided with a cycling machine, stretching bands, a chin-up rod and other equipment under the orders issued by a special court on October 23, 2023.
It further said that Imran was being provided adequate healthcare facilities, sanitation and toiletries. It said that he was visited by the jail’s medical officers thrice a day, who checked his vitals and recorded the data in his medical record.
It said that a number of consultants from public tertiary care hospitals had also visited Imran, the record of which was available with the jail administration.
The report said that Imran had access to clean and filtered drinking water, and the toilet facilities were also adequate. It said Imran had access to natural light, fresh air and exercise from dawn to dusk and was free to move from early in the morning till night.
The report said that Imran had seasonal clothing, bedding, a hygiene kit, shoes and other articles of day- to-day use. “He has access to all essential items without any restriction,” the report concluded.
SC releases written order
Meanwhile, in a seven-page order on the Feb 12 proceedings, the SC reiterated that the three petitions in the case at hand had become infructuous. These petitions emanated from the same criminal trial in a case pertaining to the concealment of gifts, instituted on a complaint filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) through the district election commissioner, Islamabad.
The order said that though the petitions assail different interlocutory and procedural orders, they stemmed from a common factual and procedural background.
It said that the orders impugned in the first two petitions had merged into the final judgment of a trial court on Aug 5, 2023, which had already been challenged by Imran before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Similarly, the third petition, concerning the refusal to transfer the case, had also become infructuous by virtue of the final judgment passed by that court, from which the transfer was sought.
The petitioner’s substantive challenge to that final judgment, including the alleged irregularities or illegalities during the trial proceedings, was presently sub judice before IHC in its appellate jurisdiction, the order reminded.
Accordingly, the petitioner retained the right to agitate all his grievances before the appropriate judicial forum, which, in the present circumstances, was the IHC – the appellate court where his appeal against the trial court’s Aug 5, 2023 final judgment was pending adjudication.
“However, in due deference to the earlier orders passed by a three-member SC bench on Aug 23 and 24, 2023, where it was observed that the court would await the decision of the high court before proceeding further in these petitions, we adjourn the present petitions sine die, to be taken up after the decision of the petitioner’s appeal before the high court,” it said.
“In the meantime, if the petitioner has any grievance, the appropriate course will be to first approach the high court, where his appeal is pending adjudication,” the order said.
The written order noted that Imran had “generally expressed satisfaction with the prevailing conditions of his confinement and has not raised any concerns necessitating accommodations beyond the existing level of care”.
“Both reports (friend of the court and jail superintendent) corroborate this finding and are further reinforced by the assurances provided by the attorney general for Pakistan,” the Supreme Court order said.
Accordingly, the concerns of the SC regarding the petitioner’s living conditions in jail, as reflected in the order of Aug 24, 2023, were addressed, and that order was complied with, the order said.
Latif Khosa writes to CJP
Separately, PTI leader Latif Khosa wrote a letter to CJP Afridi on Monday, voicing concerns over the medical examination of Imran in “secrecy” at the Adiala jail on February 15 (Sunday).
In his letter, Khosa raised concerns to this end, identifying himself as a counsel for Imran in a plea pertaining to the Toshakhana case against his client.
He said Imran’s medical examination in “secrecy, without notice to the family or independent doctors, has given rise to serious apprehensions”.
“The continued exclusion of the petitioner’s family and personal medical practitioners from information concerning his health has created unavoidable doubts. Such secrecy not only undermines confidence in the medical process but is also causing unrest and distress among his family members, friends and supporters,” the letter, seen by Dawn, stated.
Khosa underlined in the letter that Imran was 73 years old, and “his advancing age and declining health are matters of grave concern not only for his family but for the people of Pakistan at large”.
“Being one of the most widely supported political leaders in the country, public interest in his wellbeing is natural and unavoidable. Yet, despite this, he remains deprived of basic human necessities during a period when his medical condition demands care and transparency,” he added.
He further said that “for the past few months, reports have surfaced across Pakistan raising serious concerns regarding the deterioration of the petitioner’s eyesight and overall health”.
“These reports, coupled with the continued denial of access to family members, have created deep uncertainty.”
In these circumstances, Khosa continued, the SC was approached for relief and appointed Barrister Salman Safdar as a “friend of the court” on February 10, permitting him to visit Imran in jail.
Barrister Safdar was asked to submit a report detailing Imran’s living conditions and health status after the visit, Khosa recalled, adding that he subsequently submitted the report to the SC on February 11.
“The report confirms that the petitioner has been left with only approximately 15pc vision in his right eye. It further records, particularly paragraph 8, that despite the petitioner’s repeated complaints of blurred and hazardous vision, no timely or adequate medical intervention was undertaken by the jail authorities, which ultimately resulted in complete loss of his vision in one eye,” Khosa claimed in his letter.
Terming these findings “alarming”, Khosa noted that Imran was medically examined at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
“Shockingly, the said examination was carried out in the complete absence of his family members, personal doctors, or legal representatives. No prior intimation was given to them regarding the said medical checkup,” he claimed.
He further brought it to the CJP’s attention that it was being “claimed in certain quarters that the family and party members were informed but voluntarily chose not to attend [the examination]”.
“These assertions are wholly incorrect and unrealistic. At no stage were the petitioner’s family members, personal physicians or counsel were informed. In fact, when the petitioner’s sisters approached the authorities, they were denied access.
“Instead, a panel of handpicked doctors was formed to conduct the examination. The petitioner’s personal doctors, family members, and legal team were denied access,” he maintained.
Khosa highlighted that Imran, on the other hand, had “repeatedly sought access to his personal doctors, namely Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yousaf, for independent examination and treatment of his deteriorating eye condition”.
He also mentioned in the letter that Imran was taken into custody on August 5, 2023 and initially kept at District Jail in Attock. He was moved to the Adiala jail after around three months and had been incarcerated there since.
“Throughout this prolonged period of incarceration, his fundamental and statutory rights have consistently been violated. While earlier his family members and close associates were permitted to meet him in accordance with jail rules, it has now been over four to five months that no meeting has been allowed. His family has effectively been denied access to him,” Khosa complained in the letter.
He requested the CJP to direct the relevant authorities to provide an attested copy of Imran’s medical report of his examination conducted on February 15.

 

The report was released today.
Khosa also sought permission for Imran to be provided immediate access to his personal doctors, including Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yousaf, for his independent medical examination and treatment.
The PTI lawyer further requested the CJP to issue directives for moving Imran to “Al-Shifa Hospital for immediate treatment of his ailment, which clearly cannot be adequately treated within Central Jail, Rawalpindi”.
He also asked the court to “direct that the petitioner’s family members be duly informed and granted reasonable access regarding his medical condition and any future medical condition”.</p><small>2026-02-16 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16195919bcd6fc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973707/in-meeting-with-naqvi-sri-lankan-president-appreciates-pakistans-support-during-difficult-times' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Naqvi, Sri Lankan president appreciates Pakistan’s support during ‘difficult times’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a meeting with a delegation from Pakistan on Monday, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appreciated Islamabad’s support during “difficult times”.
The Sri Lankan president shared photos of the meeting held in Colombo on social media platform X, saying that he had met Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain.
“We reaffirmed our enduring friendship [and] appreciated Pakistan’s support to Sri Lanka during difficult times,” the post by Dissanayake said.







He further stated that the “Pakistan delegation conveyed special thanks from Pakistan’s president and prime minister for Sri Lanka’s timely intervention when Pakistan’s participation in the T20 [World Cup] was uncertain”.
Days ahead of the ongoing T20 global showpiece, the Pakistan government had decided that the country’s cricket team would not play against India in the group-stage match.
The decision had come after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
Pakistan withdrew its decision to boycott the India match on February 9, saying: “The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges.”
Ahead of the withdrawal, PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Dissanayake. The Sri Lankan president urged Pakistan to play the match against India, in response to which PM Shehbaz said he would inform him about a “final decision” regarding the match after consultations, state-run PTV News reported.
And after Pakistan announced its decision to play the match, Dissanayake thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.
“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said in a post on X.
Joint strategy against cybercrime, financial fraud mafia
Separately, Pakistan and Sri Lanka agreed to develop a joint strategy against cybercrimes and financial fraud mafias.
The understanding was reached during a meeting of Naqvi with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala.
According to a handout released by the Interior Ministry’s media wing, the meeting focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation and matters of mutual interest.
Both Ministers also discussed ways to enhance cooperation in internal security and joint efforts in counterterrorism and anti-narcotics operations.
‎It was agreed to strengthen institutional collaboration between the interior ministries of Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The two sides also decided to improve coordination to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
Matters relating to joint training programs for police and paramilitary forces were also discussed.
Naqvi offered training opportunities for Sri Lankan police officers at the National Police Academy of Pakistan. He stated that officer exchange programs would enhance the professional capacity of forces in both countries and open new avenues of cooperation between the two ministries.
He also emphasised the need to expand collaboration to effectively combat cybercrime and financial crimes. Naqvi also invited the Sri Lankan minister to visit Pakistan and expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him during his visit.
The Sri Lankan minister welcomed Naqvi, stating that it was a matter of great pleasure for Sri Lanka and affirmed their commitment to promoting cooperation with Pakistan in areas of mutual interest.
Security cooperation
Naqvi also met with Sri Lanka’s Secretary of Defence Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Sampatha Thuyacontha.
The meeting included discussions on Pakistan–Sri Lanka security cooperation and defence matters. Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to further enhance bilateral security cooperation.
‎The defence secretary acknowledged that Sri Lanka had also been a victim of terrorism and expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s steadfast support to the government in its fight against terrorism.
Naqvi stated that security relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka had remained strong over the years and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening security cooperation with Sri Lanka.
Naqvi also met Sri Lankan Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Sunil Kumara Gamage, with discussions focusing on enhancing cooperation in sports, particularly cricket.
Both sides agreed to strengthen collaboration between the respective sports ministries and promote bilateral cooperation in cricket and other sports.
Naqvi stated that cricket and other sports would further strengthen bilateral relations. He also appreciated the excellent arrangements made during the T20 World Cup and thanked the Sri Lankan authorities for their hospitality.
He extended an invitation to the Sri Lankan sports minister to visit Pakistan.</p><small>2026-02-16 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/161939004c0130f.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973693/a-team-of-doctors-examined-imran-in-jail-heres-what-their-report-says' target='_blank'><strong>A team of doctors examined Imran in jail. Here’s what their report says</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan — who is suffering from an eye ailment leading to loss of vision in his right eye — was examined by a team of doctors at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday. The party had rejected the inspection conducted in the absence of his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
On Monday, the law minister allayed concerns Imran’s vision loss, saying that there was “nothing as such to worry about”. Meanwhile, the doctors who examined the former premier in jail released a two-page report on Monday.
According to the report, a copy of which is available with Dawn, a medical board comprising the following eye specialists examined Imran on February 15; Dr Prof Nadeem Qureshi, the head of the vitreoretinal department at the Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, and Dr Prof Dr M Arif, the head of the opthalmology department at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad.



The report stated that unaided, Imran’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.
6/6 vision means that a person can see at 6 metres what a person with normal vision can see at 6 metres. 6/9 vision means that a person can see at 6 metres what a person with normal vision can see at 9 metres.
The doctors also conducted a slit lamp examination, which, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is a common test an eye specialist will use to check overall eye health.
The test showed that the “cornea was clear bilaterally” and “no cells in the anterior chamber”.
The report further stated that in the right eye, the vitreous was clear with a “few fibrillar opacities seen, no cells appreciated”.
“Mild intragel haemorrhage seen at 6 o’clock periphery,” it said. It further noted “disc hyperemic and vessels engorged” and “cup obliterated”.
“Moderately dense retinal haemorrhages in all four quadrants. Four to five cotton wool spots seen in different quadrants,” it said. “Resolving macular oedema seen. Foveal contour visible. Retina is attached,” it said.
According to the Mayo Clinic, oedema is swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body’s tissues. The macula, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is what lets a person see small details and focus on very specific aspects of what they are looking at.
In comparison, according to the report, in Imran’s left eye, the macula and periphery were “clear”, “no lattice” and the retina was attached.
The doctors also conducted an optical coherence tomography (OCT) test, a non-invasive imaging test where light waves are used to take cross-sectional pictures of the retina.
The test showed that in the right eye, the macular oedema was “resolving and reduced”.
“Central macular thickness reduced from 550 to 350 (improved),” it added. It further stated that the left eye was “within normal limits”.
In the report, the doctors advised Nevanac eyedrops (twice a day for both eyes), Co-sopt eyedrops (twice a day for the right eye) and Systane ultra eyedrops (three times a day for both eyes).
Nevanac eyedrops are anti-inflammatory drops for pain in the eye; Co-sopt eyedrops are used for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure; and Systane ultra are artificial tears for dry eyes.
“Second dose of anti-VEGF may be given as per schedule. However, vision has improved from 6/36 to 6/9 partial in the involved eye which is substantially good vision at this stage,” the report said.



According to the American Academy of Opthalmology, an anti-VGEF treatment reduces leaking abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This slows or stops damage from the abnormal blood vessels and slows down vision loss and may also improve vision.
It further advised optical coherence tomography angiography and a fundus fluorescein angiography for the former premier.
According to the report, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and Opposition Leader in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas visited Pims on Sunday for a follow-up on Imran’s examination in Adiala jail.
It said that the two doctors, Dr Qureshi and Dr Khan “briefed them in detail on the current health condition” of Imran, while the board members also briefed Imran’s personal physicians, Dr Asim Yousaf and Dr Khurram Mirza, over a phone call lasting more than 25 minutes “to the extent of their satisfaction”.
“After a detailed briefing, leaders and personal physicians expressed their full satisfaction and confidence over the treatment given so far and follow-up advice recommended by the team of senior doctors,” the report said.</p><small>2026-02-16 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16183510989dd05.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973703/india-hosts-five-day-ai-summit-as-safety-concerns-grow' target='_blank'><strong>India hosts five-day AI summit as safety concerns grow</strong></a><br><p>A global artificial intelligence summit kicked off in New Delhi on Monday with big issues on the agenda, from job disruption to child safety, although some attendees warned the broad focus could make concrete commitments from world leaders less likely.
While frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits for many tech companies, anxiety is growing over the risks that it poses to society and the environment.
The five-day AI Impact Summit aims to declare a “shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration”.
It is the fourth annual gathering addressing the problems and opportunities posed by AI, after previous international meetings in Paris, Seoul and Britain’s wartime code-breaking hub Bletchley.



Touted as the biggest edition yet, the Indian government is expecting tens of thousands of visitors from across the sector.
That includes 20 national leaders and 45 ministerial-level delegations, who will rub shoulders with tech CEOs, including Sam Altman of OpenAI and Google’s Sundar Pichai.
“The AI Impact Summit will enrich global discourse on diverse aspects of AI, such as innovation, collaboration, responsible use and more,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi wrote on X.
It is “further proof that our country is progressing rapidly in the field of science and technology”, and “shows the capability of our country’s youth”, added Modi, who was to inaugurate the event later on Monday.







At the busy conference site, panels and roundtables were held on topics ranging from how AI can make India’s treacherous roads safer to how South Asian women are engaging with the technology.
Three ‘sutras’
But whether Modi and the likes of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will take meaningful steps to hold AI giants accountable is in doubt, said Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute.

 

“Even the much-touted industry voluntary commitments made at these events have largely been narrow ‘self-regulatory’ frameworks that position AI companies to continue to grade their own homework,” she told AFP.
The Bletchley gathering in 2023 was called the AI Safety Summit, but the meetings’ names have changed as they have grown in size and scope.
At last year’s AI Action Summit in Paris, dozens of nations signed a statement calling for efforts to regulate AI tech to make it “open” and “ethical”.
The United States did not sign, with Vice President JD Vance warning that “excessive regulation… could kill a transformative sector just as it’s taking off”.

 

The Delhi summit has the loose themes of “people, progress, planet” — dubbed the three “sutras”. AI safety remains a priority, including the dangers of misinformation such as deepfakes.
“There is real scope for change” although it might not happen fast enough to prevent harm to minors, said AI Asia Pacific Institute director Kelly Forbes, whose organisation is researching how Australia and other countries are requiring platforms to confront the issue.
AI for ‘the many’
Organisers highlight this year’s AI summit as the first hosted by a developing country.
“The summit will shape a shared vision for AI that truly serves the many, not just the few,” India’s IT ministry has said.



Last year India leapt to third place — overtaking South Korea and Japan — in an annual global ranking of AI competitiveness calculated by Stanford University researchers.
But despite plans for large-scale infrastructure and grand ambitions for innovation, experts say the country has a long way to go before it can rival the United States and China.
Globally, AI could threaten jobs in industries from software development and factory work to filmmaking, with India’s large customer service and tech support sectors particularly vulnerable.

 

Shares in the country’s outsourcing firms have plunged in recent days, partly due to advances in AI assistant tools.
Asked about Indian call centres, startup co-founder Peush Bery told AFP at the summit that AI voice tools “will definitely remove that job” within a few years, but that society would evolve to cope.
“New jobs come up, new fields come up”, such as working with data to ensure AI tools can recognise many different accents, Bery said.</p><small>2026-02-16 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16171634555899d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973694/people-of-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-living-in-the-stone-age-says-punjab-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>People of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa living in the stone age, says Punjab CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday said that the people of PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were living in the stone age, critising the province’s government for not taking steps for development in the age of technology.
Addressing a laptop distribution scheme at a Gujrat university, CM Maryam highlighted that students in Punjab had access to Honhaar scholarships, laptop schemes, Parwaz Card, green buses and technical training programmes.
“So there is Honhaar here, and incitement there, but this is nothing to rejoice about,” she said, adding that she was extremely upset that the “people of KP were still living in the stone age”.
Maryam stated: “They do not know what development is. They do not realise that Honhaar scholarships also exist if one does not have the resources for their child’s studies.
“They do not know that you must have a gadget or a laptop or an iPad or a computer in your hands if you are to meet global standards in today’s age.”







Indirectly noting that the PTI had been in power in KP for the past “13 years”, she said the public there “does not even know what development is”.
The chief minister quipped that the KP government’s response to every need was that it was providing them “awareness”.
Maryam emphasised that blocking major roads in KP did not affect the businesses in Punjab but rather the economic activity of KP itself.



During her address, Maryam also recalled the time when her mother Kulsoom Nawaz was hospitalised due to cancer in 2017 and 2018, as well as when her father and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was ill during his imprisonment in 2019.
Noting that Nawaz was in his 70s when he was jailed, the Punjab CM said, “He got sick after multiple heart attacks and his platelets dropped. He had cardiac pain [but] such a joke was made out of his ailment.”
She continued: “When my father and I were in jail, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and her disease was ridiculed so much; it was even said that she was not sick and it is all a drama.”
Maryam then recalled that Kulsoom was on a ventilator in a London hospital when certain individuals “entered the ICU through deception by wearing doctors’ uniforms to verify whether it was true or false”.

 

“When my mother passed away, my father said, ‘One has to die to prove their innocence here’,” she said, adding that she was in a jail cell when Nawaz informed her about Kulsoom’s death.
The PML-N leader then played some old video clips of ex-premier Imran Khan from when he was in power. In the clips, the PTI founder threatened to get the TV and air conditioner removed from the prisons of the PML-N leadership.
Maryam asserted: “I am swearing by God that till today, neither I nor Nawaz Sharif or Shehbaz Sharif even thought of removing his AC or shutting off his food and TV.
“In fact, Nawaz Sharif said one day that he (Imran) has one AC, give him two ACs as he should not face any problems.”







She further said she was the “first woman” to be locked in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) jail and a cell had to be vacated for her as they did not have a dedicated women’s prison.
The Punjab CM then played another video of ex-PM Imran, wherein he commented on the “long list” of health issues Nawaz was facing.
“You can have differences on policies and policies, but you cannot turn political disagreements into personal enmities,” Maryam emphasised.
“My children, you must never do this,” she told the audience, referring to the actions taken by the PTI government of jailing PML-N leadership and “making fun” of the ailments.

 

“The time circles back, but my father was telling me at dinner the other day to never wish bad for even one’s political opponents,” she said.
“You all must not do what he or his party is doing,” the politician stressed. “Those who are ill, we pray that God may give them recovery soon,” she added.
Speaking on Imran’s current health issues, Maryam said, “The kind of facilities and the doctors he needs are being provided to him, and I am telling you this on oath that no one wishes ill for him.”
She called for lies, accusations, incitement, vandalism and fitna to be “thrown out” of politics.

The statement comes days after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that Imran had only 15pc vision left in his right eye, prompting the apex court to form a medical team to examine him before February 16 (today).
Subsequently, a team of five doctors arrived at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday, where the ex-premier is incarcerated, and carried out a detailed eye examination, took blood samples and checked his blood pressure. However, the PTI rejected the check-up conducted without his family and personal physicians.
Addressing Bar Association Ferozewala in Punjab’s Shahdara on Monday, Tarar referred to the “latest report that had to be submitted” regarding Imran’s health.

 

The minister added that he discussed it with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan and the “relevant” individuals before coming to the bar association.
Tarar stated: “They said thanks to God, the examination was carried out again on the Supreme Court’s order and there is no such thing about 35 or 25 [per cent].
“If he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6. There is nothing as such to worry about.”
According to the Cleveland Clinic, having 6/6 vision or 20/20 vision means you see the world with normal clarity and sharpness.
Before commenting on Imran’s health, Tarar stressed the need to “pay attention to our national issues”.
“We took difficult financial decisions, but the fruits of those can be seen now,” he stated, asserting that Pakistan was now “performing way better economically”.
The law minister stressed that political stability was crucial for economic stability. “There is a lot of noise these days that what is about happen and what has been done to the PTI founder,” he noted.
Addressing the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, Tarar said it was the “first time that a government was taking official measures to deprive the citizens of their rights”.
He then referred to the blockades of major roads and KP’s entry and exit points by PTI protests, which have cut off the province from the rest of the country.

 

“Article 15 [of the Constitution] allows freedom of movement, but the blockage of motorways and GT Road on the official level is unconstitutional,” the law minister pointed out.
He expressed the hope that the PTI would “rectify” the situation itself after looking at the latest report. “Otherwise, the federal government will have to take some action,” Tarar warned.
He further said it was the responsibility of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, to “ensure that the KP government adheres to the Constitution”.
Imran’s physician urges authorities to allow access
Meanwhile, Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf released a video statement, saying that last night he spoke on the telephone to the two Islamabad-based eye doctors who were treating the ex-premier for his eye condition.
He said he asked his colleague, Dr Khurram Azam Mirza, a Lahore-based retinal specialist, to join the phone call.







Dr Yusuf said that the phone call lasted 40 minutes, during which the doctors provided a background of when they first examined Imran, what his symptoms were, details of the treatment prescribed and what the future treatment plan.
“Their latest assessment was yesterday afternoon … they told us that, in their view, Imran had shown significant improvement as a result of treatment and his vision had improved significantly as well,” he said.
“I would be extremely happy if I was able to confirm that this was the case. Unfortunately, because I have not seen him myself and have not been able to participate in his care or talk to him, I am unable to either confirm or deny the veracity of what we have been told,” he said.
Dr Yusuf appealed to the authorities to allow him or Dr Faisal Sultan, ideally both of them, and physicians nominated by Imran’s family to examine the ex-premier and participate in his care.
He also called for Imran to be treated at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, saying that it was “appropriately equipped and of a suitable standard” for treating the PTI founder.
CRVO in Imran’s right eye
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 10, last week submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living conditions in the prison.
In his report, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6/6 vision in both eyes”.
While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying.
A medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC.

 

It stated that a qualified ophthalmologist from Pims conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala jail of Imran and a “diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made”.
This was then followed by Imran undergoing medical treatment at Pims.
The ex-premier’s family and the PTI have been demanding that he be moved to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital for a comprehensive check-up, with the opposition even staging a sit-in at Parliament House for the past four days.</p><small>2026-02-16 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1617201334cbe9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973695/travel-why-thailand-is-perfect-for-travelling-parents-with-little-ones' target='_blank'><strong>Travel: Why Thailand is perfect for travelling parents with little ones</strong></a><br><p>My travelogue has had a recent makeover. The itinerary now insists on including clean bathrooms, feeding areas, and a prospective diaper change station. Even though these recent life developments had me apprehensive to venture back out into the world, I slowly started to identify and appreciate how family-friendly most cities in the world had become when I was not paying attention.
It was a bit like that car spotting phenomenon. You know the one where, when you notice a particular brand and model of a car, they start to appear everywhere. Similarly, once I braved back out into the world, I started to realise how much the world had to offer to travelling parents with children. It’s still a work-in-progress, but at least it was much better than what my fears had me convinced.
As the first international travel location, my personal preference was to start with a place that was already familiar. I could not look past Thailand.

On a global scale, when you do the math for budget, accommodation, food and shopping and build a travel itinerary, I think anyone in any stage in life would find it hard pressed to find a better alternative to Thailand. When you add children to the mix, it becomes even more appealing.

Firstly, let’s tackle where to go in Thailand. Bangkok or one of the islands, or both?
I would recommend Bangkok as the first stop to ease into the holiday season with modern facilities and an endless supply of 7-Elevens for any need at any hour of the day. A couple of days to get your bearings before you shoot off to your island holiday.
Although any number of island combinations could work as your first holiday, my recommendation includes two options. One for families with really young children and zero energy to plan or think. Another option for families on the path to recovery is some off the off-the-beaten-track adventures. Let’s go!
BKK + Phuket
Let’s face it, Bangkok has a reputation. If a certain portrayal in the Hangover movie is to be believed, what would have been its entertaining and exciting prospect pre-children would now terrorise the same adults and make them want to stay away.
In my opinion, though, the movie underestimates Bangkok’s diversity and capability to segregate trouble and keep it tied to specific locations only.
Most of this city actually offers a safe passage to most on a quick stopover, as also indicated by female solo travellers, marking it as one of the safer cities that can be enjoyed on your own. I place tremendous value on female and marginalised lenses on travel, especially when it comes to safety. With that in mind, let’s scope out the general must-sees!
Wherever you start in Bangkok, and I do hope you can find a suitable accommodation as close to the Nana MRT as possible, as most attractions pan out from that area. I would start my day by purchasing an MRT ticket, get off at Asok and make my way to Terminal 21, a more spread-out shopping mall.
The various exits also offer additional walking time while staying within air-conditioned zones, an important requirement on your first day, to acclimatise. The food options inside the mall are also varied and include some of the best hygienic dessert options.
If you are like me and cannot walk inside a mall without some kind of bubble, boba or sago drink in hand, then look no further and head straight to YenlyYours in Terminal 21.
This is an absolute mango heaven! Besides its smoothies and floats, the dessert options include mango sticky rice, of course, but also the lesser-promoted “treasures” such as mango mochi, mango cheese tart, and mango crepe.
Once you have checked mango off your list, move on to Pier 21 for a pad Thai with prawn wrapped in egg.
If you are a pram-pushing daredevil, by all means tick off the mandatory locations such as Khao San Road, the Floating Market and Arab Street; all the more power to you! However, if you would like to play it safe on your first trip while continuing to partake in the best of the city, I would suggest an alternate route to old BKK.
Rattanakosin is the historic heart of Bangkok. Most people associate it with all the Wats or temples it has to offer, but for me, this is where the real hidden charm of Bangkok lies, like the old parts of most cities, I suppose, being the source of origin.
The bank of the Chao Phraya is magical, and the cafes and restaurants lining this part of the city are unforgettable. Each restaurant has a history and old photographs you can peruse while you eat.
A full day spent in this part of Bangkok, traversing between the many Wats, ferried across in one of the canal boats and ending the day, watching the sunset from the Eagle Nest rooftop, can easily make one forget about the chaos of the city centre.
Once you and your baby have recovered from the flight, it’s time for island hopping!

Phuket
I chose Phuket because, whilst there are plenty of other secluded islands that can offer an experience a thousand times better than here, it is the sheer convenience of Phuket that I find unmatchable. Here, you don’t have to forego the natural beauty to satisfy comfort.
Nearly all resorts are built to attract families with children. You can choose any number of resorts along that coastline, whether it be Centara, Marriott, or Holiday Inn, suiting your budget; you are guaranteed a world within a world.
With a variety of children’s activities offered through the kids’ clubs, several splash pools and most restaurants catering to children, some offering freshly prepared meals specific to toddlers, whilst tired mummies are whisked away for the perfect foot massage or backrub next to the ocean, this is the family holiday we all deserve.
Whilst I have been busy blowing Phuket’s horn, the memory of another island begs to be mentioned. This is Koh Lanta, where I had once disappeared to during a challenging work assignment and had left after a couple of days feeling like a new person.
This island feels like being cradled into nature’s arms like no other, ushering in peace, tranquillity and safety. Please look it up if that’s the need of the hour. Otherwise, the newly reenergised army of parents, look this way with your slightly older kids, for an adventure away to Chiang Mai!

Chiang Mai
Head to the Elephant Parade with your kiddy entourage and learn the story about the father and son duo, who brought this place into existence when they fell in love with a certain baby elephant called Mosha during their holiday in Thailand.

Have you heard of cocoon farms, no? Then your next stop should be to the Thai Silk Village for a hands-on workshop on silk weaving.

A visit to Chiang Mai is not complete without at least a day spent at Baan Kang Wat, a tucked away art village, yes, guilty as charged — also in the Old Town streets of Chiang Mai.
Every inch of this place is Instagram-worthy and one of the best family day outs you can have. While the kiddos can enjoy a painting workshop, you can take your tired feet across for a cup of joe and a slice of cake at Graph. If you happen to peek inside one of the art studios, coffee in hand, some of the artists might let you watch as they work.
If you are anything like me, an out-and-out urban parent, Chiang Mai also offers a wonderful opportunity at glamping! You have heard me right, this is the newest stage in your camping journey, for those who are taken by the idea without being equipped with the logistics (and let’s face it, the guts!) that camping demands.
Once you have had your fair share of café hopping, night markets and kayaking adventures, you might want to end your trip by taking a stroll to the Thapae Gate of the Old City Walls to take to the shores of the Ping River to watch thousands of people release their krathongs or paper-based lanterns into the water.
Alternatively, arrange for a day-trip to Nong Bua Pra Chao Luang lotus lake to watch thousands do the same, but in this case, releasing the lanterns into the sky, and totally for free!

Field Marshal Munir made the remarks during a meeting with the Deputy Ruler of Abu Dhabi and National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during which they discussed “ways to further strengthen bilateral cooperation across various sectors, particularly in the fields of economic collaboration, investment and security,” according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The two leaders also “exchanged views on regional developments and emphasised the importance of continued coordination to promote peace and stability in the region,” ISPR added.
Field Marshal Munir, during the meeting, “expressed his sincere appreciation and gratitude to the government of the UAE for its longstanding investments and continued support to Pakistan’s economy and security over the decades”.
As per ISPR, the army chief “noted that such support reflects the deep-rooted historical relations between the two brotherly countries and commended the constructive role of the UAE leadership in advancing economic and social development in Pakistan”.
During the meeting, the field marshal reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to continuing joint efforts to “further strengthen this partnership in all fields, in a manner that serves the interests of both brotherly peoples and contributes to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region”.
Pakistan and UAE maintain close bilateral relations. Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone call with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, lauding the Gulf country’s “consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan”.

According to a statement by the police, the blast occurred when a time bomb planted in a motorcycle detonated. A child was among those killed in the explosion.
Police sources said the blast took place near shops located in front of the station. Although police personnel remained unharmed, civilians in the vicinity were caught in the blast. Several of the injured are reported to be in critical condition.
Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson, Muhammad Noman Khattab, stated that the victims were brought to District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital.
Rescue 1122 officials said emergency teams promptly reached the scene and moved the bodies and injured to nearby hospitals.
Following the incident, a heavy contingent of the Bannu police reached the scene, along with the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
Police and security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation, added the police statement. Evidence is being collected and an investigation has been initiated.
The BDS team also engaged in clearing the affected site “to ensure timely and effective prevention of any possible further threat”, the police statement said.
Meanwhile, Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan visited the hospital and enquired after the injured, it said.
Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
In January, two boys were injured in an explosion in the Domel area of Bannu, one of whom succumbed to his injuries after two weeks.
Earlier that month, the former nazim of Domel, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office.</p><small>2026-02-16 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16130150aedc7b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973651/ahsan-iqbal-to-attend-bangladesh-pm-elect-tarique-rahmans-oath-taking-ceremony-in-dhaka' target='_blank'><strong>Ahsan Iqbal to attend Bangladesh PM-elect Tarique Rahman’s oath-taking ceremony in Dhaka</strong></a><br><p>Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal is set to attend the oath-taking ceremony of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister-elect Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who won a landslide victory in last week’s elections, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.

In a statement issued today, the FO said that Iqbal will represent Pakistan at the oath-taking ceremony, which is scheduled to be held on February 17 in Dhaka.







FO added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was unable to attend “due to a prior overseas engagement.”
“Pakistan’s participation in the ceremony reflects its support for Bangladesh’s democratic process and underscores its commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,” the statement added.
Rahman is the son of former Bangladeshi president Ziaur Rahman and the country’s former prime minister Khaleda Zia. He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.
On Feb 13, BNP won an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the country’s general elections. The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.
Following the election results last week, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz extended their felicitations to the BNP and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority.
President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh. While PM Shehbaz said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership and strengthening the two countries’ “historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations.”</p><small>2026-02-16 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651111-medical-team-fully-satisfied-with-imran-khans-eye-treatment-says-law-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Medical team 'fully satisfied' with Imran Khan's eye treatment, says law minister</strong></a><br><p>

Naushahro Feroze Senior Superintendent of Police Mir Rohal Khoso told Dawn that all six people who died were travelling in the car, while the trailer’s driver was injured.
He said the accident took place between 5am and 6am, adding that “ostensibly, speeding and brake failure were probable reasons,” but the matter was being probed further.
SSP Khoso elaborated that one side of the National Highway in the district was under construction, which was a “contributory factor behind increasing accidents”.
He stated that, in collaboration with the motorway police, it has been decided to set up five points for checking the speed and fitness of vehicles to control the rise in accidents.
Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho, in a statement, ordered the Naushahro Feroze SSP to probe the accident and register a case.
Expressing his grief over the loss of lives, IG Odho ordered that legal action be taken against those responsible after determining the causes behind the accident.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including speeding, hazardous overtaking, and disregard for traffic rules.
On Sunday, at least 11 people were killed and eight were injured after a bus collided with a trailer on the National Highway near Tando Masti in Sindh’s Khairpur district.
A day before that, 13 people died in a traffic accident involving an oil tanker and a passenger bus on the M9 Motorway near Karachi.
Crackdown against overloading and speeding ordered
In his statement, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed his grief over the loss of lives in the accident and conveyed his condolences to the bereaved families.
“We share the grief of the bereaved families,” he was quoted as saying in the statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdul Rasheed Channa.
The statement said that the car involved in the incident was heading from Larkana Division’s Nasirabad taluka to Karachi.
CM Murad also issued directives for the strict implementation of traffic rules and regulations.
He ordered the Sindh IG to carry out a “crackdown against overloading and speeding”. He further directed that monitoring and fitness checks of vehicles be made more stringent across the province.
“The protection of the public’s life and property is the government’s top responsibility,” the chief minister noted.</p><small>2026-02-16 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651104-pindi-court-issues-aleema-khans-non-bailable-arrest-warrant-over-repeated-absence' target='_blank'><strong>Court issues Aleema Khan's non-bailable arrest warrant over repeated absence</strong></a><br><p>

Al Jazeera reported on Sunday that the Israeli government had approved the proposal to claim large areas of the occupied territory as property of the state if Palestinians could not prove ownership, a move which prompted outcry from Palestinian group Hamas, the Palestinian presidency, and political analysts.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the latest attempt by the Israeli occupying power to convert areas of the Occupied West Bank into so-called state property, and to expand illegal settlement activities,” the statement said.
It pointed out that these steps clearly violated international law and relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, stressing that they “must be rejected” by the international community.







“The occupying power’s continued disregard for international law and its provocative actions undermine the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region,” it added.
“Pakistan calls on the international community to take concrete measures to end Israeli impunity, and ensure respect for international law,” the statement said.
It once again reaffirmed full support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and for the establishment of an “independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital”.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership. International law states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
Palestinian group Hamas had condemned the decision on Sunday, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
However, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz described the move as an “essential security and governance measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for the state of Israel in the area”, according to the Jerusalem Post.</p><small>2026-02-16 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651098-woman-smuggled-from-bangladesh-seeks-reunion-with-family-after-40-year-separation' target='_blank'><strong>Woman smuggled from Bangladesh seeks reunion with family after 40-year separation</strong></a><br><p>

Akram and his father, Sajid, allegedly attacked a Hanukkah celebration in December. Sajid was shot and killed by police during the attack.
Akram has been charged with terrorism, 15 counts of murder, dozens of counts of causing wounds to a person with intent to kill and planting explosives.
He appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media.
The timeline of evidence was also discussed, the court said.
The accused wore a green jersey during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said.
He reportedly spoke only one word — “yeah” — when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders.
Akram will next appear in court on March 9.
Speaking outside the court, Akram’s lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in “very onerous conditions”, national broadcaster ABC said.
He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty.
The mass shooting sparked national soul-searching about antisemitism, anger over the failure to shield Jewish Australians from harm and promises to stiffen gun laws.
‘Tactical’ training
Police and intelligence agencies are also facing difficult questions about whether they could have acted earlier.
Naveed Akram was flagged by Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019, but he slipped off the radar after it decided that he posed no imminent threat.
Police documents released following the attack said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.
They said the suspects “meticulously planned” the attack for months, releasing pictures showing them firing shotguns and moving in what they described as a “tactical manner”.
The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State terrorist group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.
They made a nighttime reconnaissance trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed.
And a few weeks before the Bondi Beach attack, the pair returned to Sydney from a four-week trip to the southern Philippines.</p><small>2026-02-16 07:11</small></div><hr>
