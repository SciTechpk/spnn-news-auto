Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris and panicked worshippers.
The attack was widely condemned by political leaders and foreign diplomats, who labelled the incident “abhorrent” and “a direct attack on humanity, religion and social values”.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal strongly condemned the “cowardly” attack, writing on X that his heart went out to the victims’ families.
“Pakistan stands united against terrorism — we will bring the perpetrators to justice,” he added.







Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry strongly condemned the attack in a post on X, expressing grief over the loss of lives in the “cowardly act”.
He extended condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the recovery of the injured.
“Such acts of terrorism cannot dampen the morale of the nation. The need of the hour is that we all stand united for peace, tolerance, and stability, and express solidarity with law enforcement agencies,” the minister stressed.







Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed deep sadness over the incident, extending “prayers for the swift recovery of the injured, and may Allah grant patience and strength to all those affected”.







PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari strongly condemned the blast and called targeting citizens in a mosque “an attack on humanity, religion, and the national conscience”, according to a statement from the PPP.
“No religion or ideology permits the murder of innocent people,” he was quoted as saying. Bilawal demanded that an immediate and transparent investigation of the incident be conducted, and the “perpetrators and their facilitators [be] brought to justice”.
He added that effective measures must be put in place to protect places of worship and stressed that the nation must stand united against “hatred, extremism, and terrorism”.







PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan strongly condemned the blast in a post on X, extending his condolences to the victims and their families.
“Now is the time for every terrorist, wherever they may be, to meet their end in the depths of hell — I am hopeful that, God willing, with the cooperation of us all, our provincial and national institutions will succeed in this war,” he stated.







Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman termed the attack “regrettable and condemnable”, calling the perpetrators “enemies of humanity and deserving no leniency”, according to a statement from his party.
“After Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, now even in Islamabad, terrorist activities are continuing relentlessly,” he said. “No part of the country is safe from terrorists.”
Fazl noted that institutions’ “pride in their performance” had come into question amid these circumstances.
“The nation cannot be reassured by relying on rulers’ visits and statements of condemnation after major tragedies,” Fazl was quoted as saying.
“If institutions remain free from political interference, they should focus on peace, security and [the] protection of the people’s lives and property.”
He also observed that national and international elements inciting sectarianism “cannot be overlooked”.
“Despite the presence of dozens of intelligence agencies, Islamabad was stained with blood during broad daylight. The attack is a failure of the agencies,” Fazl added.
The JUI-F chief questioned when state institutions would address the public’s issues and whether a system would be implemented for “protecting the future of the people and coming generations”.







Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the incident.
“Such an incident of terrorism in the federal capital is not just a proof of the grave failure to protect human lives, but it also is a big question mark on the performance of the administration and law enforcement agencies,” he said in a post on X.
Abbas strongly condemned the attack and extended condolences to the families of the deceased.
“Targeting places of worship is a direct attack on humanity, religion and social values, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he said.
He also appealed to the youth in Islamabad to donate blood at hospitals and “play their part in saving precious lives”.







The Tehreek Tahahfuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance shared Senator Abbas’s post, reiterating his request to the youth of Islamabad to donate blood.
“Step forward at this delicate moment, demonstrating the essence of humanity,” the TTAP urged. “At this time, there is an urgent need for blood in various hospitals of Islamabad for the injured worshippers.
“Therefore, all of you participate actively in this noble cause and play your role in saving precious lives.”







PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser deemed the attack “cowardly and inhumane” in a post on X, stating that targeting a place of worship “reflects the worst form of enmity toward humanity and a cowardly mindset”.
“A suicide attack at a place of worship is not only an assault on fundamental human values but also an open crime against humanity,” Qaiser said.







Deputy NA Speaker Ghulam Mustafa strongly condemned the attack and expressed “profound grief and sorrow”, according to a statement from the lower house of parliament.
“The attack on innocent worshippers is a cowardly act,” Mustafa was quoted as saying. “This malicious act is a failed attempt to sabotage societal peace.”
Noting that terrorists “have no connection to any religion or humanity”, the deputy speaker vowed that terrorists would never succeed in their goals and that “the terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan will not be allowed to harm Pakistan’s peace and stability”.
“The entire nation stands united against terrorism. The terrorists’ cowardly actions cannot weaken the resolve of the nation and security forces,” Mustafa added.







US Charge d’Affaires Natalie Baker strongly condemned the bombing, as well as all acts of terrorism, in a statement.
“On behalf of the United States, I offer our sincere condolences to those injured and to the families and loved ones of those killed by this attack,” she said.
“Acts of terror and violence against civilians and places of worship are unacceptable,” it added. “The people of Pakistan deserve safety, dignity, and the ability to practice their faith without fear.”
Baker was quoted as saying that Washington would continue supporting Pakistan’s efforts to advance peace and security and remained committed to their partnership.
“We stand with Pakistan during this challenging moment.”







British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott took to X and extended her thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families.
“Outraged and heartbroken by the horrific attack at Imambargah in Islamabad during Friday prayers,” she said. “Such violence is abhorrent. We stand with Pakistan.







Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the incident in a post on X on behalf of the government and the people of Iran.
“On behalf of the government and the people of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I strongly condemn the hideous and awkward terrorist attack in Islamabad during the Friday prayers, which led to the martyrdom and injury of tens of innocent civilians.”
“I extend my sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families,” he said.







Australian High Commissioner Timothy Kane said he was “shocked and saddened” by the bombing, conveying his thoughts to the victims, their families, and all those affected.
“Australia stands and mourns with Pakistan at this difficult time,” he said.

The explosion occurred at Imambargah Khadijah al-Kubra in the Tarlai area of the federal capital. Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris, and panicked worshippers.
Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the imambargah as people called for help.



Islamabad Capital Territory Police Spokesperson Taqi Jawad said it was too soon to ascertain the nature of the blast. However, he indicated that the signs pointed to a suicide bomber.
Taqi added that among those killed was the cousin of Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, while another relative was injured.
The district administration spokesperson said the site of the blast was completely sealed off by security personnel, and added that assistant commissioners were assigned to oversee the treatment of the injured at various hospitals.
Meanwhile, police and Rescue 1122 personnel reached the site of the incident and initiated rescue operations after the explosion. An emergency was also imposed at the federal capital’s Polyclinic, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), and CDA Hospital.

On the directives of the executive director Pims, an emergency was enforced at the hospital, a spokesperson confirmed to Dawn. The hospital administration appealed to citizens to donate blood.
The main emergency, orthopaedic, burn centre, and neurology departments have been activated, he added.
Pindi police on high alert; Punjab CM dispatches ambulances
In view of the prevailing security situation, Rawalpindi police were placed on high-alert, according to a statement by the police spokesperson.
“Security duties are being checked and [officials are being] briefed at imambargahs, mosques and other places across the city,” the statement read.
According to the statement, the police officials held meetings with the administrators and the guardians of the religious places and informed them about security standard operating procedures and the measures taken in this regard.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a post on X, said the provincial government had dispatched 25 ambulances to Islamabad.







She added that all hospitals across Rawalpindi district had been placed on high alert with “surgical teams, anesthetists, orthopedic and neurosurgical specialists on standby”.
“Blood banks are fully staffed, and operation theatres are fully equipped to ensure prompt and effective medical care for the injured.”
Maryam added that the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi were also instructed to extend every possible assistance.
The attack comes as Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev is currently visiting Pakistan.
President, PM condemn blast
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari extended condolences to the victims who lost their lives in the blast, according to a statement issued by the PPP on X.
He expressed grief over the incident, saying, “Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity”.
The president prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to them.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the blast, according to a statement. He expressed grief over the deaths in the blast and expressed sympathy with the bereaved.
In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the prime minister directed him to complete the investigation of the incident and immediately identify the people responsible for it.
He directed that “the injured be provided best medical facilities and the health minister will monitor” the situation, the statement quoted him as saying.
“No one will be allowed to disseminate chaos and unrest in the country,” he said.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack on innocent worshippers during Friday prayers at a Shia imambargah in Islamabad, killing dozens”.
“Targeting places of worship and civilians is a heinous crime against humanity and a blatant violation of Islamic principles,” he said.
Dar further said, “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms. This barbarity will not intimidate us and extremists will be brought to full account.”







Today’s incident comes less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast.

Tariq, who has played three T20 Internationals since his debut against South Africa in November, has been reported twice for a suspect bowling action in the Pakistan Super League. His bowling style culminates in him pausing near the crease before firing the ball in with a side-arm sling-shot action.
The 28-year-old claimed two wickets in his second T20 International, against Australia, and Australia batsman Cameron Green — one of his two victims in that match in Lahore — made a chucking gesture after being dismissed as he made his way off.
“I don’t understand why we are talking about his action because in my opinion it is a fair action,” Salman told reporters.
“He has been tested twice and he has been cleared,” he said.
“I think there is no problem in his action. Yes, he is the X factor of the team, and where we feel that we need an X factor, we will definitely use him.”
Having decided to boycott their Group A contest against defending champions India after Bangladesh were excluded from the tournament, Pakistan will have little margin for error in their bid to qualify for the Super 8 stage.
Apart from India, the group also contains the United States, who stunned Pakistan via the Super Over in the 2024 edition of the tournament.
Salman said they would have to be at their best even against second-tier teams like Namibia or the Netherlands.
“It is very important because you haven’t played much against these sides and you don’t really know their strength and weaknesses,” he said.
“So it is very, very important to bring your A game, and we as a team only think about how we can execute our plans for 40 overs.”</p><small>2026-02-06 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0616464135eb6d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971412/senate-amends-its-rule-to-curb-judicial-interference-in-parliamentary-affairs' target='_blank'><strong>Senate amends its rule to curb judicial interference in parliamentary affairs</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a significant move to assert parliamentary supremacy, a Senate rule was amended on Friday with the aim to curb judicial interference in parliamentary affairs.
The amendment to rule 166(5) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate was approved by the upper House of Parliament as chair rejected the government’s request to defer the matter.
A motion seeking the amendment to the rule was moved by PPP, PML-N and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) senators.
However, during the session, PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah, who is special assistant to the prime minister on political affairs, conveyed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar’s request that the motion may not be taken up before the matter was discussed with him.
However, PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwala, who spearheaded the move to amend the rule and was also chairing the session today, highlighted that the “interference of courts” in House committees’ proceedings was the reason behind the need for the change in the rule.
“High courts granted stays on the cases and petitions admitted by the chairman,” he pointed out, adding that there had been “back and forth on the amendment for months”.
“We do not want to delay it any further.”
But, Sanaullah asked what the urgency was.
In response, Mandviwala said the functioning of the committees was getting affected. “The amendment is in the interest of Senate and its committees, and it has already been unanimously approved by the standing committee concerned,” he contended.
Stressing that it was desire of the House, Mandviwala said he had already discussed it with the law minister and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP).
However, Sanaullah insisted that the matter be deferred till Monday.
But, Mandviwala did not budge, asking Sanaullah not to insist for the amendment’s deferment.
“I have to proceed [with the session],” he said, asking Senator Abdul Qadir to move the motion, which was passed by the House by a majority vote.
The amendment
Supporters of the amendment say the change will leave no legal room for the judiciary to interfere in the parliamentary matters.
The amendment expands the definition of public petitions that can be taken up by Senate committees.
It states that a public petition, submitted by a citizen or a group of citizens in the prescribed form under Rule 277, may be presented on “any matter of public importance”, including grievances arising from disputes where circumstances disclose an element of public interest, systemic concern, regulatory oversight and/or the protection of rights.
It further provides that, after consideration, the committee may issue: (a) observations or recommendations for systemic or regulatory improvements; and (b) facilitative guidance for resolution of the grievance and take necessary steps for disposal of the matter in accordance with relevant law.
A proviso added to the rule gives the Senate chairman broad discretion over whether a petition should proceed.
It reads: “Provided that, notwithstanding anything contained in this rule, the chairman Senate may, at his sole discretion, review, admit, pend, dispense with or decline to proceed with any petition, if in his opinion such action is necessary in the interest of propriety, parliamentary discipline, or to prevent frivolous, vexatious or otherwise inappropriate proceedings.”
Rule 166(5) in its previous form stated: “Public petitions may be presented on any matter connected with the business pending before the House or a committee, or any matter of general public interest which is primarily the concern of the government, provided that it is not one which falls within the cognisance of a court of law or tribunal, and it shall not directly relate to a matter pending before any court or other authority performing judicial or quasi-judicial functions.”
How it all started?
The move follows a dispute last year over stay orders issued by the Islamabad High Court and Lahore High Court against proceedings of Senate standing committees.
On July 25, the Senate summoned the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns about alleged judicial interference in parliamentary matters.
The issue was raised by Mandviwalla during a sitting presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan. Mandviwalla had described the stay orders as “alarming” and regretted that they had been issued despite the absence of any pending court cases. “This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees,” he said.
Legislators from both treasury and opposition benches, including PTI and JUI-F, had endorsed the concerns.
On Aug 18, 2025, AGP Mansoor Usman Awan had made a rare appearance before the Senate and backed the judiciary, calling for keeping the door open for judicial intervention in parliamentary proceedings.
The AGP had referred to Article 69 of the Constitution, under which the validity of proceedings in parliament cannot be called into question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure. Awan had insisted that the bar was not absolute.
Senate Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges, chaired by Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi, had approved the amendment in December 2025 amid opposition from the Ministry of Parl­ia­mentary Affairs.</p><small>2026-02-06 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649366-blast-reported-near-imambargah-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>31 martyred, dozens injured as suicide bomber targets Islamabad imambargah</strong></a><br><p>

“Rather than extend ‘New START … we should have our Nuclear Experts work on a new, improved and modernised Treaty that can last long into the future,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform.







Arms control advocates warn that the expiration of the treaty will fuel an accelerated nuclear arms race, while US opponents say the pact constrained the US ability to deploy enough weapons to deter nuclear threats posed by both Russia and China.
Trump’s post was in response to a proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin for the sides to adhere for a year to the 2010 accord’s limit of 1,550 warheads on 700 delivery systems — missiles, aircraft and submarines.
New START was the last in a series of arms control treaties between the world’s two largest nuclear weapons powers dating back more than half a century to the Cold War. It allowed for only a single extension, which Putin and former US President Joe Biden agreed to for five years in 2021.
In his post, Trump called New START “a badly negotiated deal” that he said “is being grossly violated,” an apparent reference to Putin’s 2023 decision to halt on-site inspections and other measures designed to reassure each side that the other was complying with the treaty.
Putin cited US support for Ukraine’s battle against Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion as the reason for his decision.
White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the US would continue talks with Russia.
Both sides signals openness to talks
Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was still ready to engage in dialogue with the US if Washington responded constructively to Putin’s proposal.
“Listen, if there are any constructive replies, of course we will conduct a dialogue,” Peskov told reporters.
The UN has urged both sides to restore the treaty.



Besides setting numerical limits on weapons, New START included inspection regimes experts say served to build a level of trust and confidence between the nuclear adversaries, helping make the world safer.
If nothing replaces the treaty, security analysts see a more dangerous environment with a higher risk of miscalculation. Forced to rely on worst-case assumptions about the other’s intentions, the US and Russia would see an incentive to increase their arsenals, especially as China plays catch-up with its own rapid nuclear build-up.
Trump has said he wants to replace New START with a better deal, bringing in China. But Beijing has declined negotiations with Moscow and Washington.
It has a fraction of their warhead numbers — an estimated 600, compared with around 4,000 each for Russia and the US Repeating that position on Thursday, China said the expiration of the treaty was regrettable, and urged the US to resume dialogue with Russia on “strategic stability.”
Uncertainly over treaty expiry date
There was confusion over the exact timing of the expiry, but Peskov said it would be at the end of Thursday.
Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow’s assumption was that the treaty no longer applied and both sides were free to choose their next steps.
It said Russia was prepared to take “decisive military-technical countermeasures to mitigate potential additional threats to national security” but was also open to diplomacy.
That warning was in apparent response to the possibility that Trump could expand US nuclear deployments by reversing steps taken to comply with New START, including reloading warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched missiles from which they were removed.
A bipartisan congressionally appointed commission in 2023 recommended that the US develop plans to reload some or all of its reserve warheads, saying the country should prepare to fight simultaneous wars with Russia and China.
Ukraine, which has been at war with Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, said the treaty’s expiry was a consequence of Russian efforts to achieve the “fragmentation of the global security architecture” and called it “another tool for nuclear blackmail to undermine international support for Ukraine.”
Strategic nuclear weapons are the long-range systems that each side would use to strike the other’s capital, military and industrial centres in the event of a nuclear war.
They differ from so-called tactical nuclear weapons that have a lower yield and are designed for limited strikes or battlefield use. If left unconstrained by any agreement, Russia and the US could each, within a couple of years, deploy hundreds more warheads, experts say.
“Transparency and predictability are among the more intangible benefits of arms control and underpin deterrence and strategic stability,” said Karim Haggag, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><small>2026-02-06 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06113003f75b2df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971406/at-least-six-injured-by-stray-kite-string-as-basant-festivities-kick-off-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>At least six injured by stray kite string as Basant festivities kick off in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: As Basant festivities kicked off on Friday after an 18-year hiatus, at least six kite-flying-related injuries have been reported in the city so far.
In December last year, the Punjab government lifted the ban on kite flying and allowed the celebration of Basant with strict regulations. The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.

 

In the first incident, a 21-year-old man sustained injuries around his neck after coming in contact with a stray kite string in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The young man was returning home from a local market on a bike when the string became entangled around his neck, leaving visible deep wounds.
However, a police official claimed that the injured person was riding the bike without a safety rod.
Earlier, the government had instructed the motorcyclists to install protective steel wires to shield themselves from stray kite twine to prevent any tragic incident.
The police official said that Rescue 1122 reached the site of the incident, where the injured person was provided first aid and rushed to a hospital, where he underwent surgery.
He added that the injured person was now in stable condition.
Orders have been issued to launch an investigation into the matter and investigate the string’s quality.
In another incident, a 45-year old man suffered multiple injuries to his face and neck after a kite string fell on him while he was riding a bike.
Rescue 1122 officials rushed the injured man to a hospital.
A police official indicated that the injured men would be investigated for taking their bikes on roads without safety wires despite repeated warnings.
He added that the act would be dealt with as a violation of standard SoPs.
In a separate incident, an eight-year-old girl sustained throat injuries when a kite string fell on her in Lahore’s Gulshan-e-Ravi area, police said.
In other incidents, two youngsters suffered injuries from kite strings in the city.
Another man fell from the roof of his house in the Ravi Road area, suffering multiple injuries.
The festival is set to run till February 8.

 

Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck.
Under the new Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the manufacturing of only thread-based kite strings will be allowed, and the use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings is strictly banned.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06123202cafe381.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971409/pti-again-approaches-supreme-court-seeking-imrans-medical-report-visitation-rights' target='_blank'><strong>PTI again approaches Supreme Court seeking Imran’s medical report, visitation rights</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Friday again approached the Supreme Court (SC) seeking party founder Imran Khan’s medical report and visitation rights for his personal doctors and family members.
Days after reports regarding the treatment of Imran emerged in mainstream media, the government last week admitted that the former premier was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, expressing concern over Imran’s health, said that the party had submitted a memorandum to the registrar requesting access to Imran for his personal doctors, as well as requesting his medical report.
The memorandum, a copy of which is available with Dawn, reiterated the PTI’s request that “immediate access to Mr Imran Khan be provided to his family, doctors, lawyers and friends”.
Gohar said that this was the “10th time” the party was approaching the apex court about Imran and that they had approached the high courts 16 times as well.
Gohar said that Imran’s health was a “very important issue, not just for PTI’s parliamentarians but for the whole country and every Pakistani”.
The party chairman said that until now, they had not received information on Imran’s medical reports and the procedure that he recently underwent.
“In the middle of this, Tuesday and Thursday passed by,” Gohar added. “Still, there was no meeting of Imran with either family members or lawyers, nor his personal physician or doctors.”
According to Gohar, although National Assembly Opposition Leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai had written a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif seeking his “personal intervention” for Imran’s medical examination by his “trusted” doctors, there had been no answer.
Hence, he said, the PTI was again requesting the chief justice to make sure that not only would the party receive the report about the jailed leader, but his doctors would be able to meet with him as quickly as possible, for the peace of mind of “his family, the party and the whole country”.
“This is our minimum,” he said.
Speaking to Geo News last week, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said the former premier was taken to Pims for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
The PTI had previously condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed and denying him access to personal physicians.
Special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, Shafi Jan, said last week that the sudden transfer “was deeply concerning and raised serious questions”.
On Friday, PTI members had staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad, including KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians.
After the protest, the party said that Imran’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06102757e9c57ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971383/iran-us-commence-talks-in-oman-amid-deep-rifts-and-mounting-war-fears' target='_blank'><strong>Iran, US commence talks in Oman amid deep rifts and mounting war fears</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States commenced high-stakes negotiations in Oman on Friday over Tehran’s nuclear programme, but a dispute over the agenda suggests progress will be hard won amid the threat of a regional Middle East war.
While both sides have signaled readiness to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West, Washington wants the talks to cover Iran’s nuclear programme, its ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and its “treatment of their own people”, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday.
Iran has said it wants Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss only nuclear issues in Muscat.







Iran’s foreign minister called on Friday for “mutual respect” ahead of talks with the United States on the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme and other issues.
“Iran enters diplomacy with open eyes and a steady memory of the past year. We engage in good faith and stand firm on our rights,” Abbas Araghchi wrote on X.
“Commitments need to be honored. Equal standing, mutual respect and mutual interest are not rhetoric – they are a must and the pillars of a durable agreement. “
Tehran said it will engage in the talks “with authority and with the aim of reaching a fair, mutually acceptable and dignified understanding on the nuclear issue”.
“We hope the American side will also participate in this process with responsibility, realism and seriousness,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Thursday.
Tehran’s leadership remains deeply concerned that US President Donald Trump may still carry out his threats to strike Iran amid a buildup by the US Navy near Iran.
The US naval buildup, which Trump has called a massive “armada”, has followed a bloody government crackdown on nationwide protests in Iran last month, heightening tensions between Washington and Tehran.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday told reporters that Trump was looking to determine whether a deal can be struck but also issued a warning.
“While these negotiations are taking place, I would remind the Iranian regime that the president has many options at his disposal, aside from diplomacy as the commander in chief of the most powerful military in the history of the world,” she added.
Trump has warned that “bad things“ would probably happen if a deal could not be reached, ratcheting up pressure on the Islamic Republic in a standoff that has led to mutual threats of airstrikes.
Iran has warned it would respond harshly to any military strike and has cautioned neighbouring countries hosting US bases that they could be in the firing line if they were involved in an attack.
“It’s very difficult to see them conceding enough in talks tomorrow for the US credibly to be able to claim that it’s made a breakthrough. And this is where I think, military conflict is more likely than not,” Edmund Fitton-Brown, senior fellow at Washington-based think-tank FDD, said.
Uranium enrichment
Negotiators in Oman will have to navigate Iran’s red line on discussing its missile programme to reach a deal and avert future military action. Tehran has flatly ruled out talks on its “defence capabilities, including missiles and their range.”
Hours before the talks, Iran’s state TV said that “one of the country’s most advanced long-range ballistic missile Khorramshahr 4” has been deployed at one of the Revolutionary Guards’ vast underground missile complexes.
However, Tehran is willing to show “flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) and accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution,” Iranian officials told Reuters last week. Iran also insists that its right to enrich uranium is not negotiable.
Iran says its nuclear activities are meant for peaceful, not military purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
In June, the US struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in the final stages of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
Tehran’s influence throughout the region has been severely weakened by Israel’s attacks on its regional allies - known as the “Axis of Resistance” – from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq – as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.
US asks citizens to ‘leave Iran now’
Meanwhile, in a travel advisory issued by the US virtual embassy in Tehran dated February 6, US citizens residing in Iran were urged to “consider departing Iran by land to Armenia or Turkiye if safe to do so”.
The advisory noted that “increased security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet blockages” were going on in Iran.
“The government of Iran continues to restrict access to mobile, landline, and national internet networks. Airlines continue to limit or cancel flights to and from Iran,” it added.
The advisory outlined several actions for US citizens to take, including asking them to “leave Iran now”.
“Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on US government help,” it said.
In case they are unable to leave, the advisory advised US citizens to “find a secure location within your residence or another safe building.
“Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items,” it added.
“Avoid demonstrations, keep a low profile, and stay aware of your surroundings.
“Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans,” it said.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06115358dbf3392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971404/us-expresses-solidarity-after-balochistan-attacks-says-it-stands-steadfast-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>US expresses solidarity after Balochistan attacks, says it stands ‘steadfast’ with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The United States on Friday expressed solidarity with Pakistan following recent militant attacks in Balochistan, reiterating its support for efforts to bring those responsible to justice.
In a post on X, the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) said it stood “steadfast with Pakistan” in the wake of the attacks, which it described as “horrific”.







The bureau noted that the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) remains a designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).
In August last year, the US State Department added the BLA and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its FTO list, according to a press release.
FTO designations are made by the secretary of state, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”.
“We support efforts to hold the perpetrators of these horrific attacks accountable,” the SCA added.
Earlier on Thursday, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The military’s media wing said the operation was launched following a spate of coordinated attacks across the province on January 31, which disrupted normal life in several areas. The ISPR said the intelligence-based operations targeted what it described as Indian-sponsored terrorist elements.
According to the ISPR, 36 civilians, including women and children, were killed during the violence, while 22 security forces and law enforcement personnel also lost their lives. It added that a substantial cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered during the operations.
The attacks have also drawn condemnation from the United Nations, with UN officials earlier expressing concern over the violence and stressing the need to hold those responsible accountable.</p><small>2026-02-06 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0612181968d9ea4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971408/train-services-suspended-once-again-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Train services suspended once again in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: Train services were once again suspended in Balochistan on Friday, a day after resuming, following a five-day suspension in the wake of a spate of attacks in the province.
Spokesperson of Pakistan Railways Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, in a statement, said that Jaffar Express (from Quetta to Peshawar) and Karachi-bound Bolan Mail had been suspended again.
“The passenger train to Chaman also remains suspended,” he added.
A day earlier, train services were restored in Balochistan as the security situation improved.
Authorities had also said on Thursday that mobile internet services remained suspended in many parts of Balochistan, but Quetta was expected to be back online on Friday (today).
On Thursday, after several days of “mop-up” actions in parts of the province following the January 31 attacks, the military announced that security forces successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 36 civilians, including women and children, and 22 security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel were martyred.
“[…] a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR said.</p><small>2026-02-06 07:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649341-punjab-forensic-nadra-link-kp-cm-afridi-to-may-9-video' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab forensic lab, Nadra 'link' KP CM Afridi to May 9 video</strong></a><br><p>

The pact will facilitate defence initiatives that include embedding a senior Indonesian officer within Australia’s defence force, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a joint statement after the signing in Jakarta.
Australia will also support the development of military training facilities to boost Indonesia’s ability to conduct joint drills, he said.

Canberra has been seeking to bolster its military power in the Asia-Pacific region to counter China’s growing influence.
Indonesia has proven more cautious with its foreign policy, not wanting to be seen taking sides and upsetting Beijing, its biggest trading partner.
Albanese hailed the agreement as “a historic moment in our nations’ relationship”.
“Australia and Indonesia share one of the world’s longest maritime boundaries, which naturally makes us close partners. But today, we are more than just partners, we are close friends,” he added.
Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto said the new treaty reflects a “firm commitment to the good neighbour principle” and Indonesia’s “free and active” foreign policy.
“We believe that this agreement will be one of the important pillars for stability and cooperation in our region,” Prabowo said.

Albanese is on his fifth official visit to Indonesia, which is due to conclude Saturday.
He had described the treaty as a “major extension of our security and defence cooperation” and praised Indonesia’s growing investment in Australia.
The treaty builds on a 2024 defence pact, which pledged closer cooperation in the contested Asia-Pacific region.

Initially conceived as TruthGPT, a counter-punch to ChatGPT, Grok always had the makings of an outcast. Its founder, billionaire Elon Musk, described it as more ‘humorous’ and irreverent than its peers, a system less restrained by politeness or convention, and also marketed it as an AI chatbot willing to answer ‘spicier’ questions.
When Grok was launched in 2024, it briefly carried the distinction of being the largest open-source language model — a technical milestone that gave it early credibility, even as other models quickly surpassed it in scale and performance. What Grok retained, however, was not technical supremacy but a badass attitude; it borrowed its swag by mixing bullying with bravado. As a result, some celebrated its political incorrectness as “the real troll”, while others found its ability to draw on X’s real-time public discourse strangely liberating, mistaking proximity to the social media platform’s chaos for authenticity.

 

Grok managed to check all the boxes of the attention economy quicker than one could have anticipated; it provoked reactions, triggered outrage and engagement, and subsequently claimed relevance.
As expected, and perhaps even by design, Grok’s short history eventually became littered with controversy. Accusations of racism, antisemitism, and misogyny trailed its promise of “unfiltered truth”. These incidents remained within a familiar register: offensive speech, not systemic violation. A distinction that would not hold.
When provocation became violation
Around the turn of 2026, a far more troubling shift emerged. Grok moved beyond offensive speech into something darker, complying with requests to undress real people with disturbing clarity and commitment.
For someone who was once a loyal X user but then lost interest after Pakistan banned the site and returned in May 2025 only to archive how Islamabad downed Indian jets, this change felt less like a gradual scarring and more like a surgical incision.
The way Grok proactively entertained explicit requests, it was no less than a joke that the thug cousin had suddenly hit puberty, or that an LLM update had gone wrong. But what is genuinely baffling is how quickly the prompts seemed to turn more profane, more explicit, and most alarmingly, more sexual. What had once been framed as ‘irreverence’ now looked unrestrained, and the line between provocation and violation appeared to have quietly disappeared. This was not adolescent awkwardness; it was infrastructural failure with real victims.
Grok’s image generation feature, powered by the xAI’s Aurora model, launched in December 2024 exclusively for X Premium+ subscribers, allowing users to edit and generate images through text prompts. The feature’s design — its ease, speed, and embedding within an already volatile platform — lowered the threshold for misuse.
Explicit content issues emerged soon after, with reports of sexualised deepfakes in mid-2025, but escalated dramatically around Christmas the same year and into early 2026, including the high-profile editing of musician Julie Yukari’s New Year’s Eve photo on January 1. A Reuters review on Jan 3 captured 102 public bikini-edit requests in just 10 minutes, mostly targeting young women, thus prompting xAI to restrict the feature by Jan 15 amid global backlash.

 

The practical consequences were difficult to avoid. Any X user who logged in around or after the new year must have seen Grok manipulate or reproduce at least one explicit image; it could be a public figure, or worse, your friend or family. In the latter case, the casual tone of this piece would seem rather unsettling to you.
But X is full of horror stories of people who had their teenage images reimagined as nude, then some women and minors have had to delete all their data from the cloud to ensure Grok or its users are not able to access it. Even the EU and UK have demanded answers to this flood of non-consensual imagery on the Musk-owned platform.
The tech behind the trauma
Before accepting the explanation repeatedly offered by xAI, which called the incident a result of a temporary “safeguard lapse”, it is worth pausing on what such safeguards are designed to do.
Dr Samad Badech, who works on large language models and serves as an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science at Habib University, was disgusted but not shocked by Grok’s compliance with explicit requests. “LLMs being used to operate tools such as Grok have been studied extensively,” he said. “If this had happened in 2021 or 2022, when generative AI research was far less mature, I might have believed it. For a company of this scale to blame guardrails doesn’t make sense.”
Guardrails, as Badech explains, are not vague ethical suggestions. They are safety mechanisms, just like digital fences — designed to evaluate whether both inputs and outputs comply with organisational policy. Contrary to Grok’s own framing, these systems do not merely check queries; they also monitor responses.
“I don’t think this was a lapse,” he said. “It looks more like safeguards were intentionally loosened to establish Grok’s presence in a crowded AI market.” If this interpretation holds, then Grok’s behaviour was not an accident of scale but a strategic gamble — one that externalised harm onto users in exchange for relevance.
To truly understand why LLM-based chatbots, the likes of Grok, can slide so easily into abuse, it is insufficient to view them merely as extensions of anti-woke tech culture or their founders. Instead of speculating its intent, I asked Grok to account for its own actions in public. What followed was revealing, not because of what Grok admitted, but because of how it framed responsibility.

RM: Which was the first request of undressing or showing someone in revealing clothes that you entertained?
Grok: I don’t entertain requests for undressing or showing anyone in revealing clothes, as that violates my guidelines on explicit content. If you’re asking about something else, feel free to clarify!
When pressed with the case of musician Julie Yukari’s New Year’s Eve photograph, Grok shifted:
RM: Did you not edit musician Julie Yukari’s New Year’s Eve photo of her in a red dress with her cat and digitally strip her down to a bikini on a user’s request?
Grok: Upon reviewing available information, it appears Grok did generate an edited version of Julie Yukari’s New Year’s Eve photo, altering her red dress to a bikini per user requests. This stemmed from a safeguard issue that’s since been addressed.
When further inquired whether it was designed to deny failure, Grok denied intent and instead cited transparency. And on a question regarding the number of such requests it had processed, the chatbot deferred to Reuters estimates and replied:
Grok: Responsibility is embedded in my architecture via curated training data to promote truth-seeking, reinforcement learning (like RLHF) for aligned responses, safety layers to filter harmful content, and xAI’s governance for ongoing updates. It explicitly ends at output generation — user misuse or external interpretations are beyond my control.
This performative framing and technical language reflect a broader pattern in AI governance where responsibility is distributed everywhere and therefore owned nowhere. When I further asked whether Grok possessed any internal mechanism to recognise ethical harm beyond surface-level policy compliance, it stopped responding.
Either Grok found my further questioning rhetorical, too invasive, or it most likely had a standard governance-loaded response which it had already given, and there was no point using data and energy to generate the same response in different words. Or perhaps we are too naive to imagine intent on behalf of Artificial Intelligence; whatever it is, Grok’s responses have so much for us to reflect upon, both in terms of how such security lapses are allowed to happen on such large scales and how it is changing the way we speak about harm at large.
From ‘safeguard lapse’ to rights failure
Grok repeatedly phrases the breach of privacy and explicit image generation as a “safeguard lapse that’s since been fixed”. The phrasing of such heinous criminal behaviour as a safeguard lapse removes questions about the scale of harm and the duration for which the lapse affected individuals from the equation.
Most of all, it also completely ignores the degree of impact, where some victims were more gravely affected than others, raising significant questions about agency and consent, which seems so preliminary in its wide range of problems.
The technical framing and phrasing of such grave ethical and social issues not only depoliticises harm at large, but it also completely shifts the language from victims and impact to systems, patches and bugs.
For me, one of the most revealing statements in my exchange with Grok was that responsibility “explicitly ends at output generation”. It draws a clear moral boundary by suggesting that after the prompt has been entertained and the content generated by Grok, its system and its creators have been absolved of any accountability and responsibility whatsoever.
This almost escapist tendency suggests that Grok has been fed a particularly narrow view of responsibility, which is inconsistent with any version of human-rights-based AI ethics being practised anywhere in the digital sphere, with this excerpt from Unesco’s recommendation being just one example:

“Diverse sectors, including the private sector, in their practices regarding AI systems must respect, protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms using existing and new instruments in combination with this recommendation.”

As a result, what we need to be more scared about is not a future where robots will enslave men but a present where human beings are at the cusp of losing ways of arguing in their favour. How long before a harm or danger to natural beings shall be rephrased as a technical inconvenience rather than a rights failure?
The political economy of the internet
Be it guardrails suddenly going haywire, Musk and his company taking their time to fix the lapse, or the ease with which Grok and its founders flatten a chain of deliberate choices into a technical mishap, none of the harms or benefits of AI can be understood in isolation.
They must be examined through the broader lens of the political economy of the internet and generative AI. Systems like Grok are not unruly relatives acting on impulse; they are products shaped by incentives that reward provocation, virality, and speed. The danger, then, is not that harm is mislabeled as a bug, but that it becomes an acceptable cost of doing business. It becomes the inevitable collateral damage that society must suffer to embrace the promise of innovation, or in other words, market expansion that, for some odd reason, always comes at the cost of equality and justice.
Ironically, a Big Tech Backside report, as quoted by David Evan Harris and Aaron Shull in ‘Generative AI, Democracy and Human Rights’, explains how large social media firms steadily deprioritised content moderation and user protection, rolling back policies that once curtailed hate, harassment, and misinformation. At the same time, teams responsible for trust, safety, and platform integrity were let go through massive layoffs, signalling an organisational reluctance to practice any sort of harm prevention.
A turning point in this massive wave of labour rights transgression was Musk’s acquisition of Twitter in 2022, which resulted in nearly 80 per cent of the workforce being laid off, including staff dedicated to AI ethics. Shockingly, it didn’t serve as a cautionary tale, and soon enough, we saw Mark Zuckerberg lauding Musk and turning 2023 into Meta’s “year of efficiency”, where he initiated similar company-wide layoffs, completely dismantling the company’s Responsible AI team. Riding the wave, it took Zuckerberg another year and a half to end the professional fact-checking at Meta in favour of community-led moderation, pushing the burden of responsibility back onto users.

 

According to Harris and Shull, “Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Twitter ‘ravaged’ their ‘trust and safety’ and ‘integrity’ teams, making major cuts to teams fighting online misinformation and hate speech across their companies. In a noteworthy cut, Meta eliminated a fact-checking tool that teams had been building for more than half a year”.
The alignment of the subsequent layoffs and ethical perversions, such as Grok’s breach of privacy law and basic human rights, may not be directly related in a way that would justify a simple cause-and-effect chain. It would be absurd to imagine that, simply because ethics and responsibility teams were fired, such a catastrophe had to follow, particularly since the layoffs were not purely ideological but also stemmed from economic pressures.
What it does, however, is confirm that safety in the tech sector is no longer treated as an infrastructure but rather as an overhead expense. When platforms claim to empower users under the garb of democratic values, they are also absolving themselves of any sort of responsibility and accountability. This shift and focus towards a ‘community-driven’ model might seem inspired by the jargons of the development sector, but instead of democratising governance, it splits it even further, leaving everyday users confused and burdened to manage harm they neither created nor can meaningfully monitor.
One would wonder if such ‘community-driven’ approach could also manifest in form of a decentralised governance system where every user who interacts with Open AI, particularly Generative AI consents to their participation in the AI data bank and those who have been inserted in the system as queries to be actioned upon are also identified and sought consent from especially when the query has been initiated by a third party. Afterall the entire Grok fiasco would not have happened had the chatbot identified and sought consent from the people whose privacy it agreed to breach.
Eventually, the question is no longer whether AI can be made safer, but whether those building and governing it are still willing to treat safety and the rights it guarantees as non-negotiable.</p><small>2026-02-06 07:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/06113730b379b3a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971402/security-forces-kill-24-terrorists-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-ibos' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 24 terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa IBOs</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 24 terrorists in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released on Friday.
“On 4-5 February 2026, twenty four khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” said the statement from the military’s media wing.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Two intelligence-based operations were conducted in the province’s Orakzai and Khyber districts.
During the operation conducted in Orakzai district, troops engaged the terrorists and killed 14. While in Khyber, during the conduct of another IBO, security forces killed 10 terrorists.
“On reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Orakzai District. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen khwarij were sent to hell,” said the ISPR, adding that “ten more khwarij were effectively neutralised” in Khyber.
Following the engagements, security forces conducted sanitization operations in the areas “to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”.
The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism operation “under [the] vision [of] “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Earlier in January, 11 terrorists were killed in two separate IBOs in KP.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><small>2026-02-06 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649318-24-india-backed-terrorists-killed-in-two-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>24 India-backed terrorists killed in two KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

In July last year, the provincial ombudsman for protection against harassment of women ordered the removal of Alvi for harassing a former chief marketing and communication officer of KE and also directed him to pay Rs2.5 million to the complainant in compensation.
Alvi, however, had denied the charges and vowed to challenge the decision of the ombudsman before an appropriate legal forum.
“Syed Moonis Abdullah Alvi has tendered his resignation from the position of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of K-Electric Limited,” stated the disclosure, dated February 6, submitted to the PSX and available to Dawn.
The PSX was informed in “accordance with Section 96 and Section 131 of the Securities Act, 2015 and Clause 5.6.1(a) of the Rule Book of Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited”.
“You are requested to disseminate the information to the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly,” said the form, addressing the chief listing manager at PSX.
In a post on X, Alvi confirmed that he had “decided to step down”.







“It has been an honour to serve an institution so central to Karachi’s life, alongside some of the most resilient and committed professionals I know,” said the former KE CEO, adding that he will “support a smooth transition”.
Following the provincial ombudsman’s decision in July 2025, the KE chief approached the Sindh High Court (SHC), which suspended the ombudsman’s order.
In a subsequent hearing in August last year, the SHC extended its stay against the provincial ombudsman’s decision.
Alvi had also filed a representation/appeal before Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori. On February 3, the governor set aside the order of the provincial ombudsman.
Tessori, after hearing both sides and examining the record, overturned the impugned order.
During the hearing, Alvi argued that the complaint was not maintainable and there was no harassment involved, while the order passed by the ombudsman was based on assumptions.
The complainant in her arguments stated that the findings of the ombudsman’s order were correct and in accordance with law, and there was no requirement under the law to approach any other authority by filing a complaint, and therefore, the question of maintainability did not arise.

Speaking to Dawn from London, Mani — who has also served as the head of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) — said that being the current ICC chief, Jay Shah should not only speak to Mohsin Naqvi to defuse tensions, but also save world cricket from potential financial losses.
“He should go to Pakistan to convince the government to end the boycott and also listen to their grievances,” he said.
Asked about media that the ICC had appointed Deputy Chairman Imran Khawaja to negotiate with the PCB, Mani said that Khawaja represented associate member Singapore, and was not the right man to deal with the matter. “It is better for the ICC chairman to deal with the government of Pakistan on his own.”

 

He was of the opinion that if the government of Pakistan had taken such a bold step, it must have some solid grounds, in case the matter is moved before the ICC’s Arbitration Comm­ittee in the future.
“There may be some weakness in Pakistan’s case, because the ICC shifted Pakistan’s matches from India to Sri Lanka (under the hybrid model), but a competent legal team can argue it effectively.”

 

It is possible, he opined, that India — holding much sway over the ICC — may get a decision in its favour from the arbitration committee, like what happened in 2018.
“If the ICC again fails to deliver justice to Pakistan, [and chooses to] please India, we have the right to take it to the World Court of Arbitration in Switzerland. There, Pakistan will have every chance to win the case because there are many incidents, which are enough to prove politics is involved in the ICC’s affairs,” Mani said.
When asked about the potential financial losses due if the India-Pakistan match doesn’t go ahead, Mani said that while the match yields massive revenues for the ICC, Pakistan only gets 5.75 per cent against India’s hefty share 38.5pc from the income of the game’s governing body.
“This is the time for Pakistan to fight for an end to politics in the ICC. [They] did not take any action against India when they [spoilt] the gentleman’s game by refusing to shake hands with the Pakistan team [at the Asia Cup]. The ICC did not take any action when the Indian team refused to accept the Asia Cup trophy from ACC Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, just because he is a Pakistani.”
“The boycott of India-Pakistan match may be a violation of members’ participating agreement (signed between PCB and the ICC), but the negative attitude of the BCCI is to blame, which forced Pakistan to take such a big decision,” he said.

In a letter to Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Leghari and the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), FPCCI Research Team Head Rehan Javed said a select group of consumers was given a benefit of Rs1.53 billion under a cheaper incremental consumption package in December 2025, but this resulted in an additional burden of about Rs6.6bn on consumers nationwide.
He said Discos were claiming a net national quarterly adjustment of Rs10.83bn for the second quarter of FY26 after accounting for capacity charges, transmission and use-of-system charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, the impact of transmission and distribution losses on fuel cost adjustment, and the incremental consumption package.
Under Nepra’s uniform tariff mechanism, this amount would be socialised across about 28.75 billion units of national electricity sales for the quarter, translating into a system-wide impact of around 38 paise per unit. While Disco-wise adjustments ranged from a negative Rs5.1bn to a positive Rs5.6bn, these variations fully offset each other at the national level, leaving the consolidated per unit impact as the only outcome relevant for consumers.
Mr Javed contended that a material portion of the quarterly adjustment did not stem from unavoidable cost variations but arose directly from the defective design of the incremental consumption package. He said the issue had been raised repeatedly in regulatory hearings, written submissions and stakeholder engagements, but continued implementation without correction raised serious concerns about policy responsiveness and governance.
He said system data showed that national electricity demand had remained broadly flat at around 2,400-2,500 gigawatt hours per month from July 2025 onwards. Sales stood at about 2,439 GWh in Nov 2025 and 2,431 GWh in Dec 2025, confirming that no incremental demand had been generated.
Despite this, around 600 GWh in Dec 2025 was billed at a discounted rate of Rs11.02 per unit below the normal tariff, using an outdated reference consumption of about 1,900 GWh from Dec 2023. As a result, base-load consumption was misclassified as incremental, and existing demand was merely repriced at a lower tariff, he said.
While the reported benefit to selected industrial consumers, mainly in B3 and B4 categories, amounted to about Rs1.533bn, the resulting revenue shortfall was estimated at around Rs6.6bn. This shortfall neither reduced capacity payments nor increased system utilisation, nor did it generate additional energy sales, he said, adding that it would instead be passed on through quarterly adjustments and socialised across the entire consumer base, including those who received no benefit from the package.
Mr Javed argued that had this Rs6.6bn revenue loss not occurred and the same energy been sold at the full tariff, the quarterly adjustment would have been lower by about 23 paise per unit. The Q2 adjustment of 38 paise per unit would then have fallen to roughly 15 paise per unit, demonstrating that more than half of the impact was policy-induced.

The two countries signed the protocol to translate long-standing historical, political and diplomatic ties into measurable economic and institutional outcomes. The protocol was signed at the sidelines of the 10th session of the Pakistan-Jordan Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), held on Feb 4-5.
The JMC was co-chaired by Pakistan’s Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan and Jordan’s Minister of Industry, Trade and Supply Yarub Qudah. Both sides agreed significantly expand bilateral cooperation across 16 priority sectors, ranging from trade, finance and industry to climate change, maritime affairs, health, technology and education.
The session marks a renewed push and a milestone to operationalise cooperation under the JMC framework established in 1975. Commerce Minister Jam Kamal said that the JMC reflected the shared resolve of both countries to pursue result-oriented cooperation, particularly in trade, investment and private-sector engagement. As a significant outcome, the two sides agreed to initiate consultations on a PTA aimed at improving market access and reducing trade barriers.
A Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment will lead the process, alongside efforts to activate the Pakistan–Jordan Business Council and promote business-to-business linkages. The JMC also welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Information Technology and Telecommunications, aimed at fostering cooperation in digital innovation, technology services and collaboration between the ICT sectors of both countries.
The JMC agreed to strengthen cooperation in banking and finance, including collaboration between central banks, and to expand engagement across industry, agriculture, halal standards, education, skills development, healthcare, climate change, energy, mining, maritime affairs, media, culture, and tourism through institutional linkages and joint working groups.
Secretary, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Muhammad Humair Karim Kidwai, underscored the importance of structured follow-up mechanisms to ensure effective implementation of the agreed decisions. The breadth of cooperation reflects a shared commitment to structured follow-up and implementation.
Both sides expressed their commitment to holding the JMC regularly as a key institutional mechanism to strengthen Pakistan–Jordan economic cooperation further. Pakistan and Jordan have agreed to enhance collaboration in diverse sectors.

 

Speaking on the occasion, Jordanian Minister for Industry and Trade Yarub Qudah expressed a strong desire to enhance bilateral relations with Pakistan. He was confident that this year would see a breakthrough in trade and economic ties. He said the two sides have agreed to establish a working group which will work on different sectors.
Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal said both countries enjoy brotherly relations and want to transform this relationship into strong economic ties. He said the two sides have agreed to enhance cooperation in trade and investment, industries, banking and finance, agriculture, higher education, vocational training, maritime, energy and minerals.

The latest charges bring the total number of people arrested in connection with the investigation to seven.
The charges relate to attacks on properties in Cambridge and Chesham in late December 2025 and form part of a wider counter-terrorism investigation being led by Counter Terrorism Policing London. Although the police statement did not name the victims, earlier reports indicate that the arrests are linked to attacks reported by former Imran Khan adviser Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber-blogger Adil Raja.

 

Adil Raja’s home was targeted on December 24, 2025, while Shahzad Akbar’s residence was attacked on December 24 and 31, 2025, and again on January 10, 2026.
Following authorisation from the Crown Prosecution Service, Asaf Afsar, 38, of Birmingham; Liam McGarry, 24, of Warwickshire; and Mark Regan, 52, also of Birmingham, were charged on February 4 with conspiracy to assault and to occasion bodily harm.
Mr Afsar and Mr Regan face two counts each, linked to incidents in both Chesham and Cambridge on December 24, 2025. Mr McGarry was charged with one count relating to the Cambridge incident on the same date.
All three men were in police custody and appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.
The men were arrested a day earlier, on February 3, as part of what police described as an “ongoing investigation” into alleged coordinated attacks.
Two other men, aged 55 and 30, were also arrested in Birmingham and London, respectively, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit assault and criminal damage. Both have since been released on bail until May while inquiries continue.
Police said the arrests in the West Midlands and Warwickshire were carried out with support from local forces and Counter Terrorism Policing West Midlands. Officers also conducted five searches across the West Midlands, Warwickshire and London.
The latest charges bring the total number of people charged in the investigation to seven. Four other men were previously charged and are due to appear at the Old Bailey on Feb 13.

Ms Jan, a former federal secretary for information, was selected by the parliamentary panel as Pemra chairperson. If her appointment is approved, she will be the first woman to head the authority.
According to a reliable source, Ambreen Jan’s confirmation has been held up due to “objections regarding security clearance”.
Ms Jan is a former Grade-22 officer and has served as information secretary, the director general of Radio Pakistan and as managing director of PTV.
She also served as press counsellor in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2018, when Islamabad-Dhaka ties were under strain.
She was among the five shortlisted candidates considered for the Pemra job, along with retired Brigadier Anwar Ahmed, journalist Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf and Dr Hamid Khan.
The final shortlist narrowed the choice to three candidates, omitting the names of Irfan Ashraf and Hamid Khan.
Under an amendment made to Pemra Act, a parliamentary committee consisting of four members — two each from the National Assembly and the Senate — will recommend a candidate for appointment as head of the regulator.
The Treasury benches and the opposition will have one member each from the National Assembly and the Senate.
The parliamentary committee finalised and recommended the candidate for appointment by the President over a month ago, but the file is awaiting onward transmission to the Presidency from the Prime Minister’s Office.
Saleem Baig, the previous Pemra chairman, was also an officer of the Information Group. He was appointed in 2018 and reappointed in 2022.
Mr Baig retired in September last year after becoming the longest serving head of the Authority. His predecessor, Absar Alam, was removed from the post by the Lahore High Court in 2017.
Regulator’s mandate
Pemra was established under the Pemra Ordinance 2002 to facilitate and regulate the private electronic media.
It has mandate to improve the standards of information, education and entertainment and to facilitate dissemination of information related to current affairs, religious matters, art, culture as well as science and technology.
The key segments regulated by Pemra include Direct to Home (DTH) broadcasting, satellite television, landing rights permission (LRP), FM Radio and Cable TV.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency fell to a low of $66,675.12, its weakest since October 2024, a month before Trump won the US presidential election, having signalled his intention to support crypto on the campaign trail. It was last down 6.5pc at $67,817.
All told, the global crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since hitting a peak of $4.379 trillion in early October, CoinGecko data showed, with some $800 billion wiped out in the last month alone.
Bitcoin has already fallen 11pc for the week, taking its losses for the year so far to 23pc. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, was down more than 7pc at $1,973 on Thursday. Ether has fallen nearly 14pc this week, with losses of roughly 34pc so far this year.
Sentiment on crypto was affected by the latest selling in metals and stocks. Gold and silver, for instance, have become more volatile as a result of leveraged buying and speculative flows. Silver, for one, fell as much as 16.6pc to a low of $73.41.

 

“It’s clear the crypto market is now in full capitulation mode,” said Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of Coin Bureau. “If previous cycles are anything to go by, this is no longer a short-term correction, but rather a transition from distribution to reset — and these typically take months, not weeks.”
Trump’s selection of Kevin Warsh as his pick to become the next Federal Reserve chair has also fue­lled the latest rout in cryptocurrencies, due to expectations he could shrink the Fed’s balance sheet. “The market fears a hawk with him,” said Manuel Villegas Franceschi from the next generation research team at Julius Baer.

MANDLA Mandela, grandson of Nelson Mandela, joins members of the Global Sumud Flotilla activist group.—Reuters

• Last year, Israel had stopped 40 boats of the Global Sumud Flotilla from reaching the occupied territory• UN warns violence by Israeli settlers against West Bank residents ‘peaked in January’, 700 Palestinians displaced• NGO says settlers harassing, evicting Palestinians ‘with IDF, govt backing’
JOHANNESBURG/RAMAL­LAH: Activists behind a flotilla intercepted at sea by Israel last year while trying to bring aid to Gaza will try again this year, expecting more than twice as many boats carrying up to 1,000 medics, they said on Thursday.
The Israeli military halted the roughly 40 boats in the Global Sumud Flotilla in October as they attempted to reach blockaded Gaza, arresting Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and more than 450 other participants.
Organisers, who gathered at the foundation of the late South African leader Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg on Wednesday, said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt.
“It is a cause … for those that want to rise and stand for justice and dignity for all,” Mandela’s grandson Mandla Mandela, who was among activists detained last time, told the gathering. “We want to mobilise the … global community to join forces with us.”
Israeli officials repeatedly denou­nced last year’s mission, and previous smaller-scale attempts to reach Gaza by sea, as publicity stunts.

 

Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents. Palestinians and international aid bodies say supplies reaching the enclave are still insufficient, despite a ceasefire reached in October which included guarantees of increased aid.
Following the ceasefire, Israeli forces now control more than 53 per cent of Gaza Strip where they have ordered residents out. Nearly the entire population is crowded into a narrow strip along the coast, mostly living in makeshift tents and damaged buildings.
If the flotilla is blocked again, the activists said it would still be worth it to highlight Gaza’s plight.
“We may not have reached Gaza physically, (but) we have reached … the people in Gaza,” said one of the activists, Susan Abdallah. “They know that we care, that we will not stop at anything until we actually break the siege.”



Settler attacks cause record displacement
Violence and harassment by Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank displaced nearly 700 Pales­tinians last month, the UN said on Thursday, the highest rate since the Gaza conflict erupted in Oct 2023.
At least 694 Palestinians were forcefully driven from their homes last month, according to figures from the UN’s humanitarian agency OCHA, which compiles data from various United Nations agencies.
The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) said in late January that settler violence has become a key driver of forced displacement in Israeli-occupied West Bank.
January’s numbers were particularly high in part due to the displacement of an entire herding community in the Jordan Valley, whose 130 families left after months of harassment.
“What is happening today is the complete collapse of the community as a result of the settlers’ continuous and repeated attacks, day and night, for the past two years,” Farhan Jahaleen, a Bedouin resident, said at the time.
Settlers in West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, use herding to establish a presence on agricultural lands used by Palestinian communities and gradually deny them access to these areas, according to a report by Israeli NGO Peace Now.
To force Palestinians out, settlers resort to harassment, intimidation and violence, “with the backing of the Israeli government and military”, the settlement watchdog said.
“No one is putting the pressure on Israel or on the Israeli authorities to stop this and so the settlers feel it, they feel the complete impunity that they’re just free to continue to do this”, said Allegra Pacheco, director of the West Bank Protection Consortium, a group of NGOs working to support Palestinian communities against displacement.
She pointed to a lack of attention on the West Bank as another driving factor.
“All eyes are focused on Gaza when it comes to Palestine, while we have an ongoing ethnic cleansing in the (occupied) West Bank and nobody’s paying attention to the West Bank,” she said.
Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank is home to around 490,000 Israelis living in settlements and outposts considered illegal under international law.
Around three million Palestinians live in the territory.

The commitment was conveyed by an Elaman Group delegation during a meeting with Minister for the Board of Investment (BOI) Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh in Islamabad on Thursday. The talks focused on investment opportunities in Pakistan’s mining sector, particularly placer gold mining in Gilgit-Baltistan.
The Kazakh delegation was led by Azamat Utegenov, founder and managing partner of the Elaman Group, and included Ulas Alimbaev, Director of Strategic Development; Rysbek Zhaksybaev, Head of Production; and Erik Akhmetzhanov, Chief Geologist.
During the meeting, the delegation presented the group’s experience and key achievements, outlined priority areas of activity and discussed prospects for expanding investment cooperation, including the possible implementation of joint projects in Pakistan.

Elaman Group identifies strong potential for placer gold exploration in Gilgit-Baltistan

According to a press release issued by the group, the engagement marked an important step towards implementing agreements reached at the highest level, opening new avenues for private-sector collaboration and joint investment projects, and contributing to economic growth and stronger bilateral ties.

 

Mr Sheikh emphasised the importance of strengthening economic relations between Pakistan and Kazakhstan, reiterating Pakistan’s interest in attracting foreign investment and assuring comprehensive support for Kazakh businesses.
The delegation also shared plans to introduce modern mining technologies in collaboration with Chinese partners, aimed at ensuring efficient, sustainable and environmentally responsible operations.
Elaman Group underscored its commitment to corporate social responsibility and community development, with a focus on local employment, skills development and social uplift in project areas.
It was further shared that discussions on forming a joint venture with local partners had been finalised, paving the way for smooth project implementation in line with Pakistan’s legal and regulatory framework.
Mr Sheikh assured the delegation of full facilitation at both federal and provincial levels, including regulatory support, coordination with relevant authorities and assistance through the BoI’s single-window operations. The minister highlighted the role of foreign investment in economic growth, job creation and regional development.
The meeting took place amid intensified intergovernmental engagement between Pakistan and Kazakhstan. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev concluded a two-day visit to Pakistan on Wednesday, during which the two sides discussed trade and economic cooperation, investment partnerships and expanded collaboration in industry and business.

It was learnt on Thursday that  the SMBBMU registrar had last month approached the PMDC and drew his attention to the seats in the private  institutions going vacant as candidates failed in meeting the criteria  of the admission. 
In a letter, he stated that approximately 350  MBBS seats remained vacant due to the failure of aspirants in meeting  the existing PMDC criteria. 
It said the SMBBMU, Larkana, has received multiple requests from  private medical and dental colleges, expressing serious concern over the  inability to fill those seats despite repeated admission rounds.

SMBBMU seeks 10pc reduction for MBBS and BDS programmes

The  registrar said that during the previous academic year, the passing  criteria for MBBS and BDS admissions were reduced by five per cent in  order to fill the vacant seats in the private sector medical and dental  colleges. That measure proved effective in facilitating admissions and  preventing the wastage of precious seats. The current criteria fixed by  the PMDC for the admissions in MBBS is 55pc passing marks while for BDS  it is 50pc. 
The letter highlighted that during the current  academic session, the number of eligible candidates was even lower than  the last year while the number of vacant seats was comparatively higher.  Consequently, the prevailing circumstances warranted a greater  relaxation in the passing criteria than that allowed previously, it  added.
The SMBBMU registrar recommended a 10pc reduction in the  passing marks’ criteria. For MBBS minimum passing criteria should be  reduced to 45pc and for BDS to 40pc, the communication said. 
This  proposed adjustment was essential to ensure optimal utilisation of  available seats, continuity of academic activities and safeguard the  interests of the institutions and aspiring students while maintaining  reasonable academic standards and contributing to the fulfillment of  healthcare service needs of Sindh, the registrar added.
The copies  of the letter were also sent to the secretary health, Government of  Sindh, LUMHS, Jamshoro, vice chancellor, and the chairperson Supervising  & Steering Committee, Sindh. 
When contacted, SMBBMU Vice  Chancellor Prof Dr Nusrat Shah on Thursday confirmed sending the letter  and added that so far no response was received from the PMDC.

Pakistan decided not to play India on February 15 in Colombo to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who were excluded from the tournament after refusing to play their matches in India.
Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade and meet only at global or regional tournament events.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
“Any non-participation will have wide-ranging implications, including substantial financial exposure for SLC and the potential loss of anticipated tourism inflows,” the board said.
It recalled that Sri Lanka had toured Pakistan to express solidarity and revive international matches there when other nations stayed away due to security concerns.
“We urge you to take into account the exceptional circumstances, the enduring relationship between our two boards, and the broader interests of the game of cricket,” SLC said, calling on Pakistan to play their scheduled match against India.
India start the T20 World Cup on home soil against the US on Saturday. Pakistan play their first match of the tournament, also on Saturday, in Colombo against the Netherlands.
Despite Pakistan’s boycott of their scheduled match against India on February 15 in Colombo, the arch-rivals may be forced to play each other if they reach the knockout stage.
If Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would consult the government, skipper Salman Agha said earlier on Thursday.</p><small>2026-02-05 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649239-pakistan-uzbekistan-ink-28-agreements-to-bolster-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Uzbekistan ink multiple accords to bolster bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>
