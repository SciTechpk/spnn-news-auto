According to the Met Office, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country, particularly the southern parts.
Under the influence of these conditions, widespread rain-wind/thundershowers, with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy, are expected in Mithi, Tharparkar, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, and Jamshoro, while scattered showers are likely in Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad till August 22 with occasional gaps.
In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershowers, with scattered heavy falls, are expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qila Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur till August 22 with occasional gaps.
Subdued rain-wind/thundershowers are expected at isolated places in Islamabad, Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and upper Punjab (Rawalpindi, Attock, Murree/Galliyat, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Lahore, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, and Rajanpur), as well as in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, and Swabi) till August 22.
 
 

The Met Office warned that torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Sindh, including Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tharparkar, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, and Jamshoro.
Torrential rains may also generate flash floods in north and southeastern parts of Balochistan. Heavy falls, windstorms, and lightning may damage weak structures such as kacha houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles, and solar panels during the forecast period.
The public, travellers, and tourists have been advised to avoid unnecessary exposure to vulnerable areas and stay updated with the latest weather alerts.

Those vague plans never came close to fruition. With the US serving as dishonest broker, the Bantustan-style deals Israel offered were understandably unacceptable to the Palestinians — as the Zionist state likely intended. The genocidal aim has simmered beneath the surface of every Israeli action since 1948. The difference now is that it is no longer latent.
The concept of ‘land for peace’ has re-emerged, though, in a different context. The czar-like ruler of Russia appears to have demanded the entire Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, including parts that his troops have so far failed to conquer, as the price for halting the aggression he embarked upon over three years ago. The idea of ‘territorial exchanges’ presumably implies no more than a Russian withdrawal from some of the areas in the southeast.
 
 

President Donald Trump went into last week’s Anchorage summit with Vladimir Putin threatening “severe consequences” for Russia unless a ceasefire was agreed. He emerged somewhat chastened after three hours of what he had earlier described as a “listening exercise”, only to declare that a comprehensive peace agreement made more sense than a truce that might not last long. The notion that a ceasefire — desirable under any circumstances — could facilitate the trilateral Russia-Ukraine-US negotiations he wishes to arrange appears not have crossed his mind.
Announcement of the summit in Alaska — which was a Russian colony until Tsar Alexander II sold it to the US for less than two cents per acre — unleashed a flurry of diplomatic activity in Europe, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky hopping across the capitals where he is admired, and culminating in several European leaders deciding to rearrange their summer holiday schedules to accompany him to Washington. The heads of the EU and Nato were accompanied by the prime ministers of Italy and Britain and the presidents of France and Finland, alongside the German chancellor.

Save Ukraine, but don’t stop there.

The ‘Magnificent Seven’ (as they might see themselves) are likely to claim that they were there to safeguard Zelensky against the kind of bullying he experienced on his last visit to the White House. They could also be perceived as facilitators of the seven deadly sins that Trump revels in, given the level of kowtowing to his imperial majesty. Respectable economists have decried the EU’s recent trade deal with the US as a self-abasing disaster, involving commitments to, inter alia, invest in American fossil fuels and spend hundreds of billions on US weaponry.
 
 

Zelensky, too, resorted to abject obsequiousness after the tongue-lashing he received from the vacation-loving Vice-President J.D. Vance, and on Monday dressed up in a black suit for his White House appearance, while mouthing ‘thank yous’. Whether the brown-nosing will lead to direct talks between Putin and Zelensky, with Trump as a biased referee, remains to be seen. Trump dialled the Kremlin while the seven European leaders plus Zelensky were still in the White House, for what Putin’s spokesman described as a “frank and very constructive” discussion, implying some disagreement.
In Alaska, Putin was reportedly amenable to Western ‘security guarantees’ for what remains of Ukraine after an ongoing conflict that is said to have claimed a million lives on both sides. That’s a horrific toll, and there can be no question that ending the Russian-launched war would be a spectacular achie­vement.
Ceding a substantial chunk of its territory to the aggressor would be anathema to any Ukrainian leader, but it’s a bitter way out of an unwinnable war that Zelensky or any successor might eventually feel obliged to swallow as the price of peace. If that’s bound to be the unfortunate outcome, the sooner the better.
 
 

Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that while Trump trumpeted his discussions with the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen about “the massive Worldwide problem of missing children”, and in Alaska handed Putin a letter from first lady Melania Trump, touchingly requesting him to “restore … the melodic laughter” of children, neither of the women has offered evidence of concern about Gaza.
Washington Post reported recently that, according to the UN, “at least 55 children have been killed this year” in Ukraine, 43 of them in Russian attacks. That is a huge tragedy — while Israel’s Western-supplied munitions and starvation are killing an estimated 30 Palestinian children daily.
Unlike the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, Trump could halt the Palestinian genocide at a stroke. But he won’t, yet he hankers after the Nobel Peace Prize.

Once again, with regard to the merged areas, the drumbeats of change are becoming louder in the corridors of power. However, yet again, locals of the area are mere observers looking in from the outside.
In the aftermath of the US invasion of Afghanistan, then Fata, took centre stage in this region’s affairs. The Taliban took refuge along the Pak-Afghan border, with Tora Bora the most popular of the cave complexes. Soon after, by the mid-2000s, the Pakistani Taliban, or other militant groups, had taken control of most of Fata in Pakistan. A new great game took root in this belt that decimated the local culture, economy and lifestyle of its people. Unfortunately, the wrong conclusions were drawn.
The tribal nature of this area and its people, it was concluded, was the root cause for the spread of militancy and the area’s underdevelopment. So, it was decided by the then powers that be, that it was time to ‘mainstream’ Fata. National security experts saw it as a means to counter militancy, while West-influenced development specialists viewed it as the great liberation — freeing the barbaric tribesmen from their ‘past’, if you will.
 
 

Others decided it was time for Fata to cease to exist. Without any genuine consensus building, and on the illusion of a demand from a group of pseudo tribal youth, all major political parties of Pakistan, other than the JUI-F, voted for Fata to be merged with KP, with promises of peace, prosperity, legal rights and development.
It’s safe to say the merger has not gone as planned. It has failed to: secure the merged districts’ share in the NFC award, deliver functioning judicial services, provide promised government jobs or quota seats to residents, promote businesses or industry production, create employment opportunities, develop carefully planned urban centres, or even give the area sustained peace — all pre-merger promises.
If the merger of East and West Germany is an example of how to merge two developmentally unequal regions of similar ethnicity into one, Fata’s merger with KP is one of how not to. The tragedy is that local stakeholders, including the majority of the then elected members from Fata and influential elders and youth residing there, had highlighted these impracticalities that today the government is perplexed by. However, over the past few years, as political turmoil expectedly gripped the country, the merged districts’ problems took a back seat.

Residents of the merged areas have become too accustomed to decisions being imposed on them

Recently though, after global successes on the foreign policy front, following the conflict with India, the federal government seems to be willing to mend local fault lines within the country. In this regard, on June 3, 2025, a grand jirga by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was called in Peshawar of participants from all of KP’s conflict-affected districts, but predominantly the merged districts. Importantly, the jirga was also attended by the army chief and the KP chief minister, along with his cabinet and the province’s senior administrative staff. Two key demands of the provincial government were the release of funds for the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP), a special package for Fata following its merger with KP by the federal government but executed through the KP government, and the revival of the jirga system for administrative purposes.
Subsequently, by mid-June about Rs35 billion were released for the AIP scheme. To put this in context, in the first 11 months of the financial year prior to the jirga, only a little over Rs7bn had been released. That’s over 80 per cent of the total funds being released following this jirga. Similarly, a committee under the convenorship of Amir Muqam, federal minister for KANA & SAFRON, was formed by Mr Sharif, which included the chief minister, governor and senior representatives of the KP government to ‘explore the revival of jirga system and strengthening of civil administration’ for the merged areas.
However, this is where things start to become convoluted. Strong rumours are circulating that the aim of this committee is beyond just the extension of a jirga system. Rather it is to roll back the merger and restore the area’s semi-autonomous status as Fata, a claim the federal government rejects. While some merged district residents have welcomed this rumour regardless of the centre’s reasons, there are many others that fear the motivation behind this. Locals fear this is an attempt to take control of the merged districts’ mineral wealth after the failed attempt of passing a new mines and minerals law in KP.
Others fear that this might be part of a larger negotiated settlement with militant groups, since the rollback of the merger was a key demand of the TTP when negotiations took place with them during the tail end of Imran Khan’s government. Out of fear of public backlash, the KP government’s boycott of committee meetings, after originally asking for it and attending the initial meetings, has only added fuel to the fire. But trying to evade the problem won’t make it go away. The reality is that the current system is not working and reform is needed.
 
 

Unfortunately, the residents of the merged areas have become too accustomed to decisions being imposed on them and being made from the angle of ‘administering’ them. While the ongoing conflict against militants in the area has put reforms on hold for now, local apprehensions about the state’s intentions are understandable. Importantly, regardless of the policy the centre advocates, whether the revival of the jirga system or the merger’s rollback, the process by which they do it and for them to be cognisant of who they are doing it for, is key.
Regrettably, even the wording and membership of this committee seems to be for assisting the bureaucracy to regain their pre-merger control rather than for providing relief to the public. Overwhelmingly, locals are proponents of the jirga system, but community-led ones. Not the corrupted jirgas that had increasingly started under the supervision of the local administration. They want legal cover for community jirgas that even now take place.
Simply put, the federal government should ensure that local stakeholders are involved not just in the consultation process but also in decision-making for any reforms they intend.

• ‘Coalition of the willing’ discuss ways to press Putin to end invasion
• Geneva offers to host talks, grant Putin immunity from ICC warrants
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Tuesday ruled out sending troops, but envisioned extending US air power as Western nations began hashing out security guarantees for Ukraine before any potential summit with Russia.
Trump, in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at ending the war, brought Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and top European leaders to the White House on Monday, three days after his landmark encounter with Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Alaska.
Trump said President Putin, whom he called in the middle of Monday’s talks, had agreed to meet Zelensky and to accept some form of Western security guarantees for Ukraine against Russia – promises met with extreme caution by Kyiv and European leaders.
According to three sources familiar with the Trump call, Putin proposed holding the summit with Zelensky in Moscow. One source said Zelensky immediately said no to the Russian capital.
Trump, long a fierce critic of the billions of dollars in US support to Ukraine since Russia invaded in 2022, said that European nations would take the lead by sending troops to secure any settlement, an idea that has been mulled by France and Britain.
“When it comes to security, they’re willing to put people on the ground,” Trump had said in an interview with Fox News.
“We’re willing to help them with things, especially, probably, if you talk about by air, because no one has the kind of stuff we have. Really, they don’t,” Trump said.
He added his “assurance” that no US ground troops would deploy to Ukraine, and he again categorically ruled out Ukraine joining the Western military alliance NATO.
Trump has sided with Putin in describing Kyiv’s NATO aspirations as a cause for the war, in which tens of thousands of people have died.
European leaders, Ukraine and Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden called the issue a pretext and pointed to Putin’s statements rejecting the historical legitimacy of Ukraine.
Allies discuss next steps
Following the Trump talks, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer brought together around 30 of Ukraine’s allies known as the ‘Coalition of the Willing’ for virtual consultations.
Starmer told them coalition teams and US officials would meet in the coming days to discuss security guarantees and “prepare for the deployment of a reassurance force if the hostilities ended,” a Downing Street spokesperson said.
“The leaders also discussed how further pressure, including through sanctions, could be placed on Putin until he showed he was ready to take serious action to end his illegal invasion.”
Macron, speaking to reporters before leaving Washington, also called for additional sanctions if Putin does not show a willingness for peace.
Britain’s military chief, Admiral Tony Radakin, will travel to Washington on Tuesday for the talks on reassurances.
The military chiefs of staff of all NATO’s 32 member countries will also meet by video Wednesday to discuss Ukraine, officials said.
Geneva offers to host
Russia has warned that any solution must also protect its own interests. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told state television channel Rossiya 24 that any deal must ensure the rights of “Russian-speaking people who live in Ukraine,” another issue cited by Moscow for the offensive launched in February 2022.
Moscow would surely be seen as a provocative location for a summit, with suggestions it would amount to a surrender by Ukraine.
Macron told French news channel LCI he wanted the summit to take place in Geneva, a historic venue for peace talks.
Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said the government would be ready to offer immunity to Putin, who faces an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court related to abuses in the war.
Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz have both said the summit could take place in two weeks.
Trump also is seeking a three-way summit involving him, while Macron has called for a four-way meeting to involve Europeans who will be vital to Ukraine’s security.

Speaking at a workshop organised by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the Pakistan Banks Association in Karachi recently, Mr Aurangzeb said the policy would soon be presented to the federal cabinet for approval. The reasons driving the government to frame an industrial policy framework are understandable: after years of painful macroeconomic adjustments that have seen industrial output shrink, factories close down, jobs lost and growth stagnate, the economy is showing tentative signs of stability.
Inflation has slowed, reserves have risen amid a stable exchange rate and an improved balance-of-payments position, interest rates are down even if they remain elevated and the fiscal deficit is narrowing under austere fiscal policies. Pakistan’s credit rating — though still in the speculative-grade category — has improved, while the bulls continue to lift the stock market. The hard-won economic recovery — even if fragile — has given the government confidence that the economy is poised to transition to the next phase of sustained growth. That is exactly why it wants to accelerate industrialisation and growth through business-friendly incentives.
 
 

Indeed, such strategies are important tools to attract fresh investments in priority industrial sectors. Global experience shows that fiscal, regulatory and other economic incentives and a positive business environment can foster industrial competitiveness, boost factory output and increase exports. Unfortunately, our own experience with previous industrial and export development policies has not been enviable.
We have seen successive governments formulate several ambitious policies, only to see them fail due to poor execution and an unreformed economic ecosystem. These strategies have mostly ended up rewarding inefficiencies in the economy through protectionism, subsidies and regulatory perks. Such ‘quick fixes’ have contributed more to the erosion of our economic competitiveness than to boosting resilience, and have prevented Pakistan from becoming part of global supply chains.
A new industrial policy isolated from complementary frameworks for the development of agriculture and services will not change anything. Besides, no strategy to grow the economy or industrialise the country can deliver results unless long-standing structural impediments like high energy costs and shortages, distortive taxation, low domestic savings, climate change challenges, and other factors are tackled alongside.
Without reforms in the entire ecosystem, even a well-drafted industrial policy will end up gathering dust. In the absence of complementary ecosystem reforms across industry, agriculture and services to create conditions conducive to competition, investment and innovation, even a meticulously prepared industrial policy will be doomed.

• Israeli forces kill at least 45 people in Gaza, Palestinian death toll hits 62,064
• UN says 265 aid workers slain in this year
JERUSALEM: A day after Hamas accepted a fresh proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, and signalled its readiness for a new round of talks aimed at ending nearly two years of war, Israel said it stood firm on its call for the release of all prisoners in any future Gaza ceasefire deal.
Mediators are awaiting an official Israeli response to the plan, with Qatar expressing guarded optimism for the new proposal, noting that it was “almost identical” to an earlier version previously agreed to by Israel.
But a senior Israeli official told AFP the government’s stance had not changed and demanded the release of all prisoners in any deal.
The two foes have held on-and-off indirect negotiations throughout the war, resulting in two short truces during which Israeli hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but they have ultimately failed to broker a lasting ceasefire.
Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States, have mediated the frequent rounds of shuttle diplomacy.
Egypt said Monday that it and Qatar had sent the new proposal to Israel, adding “the ball is now in its court”.
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said on Tuesday that Hamas had given a “very positive response, and it truly was almost identical to what the Israeli side had previously agreed to”.
“We cannot make any claims that a breakthrough has been made. But we do believe it is a positive point,” he added.
Mounting pressure
According to a report in Egyptian state-linked outlet Al-Qahera News, the latest deal proposes an initial 60-day truce, a partial hostage release, the freeing of some Palestinian prisoners and provisions allowing for the entry of aid.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to publicly comment on the plan, but said last week that his country would accept “an agreement in which all the [prisoners] are released at once and according to our conditions for ending the war”.
Senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mardawi said on social media that his group had “opened the door wide to the possibility of reaching an agreement, but the question remains whether Netanyahu will once again close it, as he has done in the past”.
Hamas’s acceptance of the proposal came as Netanyahu faced increasing pressure at home and abroad to end the war.
Over the weekend, tens of thousands took to the streets in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv to call for an end to the war and a deal to free the remaining priosners still held in Gaza.
 
 

The new proposal also comes after Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to conquer Gaza City, fanning fears the new offensive will worsen the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the devastated territory.
45 killed
Meanwhile, at least 45 people were killed by Israeli strikes and fire across the territory, the local civil defence agency reported on Tuesday.
A spokesman said the situation was “very dangerous and unbearable” in the Zeitoun and Sabra neighbourhoods of Gaza City, where he said “artillery shelling continues intermittently”.
The Israeli military declined to comment on specific troop movements, but later claimed that a strike in Khan Yunis overnight targeted a Hamas militant.
Sabra resident Hussein al-Dairi, 44, said “tanks are firing shells and mortars, and drones are firing bullets and missiles” in the neighbourhood.
“We heard on the news that Hamas had agreed to a truce, but the occupation is escalating the war against us, the civilians,” he added.
Israel’s campaign in Gaza has claimed the lives of at least 62,064 Palestinians so far, most of them civilians.
383 aid workers killed
A record 383 aid workers were killed last year, the United Nations said Tuesday, branding the figures and lack of accountability a “shameful indictment” of international apathy, and warning that this year’s toll was equally grim.
The 2024 figure was up 31 per cent on the year before, the UN said on World Humanitarian Day, “driven by the relentless conflicts in Gaza, where 181 humanitarian workers were killed, and in Sudan, where 60 lost their lives”.
It said state actors were the most common perpetrators of the killings last year, and most of the victims were local staff attacked in the line of duty or in their homes.
 
 

Besides those killed, 308 aid workers were wounded, 125 kidnapped and 45 detained.
“Humanitarians must be respected and protected. They can never be targeted,” UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement.
“This rule is non-negotiable and is binding on all parties to conflict, always and everywhere. Yet red lines are crossed with impunity,” he said, calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice.

“On August 20 of this year, Mr Wang Yi, a member of the political bureau of the Chinese ruling party and foreign minister, and Mr Ishaq Dar, deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Pakistan, will travel to Kabul to attend a trilateral meeting,” the Afghanistan foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
The discussions are expected to cover progress on earlier commitments, including counter-terrorism cooperation, extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan, and strengthening regional trade and connectivity.
“The participants of the meeting are expected to exchange views on the future of relations based on common interests, mutual understanding, and broad cooperation,” the ministry said. The gathering, the first of its kind hosted in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul, will bring together Wang, Dar and Afghan Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for a day-long dialogue.

Chinese diplomat to visit Islamabad on Thursday to co-chair high-level moot

Mr Wang will also hold bilateral meetings with senior Taliban leaders on political and economic cooperation. The last round of trilateral talks among the three countries’ foreign ministers was held in Beijing on May 21.
Islamabad visit
Following the Kabul meeting, the Chinese foreign minister is scheduled to travel to Islamabad to attend the Pakistan-China strategic dialogue on Aug 21, Dawn.com reported.
The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang in Beijing.
According to the FO’s statement issued on Tuesday, “On the invitation of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar … Mr Wang Yi is visiting Islamabad for co-chairing the sixth Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue on August 21, 2025.”
“The visit is part of the regular high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China to further deepen their ‘All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership’, reaffirm support on the issues of respective core interests, enhance economic and trade cooperation, and reaffirm their joint commitment to regional peace, development and stability,” the statement added.
Last month, FM Dar met with Wang on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation event, where they discussed and reaffirmed mutual support in core sectors, including agriculture, mining, industry and security.

The final form was notified through SRO1561 of 2025 after a 40-day consultation period, following the draft version’s release for public feedback on July 7 this year.
The new form is currently available only in English, while the Urdu version is still awaited despite earlier government announcements. Weeks of delay in finalising the form had created uncertainty among taxpayers, which was finally resolved with the notification of the final version.
 
 

The interactive return form incorporates an auto-fill system that integrates data on purchases, assets, and tax deductions at source, ultimately generating a single return upon completion. It consists of eight digital windows, each with one input column, designed for a step-by-step process.
For instance, entering an employer’s name in the first window automatically fills in tax deduction details. Withholding tax deductions linked to CNIC numbers will also appear on the form. Similarly, entering bank account details will display closing balances, while registered purchases linked to the filer’s CNIC will auto-populate, minimising manual entry.
The simplified return form is applicable to salaried individuals with additional rental income, as well as small businesses within a prescribed threshold. Taxpayers exceeding this threshold will be redirected to the standard filing process.
Through SRO1562 of 2025, the FBR has also introduced simplified electronic return forms for salaried individuals, associations of persons (AOPs), companies, and business professionals, with the aim of streamlining the filing process and enhancing transparency.
Under the Income Tax Ordinance, taxpayers must begin filing returns soon after the close of the tax year, with September 30 set as the deadline.
SRO1562 also makes it mandatory for owners of immovable properties abroad to file an “Electronic Foreign Income and Assets Declaration for Resident Individuals”. Resident taxpayers must now disclose details of foreign rental properties, business income, overseas  assets, earnings, and bank accounts.
In addition, the FBR has notified separate electronic returns for non-residents with no Pakistan-source income, traders, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and salaried taxpayers.
Final versions of the electronic return for manufacturers, traders, and SMEs have also been issued.

• Other telcos also experience data service disruptions
ISLAMABAD: Heavy rainfall in Karachi caused widespread disruptions to PTCL internet and Ufone services, affecting subscribers across the country.
Since other telecom operators purchase wholesale internet from PTCL, users of Jazz, Zong and Telenor also experienced data service disruptions.
Netblocks, a global internet watchdog, confirmed a major disruption to internet connectivity across Pakistan, with PTCL being significantly impacted. National connectivity dropped to 20 per cent of ordinary levels.
Responding to a query, a PTCL spokesperson acknowledged the issue. “Our teams are diligently working to restore the services as quickly as possible. We regret any inconvenience caused,” the spokesperson said but did not mention the cause for the nationwide outage.
Sources in the Ministry of IT and Telecom suggested that the disruption might be due to a technical fault at the landing station of submarine cables in Karachi’s Clifton area.
“No submarine cable issue has been reported, so the problem is likely at the landing station and some technical fault in the main hub,” and official said. “As a result, it’s a nationwide outage now with upstream traffic facing issues too.”
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said in a statement that technical teams were working to resolve the issue.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima attributed the disruptions to power outages and network congestion, with many towers down in Karachi.
“The other localised issue is temporary choking of the network as too many people were stranded at the same spot and almost everyone was either making calls or receiving them. And now with PTCL going dead, all connectivity has shifted at telephony creating more choking,” Ms Fatima added.
Karachi’s 12 million mobile phone subscribers were affected, with the load shifting to the remaining three telcos after Ufone’s service disruption.
A PTA official noted that running generators for 12 hours was not feasible, and supplying diesel to towers was challenging in the current situation.
He added that more than 200 telecom sites (towers) were damaged in the flood in KP and most of the towers were restored in flood-affected areas of Swat, Buner, Shangla, etc, and the teams were ensuring restoration of remaining sites.
As heavy urban flooding hit Karachi, residents faced telephony disruptions in many areas, losing connections with each other.
Saher, a Gulistan-i-Jauhar resident, expressed concern: “I received one call from my husband, Jamal, saying he was stuck on the street, but his phone isn’t connecting since sunset. I’m really worried.”

• City at a standstill as main thoroughfares closed off; underpasses submerged after storm drains overflow
• Flight operations at Jinnah International Airport disrupted
• Met Office warns of more rains to come as low-pressure area over Indian Gujarat likely to intensify
KARACHI: Unpre­cedented heavy monsoon rains lashed Karachi on Tuesday, claiming at least six lives, flooding neighborhoods, and leaving people frustrated and helpless with the Pakistan Meteorological Depar­tment warning of more showers to come.
The rains severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure,  causing storm water drains and sewers to burst, and bringing life in  the bustling “City of Lights” to a grinding halt. Even upscale neigh­borhoods like Defence Housing Auth­ority and Clifton  were severely affected, with rainwater flooding homes and adding to the  misery of residents.
Shortly after the heavy rains hit the city, power outages swept  across the city, plunging several areas into darkness and compounding  the challenges faced by residents.The domestic and international flight operations at Jinnah International Airport, Karachi were  also affected badly, with the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA)  confirming that several flights were either delayed, cancelled or  diverted to alternative airport due to inclement weather.
By 10pm, the maximum rainfall was recorded in Guls­han-i-Hadeed 170­mm, or 6.69 inches, and the minimum rainfall was 66.2mm in Orangi Town, according to data released by the Met Office.
Due to severity of the situ­ation, the provincial admin­­istration anno­unced a public holiday in Karachi on Wednesday (today).
Anjum Niaz Zaigham, the focal person of the Met department, said that the rain did not broke previous records but “it’s unprecedented  heavy downpour”.
“A low pressure area over Indian Gujarat caused  heavy downpour in Karachi,” he said, adding that the next two days were  very important for the city as another depression from Odissa, India,  would reach Gujarat and was expected to become   more intense on  Wednesday and Thursday and affect Karachi and other southern areas.
Karachi’s major arteries, including Sharea Faisal, M.A. Jinnah Road,  and I.I. Chundrigarh Road, were severely flooded, with hundreds of cars  and motorcycles submerged. Thousands of commuters were stuck in  bumper-to-bumper traffic for hours, one of the worst jams in the city’s  history, with many abandoning their vehicles as fuel ran low, adding to  the chaos.
The worst-affect were the home-returning people,  particularly women, who had to wade through waist-deep water in the  business district of the metropolis. Thousands of them endured an agonizing ordeal, taking over 10 hours to reach home from work due to  the city’s severely congested and flooded roads.
As many as six people died in rain-related incidents. Of them, five were killed in house and wall collapse  incidents while the sixth died from electrocution, officials said.
The severity of the urban flooding in the city was starkly evident as  a high-rise building in Soldier Bazaar was inundated up to its first  floor during the downpour and 80 stranded residents were rescued.
A Rescue-1122 spokesperson told Dawn that  the building was under water up to 1st floor with residents trapped. He  said their rescue teams rushed to the spot after receiving information  at around 5:41pm and rescued the residents.
However, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation claimed in a statement that despite the intensity of the downpour, the “metropolis returned to normalcy following the timely measures and directives issued by Mayor  Barrister Murtaza Wahab”.
PM concerned over situation
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke with Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, expressing concern over the heavy rains in Karachi and other cities.
CM House Spokesman Rasheed Channa said that the chief minister briefed the prime minister on the government’s relief efforts, noting that water drainage work began promptly after the rain subsided.
He said that he chief minister had ordered all relevant agencies to remain on high alert as heavy monsoon rains continue to affect the region.
The chief minister also instructed the traffic police to remain vigilant in low-lying and high-traffic areas, guiding the public during the inclement weather. Both leaders expressed regret over the loss of life and property, with the prime minister assuring the chief minister of federal support during the emergency.
Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tesori also called Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, briefing him on the rain-induced situation in Karachi and requesting federal assistance to alleviate the crisis.

• Villages in flood-hit districts cut off due to landslides; bridges washed away in downpour
• Tarar says 25,000 people rescued in past two days, vows unified response to ‘national emergency’
• ISPR chief says nine units of military, paramilitary actively involved in KP, GB relief efforts
ISLAMABAD: As the government vowed to step up relief efforts in the flood-hit districts, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa continued to reel under the impact of torrential rains with more flash floods reported in several districts of the province.
KP Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) said the death toll since Friday had surged to 365, including 225 in the worst-affected Buner, while more than 180 people sustained injuries over the past several days.
On Tuesday, Upper and Lower South Waziristan districts fared the worst: one woman was killed in Upper South Waziristan. Upper South Waziristan’s Servekai subdivision was the hardest hit, where raging torrents washed away roads and bridges. The Tanga road was blocked due to landslides, while the Spalatoi, Bangashwala, and Madina Mor bridges collapsed due to the heavy flow, severing road links with remote villages.
Likewise, heavy rainfall triggered flash floods in the hill streams of Tank district and surrounding areas, sending powerful torrents into the city and submerging several localities. Offi­cials said a flooded stream coming from South Waziristan reached Tank’s Garah Baloch village and submerged the city. The floodwater rose above the Garah Baloch bridge, forcing the closure of the Tank-Waziristan highway to all types of traffic. The main South Waziristan road was also blocked, disconnecting the road link between the two districts.
The floodwater also entered low-lying neighbourhoods, forcing the residents in the vulnerable areas to move to safer places amid a rise in the water level.
Though the district administration, along with rescue teams and heavy machinery, remained stationed at the Garah Baloch bridge to monitor the situation, the officials feared incessant rainfall could worsen the flooding and pose a greater danger to Tank’s urban and rural settlements.
In Abbottabad, the downpour damaged the Lora Nagri Bridge and cut off access to hundreds of villages. The bridge, a vital connection between Tehsil Lora and Rawalpindi and Abbottabad, partially collapsed, causing a complete halt in traffic. The central structure is reported to be sinking, further threatening its integrity.
Swabi toll surges to 24
In Swabi, the death toll in the Gadoon Amazi area surged to 24, including eight children, as the search for people swept away in flash floods continued on Tuesday. Rahim Jadoon, the Topi mayor, told Dawn that 23 people had been buried. Seven bodies were recovered on Tuesday.
Mr Jadoon, present in the affected area, said that as per the locals, about a dozen people were still buried under the rubble: “Over 12 houses collapsed in Dalori,” he confirmed.
 
 

As the entire village of Dalori and its surroundings were reeling from the shock, the locals could not even mourn their dead. “No one is in a position to hold a traditional three-day mourning period, as more and more bodies are being recovered,” locals said, adding, “We are in a complete state of pain and misery.”
In separate development rescuers have recovered the dead body of man who drowned in the Karnal Sher Khan’s area on Monday.
Rangaiz Khan, provincial minister for transport who was elected from the area, said that the district authorities did not have excavators, forcing the district administration and other departments to hire them from private contractors.
 
 

In Mansehra, rescuers, including volunteers and officials of Tehsil Municipal Administration and Rescue 1122, on Tuesday recovered another body from the flood-hit Haleem Bandi Neelband area of the district.
“A total of 20 men, women and children were swept away in the flood earlier this week, and now 18 bodies have been recovered. The search for the remaining two is still underway,” Mazhar Muzafar Awan, Baffa-Pakhal tehsil municipal officer, told reporters.
‘Unified response’
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the government was dealing with this “national emergency under a national response and all relevant departments, including the armed forces of Pakistan, are working in complete unison in this regard”, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
He was briefing the media persons along with Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and National Disaster Management Author­ity Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik in Islamabad.
The minister said at least 25,000 people affected due to floods caused by torrential rains had been rescued since Aug 17 and moved to safer places, adding that almost 70 per cent of the electricity infrastructure damaged by floods had been restored.
The NDMA chief said bodies of many missing people, trapped under the rubble, had been retrieved, adding that the authority had already dispatched two relief convoys carrying relief goods to Swabi, Malakand and Buner, while another convoy would leave for Shangla.
‘Search and rescue, and flood relief operations’
The ISPR DG, as per Dawn.com, provided a summary of the efforts by the military in the northern areas in the wake of the monsoon rains. He said that KP received eight units of Infantry and Frontier Constabulary (FC), who were directly involved in search and rescue, and flood relief operations, while GB had one, taking the total to nine units.
He also said that one engineer brigade, two engineer battalions and two urban search and rescue teams were deployed in KP, while two engineer battalions were sent to GB, where they were “working on road opening and removing landslides”.
“Three medical units were deployed in KP, while nine medical camps were deployed in GB. More than 6,304 people have been treated.”
“In search and rescue operations, 6,903 people have been rescued,” he added.
Gen Chaudhry also said that one-day rations were allocated, amounting to 585 tonnes, adding that army aviation was deployed to oversee medical casualty evacuation, emergencies, and transportation of food and medicine.
He highlighted that multiple bridges and roads were repaired, while the telecommunication infrastructure in affected areas, including Shangla and Buner, was being repaired alongside the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.
Speaking more specifically about affected regions, the DG ISPR said that the army deployed two battalions in Buner, two battalions in Shangla, one in Swat, one FC wing each in Bajaur and Dir, and one company in Swabi.
“These are dedicated resources … which were deployed 24 hours for flood relief rescue operations,” he said.
While speaking about logistics support, the DG said, “In Peshawar, there were 2,500 ready-to-eat meals and 20 tonnes of rations. In Nowshera, there are 5,000 ready-to-eat meals and 505 tonnes of rations,” he said, adding that they were being transported by road and helicopters.
He also highlighted that 90 roads were damaged in KP. Of those, nine roads were fully operational and 86 were partially restored, he added.
UNDP sends aid
On the other hand, the UNDP Pakistan said it was actively assessing needs on the ground to bridge immediate humanitarian gaps while also laying the groundwork for longer-term recovery and resilience as the crisis unfolds in the wake of floods across the country.
“Our hearts go out to the families who have lost loved ones, homes and livelihoods,” said UNDP Officer-in-Charge Van Nguyen in a statement issued in Islamabad.
UNDP has provided emergency relief items to assist flood-affected families in the hardest-hit regions of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. These supplies include 180 tents, 103 stretchers, 230 sleeping bags, 130 floodlights and 53 first aid kits, among other essentials.
Muqaddam Khan in Swabi, Nisar Ahmed Khan in Manshera, A.K. Wazir in South Waziristan Lower,  Muhammad Irfan Mughal in Dera Ismail Khan and Rashid Javed in Abbottabad  contributed to this report.

US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles requests to stay in the United States or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social media postings of applicants.
“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” age­ncy spok­esman Matthew Trag­e­sser said in a statement.
“Immigration benefits — including to live and work in the United States — remain a privilege, not a right.” The US Immi­gration and Nationality Act, which dates back to 1952, defines anti-Americanism which at the time primarily focused on communists.
But the Trump administration has already moved aggressively to deny or rescind short-term visas for people deemed to go against US foreign policy interests, especially on Israel.
The latest guidance on immigration decisions said that authorities will also look at whether applicants “promote anti-Semitic ideologies.”

“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” said an official announcement quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative, as saying at a high-level meeting.
The meeting was convened to review preparations for the forthcoming session of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) of CPEC, as well as the prime minister’s scheduled visit to Beijing. 
While the JCC is expected to meet in October, official sources said the prime minister will travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO) summit (Aug 31-Sept 1). On the sidelines, he is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. 

Both sides expected to set clear priorities, agree on tangible outcomes for the new phase

The planning minister stressed that the future of CPEC “must be anchored in quality rather than quantity,” emphasising that only carefully selected, high-impact projects should be advanced to ensure sustainability and institutional strengthening.
He also disclosed that during his recent visit to China, he had conveyed PM Shehbaz’s invitation to President Xi to visit Islamabad in 2026 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and China.
Underscoring the need to expand Pakistan’s trade and export footprint in China, the minister directed the authorities concerned to resolve visa processing delays on priority to facilitate genuine businesspersons. He also instructed the preparation of an outcome-focused plan to diversify exports, enhance industrial linkages, and maximise benefits from market access under CPEC.
On human resource development, Mr Iqbal highlighted the importance of utilising the 10,000 training opportunities offered by China across multiple sectors. He stressed the need for a transparent framework to ensure that the right people receive training aligned with institutional needs, enabling Pakistan to secure durable capacity-building gains.
The meeting also reviewed progress in priority areas, including the Multan-Sukkur Motorway, IT graduate training, computational infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI), industrial relocation, industrial parks, mining, special economic zones, and agriculture.
It was decided to conduct data-driven studies on China’s industrial relocation trends and to map market segments where Pakistan has export strengths. 
The minister noted that with China importing goods worth over $2 trillion annually, Pakistan should strategically aim to capture at least $30-50bn of this trade by building competitiveness and sectoral readiness.
He directed completion of an outcome-oriented study to identify high-potential export sectors, with the goal of creating an exportable surplus, attracting sustained investment, and strengthening the balance of payments over the medium term.
Calling for policy continuity and institutional reforms, the minister stressed the need for close engagement with the private sector, academia, and research institutions in areas such as industrial cooperation, technology, agriculture, energy, and human resource development.
According to projections, AI could contribute Rs24.9tr ($88.31bn) to Pakistan’s economy by 2030, raising the projected GDP of Rs171tr by 14.56pc. Agriculture, which makes up 24pc of GDP, could see 20+30pc productivity gains through AI-powered precision farming, while manufacturing and mining (15.1pc of GDP) may achieve 20-25pc improvements via automation.
Similarly, fintech (2pc) and the software industry (1.5pc) are projected to grow 20-30pc, while energy (3.8pc), defence (3.5pc), law & judiciary (1pc), and international collaborations (2pc) also hold 10-20pc growth potential, the minister said.

Last week, National Assembly had passed the amendment to the ATA.
Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Muhammad Tallal Badar moved the Anti-terrorism Amendment Bill 2025 to amend the ATA in the House, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
A copy of the bill, available with Dawn.com read: “The government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case maybe, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this
regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording
reasons thereof, issue order for the preventative detention of any person.”
This amendment was made to sub-section (1) of Section 11EEEE of the ATA.
Any person suspected of activities against national security or safety will be detained, according to the bill, adding that persons involved in target killing, kidnapping for ransom, extortion can be detained for three months.
The bill also added that it applies “against whom sufficient grounds exist of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry”.
The bill available stated that the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
If a detention order is issued by the army or civil forces, the investigation will be conducted by a joint investigation team, according to the bill.
“The inquiry will be conducted by no police officer below the rank of of Superintendent of Police, Intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law enforcing agencies,” the bill added.
JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza moved certain amendments to the bill but the House rejected them with majority of votes, APP added.
The house passed the bill through clause by clause reading.
The statement of objects and reasons of the bill said that the current security situation requires a robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework.
“The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the Act ibid are required to re-inserted to empower the government, Armed Forces and Civil Armed Forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed.
This will also provide law enforcement enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It would facilitate the use of joint interrogation teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.
Earlier, responding to various points raised by lawmakers in the Senate, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said: “Currently the country is facing menace of terrorism and amendments proposed by Syed Naveed Qamar have already been incorporated to make it more effective.”
The bill has also already passed judicial scrutiny tests, he said adding that that a three years sun-set clause has also been added in it.
Tarar said that under Clause 2 of the amendment, the detainee would have presented before the Magistrate within 24 hours.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar of PTI said that they were also against the menace of terrorism and wanted to curb it. However, he continued that “some of its clauses are against the law and constitution so the bill should be referred to the committee”.
Speaking on the occasion, PML-N Senator Irfanul Haque Siddiqui emphasised that no leniency should be shown toward terrorism.
“We do not want terrorists roaming freely while innocent people are slaughtered in different provinces, on passenger trains like the Jaffar Express, or in targeted attacks. These acts weaken our federation and create mistrust between the people and the state,” he observed.
Siddiqui urged lawmakers to view anti-terrorism legislation in its proper spirit as we have lost nearly 100,000 lives to the menace of terrorism. “We must either surrender to militants or legislate to resist them. Such laws can prevent crime and also curb forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions,” he said.
Senator Siddiqui urged all parties to take anti-terrorism legislation in good faith rather than perceiving it as a tool against political opponents.
He said that the government and opposition must ensure transparent communication with the public and media regarding legislative measures, according to APP.
PPP’s Senator Sherry Rehman in her speech said that her party has not passed  the bill without an “extensive review” of all the clauses.
“Our legislative committee noted that it was the same bill all parties had passed through a multi-parties conference after the Army Public School attack. It was in effect for two years,” she noted.
She continued that preventive detention is not a matter to be taken lightly.
“Many of us have personally experienced cases of missing persons.
“I request our law minister to clarify, for the civil society and opposition alike — including in press conferences — the definitions within this law and how they will be applied,” she added.
Section 11EEEE of the ATA was amended in 2014, providing the government and authorised armed forces and civil armed forces with the authority to conduct preventive detention of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities. However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to two years, which expired in 2016.
In November 2024, the government quietly introduced the bill in the NA, seeking to grant military and civil armed forces the authority to keep individuals facing terrorism charges in ‘preventive’ detention for up to three months.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had also expressed concern over the passage.</p><small>2025-08-19 19:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/192215107e27006.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931898/public-holiday-today-as-karachi-declares-emergency-in-the-wake-of-heavy-rain' target='_blank'><strong>Public holiday today as Karachi declares emergency in the wake of heavy rain</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government has declared a public holiday on Wednesday in Karachi following heavy rainfall lashing the metropolis.
 






In a separate notification, the Sindh government’s school department has ordered all private and public educational institutions under its purview in the city to remain closed today due to the heavy rainfall.
With citizens experiencing extended power failures, traffic jams and general mayhem as heavy rain on Tuesday, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab declared a rain emergency amid warnings of more showers to come.
According to the Met Office, as of 8pm Tuesday, Gulshan-i-Hadeed had recorded the highest level of rain at 170 millimetres, followed by Airport Old Area at 158.5mm, Jinnah Terminal 153mm, Nazimabad 149.6mm, Surjani Town 145.2mm, Keamari 140mm, Saadi Town 140.2mm, Defence Housing Authority Phase VII 134mm, University Road 133mm, PAF Base Faisal 128mm, North Karachi 108.4mm, Korangi 132.2mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 98mm, PAF Masroor Base 87mm, Orangi Town 66.2mm and Bahria Town 4.8mm.
It continued to pour intermittently over large parts of the city late into Tuesday night, with prayers the only resort for citizens facing prolonged electricity breakdowns with no end in sight.
According to a notification issued by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), the mayor “cancelled all types of leave, including weekly holidays” for the essential services departments, directing them to remain available.
He also directed the municipal services, the fire brigade and Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) departments of KMC to establish a Rain Emergency Cell in coordination with all essential services departments.
 






On the instructions of the Karachi East Zone’s Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Dr Farrukh Ali, the East Zone police is on high alert to deal with the possible effects of rains, the DIG’s Media Cell said in a statement.
“Clear orders have been issued to all SDPOs (sub-divisional police officers) and SHOs (station house officers) to remain present in their respective areas, ensure drainage, traffic flow and take immediate steps to deal with any emergency,” the statement said.
It added that the DIG had instructed that the protection of life and property of citizens should be ensured at all costs, paying special attention to low-lying areas. Rescue teams and helplines should be kept active, and timely guidance and assistance should be provided to the public.
 
 

The DIG statement also appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary movement during bad weather, advising them to contact 15 or the nearest police station immediately in case of any emergency.
“Police are with the public at all times in all weathers,” it added.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani contacted various town chairmen, municipal committee chairmen and municipal commissioners over the phone to seek details regarding the situation after the rains.
The chairmen of all towns and union councils and the municipal commissioners should immediately use all resources to drain water from the roads on an emergency basis.
“In the first phase, all important highways should be cleared so that the delivery of machinery or other equipment to the affected areas can be ensured,” he said in a statement from his office, adding that small highways and roads should be tackled next.
He urged citizens to limit their movement due to water on the roads to avoid any accidents, and also urged them to stay away from power poles and other electrical installations.
“In some areas, due to the power outage by K-Electric, sewage pumping stations are facing difficulties. As an alternative, these pumping stations are being operated with emergency generators,” he said.
A rain emergency cell was also established at the Governor’s House, with citizens impacted by the rain and traffic directed to immediately reach out for help at 1366.
The cell will remain active around the clock and provide timely aid to victims.
“Citizens will not be left alone in difficult times; all possible facilities will be provided,” Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori was quoted as saying in a statement.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
On Monday, Sindh Minister for Local Government Saeed Ghani had said that arrangements were in place to deal with the upcoming monsoon spell as parts of Karachi received light rain on Monday.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah had chaired an emergency meeting to oversee preparations for the monsoon rains expected to impact Karachi and other parts of the province.
A press release from his office said CM Shah put all the local bodies, administration and traffic police on high alert, and directed them to strengthen coordination between the relevant departments and organisations.</p><small>2025-08-19 19:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19200214dbc0f2a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931859/at-least-7-dead-as-heavy-rain-lashes-karachi-commuters-brave-hours-long-traffic-jams' target='_blank'><strong>At least 7 dead as heavy rain lashes Karachi; commuters brave hours-long traffic jams</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people were killed in rain-related incidents as heavy downpours lashed Karachi on Tuesday, leaving commuters stranded for hours in massive traffic jams as rainwater accumulated rapidly on the main thoroughfares of the megacity.
 


According to the Met Office, as of 8pm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed had recorded the highest level of rainfall at 170 millimetres, followed by Airport Old Area with 158.5mm, Jinnah Terminal 153mm, Nazimabad 149.6mm, Surjani Town 145.2mm, Keamari 140mm, Saadi Town 140.2mm, Defence Housing Authority Phase VII 134mm, University Road 133mm, PAF Base Faisal 128mm, North Karachi 108.4mm, Korangi 132.2mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 98mm, PAF Masroor Base 87mm, Orangi Town 66.2mm and Bahria Town 4.8mm.
Visuals shared widely on social media showed main roads and arteries of the city submerged during rush hour, with traffic gridlocked as a result. Those who had managed to reach work earlier in the day reported reaching home after several long hours navigating the city’s flooded roads.
 


Lives lost
Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that four walls of a house collapsed during heavy rains in Gulistan-i-Jauhar’s Block-12, with five family members buried underneath.
He said the department’s Urban Search and Rescue Team arrived at the spot and retrieved the five from the debris, but three of them had died on the spot. A fourth succumbed to wounds during treatment, while the fifth person was being treated. He said all victims belonged to the same family.
Haseeb said an eight-year old child was also killed when a wall of a house collapsed in Orangi Town near Khalil Market during the downpour. He said a Rescue 1122 team rushed to the spot and recovered the body, which was taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
The spokesperson also shared that a man had died from electrocution in North Karachi, adding that the body was taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
In another incident, Haseeb said a man was burnt to death while two others suffered critical burn wounds when a fire erupted at a petrol pump in Malir. He told Dawn.com that the fire, suspected to be caused by a short circuit, occurred around 3:48pm.
He said three people suffered critical burn wounds and were moved to a hospital, but one of them succumbed to his injuries while the other two were in critical condition.
Haseeb said both petrol pump staff and Malir Senior Superintendent of Police Abdul Khaliq Pirzada told the rescue team that a short circuit triggered the fire.
On high alert
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah directed the district administration, the Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), the health department, and Rescue 1122 to remain on high alert amid the situation.
He ordered the immediate drainage of rainwater and instructed the relevant administrations to remain in contact with the  Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and the PDMA.
“All deputy commissioners should be present in the field with their staff,” the chief secretary said.
 

A Google Maps screenshot at 7:20pm on Tuesday shows traffic blockages at several thoroughfares across the city.

Internet outage adds to chaos
In another development, the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL) said it was currently facing data connectivity challenges on PTCL and Ufone services.
“Our teams are diligently working to restore the services as quickly as possible,” the statement said.
Internet tracking monitor Netblocks also said its metrics showed major disruption to internet connectivity across Pakistan, with high impact to backbone operator PTCL.
“Overall national connectivity is down to 20 per cent of ordinary levels,” it said. The loss of internet connectivity added to the confusion in Karachi, as people struggled to get information about the latest developments on the urban flooding situation and check on loved ones.
Widespread blackouts
In an update posted at 9pm, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana said the company’s power distribution system was stable despite the city facing urban flooding.
“At this time, power supply continues to more than 1,285 out of 2,100 feeders in Karachi. Restoration work is facing severe difficulties due to accumulated rainwater in various areas.
“Restoration work is ongoing in affected areas as soon as accumulated rainwater recedes and safety clearance is received from on-ground teams,” the spokesperson said.
He also provided the names of areas where power was currently being restored and where work had already been completed.
 






Schools closed on Wednesday
Meanwhile, a notification from the Sindh government’s school department ordered all private and public educational institutions under its purview to remain closed tomorrow (Wednesday) due to the rain emergency.
Gloomy forecast
Separately, the Pakistan Meteorological Department, in a weather advisory, forecast intermittent rains to continue throughout the day.
The minimum temperature is expected to remain at 28 degrees Celsius, while the humidity will be 85 per cent.
A weather forecast from the PMD earlier in the day had predicted “torrential rains” in Sindh and parts of Balochistan in the next couple of days.
“Strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are continuously penetrating the country, especially the southern parts,” the PMD said.

The PMD said rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavyfalls) were expected in Balochistan’s Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibbi, Zhob, Qilla Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbella, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar and Panjgur from Aug 19-22 with occasional gaps.
It added that subdued rain-wind/thundershower were expected at isolated places in Islamabad, Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Rawalpindi, Attock, Murree/Galliyat, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Lahore, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Rajanpur, Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan and Swabi from Aug 19-22.

It also cautioned that torrential rains may generate flash floods in north/southeastern parts of Balochistan from Aug 19-22.
It advised all authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation.
A day prior, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah chaired an emergency meeting to oversee preparations for the monsoon rains.
A press release from his office said CM Shah put all the local bodies, administration and traffic police on high alert, and directed them to strengthen coordination between the relevant departments and organisations.</p><small>2025-08-19 19:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/19212242ec5b6dd.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931896/flight-operations-disrupted-as-monsoon-rain-hits-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Flight operations disrupted as monsoon rain hits Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Flight operations were affected at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport on Tuesday as the city received heavy rainfall, according to a statement issued by the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA).
Karachi received heavy rainfall in several areas over the day, triggering power outages throughout the city as the authorities advised citizens to take precautionary measures.
According to a statement issued by PAA spokesperson Saifullah Khan, several flights were affected due to inclement weather during the day.
Affected flights included Pakistan International Airline’s (PIA) PK 304 from Karachi to Lahore, which was scheduled for 2pm but was delayed till 5pm.
PIA’s flights from Karachi to Quetta and Sukkur were also cancelled, whereas the flight to Islamabad was delayed an hour till 5pm.
The national flag carrier also confirmed in a separate statement that its flight operations were affected due to bad weather in Karachi and Islamabad.

“Due to bad weather, strong winds and rain in Islamabad and Karachi, there was a slight change in the movement of PIA flights,” a statement from PIA’s Corporate Communication Division read.
Due to bad weather, flights may be delayed, the statement added, instructing passengers to contact the PIA Call Centre at 111-786-786 for information regarding their flights, the statement added.
International flights were also affected as a FlyDubai flight FZ335 from Dubai to Karachi was diverted to Multan, according to the PAA. The flight later landed in Karachi at 7pm.
FlyJinnah’s flight 9P866 from Peshawar for Karachi was also 2 hours late because of the bad weather in Karachi.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger urban flooding, deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas. The Meteorological Department had predicted rains in the city from this week.
According to a notification from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Mayor Murtaza Wahab has declared a rain emergency in the city.
The notification added that he “cancelled all types of (leave) including weekly holidays”, for the essential services departments, directing them to remain available.
According to the Met Office, as of 8pm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed recorded the highest level of rain at 170 millimetres, followed by Airport Old Area with 158.5mm, Jinnah Terminal 153mm, Nazimabad 149.6mm, Surjani Town 145.2mm, Keamari 140mm, Saadi Town 140.2mm, Defence Housing Authority Phase VII 134mm, University Road 133mm, PAF Base Faisal 128mm, North Karachi 108.4mm, Korangi 132.2mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 98mm, PAF Masroor Base 87mm, Orangi Town 66.2mm and Bahria Town 4.8mm.</p><small>2025-08-19 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619542-sindh-cm-announces-public-holiday-in-karachi-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CM announces public holiday in Karachi tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

Sent in to bat, Markram — opening for the first time in ODIs since 2021 — crunched nine boundaries in his 81-ball knock to power South Africa to a formidable 296-8.
Skipper Temba Bavuma (65) and Matthew Breetzke (57) also helped set the tone for the three-match ODI series.
 






In reply, openers Mitchell Marsh and Travis Head flattened South Africa’s pacemen as Australia raced to 60-0 after seven overs.
But the match flipped after the introduction of spin, with Maharaj conjuring rampant turn, and he picked up four wickets in his first 15 balls.
He finished with career-best figures of 5-33 from 10 overs as Australia were dismissed for 198 in the 41st over.
It was a strong bounce back from South Africa after their 2-1 defeat in the Twenty20 series between the teams.
“I just tried to utilise the conditions and was fortunate to get the rewards,” Maharaj said.
Marsh played a lone hand with 88 off 96 balls in a disappointing batting effort from Australia, transitioning after the recent retirements of veterans Steve Smith and Glenn Maxwell from ODI cricket.
“He’s (Maharaj) an outstanding bowler and there was certainly a little bit more spin than we expected,” said Marsh, who is captaining Australia in this series in place of Pat Cummins.
South Africa had been rocked by the news that quick Kagiso Rabada would miss the series with an ankle injury.
An unruffled Markram appeared to be cruising to his fourth ODI century before he was caught behind off left-arm quick Ben Dwarshuis in the 24th over.
A sluggish Bavuma was overtaken by Breetzke, playing his third ODI.
But South Africa lost three wickets for just seven runs with the fall of Breetzke, Tristan Stubbs (duck) and Dewald Brevis (six), before Bavuma kicked on.
 
 

After a breakout T20 series, ODI debutant Brevis hit a first-ball six — but then holed out to Head, who finished with 4-57.
Head’s excellent match continued with the bat until he was stumped for 27, providing debutant offspinner Prenelan Subrayen with his first ODI wicket.
Making his return since being axed from Australia’s Test team, Marnus Labuschagne (one) fell on his sixth delivery after unsuccessfully reviewing an lbw decision off Maharaj.
Cameron Green (three) and Josh Inglis (five) were clean bowled by a pumped-up Maharaj, who also had Alex Carey lbw for a golden duck.
Maharaj was unable to complete the hat-trick, but claimed his maiden five-wicket haul in ODI cricket when he knocked over Aaron Hardie (four).
The second game will be played in the northern Queensland city of Mackay on Friday.</p><small>2025-08-19 12:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191548516d6e4c4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931887/interior-ministry-reports-200-child-sexual-abuse-cases-since-2022' target='_blank'><strong>Interior ministry reports 200 child sexual abuse cases since 2022</strong></a><br><p>The interior ministry informed the Senate on Tuesday that of the 567 cases of sexual abuse registered in Islamabad between 2021 and June 2025, 200 of them involved children.
The data reported by the interior ministry was presented in a written response to Senator Shahdhat Awan during a Senate session today.

The ministry added that 222 accused parties were arrested, of which only 12 were convicted. 163 remain under trial, while 15 have been acquitted and 26 remain at large.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said in the written statement that “as per reports obtained from all police stations of Islamabad through (the) Zonal Superintendent of Police, during the period from January 1 2021 to 20 June 2025, (a) total 567 cases of rape were registered and 625 accused were arrested”.
“Out of 567 cases, 485 cases were challaned, 80 accused were convicted, 23 accused were acquitted and accused in 406 cases are still facing trial in the competent courts,” he said, adding, “29 cases are under investigation and will be concluded as soon as possible.”
According to the ministry, 266 cases of missing children were also registered in Islamabad from 2022 to 2025. These included 153 boys and 120 girls reported missing.
From these cases, 135 accused were arrested and two sentenced, the ministry said, adding 21 of the accused were acquitted and 103 were awaiting trial.
Separately, a total of 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024, according to a civil society report by Sahil in May based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
In July, police arrested a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Punjab’s Kasur district went viral online.
In June, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) exposed a child sexual exploitation gang operating in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh, leading to the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of ten children.
In January of 2018, police recovered the body of six-year-old Zainab Amin five days after she went missing. A postmortem examination suggested that she may have been raped before she was strangled to death, sparking outrage across the nation.
More than two years after the Zainab case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.</p><small>2025-08-19 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/191312589611a38.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931874/at-least-358-dead-as-kp-reels-from-devastating-floods-rehabilitation-efforts-underway' target='_blank'><strong>At least 358 dead as KP reels from devastating floods; rehabilitation efforts underway</strong></a><br><p>At least 358 people died as a result of heavy flooding and downpour in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the last three days, while rehabilitation efforts are still underway as the province recovers from the record deluge, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said on Tuesday.
Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc across the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
According to the latest data from the KP PDMA, 358 people have died in rain-related incidents since August 15, with Buner reporting the highest toll at 225. Another 181 people were injured, while the dead included 287 men, 41 women and 30 children.
Buner was the worst-hit district in the province, where flash flooding and building collapses left 225 people dead, including 193 men, 23 women and nine children, according to the report. Another 120 people sustained injuries.
Following Buner, Shangla district reported 36 deaths from flash floods, while 22 fatalities were recorded in Mansehra, another 22 in Bajaur, and 20 in Swat, where both flash flooding and infrastructure damage claimed lives.
Flash flooding in the KP’s Swabi district also left 17 dead, according to the PDMA.
Due to separate roof collapse incidents, five people died in Lower Dir, and another two people lost their lives in Noshewra.
Abbotabad, Torghar, and South Waziristan recorded one death each, the report noted.
According to the PDMA data, the total number of houses damaged throughout the province was 780, out of which 349 were completely destroyed and another 431 sustained partial damage. Buner suffered the most damage, leaving 162 houses destroyed.
The number of cattle that perished was 427.

He said the authority had directed district administrations to intensify relief activities and provide immediate assistance to the victims.
“The public is advised to contact PDMA’s helpline at 1700 in case of any emergency or weather update,” Shahzad added.
Relief efforts underway
KP’s Adviser to the Chief Minister, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, in a statement, detailed the relief efforts, saying rescue teams are fully engaged in flood-affected districts.
An amount of Rs3 billion has been released for the ongoing operations, he said, adding that around 6,000 personnel are currently deployed as part of the rescue efforts.
“A total of 5,210 people have been safely evacuated, he added.
Additionally, Barrister Saif said a mobile application has been launched to issue financial compensation to the affected families.
“One hundred and seventy-six (176) rescue centres have been established and at least 100 roads, previously severed due to floods, have now been cleared and restored,” he said.
According to Barrister Saif, five army helicopters and one provincial helicopter were involved in the rescue efforts.
He detailed that the provincial government has delivered 89 trucks of relief items to the flood-hit districts, and more trucks are scheduled to be dispatched today.
He added that 2800 tents, 6100 mattresses, 2700 hygiene kits and 4300 kitchen sets have been distributed in the impacted areas. Additionally, 3100 tarpaulins, 7400 mosquito nets, 6800 blankets, and 500 gas cylinders were distributed.

“Officers above grade 17 have donated their two-day salary, while government employees from grade 1 to 16 have donated one day’s salary to the flood victims.”
Baltistan Highway reopened for traffic
Separately, the flood-ravaged Baltistan Highway was reopened for all kinds of traffic, according to Shahzad Baig, officer of the Gilgit Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA).
He said, “The Baltistan Highway, which was blocked six days ago due to the bridge being washed away following severe flooding in the Istak Nullah, was restored with the joint efforts of the Pakistan Army and GBDMA.”
A large number of mountaineers, tourists and passengers had been stranded due to the week-long closure of the highway, he added.
On Saturday, GB Home Minister Shams Lone [said][1] that the Baltistan Highway bridge had been swept away, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit.
“As soon as the highway was opened, oil tankers and trucks loaded with other necessities of life left for Skardu,” Baig added.
A resident of Skardu, Qasim Butt, said that the closure of the highway caused a shortage of petrol and food items in the four districts, which worried the locals.
“A day before the Istak Nullah, the Baltistan Highway was closed due to the Baghicha RCC bridge being washed away in the flood. However, traffic flow was maintained by creating an alternative route,” he said, adding that the highway was now fully reopened.
22 killed in Balochistan since June 28

The development comes days after India said it will bid for the 2030 Commonwealth Games, seen as part of a wider push by the cricket-mad nation to host the 2036 Olympics.
The presidential assent came on Monday, stated a gazette notification by the central government.
The legislation has been described as a path-breaking reform by Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, PTI reports.
“The following Act of Parliament received the assent of the President on the 18th August, 2025 and is hereby published for general information — The National Sports Governance Act, 2025,” the legislation stated.
The bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of Parliament) on July 23 and passed on August 11. A day later, it was passed by the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of Parliament).
The bill provides for establishing a National Olympic Committee, National Paralympic Committee, and national and regional sports federations for each designated sport.
“The national bodies will have affiliation with respective international bodies.  These bodies will also have affiliate units at state and district levels,” it said.
The Bill empowers the central government to establish a National Sports Board, which will grant recognition to the national sports bodies and register their affiliate units. “Only recognised bodies will be eligible to receive funds from the central government.”
Further, the bill provides for constituting a National Sports Tribunal to adjudicate sports related disputes. However, “it will not have jurisdiction over specified disputes such as those in relation to games organised by international bodies and internal disputes of national sports bodies.”
In addition, a National Sports Election Panel will be set up to oversee NSF polls that are often mired in controversies.
The Act also gives central government the discretionary power to limit India’s international participation in “extraordinary circumstances” and where “national interest” is at stake.</p><small>2025-08-19 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619470-chinese-fm-wang-yi-due-in-islamabad-to-co-chair-strategic-dialogue-on-august-21' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese FM Wang Yi due in Islamabad to co-chair strategic dialogue on August 21</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with
ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang in Beijing.
According to the FO’s statement today, “On the invitation of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar … Mr Wang Yi is visiting Islamabad for co-chairing the sixth Pakistan-China Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue on August 21, 2025.”
“The visit is part of the regular high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China to further deepen their ‘All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership’, reaffirm support on the issues of respective core interests, enhance economic and trade cooperation, and reaffirm their joint commitment to regional peace, development and stability,” the statement added.
 






The development comes during Wang’s ongoing visit to India. During talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Monday, Wang said that China and India should “view each other as partners and opportunities, rather than adversaries or threats”.
He pointed to the resumption of “dialogue at all levels” and “maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas” as evidence that bilateral ties were on a “positive trend of returning to the main path of cooperation”.
Last month, Dar met with Wang on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation event, where the pair discussed and reaffirmed mutual support in core sectors, including agriculture, mining, industry and security.
“China is ready to work with Pakistan to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, and push forward the building of a China-Pakistan community with a shared future,” Wang had said.
In February, President Asif Ali Zardari held a bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing, with the two sides vowing to strengthen the Pakistan-China strategic cooperative partnership.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1913084458ae1df.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931872/indian-police-exhume-human-remains-in-mass-burial-investigation' target='_blank'><strong>Indian police exhume human remains in mass-burial investigation</strong></a><br><p>Indian police have exhumed human remains in a temple town in Karnataka, officials said, as part of an investigation into allegations that hundreds of murder and rape victims were secretly buried there from around the mid-1990s.
The probe centres on Dharmasthala, home to an 800-year-old temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in the state of Karnataka and is drawing headlines in media nationwide.
A former cleaner at the temple told police last month that he had been forced by superiors to dispose of hundreds of bodies over two decades, many of them women and girls showing signs of sexual assault.
His allegations were made in a police complaint dated July 4 and seen by Reuters.
The man, whose identity authorities have withheld for safety reasons, fled Dharmasthala in 2014 but said he was compelled to speak out now because of lingering guilt.
“If the skeletons now exhumed receive respectful funeral rites, those tormented souls will find peace and my sense of guilt could also decrease,” he wrote in the complaint.
The police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the temple said it welcomed a thorough investigation and hoped police would “bring out true facts to light”.
In the complaint, the former cleaner accused temple officials of forcing him to dispose of the bodies and told police he would name the officials if they protected him and his family. Karnataka’s interior minister told the state assembly on Monday that the protection was now in place.
The former cleaner said he had secretly exhumed a skeleton from one of the burial sites to prove his claims.
A special investigation team formed by the Karnataka government has so far recovered human remains from two of 16 suspected burial sites, according to two senior police officials familiar with the probe. They declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Karnatakas interior minister, Gangadharaiah Parameshwara, said the police have collected bone fragments, soil samples, and other material for testing from two sites thanks to the information from the former cleaner.
“The analysis is ongoing. Only once that is complete can we say the investigation has truly begun,” Parameshwara said.
“My request is to not make this a religious matter.” Sachin Deshpande, a lawyer for the complainant, told Reuters “they have found human remains where our client pointed and we are sure that the truth will come out”.
He declined to make his client available for an interview.
The revelations have revived interest in older unsolved cases, including Padmalatha, a college student whose family alleged she was raped and murdered in Dharmasthala in 1986. Padmalatha, like many in India, went by one name.
Her sister, Indravathi, said the family buried Padmalathas body rather than cremating it according to Hindu custom, hoping that would help with any investigations later.
“We hope that we will get justice one day for her abduction, rape and murder,” said Indravathi, who uses only one name.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619466-uproar-over-ceos-rs355m-package-pm-sets-up-high-level-body-to-review-all-soes-working' target='_blank'><strong>Uproar over CEO's Rs355m package: PM sets up high-level body to review all SOEs' working</strong></a><br><p>

According to the statement, the quake was felt in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, KP’s Peshawar, Swat, Chitral, and Abbottabad.
The PMD’s press release said that the earthquake originated at 10:20am PKT. Its epicentre was the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, at a depth of 190 kilometres.
 






Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority reported that the earthquake was also felt in the province’s divisions of Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Lahore, Multan, Sahiwal and Sargodha.
No casualties have been reported so far, and according to KP’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Faizi, an emergency has not yet been declared.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
The Hindu Kush region is recognised as one of the most active seismic zones in the world, lying at the junction of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates where their ongoing collision generates frequent earthquakes, including rare deep-focus events that can reach depths of over 200km, according to the US Geological Survey.
This seismicity is attributed to subduction-related processes and slab break-off beneath the Hindu Kush–Pamir region, making it part of the broader Himalayan seismic belt that has produced several destructive earthquakes across Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northern India.
A 5.1 magnitude earthquake shook Islamabad, Rawalpindi and surrounding regions earlier in the month, swaying buildings and causing panic, but there were no reports of damage or casualties.</p><small>2025-08-19 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1914031673b22d1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931867/babar-rizwan-demoted-as-pcb-announces-central-contracts-for-2025-26-no-players-in-category-a' target='_blank'><strong>Babar, Rizwan demoted as PCB announces central contracts for 2025-26; no players in Category A</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday announced central contracts for 30 male cricketers for the upcoming 2025–26 international season, with no players placed in the top-tier Category A.
Last month, the number of male and female players in the central contract lists rose, according to PCB’s 2025-26 budget documents.
According to a press release by PCB today, the contracts, effective from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2026, “reflect the board’s continued commitment to recognising and supporting national talent.”
This year’s roster sees ten players each placed in Categories B, C, and D, with the PCB acknowledging that “no player has been selected for Category A in this cycle.”
 






Pertinent to mention is that Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan were the only two players in Category A for the 2024-25 season.
The duo have seen their stock fall over the past year; the former batting mainstays having been sidelined from the T20 squad.
“Compared to last year’s list of 27 contracted players, the PCB has expanded the pool to 30, including 12 fresh additions, highlighting the emergence of promising new talent and the board’s strategic focus on squad depth and future development,” PCB said.
 
 

The new entrants are: Ahmed Daniyal, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Ali, Hasan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Sahibzada Farhan, Salman Mirza and Sufyan Moqim.
Five players have been promoted owing to their last year’s performances, PCB said. They are: Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha and Shadab Khan — all promoted from C to B category.
Additionally, nine players have retained their positions in the same categories. They are: Abdullah Shafique (Category C), Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jnr — all in Category D, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan, Saud Shakeel — all in Category C and Shaheen Shah Afridi (Category B).
PCB noted that eight players have missed out on contracts this year, namely Aamir Jamal, Haseebullah, Kamran Ghulam, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Huraira, Muhammad Irfan Khan and Usman Khan — all in Category (D).
List of this year’s centrally contacted players:
Category B (10 players): Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi
Category C (10 players): Abdullah Shafique, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Sahibzada Farhan, Sajid Khan and Saud Shakeel
Category D (10 players): Ahmed Daniyal, Hussain Talat, Khurram Shahzad, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Salman Mirza, Shan Masood and Sufyan Moqim</p><small>2025-08-19 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619455-relief-efforts-ongoing-in-flood-hit-kp-as-pmd-forecasts-more-rains-across-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Relief efforts ongoing in flood-hit KP as PMD forecasts more rains across Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

The world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia, and fought a deadly border clash in 2020.
India is also part of the Quad security alliance with the United States, Australia and Japan, which is seen as a counter to China.
But caught in global trade and geopolitical turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff war, the countries have moved to mend ties.
During talks on Monday with Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, Wang said the two countries should “view each other as partners and opportunities, rather than adversaries or threats”.
He pointed to the resumption of “dialogue at all levels” and “maintenance of peace and tranquillity in border areas” as evidence that bilateral ties were on a “positive trend of returning to the main path of cooperation”.
Wang is also expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his three-day visit.
According to Indian media, Modi might visit China this month, which would be his first trip since 2018.
Relations have improved since October, when Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met for the first time in five years in Russia.
Chinese and Indian officials have said in recent weeks that the two countries were discussing the resumption of border trade, which has been halted since 2020.
Its resumption would be symbolically significant, and follows discussions to resume direct flights and issue tourist visas.</p><small>2025-08-19 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619449-karachi-weather-will-the-port-city-see-more-showers' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi weather: Will the port city see more showers?</strong></a><br><p>
