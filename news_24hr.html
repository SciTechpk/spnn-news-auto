The advance placed the index 2.59 per cent above its previous close of 164,626.29 points.
During trading, a total of 291 scrips advanced, 145 declined, and 131 remained unchanged from their previous close. A total of 355,320,144 shares were traded by market close.
The index touched an intraday low of 162,953.63 and a high of 169,374.27. The range reflected the elevated volatility that has persisted from earlier in the week into today’s trading.
According to Topline Securities, “as the session progressed, the tone changed”. The brokerage house noted that selling pressure eased, and buyers returned with renewed confidence, turning a tentative recovery into a broad-based rally.
The strong close suggested some improvement in investor sentiment. On Wednesday, the index had also staged an early rebound, but ultimately closed in the red, shedding 1,632.25 points, suggesting continued fragility.

During the hearing today, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan expressed displeasure as dozens of lawyers affiliated with PTI stood up and approached the rostrum simultaneously.
“What is this? Are you trying to influence the court?” the IHC chief justice asked.
Imran’s counsel, Barrister Salman Sardar, replied: “Not at all.”
He argued that the matter had assumed greater urgency in view of the former premier’s sudden ailment and eye infection. He further submitted that Bushra Bibi, despite being a woman, was serving a seven-year sentence and that her petition for suspension of sentence had been fixed after six months.
“We request you to suspend the sentence. The last order was passed on November 9,” he contended.
Justice Dogar observed that most of the miscellaneous civil applications seeking early hearing had turned infructuous, but ordered that the office objections on the suspension petitions be overruled.
Barrister Sardar then requested the court to fix the petitions for hearing next week.
However, the chief justice directed the registrar’s office to fix both the petitions seeking suspension and the main criminal appeals on March 11 and adjourned the proceedings.
In a related development, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro removed office objections on the petitions seeking suspension of their sentences in the Toshakhana case pertaining to an expensive Bulgari jewellery set.
The court directed the registrar’s office to number the petitions as well as the appeals against the convictions of Imran and Bushra Bibi and fix them for hearing in accordance with court policy.</p><small>2026-02-26 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26125249b79f264.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975881/concerns-about-imrans-health-echo-across-uk-parliament' target='_blank'><strong>Concerns about Imran’s health echo across UK Parliament</strong></a><br><p>The imprisonment and reported deteriorating health of former prime minister Imran Khan came under sustained scrutiny in the UK Parliament on Tuesday.
Peers across party lines pressed the Labour government to intensify diplomatic engagement with Islamabad and consider linking aid and trade to human rights benchmarks.
The issue was raised during oral questions led by Labour peer Baroness Alexander of Cleveden, who asked about discussions with the government of Pakistan regarding Imran’s incarceration.
Responding on behalf of the Foreign Office, Minister of State Baroness Chapman of Darlington reiterated that while Pakistan’s judicial processes are a matter for its own authorities, the UK had consistently raised concerns over fundamental rights.
“While Pakistan’s judicial processes are, of course, a matter for Pakistan, we are clear that the Pakistani authorities need to respect fundamental freedoms, including the right to a fair trial, due process, humane detention and access to appropriate medical treatment,” she said.
“This applies to Imran Khan as it does to all Pakistani citizens.”







The minister added that UK ministers and officials had “regularly raised” with their Pakistani counterparts the need to uphold Pakistan’s constitution and international human rights obligations, including in relation to Imran.
Family access and medical concerns
Several peers highlighted reports that Imran had been denied access to lawyers, family members and doctors, and was being held in solitary confinement.
Conservative peer Zac Goldsmith — also the former brother-in-law of Imran — described the situation as “an international outrage”, later writing on X that peers had urged the UK foreign minister to “step up”.
During the debate, he said: “We understand that Imran Khan has been denied access to lawyers, denied access to his family, including his two sons, denied access to doctors, and that he has been kept in solitary confinement, with his health deteriorating rapidly.”







Goldsmith asked whether the UK should reconsider its aid contribution to Pakistan, noting that it has often been among the top recipients of British assistance. He suggested that aid should be contingent on Islamabad demonstrating a clear commitment to the Commonwealth Charter, including judicial independence and the rule of law.
In response, Baroness Chapman said the UK maintained a consistent position that all prisoners should have access to healthcare and family visits, and that this message would continue to be conveyed to Islamabad.
On development spending, she noted that the UK had already reduced its aid budget by 40 per cent and that further announcements regarding country allocations would follow shortly.
Comparisons with other cases
The debate also touched on comparisons with other high-profile cases.
The minister drew a distinction between the case of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai and Imran, noting that Lai is a British citizen, giving the UK specific consular responsibilities that do not apply in the same way to foreign nationals.
Labour peer Lord Sikka said there was “very soft criticism” when authoritarian acts were committed by countries regarded as Britain’s trade and defence partners.
Arguing that the government possessed the tools to exert pressure on the country’s military leadership, he suggested ending aid and imposing trade sanctions. He asked what moral principle guided UK foreign policy in such cases, compared to its approach towards states such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea.
In response, Baroness Chapman said it would not be right to end all aid to Pakistan, stressing that such a move was not the government’s position.
She said British assistance addressed genuine need and supported UK interests, including cooperation on climate issues and counter-terrorism, which she described as “absolutely in the interest of our country”.
Crossbench peer Lord Shaffaq Mohammed referred to the case of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was allowed to travel to London for medical treatment in 2019 while serving a sentence in Pakistan.

 

He asked what the government’s response would be if Imran sought permission to travel to the UK for medical care. Baroness Chapman replied that any such request would fall under the jurisdiction of the Home Office and immigration authorities.
Conservative peer Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon asked whether the government could facilitate access for Imran’s sons to visit their father during medical treatment.
The minister said that, in principle, prisoners undergoing medical treatment should have access to family, but decisions relating to immigration and prison access ultimately rested with Pakistani authorities.
Military courts and trade ties
Concerns about Pakistan’s wider democratic trajectory and the role of the military also featured prominently.
Liberal Democrat peer Lord Purvis of Tweed said that several opposition figures had been prosecuted and sentenced following protests, and warned of “significant worry about the extent of state capture of the Pakistani economy by the military”.
He asked whether human rights would be explicitly integrated into the UK-Pakistan trade dialogue.
Baroness Chapman acknowledged “very real concerns” about the operation and transparency of military courts, and said that human rights were integral to the UK’s trading relationships.

 

“It would not be the right thing to do to end all aid to Pakistan,” she said.
“The need is there, British interests are there, and we work with Pakistan on counter-terrorism, which is absolutely in the interest of our country.”



Democracy and elections
The debate concluded with broader reflections on Pakistan’s political future.
Conservative peer Lord Hannan of Kingsclere said no British government could be indifferent to developments in Pakistan, describing it as a Commonwealth ally with 1.5 million Britons of Pakistani origin.
He argued that Pakistan would struggle to achieve stability and attract investment without the restoration of democratic norms.



Baroness Chapman said the UK had raised concerns about Pakistan’s 2024 elections and would continue to engage with Islamabad on inclusive politics and rule of law, while maintaining trade and development ties.
“There are many countries where we have concerns about rule of law and democracy and yet maintain close relationships,” she said, adding that Britain does not limit its foreign relations only to countries that mirror its own governance model.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26131334cb524eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975888/japan-births-fall-for-10th-straight-year' target='_blank'><strong>Japan births fall for 10th straight year</strong></a><br><p>The number of births in Japan fell for the 10th straight year in 2025, official data showed on Thursday, highlighting the challenges for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.
A total of 705,809 babies were born in Japan, the preliminary health ministry data showed, down 2.1 per cent from 2024.
The data includes births to Japanese nationals in Japan, foreign births in Japan and babies born to Japanese nationals overseas.
Meanwhile, 505,656 couples got married in 2025, up 1.1pc, while the number of divorces fell 3.7pc to 182,969 cases.
There were 1,605,654 deaths, down 13,030 or 0.8pc from 2024.
The internal affairs ministry estimated Japan’s overall population as of February at 122.86 million people, down 0.47pc, or 580,000, from a year ago.

 

The world’s fourth-biggest economy has one of the world’s lowest birth rates and a falling and ageing population.
This is leading to a host of problems, including labour shortages, a ballooning social security bill and fewer working people paying tax.
That in turn is adding to Japan’s huge debts. It already has the highest debt ratio among major economies.
Figures last year showed that the number of people aged 100 or older was almost 100,000, with close to 90pc of them women.
The shrinking population is also gutting rural communities. The number of abandoned homes in Japan is now around four million.
Over 40pc of municipalities risk extinction, according to a recent study.
Successive Japanese leaders — including Takaichi, the country’s first woman premier — have promised to increase births but with limited success.
Tokyo’s city government developed its own dating app which requires users to submit documentation proving they are single and to sign a letter stating they are willing to get married.
“The declining birth rate and shrinking population are a quiet state of emergency that will gradually erode our country’s vitality,” Takaichi said in parliament last week.
Takaichi’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won a two-thirds majority in February 8 snap elections.
Increasing immigration would help reverse Japan’s falling population and the associated problems in the labour market.
But under pressure from the “Japanese first” Sanseito party, the right-wing Takaichi has vowed tougher measures on immigration.
The government said on Thursday it is striving to build a stronger economy to reduce the economic burden of childcare for working families.
“I believe there were some successes. Unfortunately, however, we have not managed to reverse this trend (of falling births),” Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Masanao Ozaki told reporters.
“I believe (an important factor) is to achieve a strong economy,” Ozaki said.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/260947020dc3392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975857/local-administration-imposes-section-144-12-hour-daily-curfew-in-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Local administration imposes Section 144, 12-hour daily curfew in South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>The district administration on Thursday imposed Section 144 in the districts of Upper South Waziristan and Lower South Waziristan due to rising security concerns and to facilitate the movement of logistics for security forces.
Officials said the move aims to ensure public safety, maintain law and order, and facilitate the uninterrupted operational movement of security personnel.
Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir confirmed that Section 144 has been enforced in the tehsils of Sarvekai and Sararogha from 6am to 6pm. During this period, all movement will be strictly prohibited, and all markets and commercial centres will remain closed.
The affected routes include Makin, Sararogha, Kot Kai and Spinkai Raghzai up to Nazar Khel. Additionally, the route from Dargai Bridge through Madi Jan, Sheen Warsak and Moley Khan Sarai to Chagmalai will also remain closed.
Officials said in the statement that residents have been instructed to stop their vehicles at least 50 metres before approaching security forces and to ensure that all passengers exit the vehicle if required. The DC emphasised that violators will be held personally accountable and that strict compliance with security directives is mandatory.
Meanwhile, Lower South Waziristan DC Musarat Zaman announced that Section 144 has also been enforced in various parts of Wana. The curfew, effective from 6am to 6pm, prohibits all non-essential movement. The measure comes in response to security threats and the movement of security forces.
Officials said that restricted routes include Wana, Tiarza Gate, Karb Kot, Tanai, and Azizabad Chowk up to Dargai Bridge. Movement is only allowed for emergency purposes with prior permission from police or security forces and submission of valid identification and travel documents.
The deputy commissioner urged citizens to strictly adhere to security instructions and avoid non-essential travel. Any violation will be the sole responsibility of the individual concerned, he said.
During the enforcement of Section 144 in both districts, only approved emergency movement will be permitted.
Citizens were advised to cooperate fully with security forces, remain patient, and avoid any activities that may compromise public safety. Markets, shops, and commercial centres will remain closed to maintain law and order.
Officials stressed that these measures were essential to maintain sustainable peace, support security operations, and ensure the safety of residents.
The South Waziristan region has seen a deteriorating security situation in the past few months, alongside a spike in terrorist activities across the province.
Earlier this month, Mehsud tribal elders and jirga members called on the Upper South Waziristan DC to highlight the lack of basic facilities and raise law and order concerns.
On Nov 10, 2025, the Cadet College in Lower South Waziristan’s Wana had come under attack by terrorists, who the government identified as Afghan nationals.
The attackers had targeted the college’s main gate and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy.
While all students and teachers were safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed, the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653001-fcc-upholds-tax-officials-power-to-raid-premises-without-prior-notice' target='_blank'><strong>FCC upholds tax officials' power to raid premises without prior notice</strong></a><br><p>

Eyewitnesses reported that 10–12 armed men entered the mosque, held worshippers hostage, and abducted three brothers before fleeing to an unknown location.
The abducted individuals were identified as Saeed Akhtar, a clerk at the commissioner’s office, and Amjad and Hazratullah serving in the Wazir subdivision’s police force.
Police officials confirmed that the two abducted police personnel were later brutally killed and their bodies were dumped along Marwat Canal Road, while the third brother remains missing.
Local Chairman Masoom Wazir said he received information about two bodies and, upon reaching the site, found both victims covered in blood. The bodies were immediately taken to the District Headquarters Hospital.
RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan stated that the kidnappers were affiliated with a militant group and that a full-scale operation is underway against them. He vowed that the martyrs’ blood would not be in vain and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice at all costs.
He strongly condemned the terrorists for violating the sanctity of a mosque, describing it as a deeply tragic and reprehensible act.
The RPO added that terrorist elements have previously used mosques as hideouts, but police continue to carry out operations against such groups to ensure the protection of places of worship and the lives and property of citizens.
The senior police official stated that police and other security agencies are jointly conducting search operations at various locations to recover the third abducted individual. He urged the public to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement authorities immediately.
Funeral prayers offered for martyred policemen
Funeral prayers for the two martyred police personnel were offered with full state honours at the Police Lines in Bannu today, bringing the community together in grief and solidarity.
Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan, Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Faheem Khan, senior police and civil administration officials, along with a large number of police personnel and local residents, attended the funeral.

A guard of honour was presented to the martyrs on the occasion, while special prayers were also offered for the elevation of their ranks in honour of their sacrifice. Prayers were further offered for the safe and early recovery of their abducted brother, who remains missing.
Earlier on February 21, during an intelligence‑based operation in the district, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack, prompting targeted operations.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2612242250128c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975884/karachi-atc-frames-charges-against-armaghan-co-accused-sheraz-in-mustafa-amir-murder-case' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi ATC frames charges against Armaghan, co-accused Sheraz in Mustafa Amir murder case</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Thursday framed charges against main suspect Armaghan Qureshi and co-accused Sheraz alias Shavez Bukhari in the Mustafa Amir murder case.
Amir, 23, was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by his friends — Armaghan and Sheraz — in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Jan 6, 2025. According to the police, the accused stuffed Amir’s body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
Both accused denied the charges before the court, which also summoned witnesses and adjourned the hearing until March 12.
A final charge sheet against Armaghan in the murder case was filed in August 2025.

 

In the document, Investigating Officer (IO) Muhammad Ali had said that the last known location of the victim and the two suspects was Armaghan’s house in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The IO stated that blood collected from Armaghan’s house allegedly matched samples taken from the body recovered from the car in Hub.
The report claimed that CCTV footage had been recovered showing the individuals cleaning Mustafa’s bloodstains from a carpet.
In the wake of the murder, three junior police officers, including the Darakhshan station house officer (SHO), were suspended and demoted to lower ranks over their “unprofessional conduct” while probing the kidnapping and murder case.
However, then-Sindh inspector general Ghulam Nabi Memon had defended senior police officials responsible for the investigation, saying they did face certain “handicaps” due to a host of factors during the initial probe.
Last month, a Karachi judicial magistrate granted Armaghan post-arrest bail in a case involving an illegal call centre and credit card data theft.
Other cases
Besides the murder case, Armaghan is facing several other charges.
Armaghan had been implicated in a data theft case in a first information report (FIR) registered with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on April 16, 2025.

 

The case accused Armaghan of operating an “illegal call centre” in Karachi’s DHA, which was used for harassment, fraudulent activities, identity impersonation, cheating, spoofing, phishing, and extortion.
In July 2025, the IO of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed a judicial magistrate that Armaghan had rented two properties to set up call centres in Lahore and Islamabad after Amir’s murder.
Cases had previously been filed against him for injuring policemen during a February 2025 shoot-out that led to his arrest, as well as for the recovery of imported illegal weapons and money laundering.</p><small>2026-02-26 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699f69e4a5b0f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975757/several-coaches-locomotive-of-greenline-express-derail-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Several coaches, locomotive of Greenline Express derail in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: Several coaches and the locomotive of the empty rake of the Greenline Express train derailed a kilometre away from Rawalpindi Railway Station on Wednesday, apparently due to the poor condition of the track as described by railway officials.
The rake was on its way to the Margalla Railway Station in Islamabad to prepare for 6DN journey with passengers to Karachi when the locomotive and several coaches derailed. Except for the locomotive and two passenger coaches, the remaining coaches were put back on track and moved swiftly to Rawalpindi Railway Station from where Greenline Express departed for Karachi with a delay of half an hour.
The waiting passengers at the Margalla Railway Station were moved to Rawalpindi station by buses and coaches by the railway administration of Rawalpindi, for onward journey.
Divisional Superintendent of Pakistan Railways Nooruddin told Dawn that the cause of the derailment was apparently ‘weak track’ on this particular point located close to Bakery Chowk. The weak track of the mainline has raised concern over the poor maintenance of track being used for train and freight services.

DS says cause of derailment was apparently ‘weak track’ located close to Bakery Chowk

The divisional superintendent further said the train service from Peshawar and Hazara to Rawalpindi remained unaffected in view of the dual track. Arrangements have been made to put the locomotive and two coaches back on track, he added.
Greenline Express is among the trains operating in the luxurious category in the Pakistan Railways system.It is a flagship rail of Pakistan Railways and is considered as the country’s most premium train service between Islamabad and Karachi operating on daily basis, offering luxury travel.
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Railways, at a meeting on Wednesday, expressed serious concern over the frequent train accidents reported during the past year.
Committee Chairman Senator Shahadat Awan observed that disciplinary action had largely been confined to train drivers, while no senior officers had been held accountable. He directed the railways ministry to ensure that all responsible officials are proceeded against in accordance with law.
Highlighting security gaps at railway stations and onboard trains, the chairman emphasised the need for comprehensive security arrangements in view of the upcoming festival of Eidul Fitr. The committee also sought an update on new recruitments aimed at strengthening the railway security wing. The chairman directed the DIG Railways to provide periodic briefings to the committee on theft cases and related preventive measures.
Taking note of concerns raised by Senator Rubina Khalid regarding inadequate train services in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the chairman directed the ministry to brief the committee in forthcoming meetings on consultations held with the provinces regarding the upgradation and expansion of the railway network. The ministry briefed the committee on budgetary allocations for new development schemes and apprised members of the projects completed by the ministry.
The committee was informed that the Main Line-1 (ML-1) project extended from Karachi to Peshawar, covering a total length of 1,726km.
Officials stated that approximately 70pc of the country’s population travelled through the ML-1 corridor. It was further informed that the track from Karachi to Lahore is double track, whereas the section from Lahore to Peshawar is single track. The committee was also informed that recent floods have caused significant damage to the railway infrastructure.
Senator Shahadat Awan directed the railways ministry to expedite the disposal of all pending matters of departmental committees on a priority basis and to submit a comprehensive report detailing disposed and pending audit paras.
He further instructed the ministry to furnish, within one month, a complete list of cases related to the National Accountability Bureau and the Federal Investigation Agency. The committee also sought details within three months regarding progress made in the vacation of encroached railway land.

Fortunately, no casualties were reported.
The incident occurred in the Miami Kabul Khel Dorazinda area of the Shewa tehsil. Government High School Shamazan Kot sustained extensive damage, with nearly 80 per cent of its structure reportedly reduced to rubble.
According to local sources, a powerful explosion was heard across the surrounding villages, triggering panic and fear among residents. However, the blast took place at night while the school was closed, ensuring that students and staff remained unharmed.
A senior district administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that an investigation has been launched to determine the exact nature and cause of the explosion. Authorities are collecting evidence from the site to ascertain whether it was a drone strike or another form of attack.
District police and security personnel have cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation. In an official statement, authorities said security around educational institutions would be further tightened, and emergency measures would be taken to rehabilitate and reconstruct the damaged school building.
Local residents expressed deep concern over the incident, particularly as schools across the region were due to reopen on March 1. Parents and students fear the attack may disrupt the fragile return to normalcy in the conflict-affected district.
“Education here is already struggling. If schools themselves are targeted, what future will our children have?” said an elderly tribal elder while speaking to this correspondent.
A parent of one of the students told Dawn that the government must not only ensure the immediate reconstruction of the school, but also establish lasting peace in the area so that children can pursue their education without fear.

 

Educational institutions in North Waziristan and adjoining tribal districts have previously been targeted in various incidents. In some cases, militant elements have blown up school buildings using explosive materials, while in others, structures have reportedly sustained damage during security operations.
Only a few weeks ago, another alleged drone strike in the same area left students and a teacher injured. Investigations into that incident are still underway.
While attacks targeting infrastructure are fairly common in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has also seen a rise in such incidents in recent months.
In May 2024, a private girls’ school in Shewa was also blown up by unidentified militants. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up. No loss of life was reported in the incidents.</p><small>2026-02-26 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652979-jailed-pti-leaders-urge-cjp-to-ensure-justice-is-done-in-imran-khans-medical-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Jailed PTI leaders urge CJP to ensure 'justice is done' in Imran Khan's medical treatment</strong></a><br><p>

The new round of negotiations in Geneva comes after the US carried out a massive military build-up in the region and President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if a deal is not reached.
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”.
He also claimed Tehran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”.
The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”.
The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed. However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000km — less than a third of the distance to the continental US.
The dispute between the countries mostly revolves around Iran’s nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful.

 

However the US has also been pushing to discuss Iran’s ballistic missile programme, as well as Tehran’s support for armed groups hostile towards Israel.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran’s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons “a big, big problem” on the eve of the talks.
He followed up by saying, “the president wants diplomatic solutions”.
Iran has taken anything beyond the nuclear issue off the negotiating table and has demanded that the US sanctions crippling its economy be part of any agreement.
‘Neither war nor peace’
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday he had a “favourable outlook for the negotiations” that could finally “move beyond this ‘neither war nor peace’ situation”.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, has called them “a historic opportunity”, adding that a deal was “within reach”.
In a foreign ministry statement that followed a meeting with his Oman counterpart, Araghchi said the success of the US negotiations depends “on the seriousness of the other side and its avoidance of contradictory behaviour and positions”.
The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka.
The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, which is mediating the negotiations, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
In January, fresh tensions between the US and Iran emerged after Tehran engaged in a bloody crackdown on widespread protests that had posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception.
Trump has threatened several times to intervene to “help” the Iranian people.
Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that “the region seems to expect a war at this point”.
In January, there was “a big push by a number of Middle Eastern states to convince the US not to” strike Iran.
“But there’s a lot of apprehension at this point, because the expectation is that this time, a war would be bigger” than the one in June.
Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict.
Homemaker Tayebeh noted that Trump had “said that war would be very bad for Iran”.
“There would be famine and people would suffer a lot. People are suffering now, but at least with war, our fate might be clear,” the 60-year-old said.</p><small>2026-02-26 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26104329c9fccf8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975875/us-arrests-ex-air-force-pilot-for-training-chinese-military' target='_blank'><strong>US arrests ex-Air Force pilot for training Chinese military</strong></a><br><p>The US Justice Department announced the arrest on Wednesday of a former Air Force fighter pilot who allegedly trained Chinese military personnel without authorisation.
Gerald Brown, 65, was arrested in Indiana after having recently returned to the United States from China, where he had been since December 2023, a Justice Department statement said.
He is accused of having “conspired with foreign nationals to provide combat aircraft training to pilots in the Chinese Air Force” without a required license from the US State Department, the statement said.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel posted on X: “Major story… the FBI and our partners have arrested a former US Air Force Pilot who was allegedly training pilots in the Chinese military.”







Brown had a 24-year career in the US Air Force during which he “commanded sensitive units with responsibility for nuclear weapons delivery systems, led combat missions, and served as a fighter pilot instructor and simulator instructor on a variety of fighter and attack aircraft”.
He had retired from the military in 1996 and worked as a cargo pilot, the statement said, but he later began a role as a US defence contractor training pilots to fly the A-10 and state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets.
He allegedly began negotiating a contract in August 2023 with Stephen Su Bin — a Chinese national who was imprisoned in the United States for four years beginning in 2016 over another espionage scheme — and travelled in December 2023 to China to begin his training job.
“The Chinese government continues to exploit the expertise of current and former members of the US armed forces to modernise China’s military capabilities,” said Roman Rozhavsky, an official with the FBI’s Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.
“This arrest serves as a warning that the FBI and our partners will stop at nothing to hold accountable anyone who collaborates with our adversaries to harm our service members and jeopardise our national security,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-26 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652964-rising-gas-bills-experts-ask-pm-to-end-monopoly' target='_blank'><strong>Rising gas bills: Experts ask PM to end monopoly</strong></a><br><p>

The chief minister briefed the prime minister in detail on the progress of ongoing development initiatives in the province, a Prime Minister’s Office news release said.
The Sindh CM and several other leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) have been demanding that the federal government initiate and complete mega infrastructure development projects in the province especially the much-needed Sukkar-Hyderabad Motorway (SHM), the only missing portion of motorways networks from Karachi to Peshawar and northern areas of the country.
Recently, PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi had expressed concern over what he called deteriorated condition of major roads in Sindh due to negligence of the federal government. 
He also demanded that the Centre immediately start the Sukkur-Hyderabad Moto­rway and long-delayed Jamshoro-Sehwan Indus Highway which was to be completed in 2017.
During the meeting with the Sindh CM, the prime minister said the federal government would extend all possible support to ensure early completion of projects in Sindh. 
He directed the relevant ministries to maintain close coordination with the provincial government to accelerate public welfare initiatives.
The PM said that the PPP was an important ally of the federal government and emphasised that national development could be further accelerated through cooperation among coalition partners.
He noted that harmony and consultation among allied parties were essential for national stability and continuity of policies.
Appreciating Sindh’s leadership as a key partner in the coalition government, the prime minister said strong coordination between the federation and provinces would strengthen the democratic system and help address public issues effectively.
Matters relating to Sindh’s political situation and other issues of mutual interest also came under discussion.
Members of the federal cabinet Ishaq Dar, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Ahsan Iqbal and Rana Sanaullah were also present.
Published in Dawn, February 26th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-26 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2609474047a4848.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975728/treasury-takes-flak-for-luxury-jet-purchase' target='_blank'><strong>Treasury takes flak for luxury jet purchase</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A stormy sitting of the Punjab Assembly saw exchange of heated arguments over the Punjab government’s purchase of a new “luxury” aircraft, arrests of opposition lawmakers and a flurry of legislative reforms tabled in the House.
The controversy over the provincial government’s newly acquired aircraft took centre stage as Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) MPA Shazia Abid questioned whether the Rs11 billion plane would be available for official visits to south Punjab.
Punjab Information Minister Azma Zahid Bukhari defended the purchase, stating that if PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari could use the Sindh government’s aircraft, the Punjab government was equally entitled to use its own plane as it deemed appropriate.
Opposition Leader Moin Riaz Qureshi demanded clarity that which budgetary head funded the aircraft purchase and whether it was bought for “Air Punjab” or exclusively for the chief minister. He termed the acquisition of a “luxury” jet unnecessary amid the economic challenges being faced by the country, triggering desk-thumping and sloganeering by other opposition members.
Government Chief Whip Rana Arshad hit back, asking why the opposition was objecting to the plane when chief ministers of other provinces also use official aircraft.
The House also witnessed sharp protests over the alleged arrest of nine opposition MPAs without the speaker’s permission. Opposition members claimed this violated parliamentary norms.
MPA Sardar Sarfraz Dogar alleged he was unlawfully detained for three days and later booked in a “false FIR,” calling it contempt of the assembly. He insisted that members could not be arrested without the speaker’s approval.
Treasury members responded by accusing the opposition of having double standards, referencing past arrests of political figures, including Maryam Nawaz and her father.
Earlier, responding to questions about the Information and Public Relations Department, Minister Azma Bukhari announced plans to purchase a new building,equipped with modern facilities, to consolidate all departmental offices under one roof.
She also addressed concerns over the Punjab Journalists Housing Foundation (PJHF), confirming that its office would soon be shifted from a rented building to a commercial space in “Press Club Society.”
On staffing reforms, the minister admitted that past recruitment in her department had been made without merit and announced the launch of a “restructuring drive” this year. “Only necessary positions will be retained; redundant seats will be abolished,” she said, adding that performance reviews would be conducted.
LAW AND ORDER: A general debate on law and order was initiated by Parliamentary Secretary Khalid Mahmood Ranjha, who claimed crime rate had declined across Punjab.
He highlighted a significant reduction in rape cases, recovery of illegal weapons and operations against the gangs in Katcha areas.
Opposition members disputed the government’s claims, alleging political victimisation and suppression.
Several legislative measures were also introduced in the House and all referred to relevant committees for two months. These included the Child Marriage Restraint Ordinance 2026; The Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property (Amendment) Ordinance 2026; Punjab Land Revenue (Amendment) Ordinance 2026; The Punjab Public Utilities Infrastructure Protection Ordinance 2026; the Punjab Waqf, Trust and Cooperative Societies (Monitoring) Bill 2026; The Punjab Sales Tax on Services (Amendment) Bill 2026; and The Punjab Infrastructure Development Cess (Amendment) Bill 2026.
The government also tabled amendments to the Punjab Employees Social Security Ordinance 1965 to align it with the revised minimum wage of Rs40,000. The draft noted that while the minimum wage had been raised, the outdated salary cap of Rs22,000 remained in the law, causing legal and administrative complications.
According to the bill’s text, the proposed amendments would validate social security contributions paid since July 2022 and prevent an estimated Rs24 billion loss to the provincial exchequer. The legislation will be enacted as the Punjab Provincial Employees Social Security (Amendment) Act 2026 after committee review and final approval by the governor.

The Sindh government along with the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), finalised the estimate of losses incurred by the shopkeepers of Gul Plaza in their trading goods, with the assistance of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), which put the total sum at Rs7 billion.
The officials involved in the process said that the KCCI, right after the government’s nod for compensation, initiated the process and invited claims from traders regarding their losses. The process, they said, was carried out on a fast track basis and in less than three weeks all the claims were verified and the estimates were finalised.
“The government didn’t interfere and made the traders’ body, the KCCI in charge of verifying all the claims and preparing the final estimates,” Mayor Murtaza Wahab told Dawn. “The registration of traders was done in collaboration with the KCCI to ensure transparency and fairness. The KCCI has done its job.
It verified all claims and cross-checked all the figures. All available documents, bank account details and tax returns were examined and the amount of seven billion rupees was finalised as compensation. The cabinet has approved the amount and we will start paying compensation to the affected traders in the next few days.”

KCCI has estimated compensation amount after cross-checking documents, bank accounts, and tax returns of fire-hit shopkeepers

Zubair Motiwala, prominent industrialist and renowned business leader, who oversaw the process on behalf of the KCCI, lauded the government’s efforts and said the compensation process was completed in record time “with 100 per cent satisfaction of all affected traders”.
“There are more than 900 affected traders with around 1,200 shops,” he said. “Many had more than one shop in Gul Plaza. We set up special counters at the chamber’s building, where we received claims from traders and verified them according to set standards.
The compensation ranged from a few hundred thousand rupees to more than Rs10 million for each trader, depending on their losses. This compensation covers the trading goods that the traders lost in the fire.”
Alternative locations
Regarding an alternative location for the shops, Mr Motiwala said the government had already identified a few locations — including Parking Plaza, New Jamia Market and Royal Market where it plans to build business facilities for the traders so they can restart their businesses.
Apart from the compensation for trading goods, the government had already paid Rs500,000 each to 1,153 affected traders as an initial amount to help bridge the gap during the process, he added.
“Along with this immediate relief, the Sindh government has also offered that if any shopkeeper wishes to take a loan, the government will provide up to Rs10 million as an interest-free loan on easy instalments,” said Mr Motiwala.
Mayor Wahab vowed that apart from compensation, the government had also taken emergency steps to provide immediate relief to the affected shopkeepers and has offered free alternative spaces at different locations across the city to enable them to resume business.
“Around 350 affected shopkeepers of Gul Plaza have been provided temporary stalls at the site of Baradari, Bagh-i-Jinnah (former Polo Ground), in the first phase so that they can resume commercial activities,” he said.
He said parking, basement facilities, security arrangements and deployment of police and wardens had been finalised. He added that the government would stand by the affected traders until complete restoration of their businesses.

Videos verified by this news agency showed a masked group of men, who residents said were Israeli settlers, approaching the village near the city of Hebron, and later burning vehicles and Palestinian property.
“They attack us almost every day, repeatedly, because we live near the main road…Last night they burned everywhere,” Halima Abu Eid, a Susiya resident said on Wednesday.
The Israeli military said they had dispatched soldiers to deal with rep­orts of “deliberate burnings of Pa­l­­e­s­t­inian property” and had ope­n­ed an investigation into the incident.

UN has documented 86 instances of violence from Feb 3 to 16, leading to displacement of 146 Palestinians

Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza in October 2023, with over 800 Palestinians displaced due to settler attacks in 2026 according to United Nations data.
Attacks where masked settlers arrive at night to destroy Palestinian property or attack residents have become common, as Israeli settlers seek to control large swathes of land in the West Bank.
An Israeli official previously blamed settler violence on a “fringe minority”, although reporting has shown well-organised plans to take Palestinian land in public settler social media channels.
The United Nations has documented at least 86 instances of settler violence from February 3 to 16, leading to the displacement of 146 Palestinians and the injury of 64.
Israeli indictments of settler violence are rare. At the end of 2025, Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it had documented since October 7, 2023, only 2pc resulted in indictments.
Israel’s far-right governing coalition has enabled the rapid spread of settlements, with some ministers openly stating they want to “bury” a Palestinian state. Most world powers deem Israel’s settlements, on land it captured in a 1967 war, illegal, and numerous UN Security Council resolutions have called on Israel to halt all settlement activity.
Israel disputes the view that its settlements are unlawful and it cites biblical and historical ties to the land.

The Microsoft co-founder is among the prominent names appearing in documents released by the US Justice Department that revealed close friendships, illicit financial dealings and private photos with convicted sex offender Epstein.
In a town hall on Tuesday with staff at the Gates Foundation, a recording of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Gates expressed regret that his relationship with Epstein had affected the work of his philanthropic organisation.
“It was a huge mistake to spend time with Epstein” and to also bring Gates Foundation executives into meetings with Epstein, he said. “I apologise to other people who are drawn into this because of the mistake that I made.”
In a draft email among the documents released by the Justice Department, Epstein alleged Gates engaged in extramarital affairs, writing that his relationship with Gates ranged from “helping Bill to get drugs, in order to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls, to facilitating his illicit trysts, with married women.”
“I did have affairs, one with a Russian bridge player who met me at bridge events, and one with a Russian nuclear physicist who I met through business activities,” he said.
But he denied any involvement with victims of Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls. “I did nothing illicit. I saw nothing illicit,” Gates told the town hall.
The tech titan said his relationship with Epstein began in 2011, three years after the financier pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution. Gates said he knew of an “18-month thing” restricting Epstein’s travel but didn’t check his background.
He said his then-wife Melinda expressed concerns about Epstein in 2013, but that he continued the relationship for at least another year.
“Knowing what I know now makes it, you know, a hundred times worse in terms of not only his crimes in the past, but now it’s clear there was ongoing bad behavior,” Gates told staff.
The Gates Foundation said Gates addressed the Epstein case and other issues at its scheduled twice-yearly town hall event. “Bill spoke candidly, addressing several questions in detail, and took responsibility for his actions,” it said in a statement.

On his first visit to China as Chancellor, Merz, who was accompanied by a large business delegation, told President Xi Jinping that he wanted to deepen economic ties with China, Germ­any’s largest trading partner last year.
“There are challenges, which we should talk about today, but the framework in which we operate is exceptionally good and we have worked together very well over the past decades,” he said.



Xi welcomed the comments from Merz, who faces a tough balancing act of redefining an economic relationship that is increasingly unfavourable to German interests . “The more turbulent and intertwined the world becomes, the more China and Germany need to strengthen strategic communication and enhance strategic mutual trust,” he said.
China’s trade surplus
Merz’s visit follows his warning this month that the postwar international order underwritten by the US alliance with Europe was no more and that Europe must stand on its own in a world of great power rivalry.
In an earlier meeting with Premier Li Qiang, Merz said there were “very specific concerns regarding our cooperation, which we want to improve and make fair.” Merz’s comments reflect longstanding German concerns about what Berlin sees as an undervalued yuan, market-distorting subsidies and overcapacity among Chinese exporters that have built massive trade surpluses with Europe’s largest economy, amounting to 90 billion euros ($106 billion) last year.
He noted that the deficit had increased fourfold since 2020, and said this was largely due to overcapacity. “This dynamic is not healthy,” he told reporters after the meetings. German business has been deeply concerned by its dependence on strategic commodities from China including rare earths and basic chips after Beijing tightened export controls last year, sending shockwaves through Western manufacturers.
At the same time, Merz’s visit underlined the vital importance of China’s huge consumer market and the technical sophistication of its all-conquering manufacturers.
“We want Chinese investment in Germany,” Merz said at a business event attended by senior German and Chinese business leaders from the tech and auto sectors.
Li told Merz that China wished to cooperate in areas like automobiles and chemicals as well as emerging fields including artificial intelligence and biomedicine.
He also said China was willing to import more high-quality products from Germany and encouraged Chinese companies to invest in Germany, according to a readout from the meeting released by Xinhua news agency.
“China will unswervingly expand high-level opening-up and actively address the reasonable demands of foreign-invested enterprises from Germany and other countries,” he said.
Fair global governance
Merz is accompanied by top executives from 30 German firms including top carmakers such as Volkswagen and BMW which are acutely feeling the strain of Chinese competition — contributing to the growing trade imbalance.
China has been seeking to present itself as a reliable economic partner, as Europe struggles with a new, less certain relationship with Washington and vulnerabilities in its supply chains exposed during a bout of trade turbulence last year.
China’s market, once coveted by foreign businesses for its wide consumer base and rising spending power, has changed in recent years with a slowing economy capping consumer demand and manufacturing overcapacity increasingly pushing domestic firms to look for opportunities abroad.

Police said retired Major General Suresh Sallay was taken into custody at dawn in a suburb of the capital, Colombo.
“He was arrested for conspiracy and aiding and abetting the Easter Sunday attacks,” an investigating officer told AFP. “He has been in touch with people involved in the attacks, even recently.”
The coordinated bombings targeted three upmarket hotels in the capital, two Roman Catholic churches and an evangelical Protestant church outside Colombo.
The attacks killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners, and were blamed on a homegrown jihadist group.
Police, in a statement, said that Sallay was arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and would be detained for at least three days for questioning.
His arrest was welcomed by the Catholic church, and criticised by his still powerful supporters.
“What we need is the truth behind the Easter attacks,” church spokesman Father Cyril Gamini Fernando told AFP.
‘We want to see justice for all the victims.”
The church has accused successive governments of failing to identify the masterminds.
The April 21, 2019 attacks were the worst to target civilians in the country, where at least 100,000 people were killed in nearly four decades of civil war.
Sallay, who was promoted to State Intelligence Service (SIS) chief in 2019 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president, is accused of involvement in organising the suicide bombings, a charge he denies.
His long-expected arrest came ahead of the seventh anniversary of the bombings.
British broadcaster Channel 4 reported in 2023 that Sallay was linked to the bombers and had met them prior to the attack. A whistleblower told the network that Sallay had permitted the attack to proceed with the intention of influencing that year’s presidential election in favour of Rajapaksa.
Two days after the bombings, Rajapaksa declared his candidacy and went on to win the November vote in a landslide after promising to stamp out extremism.

• NPR report says key records were catalogued but never released; include over 50 pages of FBI interviews with a female victim• Democrat calls withholding of files ‘illegal’; launches probe against Justice Department• Dept says unreleased materials are privileged or part of ongoing investigation
THE US Department of Jus­tice has withheld Epstein files containing allegations that US President Donald Trump sexually abused a minor and also removed other related docume­nts from a public database, according to a report by the US National Public Radio (NPR).
According to the report, dozens of pages catalogued by the DOJ, including what appear to be over 50 pages of FBI interviews and notes with a woman who accused Trump of sexually abusing her as a minor decades ago, have not been made public as mandated by law.
The DOJ declined to answer NPR’s specific questions on the record but said that any unpublished documents are privileged, are duplicates or pertain to an ongoing federal investigation.
Following the report, the top Democrat on the House Over­sight Committee said his staff had confirmed the discrepancy.

 

“Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor who accused President Trump of heinous crimes,” Rep. Rob­ert Garcia said in a statement. Garcia announced a parallel investigation into the DOJ’s handling of the documents.
When asked for comment, a White House spokeswoman told NPR that Trump has been “totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein” and has “done more for Epstein’s victims than anyone before him” by releasing documents and cooperating with Congress.
One allegation detailed in internal FBI documents involves a woman who claimed that when she was about 13, around 1983, Epstein introduced her to Trump. She alleged that Trump assaulted her, and when she resisted, he struck her and threw her out, according to the report.
While this specific claim appears in an internal FBI list and a slideshow, NPR found that associated FBI interviews with the accuser appear to be missing from the public files. A review of case logs from the criminal trial of Epstein’s associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, indicates the FBI interviewed this woman four times.
However, only the first interview, which does not name Trump, is in the public database. In that interview, the woman’s attorney said a photo of Epstein she provided was cropped because she feared “implicating additional individuals, and specifically any that were well known, due to fear of retaliation.” FBI agents noted the picture was a “widely distributed photograph” of Epstein with Trump.
Other missing files relate to a key witness in the trial that led to Maxwell’s 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. That woman told the FBI she met Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club as a minor while being abused by Epstein. She recounted Epstein telling Tru­mp, “This is a good one, huh,” to which both men chuckled.
NPR reported that the FBI in­­terview detailing this acco­unt was temporarily removed from the public database before being restored, while an interview with the woman’s mother that also mentions Trump remains offline.
Robert Glassman, an attorney for the witness who testified against Maxwell, criticised the department’s handling of the document release.
“The DOJ was ordered to release information to the public to be transparent about Epstein and Maxwell’s criminal enterprise network. Instead, they relea­sed the names of courageous victims who have fought hard for decades to remain anonymous and out of the limelight.”
A DOJ spokesperson told NPR the department is working to ad­­dress redaction concerns from victims, noting that due to the large volume of information, sensitive or personally identifiable information may have been inadvertently included.

“It was a race against time. Sifting through technical data, establishing coordinates and isolating the target,” a senior security official said. “It didn’t take long before we knew the location.”
By late evening, they had already laid siege to the residence, taken up position and called out those inside to come out, hands raised, and surrender.
For a moment, there was no movement. But then, someone showed a raised hand from behind the door, indicating their willingness to surrender. Except that he didn’t.
Aiming a 9mm gun straight at the security cordon, the lone gunman fired straight shots, hitting an assistant sub inspector of the police right in the chest, killing him on the spot, and injuring two intelligence officers.
The exchange of fire didn’t last long, though.
Within minutes, the gunman, said to be in his mid-thirties, was shot and killed. But the brief distraction offered by the gun battle gave those inside the house sufficient time to destroy cellphones and any other evidence of communication that could possibly betray them.
The gunman turned out to be a high-value target — identified as Yousaf alias Qasim aka Idrees — the leader of the militant Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group in the Bajaur region, and the main handler of the Imambargah suicide bomber, carrying a reward of Rs12 million.
What followed was more startling, as the counter-terrorism department dug further into this cell’s activities. The gang, it turned out, had been involved in a series of assassinations and suicide bombings before stepping out of the tribal district to relocate to Gujranwala, Lahore and finally to Nowshera’s Hakimabad.
Investigators now have enough evidence to link them to the targeted assassination of all 20 men involved in the lynching to death of an IS-K operative, out to kill a local JUI-F leader for issuing a scathing attack against it.
They were also linked to the assassination of senior JUI-F figure Mufti Sultan Mahmood in Bajaur in October 2019, a suicide bombing at the party’s convention on July 30, 2021 that left more than 54 dead and over a hundred wounded, and the bombing and assassination of ANP leader Maulana Khanzeb on July 10, 2025.
Additionally, investigators say, the group was involved in the killings of at least 15 policemen, as well as the murder of the Nawagai assistant commissioner in a bombing on July 2, 2025.
Investigators say that Idrees — a tailor by profession — had been on their radar for some time, but had managed to evade capture by changing locations, moving with women and children, and avoiding staying at one location for longer periods.
“Pretty much living like nomads, leaving whatever little they had behind before moving onto the next location without notifying the landlord,” was how one official described his movements.
What surprised investigators the most was the role of the women in the group. Investigators have now established that not only did the suicide bomber travel to Afghanistan’s Kunar in May 2025, the women had also crossed the border using tampered passports.

 

Not only that, but one of the women had carried the suicide vest from Bajaur to Islamabad, and handed it over to another woman in the group. “They are all indoctrinated. The whole family is radicalised,” a senior investigator said.
As investigators dig deeper into the working and operations of IS-Khorasan, there is a realisation that its network is far bigger and more spread out than previously thought — from the Middle East to Central Asian Republics, and onwards into Afghanistan and Pakistan.
They use cryptocurrency for money transfer and employ encrypted communication apps, making their communications very hard to break.
Based on what they have learned, investigators now consider IS-Khorasan a much bigger threat than the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan in terms of its capability for mass killing, compartmentalisation, commitment to ideology, resources and the sophistication of their operations.
Published in Dawn, February 26th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-26 02:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26072752155885c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975815/auto-assemblers-warn-of-market-distortion-after-reev-duty-decision' target='_blank'><strong>Auto assemblers warn of market distortion after REEV duty decision</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A recent ruling by the Customs Classification Committee classifying range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs) as battery electric vehicles (BEVs) has triggered concerns among local auto assemblers, who argue that the decision overlooks key market realities and will lead to distortion.
The committee classified REEVs, essentially series hybrids, under HS Code 8703.8090, the same category as BEVs, on the basis that propulsion is provided solely by an electric motor, with the onboard internal combustion engine (ICE) functioning as a generator.
However, the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) has termed the matter a case of misdeclaration under the Customs Act, 1969, and raised the issue with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
It noted that the importer declared the vehicle under HS Code 8703.8090, attracting a 25 per cent duty under the Fifth Schedule, whereas the exporter at the port of origin in China declared it under HS Code 8703.6023, which carries a 50pc duty.

Seek review of HS code for range-extended electric vehicles

According to PAMA, HS 8703.8090 applies to pure electric vehicles, while 8703.6023 covers hybrid vehicles.
The association argues that a vehicle equipped with an internal combustion engine, even if used as a generator, cannot be considered a pure electric vehicle and therefore should not qualify for incentives intended for zero-emission vehicles.
PAMA further said the inclusion of an ICE potentially contravenes the National Electric Vehicle Policy, which restricts incentives to all-battery vehicles operating solely on onboard battery charge without any combustion engine.
The association maintained that the dispute involves both classification and fiscal benefits. It argued that if there was no difference in duty, the classification under either of the two mentioned HS codes would be irrelevant.
The customs ruling relied heavily on the source of propulsion. However, industry representatives contend that the presence of an ICE generator — reportedly constituting at least 15pc of the vehicle’s value — makes the product distinct from a customary electric vehicle.
PAMA has called for the ruling to be suspended and reviewed to ensure that fiscal concessions are limited to genuine zero-emission vehicles and that market distortions are avoided.
An assembler pointed out that REEVs typically feature a 45-litre fuel tank, emission levels and fuel efficiency comparable to hybrids when not externally charged. He also noted that exporting countries and UNECE regulations classify REEVs as hybrids.
While the Customs Classification Committee stated that its ruling was confined to tariff classification — and acknowledged that the World Customs Organisation is expected to assign a separate HS code for REEVs by 2028 — the decision to extend BEV-level fiscal incentives rests with the federal government and cabinet.
Currently, completely built-up (CBU) BEVs below 50kWh attract 25pc customs duty and 12.5pc GST, while completely knocked-down (CKD) BEVs benefit from one per cent duty on specific parts, 10pc CKD duty, 25pc duty on its localised parts, one per cent GST and zero federal excise duty — incentives aimed at promoting zero-emission vehicles without combustion engines.
The assembler said industry representatives have warned that extending these same concessions to REEVs could significantly distort the market, trigger a surge in low-duty REEV CBU imports at a fraction of duty, and undermine the economic viability of CKD operations across ICE, HEV, PHEV and BEV segments.
He said this classification issue has emerged at a time when the Auto Policy 2026-31 is being discussed with respect to future tariff structures, sales tax treatment and concessions for hybrid, plug-in hybrid, REEV and battery electric vehicles.
He said automakers are awaiting clarity from the Engineering Development Board (EDB) and the Ministry of Industries and Production, especially as the upcoming policy will require alignment with IMF commitments, federal cabinet approval and consensus among key stakeholders.

The protesters blocked the Karakoram Highway at several points in Gilgit, calling for action against the culprits. The demonstrators dispersed peacefully after the authorities assured them that steps would be taken to arrest the individuals responsible for offending religious sensibilities.
The arrests came during a crackdown against “elements spreading communal hatred and blasphemous material” on social media, according to a police statement.
“Police took action und­er a zero-tolerance policy against elements offending religious sentiments or undermining harmony through social media,” the statement said.
Police did not name the four arrested individuals. The authorities have requested the public to cooperate with police in identifying such elements.
According to a separate statement, police arrested a resident of Gil­git’s Naumal area on a charge of sharing “derogatory content” on social media. A case was registered against him under sections 298 and 153 of the PPC and also under the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Caretaker home minister Sajid Ali Baig said at a press conference that the government would carry out a thorough investigation to nab the people involved in stoking disharmony and “exemplary punishment” would be given to them.

Modi also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a two-day visit aimed at deepening trade and defence ties that has drawn criticism at home.
“I … carry with me the deepest condolences of the people of India for every life lost and for every family whose world was shattered in the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7,” Modi said in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament.
“We feel your pain, we share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly with full conviction in this moment and beyond.”
In his speech, Modi did not explicitly mention the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza during the more than two-year-long Israeli onslaught.

 

But he said that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.
Modi also told Israeli lawmakers that his country’s economic growth and Israel’s leadership in technological innovation formed a “natural foundation for our forward-looking partnership”.
“I see a lot of synergies in areas such as quantum technologies, semiconductors and artificial intelligence,” he added.
It is Modi’s second visit to Israel as prime minister since he took office in 2014.
‘A real friendship’
Earlier on Wednesday, a red carpet was rolled out at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport and Modi was greeted with a hug by Netanyahu as he disembarked the plane.
“The two leaders share a special and a personal relationship,” Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for Netanyahu’s office, said in a video posted on X.
“The bond between Israel and India is a powerful alliance as we are partners in innovation, security and a shared strategic vision,” she added.







Netanyahu’s office said the two right-wing leaders held a private meeting after the welcoming ceremony, with the Israeli premier hailing “a real friendship”.
In a post on X, Modi described the meeting as “excellent”.
“We discussed a wide range of topics aimed at deepening and strengthening the bilateral relations between our two countries,” he said.
The pair “held an in-depth conversation about major developments in the region”, he added.







Modi is also scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog during the visit.
New Delhi has steadily expanded cooperation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cybersecurity sectors, while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East.
Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that merchandise trade reached $3.62 billion in 2024-2025.
Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014.
Criticism at home
Modi first visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year.
In 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor — to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel.
Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which responded with a devastating onslaught on the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians.
Months after his 2017 visit to Israel, Modi travelled to Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority.
His current visit has sparked criticism at home.
Senior Congress party figure Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — posted on social media on Wednesday that she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” during his address to the Israeli parliament.







Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh said Modi will be displaying “moral cowardice” when the entire world is critical of his “dear friend” Netanyahu.
He said Modi was “brazenly embracing” his Israeli counterpart, who has “reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank”.
“On May 20, 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there,” Ramesh recalled.







Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “hexagon of alliances” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations.
India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people, is majority Hindu, but an estimated 220 million Indians are Muslim.

Sri Lanka needed an emphatic win to stay alive but instead exited with a whimper, limping to 107-8 chasing New Zealand’s 168-7.
A win for New Zealand against England on Friday at the same R. Premadasa stadium would see them top the Super Eights group and qualify for the semi-finals along with Harry Brook’s side.
A defeat would open the door for Pakistan, who would probably need a big win against Sri Lanka in Kandy on Saturday to sneak through on net run rate.
Sri Lanka were never in the chase as Matt Henry dismissed their leading batsman Pathum Nissanka with the first ball of the innings.
Henry also removed Chairth Asalanka with the first ball of his second over to leave Sri Lanka in trouble at 6-2.
Sri Lanka crawled to 20-2 at the end of the six-over power play, the lowest in the competition and Sri Lanka’s second lowest ever in T20 internationals.
Part-time spinner Rachin Ravindra found a turn to put the game beyond Sri Lanka with a career-best 4-27.
Ravindra had a charging Kusal Mendis stumped and then removed Pavan Rathnayake in a similar fashion in the same over as the sellout crowd was stunned into silence.
“It is very embarrassing to disappoint the home crowd,” said Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka.
“We started really well, but to be honest, the Santner-McConchie and that partnership, it was a good one, which took the game away from us.” New Zealand earlier recovered from a mini-collapse to reach 168-7.
“I think it was obviously a nice score there with the amount of spin on the ball. They squeezed us a lot,” said New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner.
Sri Lanka were right in the game as New Zealand slumped from 84-3 to 84-6 in the space of six deliveries.
But an 84-run stand off just 47 deliveries for the seventh wicket between Cole McConchie and Santner enabled them to set a tricky target on a turning pitch.
Skipper Santner top-scored with 47 off 26 balls with two fours and four sixes.
McConchie, recalled to the side, posted an unbeaten 31 off 23 balls.
New Zealand were struggling to read Maheesh Theekshana as the spinner claimed 3-9 in his first three overs.
New Zealand blasted 70 off the last four overs, including 21 off the final one from Theekshana.

Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omer Sarfraz Cheema made the appeal in a joint handwritten open letter, which was shared by their counsel Rana Mudassar on Wednesday.
They also drew a comparison between the events surrounding the jailed ex-prime minister’s treatment today and that of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif in 2019.
Nawaz, who was serving a prison sentence granted by an accountability court that found him guilty of corruption in the Al Azizia case in 2019, had been allowed to travel to London for treatment after he was diagnosed with an immune system disorder. Prior to that, he was also provided treatment at the hospital in Pakistan.
The five PTI leaders said in their letter that in 2019, “when Nawaz Sharif was shifted to Services Hospital, Lahore for low platelet count, we as the sitting government ensured that he should get proper treatment for his ailment”.
“His personal physician Dr Adnan was part of all meetings conducted by the medical board. We even personally asked Mian Nawaz Sharif whether he was satisfied with his treatment,” the leaders said.
They added that Nawaz was also asked whether he wanted to be treated by a physician of his choice and assured that the relevant doctor would be called.
“His family and legal counsel had free access to him,” the letter further stated. “We are sure that if you ask Mian Nawaz Sharif personally, he will not refute our claims,” it added.
The leaders recalled that Nawaz was also permitted to go to England for treatment.
Comparing those events with the situation today, the five leaders said that Imran, a former premier, has “faced obstructions of all forms in his treatment”.
They accused the incumbent government of carrying out a “cloak and dagger activity”, saying: “First, the present government did not accept that he was unwell and then when the news was leaked from Pims about his central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), the government blustered around with all sorts of obnoxious statements. His consultants’ rights were trampled […] and his family was not granted access [to him]; his lawyer and personal physicians could not meet him.”
The jailed leaders said that Imran was taken to the hospital for the administration of a second injection on Tuesday, “but his family was not informed.“
Only PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan “received a message at 2am that he had been given his second injection”.
“The government should be ashamed of itself. This callous attitude will never improve the situation. We, however, think this Form-47 government does not want any political stability as they know that they never won the [2024] elections, and they do not want to lose their chairs (positions) as they have no chance of winning again,” the leaders maintained.
The health condition of Imran, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
The concerns have been heightened with restrictions in place on meetings with Imran at the jail.
However, earlier this month, a two-member Supreme Court bench led by CJP Afridi had allowed Imran’s lawyer Salman Safdar to meet him, declaring him amicus curiae.
After the meeting, Safdar had submitted a report to the SC, which said “only 15 per cent” vision was left in Imran’s right eye.
Government, however, has been issuing statements to allay these concerns, with the law minister stating at one instance that “if he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6”.
Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations.
Today, the PTI approached the Supreme Court seeking the medical treatment of jailed party founder at a hospital of his choice, along with access to his personal physicians.</p><small>2026-02-25 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652900-imran-khan-can-be-shifted-to-hospital-if-court-orders-says-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan to be shifted to hospital if court orders, says Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that over the last few days, security forces had conducted a series of “high tempo, intelligence-driven operations” aimed at eliminating Indian proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
The statement said that on Feb 24, 26 terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in four separate engagements in KP, while eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were killed in an operation in Balochistan’s Sambaza.
Giving a breakdown, ISPR said that the movement of a group of terrorists trying to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border was picked up by security forces in KP’s North Waziristan. It said troops engaged the terrorists, killing one in the process.
