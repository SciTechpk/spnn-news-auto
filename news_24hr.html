Reporters Without Borders in its 2025 World Press Freedom Index painted a bleak picture for media freedom, with economic pressure emerging as the leading threat to press freedom across the globe. In a statement, the media watchdog said their results had warned of a worldwide decline in press freedom over the past ten years, but the 2025 report was a new low for the media.
“In 2025, a new low point emerged: the average score of all assessed countries fell below 55 points, falling into the category of a ‘difficult situation’,” said the report, adding that more than six out of ten countries (112 in total) saw their overall scores decline in the index.

Reporters Without Borders reports ‘new low’ for media as average score of all countries falls below 55; freedom ‘entirely absent’ in Pakistan

“For the first time in the history of the index, the conditions for practising journalism are poor in half of the world’s countries and satisfactory in fewer than one in four,” it said. According to the listicle shared by the RSF, 42 countries have ‘good’ or ‘satisfactory’ ratings in the index but almost 138 countries have been categorised in problematic, difficult, and very serious situation, in terms of press freedom. Pakistan (158th rank) is in the ‘very serious situation’ category alongside India, China, Afghanistan, and Iran.
The same is the case in Palestine (163rd), where the Israeli army has been annihilating journalism for over 18 months, killing nearly 200 media professionals — including at least 43 murdered while working — and imposing a blackout on the besieged strip. Israel (112th) also continued its decline.
Financial constraints
The report said the financial condition of journalism and economic pressure on the industry dragged down the world’s overall score in 2025, adding that in nearly a third of countries, media outlets were shutting down due to economic hardships, with the US leading the trend.
It said 160 states out of 180 assessed by the RSF achieved financial stability “with difficulty” or “not at all”, adding that 34 countries, including Iran, Azerbaijan, and Afghanistan, stood out for the mass closures of their media outlets, leading to the exile of journalists in recent years.
Another threat to media freedom pointed out by the RSF is the media concentration and dominance of online platforms, such as Meta, Google, and Amazon. “…serious funding cuts are an additional blow to a media economy already weakened by the dominance that tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have over the dissemination of information. These largely unregulated platforms are absorbing an ever-growing share of advertising revenues that would usually support journalism,” the report said, adding that the total spending on advertising through social media reached $247.3 billion in 2024, a 14 per cent increase compared to 2023.
In addition to the loss of advertising revenue, which has severely disrupted and constrained the media economy, media ownership concentration is another key factor in the deterioration of the Index’s economic indicator and poses a serious threat to media plurality.

The growing trade deficit raises concerns among decision-makers, mainly due to the rising influx of petroleum products. Meanwhile, export growth to select countries in the region remains minimal, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
Petroleum consumption has risen in the current fiscal year because the crude oil import rose 14.61pc in quantity in the first eight months of the FY25 from a year ago.
In FY24, the imbalance with the Middle East narrowed by 20.47pc to $13.014bn from $16.365bn over the preceding year, mainly due to lower petroleum imports amid falling consumption owing to rising local prices.
Exports to the Middle East rose 4.47pc to $2.381bn in July-March from $2.279bn over the same period last year. In FY24, the exports to the region grew 35.23pc to $3.155bn compared to $2.33bn in the preceding year.
At the same time, Pakistan’s imports from the Middle East grew 9.02pc to $12.883bn in 9MFY25 from $11.817bn over the same period last year. In FY24, the imports declined 13.53pc to $16.16bn compared to $18.69bn in the same period the preceding year.
Pakistan has recently signed a free trade agreement with the Gulf Coope­ration Council states to minimise its trade imbalance with the region. The demand for Pakistani products surged in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar during the period under review.
Exports to Saudi Arabia rose 6.95pc to $552.26m in July-March from $516.34m over the same period last year. In FY24, exports to Saudi Arabia rose 40.98pc to $710.335m from $503.851m in FY23. The imports from the kingdom saw a decline of 15.15pc to $2.828bn against $3.333bn in the same period last year.
In FY24, imports from Saudi Arabia declined by 0.01pc to $4.49bn against $4.50bn in the preceding year.
Exports to UAE increased 8.27pc to $1.610bn in July-March from $1.487bn over the last year. In FY24, exports to the UAE surged 41.15pc to $2.082bn from $1.475bn in FY23, primarily due to a significant rise in exports to Dubai.

The report titled Intimid­ation on All Fronts: Press Freedom and Media Safety in Pakistan, released on the occasion of the World Press Freedom Day 2025 falling on May 3 (Saturday), says the year began with the passage of the much-opposed Pakistan Electronic Crimes Amendment Act, 2025, in January which heightened concerns about legal consequences journalists may face for their reporting, particularly online.
In addition to these, punitive measures including restrictions on advertising to certain media outlets have also been documented. The suspension of advertisements to Dawn, the leading English newspaper of the country, who issued a public response defending its editorial policy, and the Ministry of Information’s stoppage of advertisements to Daily Sahafat, highlight the underhanded methods used to financially cripple media outlets.
In what has become the norm, the lack of accountability and the role of state bodies — in 2024-25, the FIA set a dangerous pattern of action against media professionals.
At the same time, forms of physical violence, including assault and manhandling as well as arrests, detentions, and the issuance of threats to journalists, continued to undermine the safety of media professionals and served as tools to intimidate the media alongside other punitive measures, including the suspension of advertising to media outlets.
In 2025, PPF documented at least 34 cases including seven instances of case registration, one defamation notice, three instances of call-up notices by the FIA, two arrests, four detentions, two abductions, at least six instances of assault and two of manhandling, two attacks on property including a raid, three instances of threats including a threat of legal action and threats to family, and two of online harassment.

Speaking at the Balochistan Bar Association, Mr Mengal criticised the authorities for their inaction following a suicide attack near the BNP-M sit-in camp in the Lakpass area. “It has been over three weeks, yet no investigation has been initiated, nor have the perpetrators been identified,” he regretted.
Mr Mengal, a former chief minister of Balochistan, expressed dismay at the silence of state institutions, lamenting that the authorities concerned had yet to launch an investigation.
“The judiciary and parliament were not working independently and not playing their true role,” he claimed, adding that those who simply read out decisions written by others were decorated with medals.
He also expressed doubts about the legitimacy of the electoral process, referring to what he described as “Form-47 manipulation” — a term often used to denote rigging through falsified results. “Rubber-stamp legislators cannot make decisions based on merit. A rubber-stamp parliament cannot lead the country towards progress,” he said.
He warned that the limited provincial autonomy granted under the 18th Amendment was under threat. He also condemned the state’s failure to address enforced disappearances across Balochistan. “My faith in the parliamentary system has eroded completely,” he said.
Mr Mengal also criticised Islamabad’s role in regional conflicts, stating: “We pushed Afghanistan into war for dollars and ran this country on the fuel of Afghan refugees for 40 years.
“Now, they should be repatriated with dignity.”

In a detailed research in the half-yearly report on the State of the Economy 2024-25, released on Monday, the central bank observed that one of the key underlying issues facing Pakistan’s economy was weak competitiveness.
“From a macroeconomic perspective, this is reflected in consistently declining exports (as a percentage of GDP), low FDI, and overall insufficient integration with global value chains (GVC),” said the report.
From a micro perspective, this is reflected in the low quality of products, the higher unit cost of production, inability to create brands in international markets, and other ancillary indicators, the report added.

Pakistan’s labour productivity is the lowest among peer economies

The country’s productivity growth has been declining, even though productivity has featured in the government’s broad economic policy frameworks since at least the late 1990s, according to the report.
Pakistan’s economy has been caught in boom-bust cycles for more than five decades, with recurring episodes of high inflation and external account pressures, said the report, adding that historically, these cycles comprised three to six years of relatively high growth followed by a crisis — particularly balance of payments crisis — that necessitated urgent stabilisation measures.
“In recent decades, however, the frequency of boom-bust cycles has increased with the boom periods getting shorter. Moreover, access to external support has become challenging, warranting implementation of deep-rooted and long-pending structural reforms to address the underlying issues,” said the report.
Labour productivity
Pakistan’s labour productivity (LP) growth, measured as a change in GDP per worker, is among the lowest compared to its peer economies.While average annual growth in GDP per worker in the last two decades increased by about 1.0 percentage points over the average growth in the preceding decade, it remains low compared to peer economies by income — lower-middle-income countries (LMIC).
Labour quality in Pakistan accounted for 21pc of the improvement in labour productivity during 2000-2022, compared to 61pc in ASEAN economies.
Several attempts have been made in Pakistan to increase exports and attract FDI to kick-start economic growth. With some exceptions, most such attempts have been based on the low road model (short-term approach) coupled with the protection of domestic industries on the premise of infant industry.
However, these approaches have not delivered desirable outcomes; nor have foreign aid, grants, loans, privatisation and other windfall or external endowments sustainably driven long-term growth prospects, said the report.
It is productivity growth, which is the biggest structural driver of competitiveness, that boosts the economy’s ability to continue to export competitively, attract FDI, and sustain economic growth, said the report.
An important dimension is that while the short-term offers quick gains, it is inherently unsustainable.
Similarly, solely relying on exchange rate undervaluation to compensate for the high cost of production, lack of innovation, low product quality, etc., could be counterproductive, said the report.

The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
“Our hope here is that India responds to this terrorist attack in a way that doesn’t lead to a broader regional conflict,” Vance said in an interview on Fox News’ ‘Special Report with Bret Baier’ show.
“And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,” Vance added.
Top US leaders, including President Donald Trump, have condemned the attack, calling it “terror” and “unconscionable,” while expressing support for India without directly blaming Pakistan.
India is an important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence. Pakistan remains Washington’s ally even as its importance diminished after the 2021 US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan.
In recent days, Washington urged India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a “responsible solution.” India has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Islamabad denies responsibility and is calling for a neutral probe.
The US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to punish those responsible and Jaishankar has told Rubio that the perpetrators should be brought to justice. Pakistan says military action by India was imminent.
After the attack, India suspended the Indus Water Treaty, and both countries closed airspace to each other’s airlines. They also exchanged fire across their border.
Pakistani ambassador, UN chief discuss ‘evolving security situation’
Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Asim Iftikhar Ahmad met UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday and discussed the latest developments in the region.
“The discussion focused on the evolving security situation in South Asia as well as the imperative of de-escalation and the efforts being made to that effect,” a press release issued by the Pakistan Mission to the UN said.
“The ambassador reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability,” it added.
 






Earlier in the day, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric was asked at a UN briefing whether Guterres planned on travelling to India and Pakistan.
Dujarric replied that the UN chief had offered his good offices during his phone calls to PM Shehbaz and Jaishankar in the wake of the attack.
“So I don’t think there would be any travel until there’s a clear message that, as in any instance where we have high tensions between two countries, that they’ve both accepted his good offices,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-02 04:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02092549dc9fba4.png?r=092734' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907910/justice-not-limited-to-courts-says-sc-judge-mandokhail' target='_blank'><strong>Justice not limited to courts, says SC judge Mandokhail</strong></a><br><p>• Urges people to ensure justice in their actions
• Calls for recognition of mining sector on Labour Day
• CJP reaffirms judiciary’s role in enforcing workers’ rights
ISLAMABAD: A judge must follow the law, but justice is not limited to the courts, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court said on Thursday, stressing that every individual is responsible for ensuring justice in their actions.
Speaking at the ‘Workers and Employers in 2025: Navigating Change with Harmony’ conference organised by the National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC) in collaboration with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Justice Mandokhail urged the government to recognise mining as a formal industry, highlighting the severe conditions faced by miners in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
He expressed deep concern over the lack of institutional safeguards for mine workers and called for comprehensive legal and administrative reforms to ensure their welfare and protection.
Justice Jawad Hassan of the Lahore High Court praised Pakistan’s progressive labour legislation, noting its longstanding tradition and international commitments.
In his opening remarks, retired Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, chairman of NIRC, reaffirmed the commission’s mandate to balance industrial progress with workers’ rights protection.
Prominent jurist Barrister Dr Zafarullah Khan stressed the Islamic foundations of labour justice, noting that “lawful and hard-earned income is an act of worship”.
Minister for Law and Justice reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the NIRC’s mandate, emphasising that fair dispute resolution and protection of workers’ rights were in line with international standards.
Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain highlighted skills development as central to providing decent employment opportunities. He acknowledged the ILO’s role in supporting vulnerable workers and called for an institutional framework for effective labour dispute resolution.
Speaking on the occasion, ILO Country Director Geir Tonstol said that “tripartite dialogue is not just beneficial, it is essential”.
He added, “In today’s evolving world of work, industrial harmony depends on inclusive, consensus-driven solutions that reflect the lived realities of our labour force. The ILO is proud to support Pakistan’s journey towards fairer, safer and more equitable workplaces.”
The national conference called on the government, employers and workers’ organisations to enhance institutional capacity, promote labour law compliance, invest in dispute prevention and resolution mechanisms and promote a culture of open dialogue and mutual respect at all levels.
The event proposed establishing a national tripartite forum to address emerging workplace challenges proactively. Participants underscored resolving labour disputes through social dialogue, conciliation and mutual understanding, reaffirming that labour rights must ensure decent working conditions and workplace safety.
The conference was attended by a large number of workers, legal experts and dignitaries, including retired Justice Mian Shakirullah Jan, former Supreme Court judge Syed Atique Shah, the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court, and Supreme Court Bar Association General Secretary Salman Mansoor Siddiqui.
Right to dignity
Meanwhile, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi emphasised on Thursday that Labour Day serves as a solemn occasion to pay tribute to the resilience, dedication and sacrifices of the working men and women, whose contributions are foundational to national development and economic growth.
In his Labour Day message, Justice Afridi highlighted the judiciary’s responsibility as the guardian of constitutional rights, reinforcing the importance of social justice, equity and labour rights protection.
“The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan embodies the right to dignity, fair remuneration and just and humane conditions of work as fundamental principles of policy,” he said.
“These rights are not merely aspirational — but are enforceable legal and moral obligations for the State. The judiciary, as guardian of the Constitution and arbiter of justice, bears a profound responsibility to ensure that these guarantees are realised in both letter and spirit,” he added.
The CJP stressed that historically, Pakistani courts have played a pivotal role in safeguarding labour rights, addressing exploitative practices and interpreting protective labour legislation. The judiciary “has strived to act as a bulwark against discrimination, coercion and inequality at the workplace”, he said
He urged judicial forums handling labour matters to remain vigilant about socio-economic realities faced by workers, emphasising the judiciary’s commitment to accessible, expeditious and fair adjudication of disputes.
He called for strengthened institutional mechanisms to promote decent work, eliminate forced and child labour, ensure workplace safety and uphold labour dignity, fulfilling the constitutional promise of a just society.
Published in Dawn, May 2nd, 2025</p><small>2025-05-02 04:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/681408eb3460b.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907887/a-bullet-train-at-punjab-speed' target='_blank'><strong>A BULLET TRAIN AT ‘PUNJAB SPEED’</strong></a><br><p>GLOBALLY, the benchmark speed for high-speed trains is between 200 and 250 kilometres per hour (kmph), while more advanced bullet trains can travel over 300kmph. The Punjab government, in its quest to run a high-speed train, is looking to redefine these standards.
Last month, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif held a meeting to discuss a plan to operate a high-speed rail link between Lahore and Rawalpindi.
A working group, comprising Punjab Transport Minister Bilal Akbar Khan, Adviser to CM Shahid Tarar, Pakistan Railways (PR) chairman, and chief executive officer, has been formed to evaluate the feasibility of this project.
But experts have told Dawn that even a high-speed train is not feasible — let alone a bullet train — due to three major constraints: dilapidated infrastructure, financing needs and terrain.
Sources in PR told Dawn the operation of a bullet train at the 280km Lahore-Rawalpindi section is a “dream” for the time being, as the railway track between the two major cities of Punjab — and all over Pakistan — is outdated and way past its shelf life.

Experts say Punjab CM’s hopes for a high-speed line between Lahore and Rawalpindi are ‘unrealistic’

“It is impossible to operate a bullet train on the outlived rail infrastructure, especially the rail track,” the sources told Dawn, pointing out broader infrastructure constraints.
“We don’t even have the rolling stock (coaches and locomotives, etc) that are compatible with bullet trains,” a senior PR official explained.
Currently, trains can’t travel at a speed of more than 65kph on the existing track between Lahore and Rawalpindi.
“Our premier train, Green Line, reaches from Lahore to Rawalpindi in four and a half hours. Other trains take five and a half hours.”
CM Maryam wants to reduce this time to two hours, according to Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi, who attended last month’s meeting.
According to Mr Abbasi, the chief minister asked about the duration of train journeys between Rawalpindi and Lahore.
“We said they take around four and a half hours. On this, she said she wants to reduce it by two and a half hours.”
The minister said it was impossible to cut the travel time on the existing track.
“However, I said, we can enhance the speed to 100km per hour by spending around Rs40 billion on the upgradation of the existing track.”
Mr Abbasi claimed CM Maryam “principally agreed” to this proposal.
But Riaz Rashid, a mechanical engineer, says that even if the government succeeds in achieving a maximum speed of 150kmph by upgrading the existing track and producing new coaches, it cannot be called a “high-speed train”.
The top speed on railway tracks in Pakistan is not over 100kph, while most express trains’ average speed ranges between 60 and 70kph, according to Mr Rashid, who was a senior engineer for Saudi Arabia’s North-South Rail Project.
Investment
Experts and railway officials told Dawn even a slight improvement in train speeds would require a massive investment.
According to the PR official, a high-speed train can be operated once the entire existing infrastructure is modernised.
Another senior official of PR said the cost incurred on a state-of-the-art bullet/high-speed train system in Europe is up to $50m per kilometre. This included new coaches, locomotives, brake vans, railway track with fencing, signaling system and human resources, etc.
He estimated that replacing the existing railway system would cost around $12 to $14bn.
A low-cost option would be to upgrade the existing system.
The PR official explained that the upgradation of the existing track may help increase speed but even then, running high-speed or bullet trains, which generally operate with a speed of 180 to over 300kph, is not possible.
Mr Abbasi, the railways minister, said at the meeting with the CM, presented its working regarding the operation of high-speed trains capable of going at 160kph with modern coaches, locomotives, railway track, fencing, etc.
That project is estimated to cost around Rs400bn, according to the minister.
He said a conversation had been held with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, “who had asked us to submit the Rs400bn plan in this regard”.
“We will complete the work in this regard soon and discuss with the PM.”
Terrain
Independent experts believe that running a high-speed train between Lahore and Rawalpindi is a herculean task, something that would take years to complete.
It may take up to seven years if the government starts work today on war-footings with thousands of labourers and engineers, experts told Dawn.
Mr Rashid, the mechanical engineer, said a train with a speed of 250kph is considered high-speed and it requires special infrastructure to operate — track, rolling stock, signaling systems, etc.
He added such a system is not even available in India which has been building infrastructure for high-speed trains since 2016/17.
He also pointed out that the terrain between Lahore and Rawalpindi is not suitable for operating a high-speed train.
The rail route between the two cities is not straight. It is uneven and curves at various spots. There are also some areas with hilly terrain.
The route also has three bridges over Chenab, Ravi and Jhelum river and at least eight canal culverts.
Mr Rashid said a high-speed train between the two cities would require a straight railway track of special gauge, like the Lahore Orange Line Train, besides modern coaches and allied systems. He estimated that this would cost up to $15bn.
India is building elevated infrastructure due to the non-feasibility of the ground infrastructure.
Habibul Haq Randhawa, a former chief engineer of the Lahore Develo­pment Authority , said even if the government secured the funding to operate the train, there would still be a number of constraints.
He said that to encourage people to switch to trains, the government will also have to cut travel time to Lahore railway station from various residential areas, which currently take 40 to 90 minutes.

Jason Miller, a long-time adviser to President Donald Trump, signed a $150,000-a-month contract to represent the Indian government — his first formal lobbying role during Trump’s second term.
According to filings with the US Justice Department, seen by Dawn, Miller will provide strategic counsel, tactical planning, lobbying, and public relations services to New Delhi.
A communications strategist, Miller played a key role in both of Trump’s presidential campaigns, and served as a senior adviser in the White House.
He later launched the social media platform Gettr, which was promoted as a pro-free speech alternative to Twitter, and remained active in conservative political circles.
The same day, two other Trump aides — Keith Schiller, a former White House Deputy Assistant; and George Sorial, a former Trump Organisation executive — registered as foreign agents for Pakistan. Sorial is also the co-author of The Real Deal, a memoir chronicling his time with Trump
Their firm, Javelin Advisors LLC, signed on as a subcontractor to Seiden Law, which recently secured a $200,000-a-month agreement with the Pakistani government.
Javelin’s share of the contract is $50,000 per month, according to Politico, a US-based publication that covers politics and policy. While the foreign lobbying contracts are ostensibly focused on economic and diplomatic engagement, the timing of the two new contracts has drawn scrutiny.

In a recent interview, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told Newsweek that for a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration”, there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.
The call for Trump to play a role in reducing the tensions came as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to top Pakistani and Indian leaders, urging a de-escalation of tensions in the Subcontinent.
“If we have a president who is standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration, to establish a legacy as a peacemaker — or as someone who finished wars, defied wars and played a role in de-confliction, resolving the disputes — I don’t think there is any higher or flashier flash point, particularly in nuclear terms, as Kashmir,” Newsweek quoted him as saying.
“We are not talking about one or two countries in that neighbourhood who are nuclear-capable. So, that is how grave it is,” he said.

Pakistan’s envoy to US says no issue ‘higher or flashier’ than Kashmir; says Pakistan focusing on geo-economics, doesn’t want to fight India

In his inaugural speech as the US president, Trump had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”
On his watch, a ceasefire — which has since been broken — was secured between Israel and Hamas, and the US has also been engaging with Ukraine and Russia to halt their war.
According to Newsweek, Mr Sheikh contended that the Trump administration would need to pursue a more comprehensive and sustained initiative than in past US attempts to defuse crises that have erupted between Pakistan and India.
 
 

“I think with this threat that we are facing, there is a latent opportunity to address the situation by not just [focusing] on an immediate de-escalatory measure, or a de-escalatory approach,” the envoy said.
He called for a more durable and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute, “rather than allowing the situation to stay precarious and pop up again and again at the next drop of a hat on this side or that side”.
If the long-standing Kashmir dispute was resolved, the ambassador said, the population of South Asia could live in peace. “All the other issues between Pakistan and India are not major issues,” he noted.
‘Geo-economics’ over geopolitics
Separately, speaking to the Washington Post, Mr Sheikh said that the country could not afford a distraction at a point when things were looking up, economically.
“The only thing we need right now is a peaceful neighborhood.”
“We do not want to fight, particularly with a bigger country,” Mr Sheikh told Newsweek.
“We want peace. It suits our economic agenda; it suits our nationhood. It suits every objective that we have currently. But we want peace with dignity. We would not want to do it, but if it is imposed, then we would rather die with dignity than survive with indignity,” he asserted.
Reiterating Pakistan’s stance, the envoy rejected any involvement of his country in the Pahalgam attack, arguing that the fallout of such an operation could only serve to harm rather than benefit Pakistan’s interests.
“Pakistan is focusing on a matter of a deliberate, considered, pronounced shift of our foreign policy, a pivot from geopolitics to geo-economics,” the envoy told Newsweek.
‘Outlandish’ Indian claims
Terming it “so outlandish, so far-fetched, to blame Pakistan” for the Pahalgam attack, Sheikh said Islamabad was awaiting evidence from New Delhi to prove a link between the incident and Pakistan.
Moreover, the envoy said the attack could be a “false-flag operation” conducted to intentionally lay the blame on Pakistan. He acknowledged he could not yet back up the claim, but there was “enough circumstantial evidence, history, […] immediate backdrop and setting […] to entertain that possibility.
Speaking about India’s unilateral suspension last week of the IWT, Sheikh warned that if there was “even an attempt or a semblance of an attempt” to stop or hold water, then it would be a declaration of war.
While contending that it was “physically impossible” to hold water, the envoy said “all bets are off if it’s about food security of 250 million people”.
“If you threaten me with this kind of a situation, which is existential, what is your expectation of response?” he asked.

Ukraine said it secured key interests after protracted negotiations, including full sovereignty over its own rare earths, which are vital for new technologies and largely untapped.
Trump had initially demanded rights to Ukraine’s mineral wealth as compensation for US weapons sent under former president Joe Biden after Russia invaded just over three years ago.
After initial hesitation, Ukraine has accepted a minerals accord as a way to secure long-term investment by the United States, as Trump tries to drastically scale back US security commitments around the world.
Announcing the deal in Washington on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it showed “both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine”. “This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” Bessent said.
“And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.”
Trump had originally sought $500 billion in mineral wealth — around four times what the United States has contributed to Ukraine since the war.

• WHO says ‘bodies and minds’ of Gaza children being broken
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said on Thursday Israeli bombardment killed at least 29 people since midnight in the war-ravaged territory, which has been under Israeli aid blockade for nearly two months.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile said that while the military’s mission was to bring home all the prisoners from Gaza, its “supreme goal” was to achieve victory against Hamas.
Israel resumed its campaign in the Gaza Strip on March 18, after a two-month truce collapsed over disagreements between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.
Civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughayyir said Thursday’s toll included eight people killed in an air strike on the Abu Sahlul family home in Khan Yunis refugee camp in southern Gaza. Four people were killed in an air strike east of Shaaf in Gaza City’s Al-Tuffah neighbourhood, he said.
At least 17 more were killed in other attacks across the Palestinian territory, including one that hit a tent sheltering displaced people near the central city of Deir el-Balah, the agency said.
“We came here and found all these houses destroyed, and children, women and young people all bombed to pieces,” said Ahmed Abu Zarqa after a deadly strike in Khan Yunis. “This is no way to live. Enough, we’re tired, enough! “We don’t know what to do with our lives any more. We’d rather die than live this kind of life.”
AFP images showed residents digging through rubble in search of bodies, which were carried away on stretchers under blankets. At Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, rescuers rushed a screaming wounded child out of an ambulance.
 
 

The health ministry in Gaza said on Thursday that at least 2,326 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,418.
The Hamas attack on Israel on Oct 7, 2023 resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Israel says its renewed military campaign aims to force Hamas to free the remaining prisoners.
‘Abomination’
The World Health Organisation decried on Thursday the horrifying situation unfolding in Gaza, with one top official voicing anger that the world was allowing the “abomination” to continue.
“We have to ask ourselves: How much blood is enough to satisfy whatever the political objectives are,” the UN health agency’s emergencies director Mike Ryan told reporters in Geneva.
“We are breaking the bodies and the minds of the children of Gaza. We are starving the children of Gaza, because if we don’t do something about it we are complicit in what is happening.”
Israel strictly controls all inflows of international aid vital for the 2.4 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
It halted aid deliveries to Gaza on March 2, days before the collapse of a ceasefire that had significantly reduced hostilities after 15 months of war.
Since the start of the blockade, the UN has repeatedly warned of the humanitarian catastrophe on the ground, with famine again looming.
Supplies are dwindling and the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) last Friday said it had sent out its “last remaining food stocks” to kitchens.
Ryan pointed to the more than 1,000 children in Gaza that are missing limbs, “thousands of children with spinal cord injuries, with severe head injuries from which they’ll never recover” and psychological conditions.
“We are watching this unfold before our very eyes, and we’re not doing anything about it.” Addressing the other WHO experts and journalists gathered at the agency’s Geneva headquarters, Ryan said “I’m angry”.
“As a physician, I’m angry with myself that I’m not doing enough. I’m angry with everyone here. This cannot continue… This is an abomination.”

The number of Afghans who left last month was the highest since September 2023, said a report released by the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, on Thursday.
According to the report, 72 per cent of Afghans who left last month were undocumented, followed by 22pc with Afghan Citizenship Cards and 6pc with Proof of Registration cards.
The report ‘Core Pakistan-Afgha­nistan Returns Emergency Response’ said more than 144,500 Afghans returned to their country in April.
In April, around 24,400 Afghans were arrested by Pakistani authorities, representing over twice the 2024 rate.

Number of Afghans leaving Pakistan in April at 19-month high, say UNHCR, IOM; USCIRF says minorities at risk in Afghanistan

Most of the arrests and detentions took place in Punjab, followed by Balochistan.
Documentation trends
Separate data released by the Inter­national Organisation for Migration (IOM) also identified similar trends.
It said the number of undocumented individuals who left Pakistan between April 20 and 26 was higher compared to the previous week.
Around 65pc of Afghans, whom the IOM interviewed, said they had no documents.
The return of Afghans from Iran was also ongoing, IOM reported.
Around 14,909 male individuals entered Afghanistan using Abu Nasar Farahi and Milak border crossing points from Iran, accounting for 91pc of the total inflow, while female individuals were 1,487 or 9pc.
Need for support
UNHCR says Afghanistan has an estimated 3.22 million conflict-induced internally displaced persons (IDPs), 1.65 million IDP returnees and hosts around 20,900 refugees, requiring immediate protection and humanitarian assistance, as well as medium to long-term support.
In the first quarter of 2025, UNHCR has worked to scale up response capacities at border crossing points and encashment centers to provide protection assistance for the anticipated large-scale returns and deportations from Pakistan as part of the second phase of the Pakistan government’s Illegal Foreign Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
There are 2.8 million Afghans living in Pakistan, including refugees and those in refugee-like situations, with the implementation of IFRP Phase II likely to result in more than 1.4m Afghans (undocumented, refugees, and those in refugee-like situations) returning to Afghanistan.
Risk for minorities
The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a bipartisan federal body that monitors and reports on religious freedom abroad, has expressed grave concern over the repatriation of Afghan refugees.
The agency warned the policy was putting vulnerable religious minorities at serious risk under the Afghan Taliban rule.
Since March 2025, Pakistan expelled an estimated 80,000 Afghans as part of its repatriation campaign that began in October 2023.
“The situation in Afghanistan remains dire for those who do not share the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Islam, including Christians, Shia Hazara, [Ahmadis] and Sikhs,” said USCIRF Chair Stephen Schneck.
“We are deeply concerned that religious minority communities will be in grave danger, especially women and girls, as Taliban officials seek retaliation against Afghans returned by the Pakistani government’s forced and accelerated repatriation efforts.”
USCIRF Vice Chair Meir Soloveichik warned the Taliban regime has created “terrible circumstances that put Afghan religious minorities at risk of severe persecution, including corporal punishment and arbitrary detention.”

Speaking at a gathering in Mirpurkhas, the PPP leader claimed that certain ‘conspiratorial’ elements and ‘political orphans’ saw it as an opportunity to target the PPP.
“They began celebrating, assuming that the PPP would compromise on public rights just as they have always done. Historically, whenever these parties had a chance, they sided with undemocratic forces and compromised on the people’s rights. But the PPP has never bowed before anyone. We have always stood by our principles and will continue to do so,” he said as per a statement issued by the PPP media cell after the event.
He pointed out that two major decisions were taken during the caretaker setup before the incumbent government was formed: one was the executive committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) decision to construct new canals, and the other was a “baseless certificate” issued by Indus River System Authority (Irsa), claiming that the country had surplus water.
“Both decisions were taken during the caretaker government when Arif Alvi was still occupying the presidency,” he noted, adding, “These decisions were made before President Asif Ali Zardari assumed office.”
He said that PPP did not have a majority in the National Assembly, nor in the relevant forum — the Council of Common Interests, but it still opposed the project.
“The PPP had only two representatives in the CCI, but President Zardari and the party still decided that these canals would not be built.”
The PPP leader recalled that on the death anniversary of Benazir Bhutto, he had publicly appealed to President Zardari to reject the project, and he, in his address, assured the nation that each province would receive its rightful share of water.
“President Zardari reiterated this in the joint session of parliament, where he said that he could not support any unilateral decision regarding this canals project as it posed a threat to the federation,” he added.
The PPP chief also condemned India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, stating that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched an attack on our Sindhu. “We are a peaceful nation, but we will resist anyone who threatens our (Indus) river,” he warned. Mr Bhutto-Zardari announced that the PPP would hold its next public gathering on May 9 in Shaheed Benazirabad.

• Govt orders religious seminaries to shut for 10 days

MUZAFFARABAD / RAWALPINDI: With the threat of an Indian escalation looming over Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), its prime minister indicated on Thursday that his government was considering imposing an emergency in the territory if something untoward happens.
Also on Thursday, authorities stopped tourists from entering Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the Line of Control (LoC) in view of the security situation.
 
 

The government has ordered all religious seminaries in the region to remain closed for 10 days, while the owners of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, and marriage halls have pledged to place their establishments at the military’s disposal in case India launches an attack.
Meanwhile, Pakistan announced that certain sections of airspace over the two largest cities — Karachi and Lahore — will remain closed for eight hours a day throughout the month of May.
In addition, flights to and from destinations in Gilgit-Baltistan continued to face disruptions due to the closure of airspace in that region.
Preparedness plans
Speaking during a session of the Legislative Assembly on Thursday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq said his administration was monitoring the situation on the Indian frontier.
He assured the House that his government had made arrangements to ensure the availability of food, medicines, and other basic necessities in the 13 constituencies located along the LoC.
“We have established an Emergency Response Fund and transferred Rs1bn into it… arrangements have been made to ensure food, medicines, and other essential supplies,” he said, adding that administrations and residents in the border areas had been directed to stock rations for two months.
In addition, official and private machinery was being deployed to keep roads open in the LoC constituencies of Neelum, Jhelum, Poonch, Haveli, Kotli and Bhimber.
Additionally, the State Disaster Management Authority, Rescue 1122, and Civil Defence had been directed to remain prepared for any emergency.
Stating that India had been exposed before the world as a terrorist state, Mr Haq urged the nation to remain vigilant, warning that the “vile adversary could resort to any ghastly act.”
“I assure you that if India commits any kind of aggression, the government, the people, and all political and religious parties and leaders are fully prepared to respond to its aggressive designs,” he said.
Mr Haq added that Indian occupation forces had resorted to unprovoked firing along the LoC on Thursday and had been given a strong and timely response by the army.
Later in the day, PM Haq hosted a multi-party meeting at his official residence, where participants, including leaders from outside the Legislative Assembly, ren­ewed the resolve to teach India a befitting lesson in the event of any aggression.
Restrictions
Also on Thursday, authorities began stopping tourists from entering the Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the LoC.
Many visitors who were unaware of the fresh restrictions were turned back from the Marbal checkpost, and even AJK residents who were not local to these areas were stopped from proceeding further.
In Leepa Valley, officials advised residents to avoid areas near the LoC and urged them to cooperate with law enforcement agencies to ensure their safety.
Separately, the government ordered all religious seminaries to remain closed for 10 days, citing a heatwave.
However, official sources indicated that the decision was based on intelligence rep­orts suggesting India mi­ght target such institutions, under the pretext
of hitting militant training centres. “We are dealing with such a cunning, cruel, and conspiratorial enemy that no vile act can be ruled out,” said Minister for Law Mian Abdul Waheed.
In a related development, the Joint Action Committee of Hotels, Guesthouses, Restaurants, and Marriage Halls of AJK held an emergency meeting to express solidarity with the army.
Chaired by Raja Ilyas, the meeting included members from Kotli, Mirpur, Bagh, Rawalakot, and Neelum, some of whom joined via video link.
Participants pledged to hand over their establishments to the Pakistan Army through the AJK prime minister if India launched an attack.
Airspace closures
Pakistan has also decided to close certain sections of the airspace over Karachi and Lahore between 8am and 4pm (local time) for the month of May “due to operational reasons”.
The restrictions will not be applicable on Sundays.
New Delhi had earlier closed its airspace to Pakistani planes on Wed­nesday, a few days after Islamabad banned Indian planes from overflying.
“Affected routes are located between flight levels 9,000 and 25,000 feet,” according to the latest Notice to Airmen (Notam) issued by the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA).
The decision affects selected corridors within the FIRs rather than a complete shutdown, and is being implemented as a precautionary security measure, officials added.
Although authorities say the closure will not significantly disrupt commercial flight operations, as aircraft will be rerouted via alternative flight paths during the restricted hours, these hours are considered peak times for domestic flights.
The closure comes in addition to restrictions already in place in the skies over Gilgit-Baltistan, as PIA flights from Islamabad to Gilgit-Skardu were cancelled for a second day on Thursday. The airspace was unavailable between 1:30am and 10pm on Thursday.
Separately, rain and windstorms in northern parts of Pakistan disrupted the flight schedule, with as many as five international and domestic flights delayed and diverted to other cities due to bad weather in Islamabad.

• Army chief inspects military exercise, vows befitting response in case of aggression
• Tarar says situation on the border is ‘ever evolving’
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan-India tensions continue to simmer in light of the Pahalgam attack in the held Kashmir, Pakistan on Thursday engaged a host of friendly nations, including China, to seek their support for de-escalation measures between the nuclear states and to take them into confidence regarding the ‘weaponisation’ of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.
The hostilities, which led to the downgrading of ties between the neighbours, also came up during a contact between President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as both dignitaries noted with concern the “belligerent attitude and provocative statements” by India, which posed a threat to regional peace and stability.
In his contacts with Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani on Thursday evening, PM Shehbaz discussed developments in South Asia and expressed concerns over India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin. The PM, according to a statement, deemed the action unacceptable, emphasising that the Indus water was the lifeline of the 240 million people in Pakistan.
 
 

In his meeting with Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong, PM Shehbaz informed the Chinese envoy that the belligerent actions by India could distract Pakistan from its ongoing counter-terrorism efforts against militant outfits operating from Afghanistan. He informed the envoy that the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue was the only way to ensure “lasting peace” in South Asia and also thanked him for China’s support to Pakistan in its demand for a transparent probe into the attack.
The premier said that India’s decision to weaponise water was extremely regrettable, as there was no provision for either party to unilaterally walk away from its commitments under the Indus Waters Treaty. During the meeting, the Chinese ambassador thanked the PM for sharing Pakistan’s perspective on the emerging situation due to India’s propaganda and unilateral actions, the Prime Minister’s Office said.
‘No compromise’
The breakdown in ties with India also featured prominently in a meeting between the president and the premier on Thursday. They affirmed that Pakistan would never compromise on the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and would respond to any act of aggression in a “befitting manner”.
They said the Pakistani nation was united and stood behind its military, which was capable of responding to any threat or aggression. They also reviewed Pakistan’s response to India’s “belligerent posture and any possible acts of aggression”. They said that the international community should take note of India’s involvement in funding, training and sending militants into Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities.

The two also highlighted the urgency of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions to grant the Kashmiri people their right to self-determination, noting it would help bring lasting peace and stability to the region.
Separately, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also had a conversation with Slovenia Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon and briefed her on the evolving situation. In his contact, FM Dar rejected India’s baseless allegations and denounced unilateral actions, including holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, as a clear violation of international law. FM Fajon called on both countries to exercise restraint and resolve issues through diplomacy.
‘Let there be no ambiguity’
As civilian leaders took world leaders into confidence, army chief General Asim Munir warned that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a quick and decisive response.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response. While Pakistan remains committed to regional peace, our preparedness and resolve to safeguard national interests are absolute,” he was quoted as saying by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
According to the ISPR, COAS Munir visited the Tilla Field Firing Ranges in Jhelum to witness ‘Exercise Hammer Strike’, a high-intensity, field training exercise conducted by the military’s Mangla Strike Corps. Speaking on the occasion, the army chief reaffirmed the military’s “unyielding resolve” to defend the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
The COAS lauded the “high morale, combat proficiency, and war-fighting spirit” of the officers and troops, terming them the “embodiment of Pakistan Army’s operational excellence”.
‘No proof’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said India failed to provide proof of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam incident. About allegations levelled by India, he said they kept blaming Pakistan, adding that New Delhi used such incidents as pretexts to attack Pakistan in the past. “They will have to tell the world who was involved. You cannot just say that Pakistan was behind this…” he said, adding that Pakistan demanded an impartial inquiry to prove that it had nothing to do with Pahalgam.
He said Islamabad also engaged the friendly nations to share with them its perspective regarding the recent tensions.
To another query, he said, “The situation is fluctuating and sometimes escalation is high and sometimes it is low; sometimes engagement with the diplomatic community, and this is an ever-evolving situation.”
 
 

“We keep receiving intelligence reports, and having said that, our armed forces are on alert…we are conducting exercises, and there is much at the operational level which I cannot share right now,” he said, adding that there was a possibility that India could attack Pakistan. “Yes, there is a possibility, that is why I said that Pakistan is always well prepared to defend that and our armed forces are ready for self-defence,” he added.
He said he had shared the information about the potential attack “very timely” with the world as a form of deterrence.
“There are three forms of deterrence: one is our capability, which is our very strong military… second is the resolve…of the nation…and third is the communication,” he added. “So, communication plays a big part in averting crises.”

Kharif season begins on April 1, and water availability criteria and distribution among provinces are usually settled for the entire season by the advisory committee in the last week of March.
 
 

But given peculiar sca­rce water conditions, it had allocated only drinking water shares to provinces for April — the first month of the season generally used for sowing crops. Provinces had delayed sowing because of the unprecedented water shor­tage, estimated at 43 per cent at the time.
Irsa’s advisory committee decided on March 26 to meet again in the first week of May to take stock of the latest situation and finalise “Anticipated Wat­er Availability Criteria” and set provincial water shares for the season.
The shortage has since dropped to about 25-27pc to be finally approved by the committee on May 5. The water storage in reservoirs, particularly Mangla and Tarbela, has further improved to 1.762 million acre-feet (MAF), up from 1.3 MAF on April 20 and almost zero on April 1.
Irsa has invited irrigation and agriculture secretaries from the four provinces, Wapda’s members for water and power, the chief engineering adviser and the chairman of the Federal Flood Commission, along with all Irsa members, to attend the crucial meeting.
The authority has already increased provincial water shares, raising hopes about better cotton sowing that was earlier feared to dent Kharif crops amid a 43pc water shortage for the season predicted on March 26 by the Irsa’s advisory committee.
The committee earlier resisted provincial pressures on March 26, particularly from Sindh, for lower allocations and gave monthly allocations to provinces from the maximum shortage scenario.
As a result, the provinces were given minimum shares, mostly sufficient only for drinking instead of irrigation.
The provinces generally delayed sowing crops where possible.

Based on a review of existing project pipeline, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has approved the revised IGCEP 2025-34 for submission to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) for formal approval. The revised plan meant an investment of $47.4bn over the next 10 years instead of $64.3bn previously planned by the power division.
The prime minister also directed the completion of Diamer-Bhasha Dam on a priority basis to ensure effective irrigation system and power generation.
Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari said that out of the previously planned 15,000MW capacity additions, about 7,000MW would have resulted in expensive power and are being scrapped.

Expects savings of Rs4.7tr by rescheduling 7,000MW of already committed plants

The prime minister was told that “around $10bn (about Rs2.790tr) was saved by adjusting the timelines of committed capacity under the IGCEP (submitted to Nepra). An additional $7bn (Rs1.96tr) in savings resulted from rationalising the committed capacity portfolio”.
Mr Leghari said the government had also decided that the government would not purchase generation capacity in future; instead, capacity addition would be based on a competitive market. He said the government was now pulling out of the single-buyer system and no capacity addition would be allowed on cost-plus tariff.
He said the future governments would be bound to follow the principle of competitive electricity market and would not be able to contract expensive electricity.
The government submitted IGCEP 2024-34 to Nepra in April 2024 for approval which came under significant scrutiny due to emerging sectoral dynamics like declining electricity demand, a rising share of net metering, and the presence of a large volume of committed capacity additions.
“These developments raised concerns over the potential burden on end consumers if the committed projects were approved without re-evaluation”, the power minister said.
The IGCEP-2024-34 involved a total of 25,973MW of new capacity additions, of which 25,573MW (98.5pc) was categorised as committed capacity, leaving only 400MW (1.5pc) as candidate capacity subject to optimisation.
The Net Present Value (NPV) of this proposed plan stood at $64.30bn, including $42.61bn in fixed costs and $21.69bn in generation costs.
Given the high reliance on committed projects and reduced demand projections, a detailed review of the committed project criteria was undertaken. Considering the assumptions and policy provisions, the IGCEP draft submitted to Nepra was thoroughly assessed, wherein 73 projects were initially classified as committed in the draft IGCEP-2021-31.
These projects were facilitated by various project executing agencies at the federal, provincial, AJK and Wapda levels with a collective capacity of 22,418MW. By the end of 2024, 7,434MW of this capacity had been commissioned.
The remaining capacity within the committed category stood at 14,984MW, which came under subsequent review based on the basic principle of financial closure achieved in the private sector or financial commitment in the public sector along with more than 10pc of construction and financial progress.
Based on revised criteria, only 7,017MW out of the initial 14,984MW qualified to remain in the committed category. The remaining projects were subsequently evaluated under the least-cost optimisation framework within the IGCEP.
“Based on the refined categorisation of committed projects, the system achieved savings of Rs1.015tr relative to the business-as-usual case with forced capacity additions,” the power minister said.

This early harvesting has also led to the initiation of forward trading of cotton, raising the possibility of the earliest cotton ginning season in Pakistan’s history, potentially starting in the first week of May.
Cotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq shared that advance deals for cotton produced from the new crop have begun. Initially, two ginning factories in Burewala and Mandi Bahauddin (Punjab) sold 600 bales of cotton for delivery between May 10 and 15, at Rs17,000 to Rs17,300 per maund.
These factories have procured raw cotton from the coastal regions of Sindh at a rate of Rs8,300 to Rs8,500 per maund.
He stated that limited cotton picking has started in some coastal areas of Sindh, with ginners from Punjab actively purchasing this early yield. Reports suggest more forward contracts will be finalised in the coming days.
The unexpected early start to cotton picking in Sindh’s coastal belt, attributed to a sudden rise in temperatures, has fuelled expectations that the new cotton ginning season could commence in the first week of May in two cities of Punjab — a first in the country’s history.
However, Mr Haq also highlighted concerns about overall cotton cultivation nationwide.
Reports suggest a decrease in cotton sowing in most cotton zones compared to the previous year, which could lead to lower national cotton production. 
This decline is primarily attributed to the disinterest of farmers due to significantly low domestic cotton prices, a consequence of record imports of sales tax-free cotton, cotton yarn, and grey cloth under the Export Facilitation Scheme.
There is also an unprecedented delay in the release of cotton cultivation and production estimates for the Cotton Year 2025-26 by the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA). Traditionally, these estimates are released in the first week of February.

Pakistan Goods Transporters Association (PGTA) Chairman Nisar Hussain Jafry said thousands of commercial vehicles were struck due to roadblocks by the protesters, including lawyers and the people of Sindh, against constructing canals on the Indus River.
As a result, the containers and cargo loaded on the vehicles were not delivered on time, resulting in demurrage and late delivery charges.
He said these charges were imposed on the transporters, who bear no responsibility or fault.
Mr Hussain claimed that over 50,000 goods carriers, which were stranded on various routes in Sindh, including vehicles going to the upcountry and coming from Punjab, have started moving, thus clearing the roads. 
The Motorway Police are also cooperating by avoiding any vehicle challans to ensure quick movement of goods. At the same time, the Excise Department has decided to defer imposing any kind of penalties for one week.

The solution aims to address major inefficiencies in the trade sector, which currently suffers an estimated annual loss of $36 billion due to outdated, paper-based systems that threaten up to 3 million jobs.
The tech company ‘Galaxefi’ has launched a multilingual, AI-powered virtual assistant that enables users to manage trade operations through simple voice or chat commands.
The assistant can automatically complete shipment details, generate customs and regulatory documents, provide real-time cargo tracking, and issue alerts in case of exceptions or delays.
In a statement on Thursday, the company said that the new system is designed to operate without human oversight, making it ideal for around-the-clock logistics support.
These AI agents allow businesses, particularly SMEs and logistics providers, to manage peak-season demand without hiring additional staff.

The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, diplomatic channels from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.
Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong called on Shehbaz at the PM House in Islamabad today, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The premier thanked China for “endorsing his sincere offer to conduct a credible, neutral and transparent international investigation into the Pahalgam incident”.

He also conveyed that India’s “belligerent actions could distract Pakistan from its ongoing counterterrorism efforts” against the militant Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K), Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), who were “operating from inside Afghanistan”.
The past few years have witnessed a rise in the frequency of attacks targeting Chinese nationals working in Pakistan, with 20 Chinese citizens killed and 34 injured in terrorist attacks across the country since 2021.
On Tuesday, the military accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. The military spokesperson specifically cited the recent killing of 54 TTP militants during an infiltration attempt, saying it was “sponsored, facilita­ted, and abetted by India”.
 
 

In his meeting with the Chinese envoy, PM Shehbaz asserted that Pakistan had always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. He highlighted that as a “frontline state” in the war against terrorism, Pakistan had sacrificed over 90,000 lives and suffered over $152 billion in economic losses.
Ambassador Zaidong thanked the prime minister for sharing Pakistan’s perspective on the “emerging situation due to Indian baseless propaganda and unilateral action”, APP quoted a press release from the PMO as saying.
He also affirmed that China would always support Pakistan to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.
PM Shehbaz conveyed his warm wishes to President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang, expressing sincere thanks to China for its strong and steadfast support to Pakistan amid the prevailing situation in the region.
Recalling a telephonic conversation between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and FM Ishaq Dar on April 27, the premier thanked China for understanding Pakistan’s principled position vis-à-vis India’s actions since April 22.
 
 

Speaking about India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), PM Shehbaz said its “decision to weaponise water was extremely regrettable”, stressing that there was no provision for either party to walk away unilaterally from its commitments under the pact.
The premier underscored that the peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was the only way to ensure lasting peace in South Asia.
Spree of diplomatic contacts continues
Continuing his diplomatic engagements with various countries, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar spoke on the phone with the foreign ministers of South Korea, Somalia and Slovenia today to brief them on the evolving regional situation, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
The foreign ministers underscored the importance of resolving issues through diplomacy to maintain regional peace and security.
As non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, Dar and the ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation. The countries also agreed to further strengthen bilateral ties with Pakistan.

In his telephonic conversation with South Korea’s FM Cho Tae-yul, Dar apprised him of the escalating regional situation arising from India’s “baseless propaganda and unilateral actions”.
FM Cho appreciated the successful co-hosting of the Third UN Peacekeeping Ministerial Preparatory Meeting in Islamabad last month.
Slovenia’s FM Tanja Fajon welcomed Pakistan’s offer for an independent and transparent investigation into the Pahalgam attack, the FO said on X.
FM Abdisalam Abdi Ali of Somalia expressed concern over the situation, FO said.
Pakistan’s envoy calls on Trump to ease tensions with India: report
Separately, Pakistan’s envoy to the United States has asked President Donald Trump to step in and help ease soaring tensions with India, according to a report by Newsweek.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told Newsweek yesterday that for a president “standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration” — referring to Trump — there was no “higher or flashier flashpoint” than the Kashmir issue.
 
 

“If we have a president who is standing for peace in the world as a pronounced objective during this administration, to establish a legacy as a peacemaker — or as someone who finished wars, defied wars and played a role in de-confliction, resolving the disputes — I don’t think there is any higher or flashier flash point, particularly in nuclear terms, as Kashmir,” Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh told Newsweek.
“We are not talking about one or two countries in that neighbourhood who [sic] are nuclear-capable. So, that is how grave it is,” he said in an interview with the US magazine.
In his inaugural speech as the US president, Trump had said: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.” A ceasefire, which has now been violated, was secured between Israel and Hamas following Trump’s election, and he has also been engaging with Ukraine and Russia to halt their war.
According to Newsweek, Sheikh contended that the Trump administration would need to pursue a more comprehensive and sustained initiative than in past US attempts to defuse crises that have erupted between Pakistan and India.
“I think with this threat that we are facing, there is a latent opportunity to address the situation by not just [focusing] on an immediate de-escalatory measure, or a de-escalatory approach,” the envoy said.
He called for a more durable and lasting solution to the Kashmir dispute, “rather than allowing the situation to stay precarious and pop up again and again at the next drop of a hat on this side or that side”.
 
 

During his interview, Sheikh emphasised that the Kashmir issue was the root cause of all troubles between India and Pakistan.
“Until and unless that final settlement is made and the resolutions dictate the prescribed solution is allowed to play out, we will all keep having these problems,” Sheikh said. “That’s why we insist on the United States and others playing a role in this situation and getting the de-confliction part activated,” he added.
If the long-standing dispute was resolved, the ambassador said, the population of South Asia could live in peace. “All the other issues between Pakistan and India are not major issues,” he noted.
“We do not want to fight, particularly with a bigger country,” Sheikh said. “We want peace. It suits our economic agenda; it suits our nationhood. It suits every objective that we have currently. But we want peace with dignity.
“We would not want to do it, but if it is imposed, then we would rather die with dignity than survive with indignity,” Sheikh asserted.
The call for Trump to play a role in reducing the tensions came the same day as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was expected to speak to top Pakistani and Indian leaders.
 
 

In his phone call with Rubio yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged the US to press India to “dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly”.
In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the US State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”
“The secretary (Rubio) urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.
Meanwhile conversation with India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Rubio “encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia”.
Foreign policy ‘pivoting from geopolitics to geoeconomics’
Sheikh, reiterating Pakistan’s stance, rejected any involvement of his country in the Pahalgam attack, arguing that the fallout of such an operation could only serve to harm rather than benefit Pakistan’s interests.
“Pakistan is focusing on a matter of a deliberate, considered, pronounced shift of our foreign policy, a pivot from geopolitics to geoeconomics,” the envoy told Newsweek.
 
 

“We are focused on the geoeconomics side of our geography and our foreign policy. We are currently economically ascendant,” the official said, stressing that Pakistan only needed a “peaceful neighbourhood” in terms of the broader region.
Terming it “so outlandish, so far-fetched, to blame Pakistan” for the Pahalgam attack, Sheikh said Islamabad was awaiting evidence from New Delhi to prove a link between the incident and Pakistan.
Moreover, the envoy said the attack could be a “false flag operation” conducted to intentionally lay the blame on Pakistan. He acknowledged he could not yet back up the claim, but there was “enough circumstantial evidence, history, […] immediate backdrop and setting […] to entertain that possibility.
Speaking about India’s unilateral suspension last week of the IWT, Sheikh warned that if there was “even an attempt or a semblance of an attempt” to stop or hold water, then it would be a declaration of war.
 
 

While contending that it was “physically impossible” to hold water, the envoy said “all bets are off if it’s about food security of 250 million people”.
“If you threaten me with this kind of a situation, which is existential, what is your expectation of response?” he asked.
On the other hand, the Indian Embassy in Washington told Newsweek in a statement: “The terrorists behind the attack will be brought to justice.” It termed Sheikh’s remarks a “crude attempt to rewrite history and gloss over facts”.
Wagah to remain open for Pakistanis stranded in India: FO
The FO on Thursday acknowledged media reports of Pakistanis stranded at the Wagah border crossing and stated that the border would remain open to Pakistani nationals stranded in India.
India Today reported that families were left separated at the border.
“In that context, we are aware of the media reports indicating that some Pakistani nationals are stranded at Attari,” Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan was quoted as saying in a statement. “We are open to receiving our citizens in case the Indian authorities allow them to cross the border from their side.”
The spokesperson stated that the Wagah border “will remain open for Pakistani citizens in the future as well”, according to the statement.
“The Indian decision to revoke visas of Pakistani citizens is creating serious humanitarian challenges,” Khan added. “Many patients, with fragile health, had to return to Pakistan without completing their treatment.
“Furthermore, there are reports of families being split and children being separated from one of their parents,” he said.
The FO spokesperson noted that the last date to cross through the Wagah-Attari border was April 30.
More than 1,000 seminaries close in AJK
As tensions rise, more than 1,000 religious schools in Azad Jammu and Kashmir have been closed for 10 days as tensions rose between India and Pakistan, a local official told AFP today.
“We have announced a 10-day break for all madressahs in Kashmir,” said Hafiz Nazeer Ahmed, the head of Kashmir’s Department of Religious Affairs.
Ahmad told Reuters that security officials feared Indian forces may target seminaries and label them as militant training centres. The notification seen by Reuters, dated April 30, only cited a heatwave as the reason for the closure.
“Right now, we are facing two kinds of heat — one from the weather and the other from [Indian Prime Minister] Modi,” Ahmad said of the notification, saying they did not mention the risk of attacks in a bid to avoid panic.
 
 

Neelum Valley, a popular tourist destination northeast of Muz­affarabad, has seen investment of millions of rupees in tourism and hospitality after the 2003 ceasefire between India and Pakistan.
“Until Tuesday, tourist arrivals hadn’t slowed,” said Deputy Commissioner Nadeem Ahmed Janjua.
“But after the federal minister’s late-night warning, about 70 per cent have left. The rest are still here,” he said, referring to Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s statement that Pakistan expected a military action by India.
Indian forces kill 9 in occupied Kashmir in April: report
In India-occupied Kashmir, troops killed nine Kashmiris in April, Kashmir Media Service reported, citing data released by its research section.
 
 

Three of the victims were killed in fake encounters and custody of Indian forces, KMS added.
It added that the Indian Army and various police forces arrested at least 2480 civilians, mostly political activists, youth, traders, and students.
Indian forces destroyed or damaged 36 residential houses in the occupied territory. It conducted a total of 322 cordon-and-search operations and house raids, the report said.
Tensions deepen
In a series of escalatory developments, Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir overnight on Tuesday were forced to retreat after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets.
On Tuesday, the Pakistan Army had shot down two Indian quadcopters after they violated the country’s airspace along the LoC in two separate areas of AJK, official sources said.
 
 

The same day, Modi told his armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”.
As ties between the arch-rival South Asian nations plummeted to new lows, raising security concerns, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan yesterday, with an official noting that the air routes pass “near Indian territories”.
In a tit-for-tat retaliation to Pakistan shutting its airspace for Indian-operated airlines, Indian also closed its airspace for all Pakistani planes until May 23.
Friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.
The United Nations chief, according to his spokesperson, has offered “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an incursion from India within the next 24-36 hours, diplomatic channels from other countries have been engaged to prevent a possible military confrontation.
A press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said COAS Munir visited the  Tilla Field Firing Ranges in Jhelum to witness “Exercise Hammer Strike”, a high-intensity, field training exercise conducted by the military’s Mangla Strike Corps.
Addressing the troops amid the exercise, the ISPR said the army chief reaffirmed the military’s “unyielding resolve” to defend the nation’s sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response. While Pakistan remains committed to regional peace, our preparedness and resolve to safeguard national interests is absolute,” he was quoted as saying by the ISPR.
It said the COAS lauded the “high morale, combat proficiency, and warfighting spirit” of the officers and troops, terming them the “embodiment of Pakistan Army’s operational excellence”. Senior military leadership, formation commanders and dignitaries from various services also witnessed the exercise.
“Exercise Hammer Strike stands as a testament to Pakistan Army’s pursuit of continuous transformation through rigorous training, doctrinal innovation, and technological modernisation,” the ISPR said.
It added that the exercise was meticulously designed to validate combat readiness, battlefield synergy and the operational integration of cutting-edge weapon systems under near-battlefield conditions. A diverse array of advanced capabilities, including multirole fighter aircraft, combat aviation assets, long-range precision artillery, and next-generation field engineering techniques, were employed to simulate conventional battlefield scenarios.
The ISPR said troops from all arms and services demonstrated “exceptional tactical cohesion, agility, and lethality during synchronised offensive manoeuvres — reflecting an extraordinary level of training and professionalism.
“Notably, the exercise showcased Pakistan Army’s increasing absorption of niche and emerging technologies to augment its kinetic and non-kinetic operational capabilities.”
 


A day ago, Pakistani officials had said the country would exercise restraint in the face of heightened tensions with India but warned it would respond “strongly” and “decisively” if attacked, invoking its right to self-defence under international law.
“Pakistan will not be the first one to resort to any escalatory move; however, in case of any escalatory move by the Indian side, we will respond very strongly,” Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a joint media briefing with military and Foreign Office spokespersons.
Dar said a similar message had been communicated to the international partners. “Any misadventure will be responded to in a befitting and decisive manner at the time and place of our choosing.”
“Our response would be befitting, decisive and assured,” ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said. “We are ready for all eventualities. If they choose military confrontation, that would be their choice, but we would then determine its (conflict’s) future direction.”
Gen Chaudhry emphasised that Pakistan’s armed forces were fully capable and prepared to defend the country across all domains. “We are vigilant and our response and counter-measures would be appropriate and decisive,” he said.
President, PM discuss security situation
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss the current security situation.
A statement from the President House said the two leaders expressed deep concern over India’s “belligerent attitude and provocative statements, which posed a threat to regional peace and stability”. They reaffirmed that Pakistan would never compromise on the country’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and would respond to any act of aggression in a “befitting manner”.
They stated that the Pakistani nation was united and stood behind its military which was capable of responding to any threat or aggression. They also reviewed Pakistan’s response to India’s “belligerent posture and any possible acts of aggression”.
The two also expressed regret over the Indian leadership’s accusations regarding the Pahalgam attack, noting that they were made without any investigation. It was highlighted in their talks that Pakistan had been a victim of terrorism, suffering immense human and economic losses for over two decades.
They said that the international community should take note of India’s involvement in funding, training and sending militants into Pakistan to carry out terrorist activities.
The statement said President Zardari commended the government’s response to Indian baseless accusations and handling of the situation in a responsible manner. He reaffirmed that Pakistan would take all necessary steps to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and vital national interests at all costs.
The two also highlighted the urgency of implementing United Nations Security Council resolutions to grant the Kashmiri people their right to self-determination, noting it would help bring lasting peace and stability to the region.
PM Shehbaz also enquired after the president’s health after his recovery from Covid-19.
FM Dar and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar were also present during the meeting.
Pakistan Army continues exercises as troops trade fire
Meanwhile, state-run Radio Pakistan shared a video, dated April 30 and dubbed with a patriotic song, showing the Pakistan Army conducting several exercises.
“Pakistan Army is continuing war exercises with full vigour,” the report said. It quoted security sources as saying the exercises included a “practical demonstration of modern weaponry in view of war strategy”.

According to security sources, the exercises included “practical demonstrations of modern weaponry in view of war strategy”. The sources said the primary objective of the war exercises was to deliver a strong and decisive response to any aggression from the enemy.
They emphasised that the Pakistan Army remained fully prepared at all times to give a crushing reply to any hostile action.
“Officers and soldiers are actively showcasing their professional capabilities during the drills,” Radio Pakistan stated.
Similarly, Radio Pakistan also shared a video showcasing the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) military prowess and capabilities, including the JF-17 Block III that other countries have also bought from Pakistan.
“PAF remains steadfast to defend [the] aerial frontiers of Pakistan,” the video captions said.
Radio Pakistan reported that the PAF “fully prepared and determined to deliver a crushing response to any aggression”.
Noting that the PAF was equipped with the latest fighter jets, the report said the air force had “always fulfilled its professional responsibilities with utmost efficiency and dedication for the integrity of Pakistan”.
“The PAF is renowned worldwide for its technical expertise and courageous reputation,” it added.
The Pakistan Navy has also released a video, titled ‘Ready at all times’, featuring Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.
“You must be battle-ready. The time has come to utilise our capabilities effectively,” Admiral Ashraf tells his troops in the video, which shows clips of various naval exercises.
“You get few opportunities to prove yourself. Our nation has a lot of expectations of us. We have to deliver, and deliver to the best possible efficiency before the enemy,” the naval chief says.
 


India’s navy today issued warnings for several firing drills in the Arabian Sea off the coasts of Maharashtra and Gujarat states. Gujarat shares a border with Pakistan.
The navy did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the warnings.
As tensions remain high, both countries’ troops reportedly exchanged small arms fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for the seventh night since April 25, Reuters said.
While there was no comment from Pakistan today, state media yesterday reported that the Pakistan Army responded to overnight unprovoked Indian firing on the LoC. No casualties have been reported so far.
‘They want to rob our water’: PPP’s Bilawal
Addressing a rally in Mirphurkhas on Thursday, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari accused the Indian PM of targeting the Indus, warning him that the people of Sindh would respond to any moves to strangle the river.
“Someone is robbing the [water of the] Indus once again — his name is Modi, the butcher of Gujarat,” Bilawal said, calling on PPP supporters to raise their voices to protect the Indus River on the international stage.
“We will raise our voices and protect our river from Modi,” he added.

Recounting his time as foreign minister, the Bhutto scion said that he raised the issue of India trying to reject the Indus Water Treaty on the international stage in the past.
“I protected the Indus as foreign minister,” he said. “After the attack in [occupied] Kashmir, they announced that they reject the Indus Waters Treaty. We reject their decision.
 


“We told them in Sukkur that they should understand that Pakistan is a peaceful country and Islam is a peaceful religion, we don’t want war,” he added.
However, Bilawal warned that if anyone attacks “our Indus River”, then it would be treated as an act of war.
“The Indus is more than just a river; it is our history and our culture,” he stated, adding that the river birthed the Indus Valley Civilisation 3,000 years ago.
“India’s culture is also linked with the river; they love the Indus for this reason,” he added. “We will not give their PM the opportunity to choke the Indus and we do not want war, but we are ready to fight until the end.
“If he targets our water, he will see whether the Indus flows with water or blood,” Bilawal warned.
US reiterates ‘responsible resolution’ of crisis
Fielding questions at a press briefing on Thursday, US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce reiterated the United States’ request for Pakistan and India to resolve the crisis responsibly.
Questioned about US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s call to PM Shehbaz and Indian Foreign Minister Subhramanyam Jaishankar, Bruce said the situation “continues to evolve” and that the US is monitoring the situation closely.
“As the president articulated to Prime Minister Modi last week, the United States stands strong with India against terrorism and … Modi has our full support,” she said, “The secretary encouraged both countries to work towards a … responsible resolution that maintains long-term peace and stability in South Asia.
“We continue to be in touch with the governments of both countries … at multiple levels,” she responded.
Answering a follow-up question, Bruce said that there is “constant involvement … communication” and that the US is asking for a responsible resolution from both countries.

Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the PICSS.
Pakistan also ranked second in March in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
According to a press release issued by PICSS today, the number of militant attacks fell by 22 per cent — from 105 in March to 82 in April — while fatalities and injuries declined by 63pc and 49pc, respectively.
It said that security forces intensified counterterrorism actions, killing at least 203 militants in various operations, making the majority (73pc) of the total fatalities in April.
“Only two civilians and two security personnel were killed in these operations,” the press release said.
“A total of 287 people were killed in April due to militant violence and security operations, down from 335 in March,” it said, adding that injuries dropped from 271 to 139.
Notably, the share of militant deaths rose, accounting for 203 out of 287 total fatalities — over 70pc, it said, adding that civilian and security force casualties remained minimal, with 30 and 32 fatalities, respectively.
It said that April marked the lowest monthly death toll among security forces since June 2024, while civilian deaths also dropped significantly, underscoring improved operational precision and threat containment.
According to the press release, PICSS attributed these improvements to proactive intelligence-led operations and enhanced border vigilance.
It said that the most consequential development of the month was a two-phase military operation near the Pak-Afghan border that targeted a large group of infiltrating militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
At least 71 militants were killed, making it the biggest loss suffered by the group in a single operation to date, it said.
Intelligence assessments suggest that the TTP attempted mass infiltration, miscalculating that Pakistani forces might be distracted by heightened tensions along the eastern border with India, it added.
 
 

It said that a disturbing trend identified by PICSS in April was the targeted killing of 13 members of local peace committees (razakars) — a community-based defence initiative that has historically resisted militant infiltration.
The resurgence of attacks on these volunteers, particularly in the tribal districts, suggests that groups like the TTP are attempting to reassert dominance by silencing local resistance structures, the press release said.
Breakdown by region
Mainland KP recorded 37 militant attacks in April — marginally down from 42 in March, it said.
However, fatalities from militant attacks and security forces’ actions combined declined from 124 in March to 65 in April — a 48pc reduction, it added.
The press release said that civilian deaths fell from 32 to 10, while security forces’ fatalities dropped from 30 to eight. Injuries also decreased from 65 to 45 — a 31pc decrease.
In the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), 17 attacks in were recorded April, slightly down from 18 in March.
It said that total fatalities from militant attacks and security forces’ actions increased significantly from 82 to 136 — a 66pc increase — driven by a sharp rise in militant deaths from 61 to 116.
It said that security forces’ deaths declined from 19 to seven, adding that injuries rose slightly from 50 to 55.
“The killing of 12 razakars, up from none in March, indicates a shift in militant targeting patterns,” it said.
“Balochistan witnessed 21 militant attacks in April, compared to 35 in March—a 40pc decline,” it added.
The press release said that combined fatalities from militant attacks and security forces’ actions dropped from 122 to 59 — a 52pc reduction.
It said that civilian deaths declined from 45 to 29, while security forces’ deaths fell from 37 to 16. Injuries also decreased from 148 to 32 — a 78pc drop.
“No suicide attacks were reported in April, in contrast to three in March, reflecting improved preventive measures,” it said.
For Punjab, the data said three attacks were recorded in April, down from seven in March — a 57pc decrease.
However, total deaths increased from six to 12, all of whom were militants, it said, adding that injuries rose from one to seven.
“TTP’s efforts to expand its footprint continued in Dera Ghazi Khan and Taunsa Sharif, where the group reportedly directed local farmers to pay ushr (Islamic tax on crops) to its representatives,” it said.
The press release said that Sindh experienced four attacks in April — up from three in March — but the overall impact remained limited.
“Fatalities rose slightly from one to four, all low-scale incidents. Injuries dropped from seven to none,” it said.
“No major claims were made by the Islamic State or Baloch groups during April, marking a quieter month in urban Sindh,” it said, adding that security forces arrested four suspected militants in the province.
“The federal capital remained peaceful in April, with no militant attacks reported for the second consecutive month,” it said; however, one preemptive counterterror operation led to the arrest of a suspected militant.</p><small>2025-05-01 19:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602736-pahalgam-attack-us-urges-pakistan-india-to-work-towards-responsible-resolution' target='_blank'><strong>Pahalgam attack: US urges Pakistan, India to work towards responsible resolution</strong></a><br><p>

“US sanctions on Iran during the nuclear talks are not helping the sides to resolve the nuclear dispute through diplomacy,” the official told Reuters.
“Depending on the US approach, the date of the next round of talks will be announced.”
Oman, which mediated earlier sessions of the US-Iran talks, said on Thursday the next round of nuclear discussions provisionally planned for May 3 would be rescheduled for “logistical reasons”.
However, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the US had never confirmed its participation in the fourth round of talks in Rome.
The source said the timing and venue of the next round of talks have yet to be confirmed but are expected in the near future.
Earlier on Thursday, Iran accused the US of “contradictory behaviour and provocative statements” after Washington warned Tehran of consequences for backing Yemen’s Houthis and imposed new oil-related sanctions on it in the midst of nuclear talks.
Separately, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran would continue to engage “seriously and resolutely” in result-oriented negotiations with the US, state media reported.
US President Donald Trump, who has threatened to attack Iran if diplomacy fails, has signalled confidence in clinching a new pact with the Islamic Republic that would block Tehran’s path to a nuclear bomb.
Trump, who has restored a “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran since February, ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six world powers in 2018 during his first term and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.
Iran has far exceeded the 2015 agreement’s curbs on its uranium enrichment since the US exited the pact, and European countries share Washington’s concern that Tehran could seek an atomic bomb. Iran says its programme is peaceful.
Iran and three European powers — Britain, France and Germany — were scheduled to meet in Rome on Friday to improve strained ties over Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme during this time of high-stakes talks between Tehran and Washington, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Wednesday.
However, the senior Iranian official who spoke to Reuters said on Thursday that it was now “not certain” whether Friday’s meeting would go ahead.
On Wednesday, Washington imposed sanctions on entities it accused of involvement in the illicit trade of Iranian oil and petrochemicals.
Separately, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned Iran that it would face consequences for supporting the Houthis, who control northern Yemen and have attacked ships in the Red Sea in what the group says is solidarity with the Palestinians.
Washington has been bombing the Houthis intensively since mid-March, hitting more than 1,000 targets. Tehran says the Houthis act independently.
China’s top diplomat backs Iran’s nuclear diplomacy
Yesterday, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a senior Iranian national security official that Beijing appreciated Tehran making diplomatic efforts regarding its nuclear programme.
“China values Iran’s commitment not to develop nuclear weapons” and “appreciates Iran’s diplomatic efforts”, Wang told Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, according to a readout of a meeting in Brazil and released by his ministry today.
“[China] is pleased to see ongoing dialogue between Iran and other parties and supports Iran’s necessary cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency,” Wang was quoted as saying.
China’s top diplomat worked with Shamkhani on the surprise 2023 deal restoring ties between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which analysts said signalled Beijing’s desire to be a diplomatic heavyweight in the Middle East.
But the crisis in Israel and Gaza, as well as Houthi rebels attacking commercial ships in the Red Sea, has sternly tested Beijing’s ability to continue to play a constructive role in handling global “hotspot issues”.</p><small>2025-05-01 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0121593008b72c3.jpg?r=220020' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907797/trump-cannot-use-alien-enemies-act-to-deport-venezuelans-judge-rules' target='_blank'><strong>Trump cannot use Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, judge rules</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s administration exceeded the scope of an 18th-century wartime law in using it to deport some Venezuelan migrants, a federal judge in Texas said on Thursday in barring the administration from using it to speed up deportations.
In a 36-page opinion, US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez ruled that the Trump administration could not rely on the Alien Enemies Act to detain and deport alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua because the gang’s presence in the United States was not an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” as contemplated by the law.
“The historical record renders clear that the President’s invocation of the AEA through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute’s terms,” wrote Rodriguez, who Trump appointed during his first term.
Neither the Justice Department nor the White House immediately responded to requests for comment.
Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to speed up the deportations of alleged Tren de Aragua members in mid-March, part of the Republican president’s push to crack down on immigration. The law is best known for being used to intern and deport people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War Two.
At least 137 Venezuelans were deported from the El Valle Detention Centre in Raymondville, Texas, under the law on March 15. Relatives of many of the men and their lawyers deny they were Tren de Aragua members, and say the deportees were not given the chance to contest the administration’s allegations.
The US Supreme Court on April 7 ruled that the Trump administration must give migrants the chance to contest any future Alien Enemies Act deportations in court.
Judges across the country have since issued temporary orders blocking such deportations in their districts.
Thursday’s preliminary injunction issued by Brownsville, Texas-based Rodriguez, whose district includes El Valle, is longer-lasting than the two-week temporary restraining orders that he and other judges in Colorado, Manhattan, and Pennsylvania had previously imposed.
White House national security adviser being forced out: reports
Meanwhile, Trump’s national security adviser Mike Waltz is being forced out of his job, four people briefed on the matter said on Thursday, in the first major shakeup of Trump’s inner circle since he took office in January.
Waltz’s deputy, Alex Wong, an Asia expert who was a State Department official focused on North Korea in Trump’s first term, is also leaving his post, two people told Reuters.
Waltz, a 51-year-old former Republican lawmaker from Florida, faced criticism inside the White House when he was caught up in a March scandal involving a Signal chat among top Trump national security aides.
It was not immediately clear who would take over from Waltz, but one option included US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been involved in both Russia-Ukraine diplomacy as well as the Middle East, one of the sources said.
Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau was also considered a possible option, the same person said.
The National Security Council did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-05-01 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/012029288a1c4e7.jpg?r=203010' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907788/8-family-members-killed-as-car-plunges-into-ravine-in-kps-lower-kohistan' target='_blank'><strong>8 family members killed as car plunges into ravine in KP’s Lower Kohistan</strong></a><br><p>Eight members of a family died when a Rawalpindi-bound Suzuki car plunged into a deep ravine in the Matta Banda area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower Kohistan district on Thursday afternoon, police said.
Station House Officer (SHO) Buland Iqbal told Dawn.com: “A family was returning from Gilgit Baltistan … and experienced the accident in the Matta Banda area. Four children, their father, mother, and two female [relatives] died.”
The SHO said the car fell from a height, killing all passengers on the spot.
The bodies were retrieved by the local people and Rescue 1122 and moved to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Pattan, he added.
Rescue 1122 district emergency officer Haroon Rasheed identified the adults as Asif Iqbal, Maimuna Iqbal, Ayesha Siddique and Bushra Iqbal.
He said the deceased were residents of Rawalpindi.
“Arrangements are being made to dispatch the bodies to Rawalpindi,” he told Dawn.com.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.
At least 10 people died and nine others were injured on April 15 when a speeding trailer ran over a Peshawar-bound van on the Indus highway in KP’s Karak district.
Five people were killed when a three-wheeler fell into a canal in the Gohati area of KP’s Swabi on April 7.
Three employees of a Chinese company working on the Dasu hydropower project were killed when a truck plunged into the Indus River in Upper Kohistan district on March 5.</p><small>2025-05-01 15:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602693-children-in-ajk-learn-emergency-drills-as-pakistan-india-tensions-rise' target='_blank'><strong>Children in AJK learn emergency drills as Pakistan-India tensions rise</strong></a><br><p>

The moves came nearly a week after Pakistan shut off its borders for any trade with India, including to or from a third country, in response to New Delhi’s measures following a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir. India, without proof, implied cross-border links, which Pakistan denied and instead sought a neutral probe.
A document shared by the foreign ministry today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, acknowledged a request made by the Afghan embassy in Islamabad on April 28 regarding containers stranded at different transit points in Pakistan.
“The ministry has the honour to inform that in view of the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the government of Pakistan has decided to permit stranded Afghan trucks, carrying goods in transit to India, which entered Pakistan before April 25, 2025, to cross Wagah Border for delivering the goods.
“The list of 150 trucks provided by the esteemed embassy has been transmitted to the concerned authorities,” the foreign ministry said.
Details of other stranded trucks, if any, may also be tared at the earliest, it added.
Islamabad decided to halt trade with New Delhi — including to and from any third country via Pakistan — during the National Security Committee meeting on April 24.
 
 

Trade between the two countries had already been suspended since February 2019, when New Delhi imposed steep duties on Pakistani imports after the Pulwama attack, which killed 40 Indian soldiers in Indian-occupied Kashmir.
That August, after New Delhi stripped occupied Kashmir of its special status by revoking Article 370, Pakistan formally downgraded trade ties with India to the level of Israel, with which it has no commercial relations.</p><small>2025-05-01 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602674-judges-rule-on-documents-justice-lies-with-god-justice-mandokhail' target='_blank'><strong>Judges rule on documents, justice lies with God: Justice Mandokhail</strong></a><br><p>
