The premier, who is on a state visit to Malaysia, made the remarks while addressing a joint presser alongside Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya.
PM Shehbaz began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation and called the country a “second home”.
“This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said.
“The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said.
PM Shebaz said that him and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and the two sides had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters.
“I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations.
“Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas.
“Today, I want to  make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said.
The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger and moving forward in unison by having win-win benefits,” he said.
He noted that Ibrahim had announced a quota of meat exports from Pakistan Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism.
“It  will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will  achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come it will increase and  have a quantum jump,” he said.
The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development.
“These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said.
PM Shehbaz concluded his remarks by saying that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”.
“When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before.
In his remarks, the Malaysian premier said acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities.
He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan while there was also an interest regarding importing meat. Calling Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
“Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said.
Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism.
He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestinian and Gaza issue.
“We jointly look favorably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald trump. Although Malaysia do express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave.
“Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said.
Prior to the press conference, the premier was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office.
 






According to Radio Pakistan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are also accompanying the premier.
Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’
The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.

From questions of provincial autonomy to disaster management, and now, calls to redraw the country’s internal boundaries, each of these discussions is rooted in legitimate concerns: unequal development, sluggish service delivery, and political imbalance. Yet too often, the solutions proposed are reactive, fragmented, or short-sighted.
Instead of piecemeal fixes like carving out new provinces, separating disaster functions, or rolling back devolution we need a deeper conversation about what kind of governance model Pakistan really needs. Because behind every institutional failure lies a more fundamental problem: a state that struggles to function effectively at both the centre and the grassroots.
 
 

The 18th Amendment in 2010, was hailed as a democratic milestone. The amendment was designed to empower provinces, dismantle centralised authority, and bring governance closer to the people. More than a decade later, however, it’s time to ask a difficult question: has the devolution of power come at the cost of effective policymaking? In reality it has led to uneven policy implementation across provinces, created jurisdictional ambiguity and exposed the institutional fragility of our system.
The provinces, suddenly saddled with vast responsibilities, were neither administratively equipped nor financially ready. The federal government, stripped of much of its role in social sectors, lacked the tools to coordinate national-level strategies. The result: fragmented policy, duplicated efforts, and weak implementation.

In times of crisis, we need clarity and a unified command not bureaucratic overlap.

But perhaps nowhere is this governance fragmentation more dangerous than in disaster management, particularly in the era of climate change. Pakistan faces one of the world’s highest risks from climate-induced disasters ranging from floods, heatwaves and glacial melts. And yet our disaster architecture remains stuck in reactive mode. Disaster management is not a linear process.
It spans risk assessment, early warning, preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation. Creating two separate institutions, one for risk reduction (National Disaster Risk Management Authority) and another for disaster response (NDMA) breaks this continuum. When a flood hits, will one authority manage the data and mapping while another handles evacuation and relief?
In times of crisis, we need clarity and a unified command not bureaucratic overlap and institutional finger-pointing. Global best practices point in a different direction. Countries like Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines — each facing frequent natural disasters have chosen integrated disaster management authorities, where risk reduction and response are handled under one roof. The UN’s Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction also emphasises the importance of mainstreaming risk into all phases of disaster management, not siloing it in a separate entity.
The third idea currently gaining traction in political circles is creating new provinces.
Pakistan has long wrestled with questions of federalism, representation, and administrative efficiency. One of the most persistent debates in this regard is whether the country’s large provinces, particularly Punjab, should be divided into smaller administrative units. On the surface, the argument makes sense: smaller provinces would presumably bring government closer to the people, reduce bureaucratic inertia, and help address long-standing grievances of regional neglect. But dig deeper, and it becomes clear that the issue is far more complex.
Beyond governance concerns, there’s the federal imbalance created by Punjab’s numerical dominance. With over 50 per cent of the country’s population, Punjab holds the largest number of seats in the National Assembly. This has long been a source of resentment among smaller provinces, who perceive Punjab’s dominance as a threat to equitable federalism.
However, proponents of smaller provinces often ignore the massive financial, political, and logistical costs involved. Each new province would require its own governor house, provincial assembly, cabinet, civil service, judiciary, police, and infrastructure. In a country already facing a serious fiscal crunch, this will add to the burden.
Worse still, the process of redrawing provincial boundaries is almost always politically charged. Demands for new provinces often follow ethnic, linguistic, or sectarian lines. Such identity-driven divisions risk deepening societal fractures, rather than healing them.
There’s also the constitutional hurdle. Under Article 239(4) of the Constitution, a new province can only be created with a two-thirds majority in the concerned provincial assembly. That effectively gives existing provincial power centres veto power over any proposed division. In other words, no new province is likely to be formed without the consent of the very political elites who stand to lose the most.
Rather than focusing solely on carving up provinces, perhaps the real solution lies in strengthening local governance. Pakistan’s districts and divisions can be empowered with administrative and financial autonomy, allowing for more responsive governance without the constitutional and political drama of redrawing provincial boundaries. Effective local government systems can serve the same purpose as smaller provinces. And unlike new provinces, empowering local governments doesn’t require constitutional amendments or new assemblies. It just requires political will.
Similarly, there’s a need for fairer resource distribution between and within provinces. Mechanisms like the National Finance Commission award must be revisited to ensure equitable development, particularly in neglected regions of larger provinces.
Pakistan’s real challenge is not geography, it’s governance. Creating new provinces without a serious plan for local empowerment, fiscal management, and political consensus could do more harm than good. Instead of redrawing maps, we should focus on redesigning the system that serves all citizens. Governance in Pakistan needs a reset, not in form, but in function. We need a system that delivers.

• State neglects its duties due to political expediency, remarks Anis Haroon
• Mehnaz Rehman cites low literacy levels and ignorance behind such killings
• IGP has directed police to conduct thorough investigations in such cases
KARACHI: Civil society and rights activists have expressed concerns over the poor enforcement of already existing laws to curb the menace of so-called “honour killings”, or karo-kari, amid an alarming surge in such cases in Sindh during the current year, with the majority of victims being women.
According to data, 142 people have been killed in Sindh this year (till September) under the pretext of karo-kari (honour killing), of whom 105 victims were women. The statistics paint a grim picture of gender-based violence deeply rooted in patriarchal norms and cultural justifications.
Data compiled by police reveals that in many of these cases, the perpetrators were the victims’ own family members. These included 38 husbands, 24 brothers, six fathers, and even sons, daughters, mothers, and sisters. Additionally, 46 extended relatives and seven individuals from outside the family, such as neighbours and friends, were also implicated.
 
 

Rights activists have stressed the urgent need for strict measures by the authorities to address this crisis.
Talking to Dawn, rights activist Anis Haroon said there were already sufficient laws to curb “honour killings” but the issue lay in their implementation. It was the responsibility of the state to enforce those laws, but the state “neglects its duties due to political expediency,” said Ms Haroon.
She pointed out that awareness among the public was increasing that so-called honour killing was not an honourable act but rather a crime.
About Sindh in particular, she said that the upper parts of the province were troubled areas where more work needed to be done along with strict enforcement of laws relating to honour killings. She also said that those who violated these laws were often “patronised” by the authorities.
‘Karo-kari has become an industry’
Mehnaz Rehman, a member of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, said that in honour killing cases, men often managed to escape punishment, while women were the ones who ended up being killed.
“I believe that karo-kari has become a kind of industry,” she said. “It involves blood money, compensation, and even the exchange of women through jirgas as part of settlements,” she added.
“Low literacy levels and ignorance are among the chief reasons behind such killings. An educated man would not commit such acts. Therefore, we need to educate people more and more on this issue,” she concluded.
Rights advocate and noted lawyer Sara Malkani emphasised the need for greater public awareness around these issues.
She said that the continued occurrence of such incidents highlighted the urgent need to strengthen protection mechanisms. “We must focus on providing shelter and safety, especially for women,” she said. “The police should prioritise their protection, and victims must feel safe and confident to approach law enforcement.”
‘Prevention of honour killings lies with provincial govt’
When contacted in this regard, a spokesperson for the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Sindh told Dawn that the prevention of cases related to so-called honour killings was primarily the duty of the provincial government.
“Police department is an investigative body. More work in this regard is to be done by the Sindh government to educate people and spread awareness in society that this [honour killing] is a wrong thing.”
“However, the IGP has directed the police to make such killings more punishable. Now, the SHOs themselves would register cases of honour killings.”
He referred to a recent review meeting held by IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon to examine, among other things, the karo-kari cases.
According to a statement issued after the meeting, it was decided that the investigation of karo-kari cases would be significantly strengthened through a structured and accountable approach. Each case will be registered under the complainantship of the SHO, and a DSP-rank officer will be appointed as the supervisory officer to ensure thorough oversight.
Officers were directed to prepare separate, detailed recommendations for each case, identifying any negligence, collusion, or procedural lapses, along with suggestions for disciplinary actions or punishments.

They also warned the government to refrain from endorsing any proposal, including the Abraham Accords, which they said was against the will of the Palestinian people.
Dozens of caravans from different parts of the city converged near the Nursery bus stop on Sharea Faisal, where they formed a mammoth rally addressed by leaders of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI).
Riding motorbikes, cars, buses and other modes of transport, the participants carried Palestinian flags and placards bearing images of Hamas leaders.

JI chief warns Islamabad against joining Abraham Accords

The march was organised by the party as a show of solidarity with Gaza, particularly in the backdrop of Israeli aggression against the Freedom Flotilla.
In his address, JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman made it clear to Islamabad that any paradigm shift in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine, set by none other than Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, would not be tolerated at any cost.
 
 

“Even decades ago, the All India Muslim League used to protest against Israel,” he said. “On March 23, 1940, two resolutions were passed by the Muslim League — one was the Pakistan Resolution and the other was for Palestine. There is only one state, and that is Palestine, and there is only one leadership in Gaza, and that is Hamas,” he said while urging the government to recognise Hamas and support it as the legitimate representative of the people of Gaza.
“Don’t dare to accept Israel or join the Abraham Accords,” he warned.
He said that the United States was directly responsible for the genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza and therefore had no right to deliver lectures on humanity.
The JI leader claimed that Israel had failed militarily in Gaza as it could not secure the release of its soldiers from Hamas and was, in fact, engaging with the group in one way or another to secure their freedom.
“Hamas is a resistance movement that represents the people of Gaza. However, the ruling class here is not even willing to mention Hamas by name because they fear any movement that originates from the people. The ruling elite dislikes any movement that opposes the US and Israel,” the JI chief added.
He also stressed the need for another UN, saying the current one had become a total failure and an “agent” of the US and Israel, having never resolved the issues faced by Muslims.
He was of the view that the massacre in Palestine happened not because of Hamas, but because of the cowardly Muslim rulers.
“We want to tell the rulers and opposition parties of Pakistan to abandon hypocrisy and double standards. The people of Gaza and Hamas must be accepted, and Hamas offices must be opened in Pakistan,” he said.
He also called on Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, currently in Adiala Jail, to express solidarity with Hamas and condemn Israel and the US.
“From Karachi’s Keamari to the mountains of Chitral, the public is united in one voice: we will not accept slavery to America,” he said.
“Greta Thunberg was tortured and forced to kiss the Israeli flag — this is the real face of the Zionist state,” he added.
Other leaders, including Dr Osama Razi, Monem Zafar and Advocate Saifuddin, also addressed the rally.

His plan was cautiously welcomed across the world in the hope that it might end the two-year war. But it was accompanied by doubts whether it would lead to an agreement, be implementable and bring about lasting peace.
The proposal seeks an immediate ceasefire, exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, disarmament of Hamas, deployment of a stabilisation force and gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The plan’s present 20 points advantage Israel, which is why many Palestinians and others saw it as a formula to secure Israel’s goals and objectives.
Some of the eight Muslim countries consulted by Trump, including Pakistan, walked back their earlier enthusiasm by pointing out that the plan announced by the US president wasn’t what he discussed with them in New York. It was apparent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had prevailed on Trump to make significant changes in the plan, infuriating Arab officials involved in negotiations.
This explains Netanyahu’s upbeat remarks at the joint presser with Trump where he said Israel’s war aims are achieved by the plan: for Hamas to be disarmed, Gaza demilitarised and no future Palestinian state to be established.
Subsequently, in a video message in Hebrew he said Israeli forces “will remain in most of the territory” as part of Trump’s plan, and that Israel did “absolutely not” agree to a Palestinian state.
Make-or-break for the peace process was how Hamas would respond to Trump’s plan. Its qualified response was one of constructive ambiguity. The Palestinian group said it accepted some elements of Trump’s plan but made it clear it sought further negotiations on other terms.
In its statement it expressed readiness “to release all occupation captives — both living and the remains — according to the exchange formula outlined in President Trump’s proposal” and create the field conditions for this. Hamas offered to hand over power to “a Palestinian body of independent technocrats based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing”.
It also set out conditions, saying aspects of Trump’s plan concerning Gaza’s future and Palestinians’ “inalienable rights” would have to be decided after consultation with other Palestinian factions on the basis of a “unanimous national position and relevant international laws and resolutions”.

Tough negotiations lie ahead which have to overcome many obstacles.

President Trump swiftly welcomed Hamas’s statement, flipping from his previous threatening posture (of “all hell” breaking out if Hamas didn’t accept his plan) to declaring he believed Hamas was “ready for a lasting peace”. He called on Israel to immediately stop the bombing and in a video message, said “Everybody was unified in wanting this war to end and seeing peace in the Middle East, and we’re very close to achieving that.” Israel’s initial response was to say it was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of the plan for the prompt release of all hostages.
Intense negotiations lie ahead with many obstacles to overcome and, if agreement is to be reached, concessions for all sides to make. Among the terms Hamas would want to negotiate are details of the Israeli withdrawal and deployment of an international stabilisation force under Trump’s plan.
Hamas’s statement didn’t say anything about the demand for its disbandment. But its position was clearly articulated by a top Hamas official, Mousa Abu Marzouk in an interview with Al Jazeera. He said Hamas would only hand over weapons “if the occupation ends and Palestinians can govern themselves”.
 
 

In its present shape, the Trump plan is light on detail and vague on core issues. The only timeline specified in the proposal is that 72 hours after the agreement is concluded all hostages are to be released. Once they are freed there is no guarantee Netanyahu, untrustworthy as he is, will abide by the rest of the agreement. There is no provision in the plan for a permanent ceasefire.
 
 

No timelines or deadline are given for the phased Israeli withdrawal, which is linked to Gaza’s ‘demilitarisation’, whose progress the US and Israel will determine. Nor is it assured that the withdrawal will be comprehensive. The provision for an Israeli “security perimeter presence” until Gaza is “secure from any resurgent terror threat” is a recipe for indefinite stay by Israeli forces in the territory.
This hardly holds out the assurance of an end to Israeli occupation and permanent withdrawal even if the plan says “Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza”. These terms would have to be renegotiated if Hamas is to come fully on board with the US plan. Trump says Israel has agreed to an ‘initial withdrawal line’ in Gaza, which awaits a nod from Hamas for the ceasefire to take effect. But this will only be a tentative and fragile start to a complicated process.
Details about the international stabilisation force (ISF) will also need to be fleshed out. Will the international stabilisation force have a role in demilitarisation? Its mandate, rules of engagement and exact role and responsibilities will have to be clarified and agreed on. What the plan says is that it will “work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas” (Pakistan should take note as it is said to be considering contributing troops to this force). The plan suggests its role will also be to “prevent munitions from entering Gaza”.
The most controversial part of the Trump plan are the governance arrangements. A committee of Palestinian technocrats and international experts are to be responsible for daily governance. It will be supervised by an “international transitional body” called the “Board of Peace”, headed by Trump himself and including former British prime minister Tony Blair. Palestinians rightly see this as a colonial project that harkens back to the US-British occupation of Iraq. It robs the Palestinians of agency and negates any notion of the Palestinians determining their own future.
The big hole in the plan, consistent with Netanyahu’s vision, is the absence of any provision for a Palestinian state or a two-state solution (supported by almost the entire world but opposed by the US and Israel). There is a vague formulation of a “pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” but conditioned on the Palestinian Authority implementing (unspecified) reforms, that presumably meet US/ Israeli benchmarks.
It is on these elements that consensus will arguably be the most challenging to evolve. The outcome will depend on how much pressure Trump will exert on Netanyahu and whether enough trust can be built among the parties. The hope is that this doesn’t become a lost opportunity for peace.

Yet the true advantage of this shift will not be decided in international forums but in whether stability can be translated into an effective economic recovery and sustained growth.
At the heart of this challenge lies the country’s human resource base. Exports, investment, and competitiveness cannot rely solely on natural resources or borrowed capital; they depend on the capacity of Pakistan’s human resource base to transform and drive an export-led economy based on both a competitive industrial base and value-added services.
We must learn from the emerging economies. Global experience demonstrates that the path to prosperity lies in skills and efficiency. Vietnam embedded training centres inside its industrial parks, producing workers tailored to industry needs. Within two decades, it scaled garments and electronics before moving into higher technology exports.
Bangladesh harnessed women’s participation as a competitive advantage, training millions for garment and later IT services, lifting exports above $40 billion. Malaysia institutionalised consistency through its Economic Planning Unit, aligning skills, industry priorities, and foreign investment across political cycles.

By investing in its people, Pakistan’s exports can be boosted, imports replaced, investment attracted, and income per capita increased

Rwanda, with no resource base, has demonstrated how governance and inclusion could turn Information and Communication Technology, tourism, and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) into national strengths. The lesson is clear: sustainable growth is not only about natural wealth but about human efficiency, technology adoption, and scale.
Pakistan has significant human capital gaps. Shortages exist across the spectrum of vocational training: electricians, welders, dairy specialists, logistics supervisors, nurses, and care workers.
Even basic skills like English communication, problem-solving, and compliance literacy are scarce. Women’s participation stands at just 22 per cent, one of the lowest globally, holding back both competitiveness and household incomes. Academia and industry remain disconnected, with outdated curricula failing to produce graduates who are market-ready and skilled.
To address these gaps, Pakistan should establish a Human Capital and Skills Development Board (HCSDB) under the Federal Government, with provinces and industry as equal partners.
 
 

Governance should be led by federal chairs, with representation from provincial governments, technocrats, academia, industry leaders, and chambers.
The mandate should align training with export demand or import substitution, ensure skills-transfer clauses in existing and potential foreign investments, and integrate human resource planning into the national economic recovery plan.
Multinationals already operating in Pakistan should be engaged, seeking their help to support training programmes, apprenticeships, and internships. Universities and technical institutes should collaborate to co-create curricula with industry, establish joint research labs, and align certifications with international standards.
Digital and IT should be one of the key areas of focus, with a talent ladder that spans from digital literacy and BPO to coding, analytics, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. Relocating BPO operations to second-tier cities would absorb youth and women while boosting IT and services exports.
Training in farm mechanisation, cold-chain logistics, and food certification can increase yields, reduce waste, and expand exports of fruit pulp, dairy products, halal protein, and processed foods. Skilled manpower in agro-processing will also strengthen food security.
Skilled engineers, technicians, and workers can raise quality, lower costs, and boost local employment. Every industrial cluster should be tied to nearby universities and technical institutes, creating live training pipelines linked to actual jobs.
Policy must reshape incentives around skills. Tax credits should be offered to firms that train and hire certified workers, with higher credits for women and new entrants. Exporters who expand certified employment should receive wage-support incentives tied directly to incremental export revenues. Training vouchers should only be redeemable upon verified job placement.
A National Job Exchange should connect certified candidates to employers in Pakistan and abroad, with streamlined visa and relocation processes. A Digital Skills ID should record credentials and job history, recognised globally.
Planning and delivery must be disciplined. The HCSDB should operate with concrete mandates and measurable outcomes. Subject-matter experts, drawn from both global corporates and Pakistani academia with strong industrial linkages, must guide execution with number-oriented deliverables.
In the short term, the aim should be to launch the skills authority, publish a live demand dashboard, and embed training in special economic zones.
In the medium term, the goal could be to certify 250,000 workers annually, place at least 150,000 into jobs, and add $2bn in IT and BPO exports. The country’s human resources development plan must be approved by parliament, ensuring continuity across political cycles.
By investing in its people, Pakistan can boost exports, replace high-cost imports, attract investment, increase per capita incomes, and lay the groundwork for a recovery that is not temporary but transformative.

With age, passions cool and ardour subsides. Patience becomes a virtue, action an aberration.
Litigating in the courts of Pakistan is similarly solid preparation for the travails of old age. Fairly early in one’s career, one learns to suffer days of inaction and the art of doing nothing, while maintaining a façade of activity.
Nearly a year after the 26th Amendment was enacted, the most important constitutional case of this century has been set down for hearing – an exhausting wait, even by our uninspiring standards.
There have been many cases, and some of great importance, but none whose outcome may pose an existential threat to the independence of the judiciary, or revive it as a co-equal institution of state. Indeed, the outcome will determine our constitutional landscape for the foreseeable future.

Through JCP, govt is party to the composition and tenure of every constitutional bench; while simultaneously being a party in every case before these same benches. This is sufficient to impact the confidence of the ordinary litigant in the independence of the judiciary

The petitions raise many issues; and others will inevitably arise. These will include the appointment of judges, including chief justices of high courts and the chief justice of Pakistan; the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP); and, the propriety of lawyer-members of the JCP appearing as counsel to plead before the very judges they appoint, confirm, transfer and promote.
These, and many other such important questions, though ostensibly important, are actually peripheral. It bears reiterating that what lies at the heart of the matter is the survival of the judiciary as an institution, independent of the government. Pivotal in this is the role assigned to the Constitutional Benches – Article 191A envisages that there can be more than one.
It is beyond debate that after the 26th Amendment, these are the most important benches in the Supreme Court. These benches – to the exclusion of all other judges, including the chief justice of Pakistan – have the exclusive jurisdiction to decide all appeals from every high court, challenging the constitutionality of a law, or raising any substantial question of law regarding the interpretation of the Constitution. Every plea of a citizen for the enforcement of his fundamental rights, and every action to prevent overreach of the leviathan is within their domain.
Every case originating in the Supreme Court, references by the president on critical legal and constitutional matters for the court’s advisory opinion, disputes between provinces, or between one or more provinces and the Federation, can be adjudicated only by them.
The chief justice of Pakistan is still the titular head of the judiciary. But in the adjudication of all matters of critical national and constitutional importance – which impact the state and affect the nation – he has no say. He is a mere bystander; sadly irrelevant both to the process and to the determination which follows. In the words of Matthew Arnold, “a beautiful and ineffectual angel, beating in the void his luminous wings in vain”.
Of even greater significance than the marginalisation of the chief justice is the independence of these benches. Security of tenure is one of the main pillars of judicial independence, but the amendment takes a wrecking ball to it. The benches comprise “such Judges of the Supreme Court and for such term as may be nominated and determined by” the JCP.
The judges of the Supreme Court are appointed till they reach the age of 65, or are removed on the recommendation of their peers.
The roster (assignment of cases) has always been an exclusively judicial preserve. After judges have started hearing a case, even the chief justice, once considered the ‘master of the roster’, had no authority to reassign that case to another bench. Any executive or legislative interference in such matters being an infringement of the doctrine of separation of powers, is incontestably unconstitutional.
The JCP, a majority of whose members are not judges of the Supreme Court, can however change the composition of the bench at will. There is nothing to prevent it from doing so mid-hearing.
In the hierarchy of our courts, a civil judge stands at the lowest rung of the judicial ladder. But even he cannot be so shunted around. This is a bird’s eye view of the impact of the 26th amendment on the independence of the bench.
Now for a worm’s eye view: the government is a party to every decision of the JCP regarding the composition and tenure of the constitutional benches. The government is also a party in every case before these benches.
This is sufficient to impact the confidence of the ordinary litigant in the independence of the judiciary. Erosion of trust in the impartiality of judges will follow. When that happens, institutional rigor mortis will set in.

After the Pahalgam episode, the BJP-led government has gone into overdrive to demonise Pakistan, aided by hawkish elements in the Indian media. Perhaps its performance on the battlefield — or lack thereof — during the May skirmishes and the global community’s unwillingness to buy New Delhi’s anti-Pakistan narrative have, along with Islamabad’s diplomatic successes, been a major reason for India’s frustration.
Hence its rulers are intent on sabre-rattling to cover up their inadequacies. Two senior Indian military officials made deplorable remarks recently, which only further vitiate the atmosphere. The Indian army chief, while speaking to his troops, said his country would not show ‘restraint’ and that “the opportunity will come soon”, while threatening this country. India’s air chief said that his forces had shot down several Pakistani jets during Operation Sindoor, when there is no evidence to back his delusional claim.
 
 

It is clear that India’s military men get their cue from their politicians and bureaucrats. For example, there were several terse exchanges between Pakistani and Indian officials at last month’s UN General Assembly. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while defending Pakistan’s military actions during the May clashes, held out the offer of “comprehensive dialogue” with India.
New Delhi’s foreign minister used the same platform, without naming Pakistan, to criticise “a neighbour” as the “epicentre of global terrorism”. Meanwhile, in remarks that were definitely not cricket, the Indian prime minister, following his country’s Asia Cup victory, termed the result “Operation Sindoor on the games field”.
Some commentators believe that the continued hostility towards Pakistan serves domestic political interests in India by shoring up the rabid Hindutva political base, as well as grabbing votes in close elections, such as the Bihar state polls due next month.
Whatever the Indian ruling party’s motivations, its ill-advised rhetoric is making chances for peace in the subcontinent more and more remote. At one time, hawkish lobbies in Pakistan resisted peace with India. Today, the Indian state itself, backed by an array of far-right Hindu groups and pliant supporters in the media, wants to isolate Pakistan.
Once India realises that its efforts to demonise this country will fail, and that the only sustainable path for South Asia’s people is peaceful coexistence, it is welcome to call Pakistan. All outstanding issues can and should be addressed in a frank dialogue.
Until then, Pakistan must remain on alert, and remind belligerent voices in India that it will defend itself, just as it did during New Delhi’s unprovoked aggression earlier this year.

Every summer, citizens brace for rolling blackouts as peak shortfalls rise into the thousands of megawatts. Behind the flickering lights lies a deeper malaise: circular debt in the power sector that has ballooned into trillions of rupees, an import bill for petroleum that drains over $15 billion annually, and a grid so inefficient that nearly a fifth of generated electricity is lost before it reaches consumers. This is not an energy system — it is a fiscal black hole.
Successive governments have tried patchwork fixes, but the crisis has only deepened. Today, the installed capacity of Pakistan’s power system stands at around 46,000 megawatts, yet average actual generation hovers closer to 14,000 to 15,000 megawatts.
The reasons are depressingly familiar: underutilised plants, poor transmission, losses from theft, and above all, the crushing weight of contracts with independent power producers (IPPs) that guarantee capacity payments in hard currency, regardless of whether electricity is generated or consumed. These “take-or-pay” contracts lock the government into paying billions each year even when demand falls short, a structural flaw that feeds directly into the circular debt cycle.
That cycle is staggering. By mid-2025, the government itself acknowledged stockpiles of circular debt in the range of Rs1.6–2.4 trillion. To keep the system afloat, it has had to negotiate a Rs1.275tr (about $4.5bn) bank facility — essentially new borrowing to pay old obligations.

Small modular reactors offer flexibility — a unit can be deployed to power an industrial cluster, a remote mining operation, or even a desalination plant

In effect, Pakistan is mortgaging its future to keep the lights on today. Meanwhile, the annual energy import bill remains in the $15–18bn range, a constant drain on foreign reserves that leaves the economy exposed to global oil shocks.
 
 

Against this bleak backdrop, panels have spread across rooftops and farms, cutting diesel costs and reducing dependency on erratic grid supply. On the surface, this looks like a climate-friendly success. But the picture beneath is more complicated — and more dangerous.
A Reuters investigation earlier this year reported that some 650,000 solar-powered tube wells are now in operation, allowing farmers to pump groundwater at virtually no cost. The result has been an explosion of water-intensive crops like rice, with cultivation expanding by roughly 30 per cent between 2023 and 2025, even as groundwater levels in Punjab plunged to critical depths.
 
 

This is the solar paradox: free energy has removed the natural restraint that diesel once imposed. Instead of conserving scarce water, it has enabled farmers to pump around the clock, accelerating aquifer depletion and threatening Pakistan’s long-term food security. The unintended consequence is that a “green” energy boom is undermining the very resource base on which agriculture depends.

However, SMRs are not an off-the-shelf solution —  commercial rollouts are still at an early stage global and financing will be complex with safety and oversight non-negotiable

Pakistan, then, faces a trilemma: unaffordable energy, unsustainable debt, and vanishing water. What is the way out?
It lies not in abandoning renewables, but in anchoring them with a technology that can provide clean, reliable, round-the-clock power without over-pumping aquifers or draining foreign exchange. That technology is nuclear power — but not in the old model of massive, decades-long megaprojects.
Instead, Pakistan should look seriously at small modular reactors (SMRs) and portable microreactors.
SMRs are designed to be built in factories, shipped in modules, and installed faster and at lower upfront cost than traditional reactors. They offer flexibility: a unit can be deployed to power an industrial cluster, a remote mining operation, or even a desalination plant.
Unlike solar, they are not hostage to the sun’s cycles; unlike gas, they are not tethered to volatile global markets. Nuclear fuel costs are a relatively small share of operating expenses, making reactors far less sensitive to price swings than oil or LNG plants. Some SMR designs also use closed-loop or air-cooled systems, reducing the heavy water demands of conventional plants and making them compatible with arid regions.
For Pakistan, the advantages are compelling. An SMR programme would diversify the energy mix, reduce the dependence on imported fuels, and add dependable baseload power that could stabilise the grid.
It would also strengthen energy sovereignty by building on existing nuclear expertise: Pakistan already operates several large nuclear plants with the support of international partners and has a trained cadre of engineers and regulators. Extending that capability into microreactors is a logical next step.
The challenges are real. SMRs are not an off-the-shelf solution; commercial rollouts are still at an early stage globally, and financing will be complex. Safety, waste management, and international oversight must be non-negotiable. But none of these hurdles are insurmountable.

The assembly’s formation is set to consolidate the power of Sharaa, whose forces led a coalition that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December after more than 13 years of civil war.
Dozens of members of the local committees were queueing at Syria’s National Library, formerly called the Assad National Library, to cast their vote.
According to the organising committee, more than 1,500 candidates — just 14 per cent of them women — are running for the assembly, which will have a renewable 30-month mandate.

Assembly’s formation is set to consolidate the power of Al Sharaa

Sharaa is to appoint 70 representatives out of the 210-member body. The other two-thirds will be selected by local committees appointed by the electoral commission, which itself was appointed by Sharaa.
But southern Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida province, which suffered sectarian bloodshed in July, and the country’s Kurdish-held northeast are excluded from the process for now as they are outside Damascus’s control, and their 32 seats will remain empty.
“I support the authorities and I’m ready to defend them, but these aren’t real elections,” said Louay al-Arfi, 77, a retired civil servant sitting with friends at a Damascus cafe.
“It’s a necessity in the transitional phase, but we want direct elections” to follow, he said.
Under a temporary constitution announced in March, the incoming parliament will exercise legislative functions until a permanent constitution is adopted and new elections are held.
Sharaa has said it would be impossible to organise direct elections now, noting the large number of Syrians who lack documentation after millions fled abroad or were displaced internally during the civil war.
Final list likely to be out today
Around 6,000 people are taking part in Sunday’s selection process.
Preliminary results are expected to emerge after it ends, with state TV reporting that some centres started counting the votes.
The final list of names is due to be announced on Monday.
Under the rules, candidates must not be “supporters of the former regime” and must not promote secession or partition. Those running include Syrian-American Henry Hamra, the first Jewish candidate since the 1940s.
“The next parliament faces significant responsibilities, including signing and ratifying international agreements. This will lead Syria into a new phase, and it is a major responsibility,” said Hala al-Qudsi, Damascus’s electoral committee member running for a seat herself.
She was focused on the ongoing talks between Syria and Israel, stating that she would “say ‘no’ to any security agreement with Israel that does not serve the interests of the Syrian people”.
In September, Sharaa voiced hope for a security agreement with Israel.
Rights groups have criticised the selection process, saying it concentrates power in Sharaa’s hands and lacks representation for the country’s ethnic and religious minorities.
In a joint statement last month, more than a dozen groups said the process means Sharaa “can effectively shape a parliamentary majority composed of individuals he selected or ensured loyalty from”.

The government initiative follows Thursday’s deadly knife and car-ramming attack on a synagogue in the northwestern city of Manchester.
A pro-Palestinian demonstration in central London went ahead on Saturday despite pleas from Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the capital’s Metropolitan Police to delay it.
The government said police would be authorised to consider the “cumulative impact” of protests when deciding to impose limits on protesters.

London witnesses huge rally despite Starmer’s appeal for postponement

“The right to protest is a fundamental freedom in our country. However, this freedom must be balanced with the freedom of their neighbours to live their lives without fear,” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in a statement.
Over 1,000 people took part in Saturday’s protest in London’s Trafalgar Square with nearly 500 people arrested for showing supporting for the banned Palestine Action campaign group.
Organisers rejected calls not to gather saying they “stood in solidarity” with the Jewish community over the Manchester attack but that “cancelling peaceful protests lets terror win”.
A day earlier, Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy was booed at a vigil for the Jewish victims of the synagogue attack.
“Large, repeated protests can leave sections of our country, particularly religious communities, feeling unsafe, intimidated and scared to leave their homes,” Mahmood claimed.
“This has been particularly evident in relation to the considerable fear within the Jewish community.” Questioned by a BBC television interviewer about the Jewish community’s repeated warnings about the dangers they face, Mahmood admitted she was “very worried about the state of community relations in our country”.
The home secretary added, speaking to Times Radio, that there was a broad “problem of a rise not only in anti-Semitism but in other forms of hatred as well”.
“There are clearly malign and dark forces running amok across our country,” she asserted
Police shot dead assailant Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old UK citizen of Syrian descent, within minutes of the alarm being raised on Thursday.
One person died in the attack outside the synagogue in north Manchester.
Another died after suffering a fatal gunshot, believed by police to have been fired by armed officers as they tackled Shamie.
Three people who were seriously injured remain in hospital, including one who is also believed to have been accidentally hit by police fire.
Counter terrorism police have been granted more time to detain four people arrested on suspicion of terrorism-linked offences over the incident.

CAIRO: Hamas on Sunday called for a swift start to a prisoner exchange with Israel, as negotiators from both sides prepare to meet in Egypt today (Monday) for crucial talks aimed at ending the nearly two-year-long Israeli invasion of Gaza.
Foreign ministers of several countries, including Egypt, said the talks were a “real opportunity” to achieve a sustainable ceasefire.
“Hamas is very keen to reach an agreement to end the war and immediately begin the prisoner exchange process in accordance with the field conditions,” a senior official told AFP.
The diplomatic push follows the group’s flexible response to US President Donald Trump’s roadmap to end the fighting and secure the release of captives held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.
Ahead of the discussions in Egypt, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza.
“You can’t release (prisoners) in the middle of strikes, so the strikes will have to stop,” Rubio told CBS News. “There can’t be a war going on in the middle of it.”
Negotiators are due to gather in Sharm El-Sheikh, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressing the hope that the prisoners could be released within days.
Cairo confirmed it would be hosting a delegation from Hamas for talks on “the ground conditions and details of the exchange of all Israeli detainees and Palestinian prisoners”.
The White House said Trump had also sent two envoys to Egypt — his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East negotiator Steve Witkoff.
“During communications with mediators, Hamas insisted that it is essential for Israel to halt military operations across all areas of the Gaza Strip, cease all air, reconnaissance, and drone activity, and withdraw from inside Gaza City,” a Palestinian source close to Hamas said, adding that the group would “also halt their military operations” in parallel.
 
 

According to Trump’s plan, in return for the prisoners, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinian prisoners with life sentences and more than 1,700 detainees from the Gaza Strip who were arrested after the war began.
‘Complete obliteration’
But Trump has warned he will “not tolerate delay” from Hamas, urging the group to move quickly towards a deal “or else all bets will be off”.
“When Hamas confirms, the Ceasefire will be IMMEDIATELY effective, the Hostages and Prisoner Exchange will begin, and we will create the conditions for the next phase of withdrawal,” he posted on Truth Social.
He also said Hamas will face “complete obliteration” if the group refuses to give up power and control of Gaza, Reuters reported.
When asked if Netanyahu is on board with ending the bombing in Gaza and supporting the US’ broader vision, Trump told CNN on Saturday, “Yes on Bibi.”
In the interview that aired on Sunday, Trump added that he expects to soon know whether Hamas is committed to peace.
He also said talks on implementing a truce for Gaza will take days. “They’re in negotiations right now as we speak. They’ve started the negotiations. It’ll last a couple of days,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We’ll see how it turns out. But I’m hearing it’s going very well,” he added.
Strikes continue
Meanwhile, Israel has continued to carry out strikes on Gaza, in spite of the US calls for a pause. Footage showed thick smoke billowing over the skyline over the coastal territory on Sunday.
Gaza’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas authority, said Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people in Gaza on Sunday, after several attacks through the night.
“The decision to occupy Gaza, the collapse of multi-storey buildings, and the intensity of IDF operations in the city have led to the evacuation of roughly 900,000 residents to the south, creating immense pressure on Hamas and the countries that support it,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a speech on Sunday.
 
 

The UN estimates that around one million people were living in the area before the assault began.
“There has been a noticeable decrease in the number of air strikes (since last night). The tanks and military vehicles have slightly pulled back, but I believe this is a tactical move, not a withdrawal,” said Muin Abu Rajab, 40, a resident of Al-Rimal neighbourhood in Gaza City.
Hayya appears on TV
Before arriving at Cairo, Hamas’ top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya broke his silence during a pre-recorded statement that aired in Qatar overnight, in his first televised appearance since Israel targeted him and other leaders of the group in Doha last month.
The Hamas leader remained defiant in the interview, saying he drew no distinction between those killed in the attack on Doha, including his son, and the tens of thousands who have died during the nearly two years of devastating war in Gaza.
“We hope that their blood will pave the way to victory, the way to Jerusalem, the way to the disgrace of the occupation, and the way to the dignity and triumph of the nation,” he said in the video aired by Al Araby Television Network in Qatar.
Hope for sustainable ceasefire
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of several Islamic countries on Sunday welcomed the latest developments over Gaza, affirming that these represented a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in the Gaza Strip, APP reported.
Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding Trump’s proposal to end the war in Gaza, said a joint statement of the foreign ministers, shared by the foreign office spokesperson with the media.
The foreign ministers also welcomed the US president’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing and to begin implementation of the exchange agreement. They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region.
They also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Com­mittee of independent technocrats.
Pakistani citizens
Also on Sunday, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was actively engaged with its international partners to ensure the safety and prompt repatriation of its citizens who were illegally detained by the Israeli occupying forces.
In response to media inquiries concerning Pakistani nationals aboard the Sumud flotilla, the spokesperson said in a statement, “Through the diplomatic channels of a friendly European country, we have confirmed that former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan is in the custody of the Israeli occupying forces and is safe and in good health.”
 
 

He added, “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, Senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.”

Both countries can gain far more from their pact if they also lay the foundation of a joint growth strategy built on agriculture, energy, labour, industry, and infrastructure. Encouragingly, 2025 has already seen a shift: financial aid is giving way to strategic investment.
In March, Riyadh signed a $1.2 billion deferred oil facility, releasing $100m monthly until February 2026. Islamabad is also seeking a rollover of $5bn Saudi loans — $2bn maturing in December 2025 and $3bn in June 2026 — at a concessional 4 per cent interest rate.
A Saudi business delegation is coming this month to explore ventures in energy, information technology (IT), agriculture, finance, semiconductors, and food, according to media sources.
The Special Investment Facilitation Council has streamlined processes, contributing to a 22pc rise in Pakistani exports to Saudi Arabia, now worth over $700m. Analysts see this as the end of the “aid era,” with investment flows aligned with Riyadh’s Vision 2030.

Islamabad’s long-term security will not come from arms alone, but from embedding itself in the broader Gulf economic transformation

Saudi Arabia remains one of Pakistan’s top trading partners, with annual trade fluctuating between $5bn and $6bn depending on oil prices. Yet the trade basket is narrow. Oil and petroleum dominate Pakistan’s imports, while exports are mostly rice, textiles, leather, and surgical goods. Untapped opportunities exist in pharmaceuticals, IT-enabled services, and processed agriculture. But weak planning, low productivity, and the absence of preferential agreements keep trade stagnant.
Riyadh’s sovereign wealth funds are expanding into infrastructure, mining, and technology. But Pakistan has captured little of this capital. Pledges such as the $10bn refinery announced in 2019 have also suffered delays in the past due to political instability, regulatory bottlenecks, and weak contract enforcement.
Islamabad claims to have removed many legal and administrative hurdles, though concerns over local rights and political stability remain unresolved. Pakistan’s hybrid regime must address these issues, starting with improving its polarised domestic climate.
 
 

If Pakistan modernises its agriculture — with better seeds, efficient irrigation, and cold-chain networks — it could become a key anchor for Saudi food supply. Gulf investment in Pakistani farms and processing facilities could, in turn, uplift rural livelihoods.
Energy is an equally pressing domain. Under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is investing heavily in renewables, hydrogen, and smart cities. Pakistan remains mired in energy crises, circular debt, and costly fossil-fuel imports. The overlap is obvious: Riyadh needs partners to expand its green portfolio, while Islamabad needs affordable, sustainable energy. Pakistan’s solar and wind corridors could attract Saudi capital, with Islamic green bonds offering innovative financing. Yet no major renewable venture has materialised so far.
Remittances from Saudi Arabia remain a lifeline. In FY25, Pakistani workers in the Kingdom sent home more than $9.3bn. But of the 2.5 million Pakistanis employed there, most hold low- or semi-skilled jobs. As Saudi Arabia automates and shifts to knowledge industries, this model is becoming obsolete.
Without re-skilling, Pakistan risks losing its place in Riyadh’s labour market. Joint vocational centres and digital academies could prepare Pakistanis for healthcare, IT, and engineering jobs — raising both remittance quality and Saudi productivity.
Religious ties between the two nations are profound, with hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis performing Hajj and Umrah annually. Yet beyond pilgrimage, cultural exchange remains limited. Saudi Arabia is now opening its cultural and tourism sectors, while Pakistan offers one of South Asia’s richest heritage trails. Joint tourism circuits, cultural festivals, and academic exchanges could strengthen people-to-people connections.
What is equally important is not to see Pakistan-Saudi cooperation in isolation. The future of Pakistan’s economic resilience lies in deeper engagement with the entire Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman.
 
 

Collectively, the GCC is a $2 trillion economy with among the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds and fastest-growing energy transition programmes. Pakistan’s trade with the bloc remains concentrated in oil imports and labour exports, leaving enormous untapped potential in IT, food processing, engineering services, and renewable energy.
Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, the UAE’s diversification drive, and Qatar’s investment in knowledge industries all point to a region hungry for partnerships that Pakistan could provide — if it can ensure political stability and regulatory clarity. Gulf states are also investing heavily in artificial intelligence, fintech, and biotechnology.
Pakistan, with its youthful population and IT talent, could position itself as a natural partner. But this requires Islamabad to think of GCC ties not as fragmented bilateral tracks but as part of a regional strategy.
At the same time, GCC countries face their own food security challenges, and Pakistan can emerge as a dependable partner if it reforms its agriculture sector. Joint GCC-Pakistan food corridors, supported by Gulf investment in infrastructure, could benefit both sides. For Islamabad, this would also diversify economic dependence.
Seen this way, the September defence pact is more than just a milestone in Pak-Saudi ties. It is also a reminder that Pakistan’s long-term security will not come from arms alone, but from embedding itself in the broader Gulf economic transformation.

• Supplier continued delivery to other industries, made ‘dubious’ force majeure claims to escape accountability
ISLAMABAD: Electricity consumers in Pakistan are having to shoulder a financial burden of nearly Rs215 million, mainly due to regulatory weaknesses, it has emerged.
While the capacity trap, currency devaluation and exch­ange-rate volatility are touted as the main factors behind expensive electricity, similar attention is not paid to issues of weak contract enforcement and inadequate regulatory oversight, which are actually forcing consumers to foot the bill for contractual default by private companies.
 
 

In the latest episode that has come to light, a Punjab-based coal power plant faced a significant contractual default by its long-term supplier.
Subsequent decisions by regulators such as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G) allowed the resulting financial burden to be passed directly on to consumers in the form of higher tariffs.
This is just one example of persistent weaknesses in the coal procurement process, which previously made headlines earlier this year, sparking inquiries and leading to partial improvements. However, the issue is far from resolved and continues to add to the public’s financial strain.
Dawn reached out to Nepra with a set of questions on Sept 22. Over the following weeks, the regulator repeatedly promised a written response, but failed to provide one until going to press.
Default on coal supply
The issue at hand stems from the breach of a long-term coal supply agreement between the power plant and its coal supplier in December last year. The contract, awarded through a competitive process, secured a substantial discount of $2.51 per tonne on API-4 specification coal.
This was seen as an improvement over a previously-challenged contract, which only offered a discount of $0.50 per tonne.
However, the supplier defa­ulted on its obligation to del­iver coal against issued purchase orders, citing an alleged ‘force majeure’ as the basis for its non-performance, referencing factors such as congestion at the Richards Bay Coal Terminal in South Africa and, notably, the India-Pakistan conflagration in May.
The claim regarding terminal congestion is noteworthy, as industry experts routinely consider this risk as a foreseeable trade challenge in the international coal market.
However, the use of the India-Pakistan flare-up as an excuse does not hold up, as documentation indicates that other suppliers successfully fulfilled their contractual obligations during the same timeframe.
Additionally, other industries in Pakistan continued to import coal without interruption, raising questions over the enormity of the supplier’s ‘force majeure’ claims.
Interestingly, while it defaulted on the long-term contract with the power plant, the company continued to supply coal to other industries, suggesting the decision was linked to the high discount offered rather than the self-proclaimed ‘force majeure’.
Cost increases
As a direct consequence of the default, the power plant in question was forced to procure replacement coal from the next-ranked supplier, at a significantly higher price. This resulted in an additional cost of $1.86 per tonne being incurred.
When applied to the total defaulted quantity of nearly 372,000 tonnes across eight vessels, this nonperformance by the original supplier generated a verifiable loss of $691,931, equivalent to around Rs197m.
The regulatory response by Nepra solidified the public’s exposure to this financial loss. In its Fuel Cost Adjustment decision of June 26, 2025, the authority green-lit passing the full impact of the Rs197m cost directly into consumer tariff, instead of protecting consumers’ interests by holding the defaulting party accountable, as explicitly outlined in the Coal Supply Agreement.
The contract stipulates that the defaulting party must bear the incremental cost of replacement coal and forfeit its performance guarantee to cover such losses. According to records, the supplier’s performance guarantee was not forfeited, and the recovery of the $691,931 loss was not enforced by either CPPA-G or Nepra.
Despite its ongoing default, the same company was allowed to continue supplying under the long-term tender and participate in, and win, a spot tender for the same plant again on June 11, 2025.
This spot tender secured a discount of only $1.58 per tonne, which was 93 cents per tonne lower than the discount on the defaulted long-term contract. The price disparity created an additional loss of $55,800, about Rs16m, on a single 60,000-tonne supply, placing yet more burden on consumers.
The CPPA-G’s issuance of NOC to the defaulting supplier, both for the spot tender and its continued long-term supplies, illustrates the absence of an effective systemic penalty framework.
Following an earlier episode, a Nepra fact-finding committee had identified “anomalies” in the coal procurement process. The committee’s subsequent report underscored the structural weaknesses inherent in the system, which led to single-bidder scenarios and limited competition.
The report had also acknowledged the absence of requisite regulatory guidelines for long-term coal procurement and recommended the urgent creation of an independent coal regulator to protect consumers from unjustified costs. But even after the passage of eight months, those recommendations remain unenforced.

The undocumented economy continues to challenge tax-compliant companies that find it increasingly difficult to compete. The recent transition of Procter & Gamble (P&G), one of the world’s largest consumer goods firms, away from direct operations in Pakistan has drawn attention precisely because the country is consumption-driven, where savings remain low and spending relatively high. In the past, profits for consumer firms were strong, but shrinking purchasing power has now become the main concern.
International companies bring leadership, technology, and governance. Despite repeated efforts to attract inflows, foreign direct investment (FDI) has remained subdued. According to the State Bank of Pakistan, net FDI stood at $2.46 billion in FY25, compared with inflows of over $30bn annually into Bangladesh and more than $70bn into India in recent years. Pakistan’s investment-to-GDP ratio has slipped to around 13–14 per cent, while India and Bangladesh maintain ratios above 30pc. For investors, both large and small, structural tax and regulatory hurdles remain significant considerations.
Over the past decade, many multinationals have scaled down, divested shares, or transferred operations to local partners. One of the most pressing concerns for foreign companies has been the difficulty of remitting dividends, with payments delayed. At the same time, industries have encountered prolonged hurdles in opening letters of credit for spare parts and raw materials. Such prolonged backlogs significantly impact production flows and business stability.
 
 

In most emerging economies, FDI grows annually by 11–13pc. Pakistan, however, has witnessed stagnation in recent years. The reasons extend beyond global trends. Profitability in Pakistan is strained: a business earning 100 rupees may retain only about 35 after taxes. With the exchange rate around Rs280 per dollar, margins are further squeezed. Investors require consistent enabling conditions and confidence that policies will remain predictable.

While the exit of P&G and similar massive companies highlights the challenges of doing business in the country, corporate transitions are not unique to Pakistan

Exits have spanned several sectors. In energy, Shell sold its Pakistan operations to Saudi Arabia’s Wafi Energy. TotalEnergies sold its 50pc shareholding in Total Parco Pakistan Limited to the global commodities trading company, Gunvor Group. In telecommunications, Telenor sold its Pakistan business to PTCL, part of the Etisalat group. Uber closed its app operations in April 2024, while Careem announced suspension from July 2025.
The pharmaceutical sector has been among the most affected. At one time, 40 multinational pharma firms operated in Pakistan; today only 17 remain. Companies such as Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, MSD, and Pfizer have either restructured or transferred portfolios to local partners. South Korea’s Lotte Chemical sold its entire 75.01pc stake in its Pakistani subsidiary, Lotte Chemical Pakistan Limited.
Historically, Pakistan was an attractive manufacturing location. In the 1950s, leading consumer and healthcare multinationals established facilities here. Over time, however, higher costs for the formal economy, while large informal segments remained untaxed, shifted competitiveness in favour of other regional markets.
It is important to recognise that these companies are not ordinary firms; they are global brands with reputations for investor trust. Their gradual withdrawal highlights the challenges of doing business locally in Pakistan. Factors such as taxation levels, currency depreciation, rising costs, inflationary pressures, import restrictions, and foreign exchange constraints continue to influence investor confidence.
At the same time, positive lessons exist. Pakistan’s banking sector illustrates this transformation. Nearly three decades ago, banks required government bailouts. Today, they are among the largest taxpayers. Investors, including the Aga Khan Fund and other local stakeholders, have consistently earned returns. The exit of some foreign names created opportunities for regional and domestic investors who helped stabilise the sector. Even when interest rates fell from 22pc to 11pc, banks sustained profitability. In today’s stock market, companies valued at close to or above $3bn include major banks such as Meezan Bank, reflecting local resilience.
Beyond banking, transitions continue. Ingredient maker Rafhan, Maize’s parent firm, divested majority ownership while keeping a minority stake. This represented a shift in management, not a full exit. In contrast, Saudi Aramco’s investment in Pakistan demonstrates confidence from one of the world’s largest energy firms. Several businesses, once foreign-owned, are now operated successfully by local investors. These examples highlight resilience and the capacity to sustain operations despite global withdrawals.
Corporate transitions are not unique to Pakistan. India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam have also seen companies restructure or exit sectors, though these economies continue to draw new inflows. Meanwhile, Bloomberg has ranked Pakistan among the world’s best-performing stock markets in recent years, showing that opportunities still exist when conditions align.
Standard Chartered’s journey in Pakistan illustrates this duality. Once running over 170 branches, it has now consolidated to fewer than 50. Whether this is progressive consolidation or a regressive retreat depends on perspective. It does, however, underline how business models evolve over time.
Looking forward, Pakistan’s prospects will be shaped by regional and global dynamics. Geopolitical realignments, trade flows, and cross-border partnerships will play important roles. The country stands at a critical juncture. With continued reforms, improved policy predictability, and measures to strengthen investor confidence, Pakistan can transform present challenges into opportunities. Its large population, consumption base, and strategic location remain advantages. The task ahead is to align business conditions with these inherent strengths.

The incident came the same day as a separate attack on a religious leader left at least five people injured.
According to police, Judge Malik Inayatur Rehman and his security staff came under fire from unidentified assailants near Khari City Hospital.
The judge’s vehicle was hit by at least 12 bullets, but all occupants survived the ambush.
Law enforcement agencies reached the site soon afterwards and cordoned off the area for investigation.
Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan took notice of the attack and directed the home secretary, inspector general of police, and other law enforcement authorities to tighten security across the city.
He instructed them that those involved in the attack be dealt with “iron hands” and brought to justice. The chief minister also urged citizens to remain peaceful and united to foil the designs of elements seeking to disturb the region’s peace.
GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah also condem­ned the attack and called for a transparent investigation. Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate, Deputy Speaker Sadia Danish, Opposition Lea­der Kazim Mesum, lawyers’ representatives, and civil society members also denounced the incident.
Religious leader attacked
Earlier in the day, a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) was also targeted near the Central Police Office (CPO).
Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire.
According to a GB government statement, Maul­ana Nisar, his driver, and three police personnel assigned to his security sustained injuries.
Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices.
 
 

CCTV footage showed the assailants fleeing in a Suzuki vehicle they allegedly snatched at gunpoint after their own vehicles became inoperative.
The injured were shifted to a hospital for medical treatment, where their condition was reported to be stable.
Police launched an investigation and took into custody two vehicles used in the attack along with other evidence.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Gilgit Ishaq Hussain said the district police had been placed on high alert following recent security concerns. He added that comprehensive operations were underway to apprehend those involved in the attack.
Protests erupt
Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest.
Protest demonstrations were reported from Gilgit, Diamer, Nagar, Skardu, Astore, Ghizer, Ghanche, and Shigar, where people from all walks of life participated. Religious leaders from all sects condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region.
Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam, also condemned the assassination attempt on Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed and ordered a high-level investigation.
In a statement issued during his official visit abroad, Mr Muqam said he had contacted the GB chief minister, chief secretary, and inspector general of police, seeking a detailed report. He said Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed was a respected religious scholar and that the attack was not only on an individual but “an assault on the peace and stability of the entire region.”
The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said.
Chief Minister Gulbar Khan reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of Gilgit-Baltistan would be allowed to succeed. He ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits.
Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.

However, the opposition PTI has raised concerns over these “secret deals” with the US, and called on the government to disclose the details of these agreements.
US Strategic Metals (USSM), which signed an MoU with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country, rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
Sources in Washington hope this will pave the way for Pakistan’s formal entry into the global supply chain for critical minerals, a sector of growing importance for global industries and national security.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
In a statement, USSM described the delivery as “a milestone in the Pakistan–US strategic partnership,” noting that the MOU “establishes a roadmap for cooperation across the entire mineral value chain — from exploration and processing to the establishment of refineries inside Pakistan.”
USSM CEO Stacy W. Hastie said the first delivery “opens an exciting chapter of collaboration between USSM and Pakistan’s Frontier Works Organisation, aimed at expanding trade and deepening friendship between our two countries.”
For Pakistan, the agreement offers a gateway into the global critical minerals economy, with the potential to generate billions of dollars in revenue, create jobs, and promote technology transfer.
 
 

The country’s mineral wealth is often estimated at around $6 trillion, placing it among the world’s most resource-rich nations.
For the US, the partnership promises access to key raw materials while reducing reliance on external monopolies that dominate the global minerals market.
Disclose secret deals
But not everyone is convinced that this and other similar deals will be a boon for Pakistan. In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram demanded the government to disclose details of alleged secret deals with the United States.
Referring to the USSM shipment, as well as claims published by the Financial Times regarding a supposed plan to offer the Pasni Port to Washington, the spokesperson warned that such “reckless, lopsided, and secretive agreements would further inflame the already volatile situation in the country”.
He demanded that parliament and the nation be taken on board and that “full details of all such deals be made public.” Mr Akram stressed that PTI “would never accept agreements struck at the expense of the people and the state’s interests.”
Military sources have already disputed the claims made in the Financial Times report, calling the proposal “a commercial idea” rather than “official policy”.
He urged the government to learn from the “disastrous consequences” of Mughal Emperor Jahangir’s 1615 decision to grant trading rights to the British at Surat Port, which he said ultimately led to colonial control.
Commenting on simmering political tensions between the PPP and PML-N, Mr Akram stated that the public disagreements were a “well-thought-out plan” to “divert public attention from chronic national issues”.

As of Sunday, 350 trekkers had reached the small township of Qudang, while contact with the remaining 200-plus trekkers had been made, CCTV reported. Visitors to the remote valley of Karma, which leads to the eastern Kangshung face of Everest, were in the hundreds this week, taking advantage of an eight-day National Day holiday in China.
“It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk,” said Chen Geshuang, who was part of an 18-strong trekking team that made it to Qudang.
“The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly,” Chen told Reuters.
Snow, thunder and lightning
Snowfall in the valley, which lies at an elevation averaging 4,200 metres, began on Friday evening and persisted throughout Saturday.
The remaining trekkers will arrive in Qudang in stages under the guidance and assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported.
Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted by villagers after enduring a harrowing evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning. With tears in her eyes, Chen accepted their offers of sweet tea and the promise of warmth, she said.
“Back in the village, we had a meal and were finally warm.” Hundreds of local villagers and rescue teams had been deployed to help remove snow blocking access to the area, where nearly 1,000 people had been trapped, according to an earlier report by Jimu News.
North face of Everest
The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff of the trekking parties had been accounted for. It was also unclear if trekkers near the north face of Everest, also in Tibet, had been affected or not.
The north face of Everest, due to its easy access by paved road, regularly draws large numbers of tourists. October is a peak season, when skies usually clear at the end of the Indian monsoon.
Ticket sales and entry to the entire Everest Scenic Area were suspended from late Saturday, according to notices on the official WeChat accounts of the local Tingri County Tourism Company.
To the south of Tibet in Nepal, heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 47 people since Friday.
Thirty-five people died in separate landslides in the eastern Ilam district bordering India. Nine people were reported missing after being swept away by floodwaters and three others were killed in lightning strikes elsewhere in the country.</p><small>2025-10-05 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/052240474ab7a59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946768/india-hand-pakistan-second-successive-defeat-at-womens-world-cup-with-88-run-victory' target='_blank'><strong>India hand Pakistan second successive defeat at Women’s World Cup with 88-run victory</strong></a><br><p>
Abyan Amir was reporting live from R. Premadasa Stadium.

India eventually finished the match with a comfortable win but at the halfway mark it could have been anyone’s game.
The hosts were bowled for a below par 247 but in the end that turned out to be too much for the Pakistani batters who folded for 159.
There were plenty of stops in between due to bugs, fumigation and the humidity causing frequent drink breaks.
Diana Baig ended up with four wickets and cleaned up India’s tail as well but it was captain Fatima Sana who shifted the momentum after a good start for India in the power play.
Pakistan go into the next encounter with Australia on the 8th with losses next to their name. Fatima Sana’s players need some introspection to their batting approach if they are to compete to go into the next stage of the World Cup.

Speaking after the match, skipper Fatima said: “We gave a lot of runs in the powerplay, extras too. That was the case in the death too. I felt we needed to restricted them under 200.
“We decided to go with specialist batters in the top-five, they need to step up. We need to express ourselves, long partnerships, assess and adapt to conditions. Amin is hard-working, hope she’ll continue to do well.”
Meanwhile, Indian counterpart Harmanpreet said she was “very happy [with the] important win.
“Our bowling was great, Kranti was outstanding; Renuka helped her. We created so many chances, dropped some. But win makes us happy.
“It wasn’t easy to bat on, we wanted to bat long and see how much we got. It’s been raining and there was a hold on the pitch. We wanted to keep wickets in hand, Richa then gave us 30 crucial runs. Right now, I’m happy we won. Just want to go with the momentum when we go back to India. We know how the pitches there are, hope to work our combinations.”
Player of the match Kranti Goud said: “Proud for me, and the people from my village. They’ve got a big screen up.
“Harman asked to remove the second slip as the pace was reducing but I insisted on it and it got Riaz’s wicket. My coaches tell me normal things and I catch onto them.”

Pakistan have opted to bowl first, with Sadia Iqbal opening for the Green Shirts as they face India in the cricket field yet again on Sunday, this time in the Women’s World Cup 2025.
While India is hosting this year’s tournament, Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka under a hybrid model decided in November after India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy.
 






Fatima Sana is leading the Green Team, while Harmanpreet Kaur is captaining the Women in Blue. The game will begin at 2:30pm PKT at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
As of 2pm (Sri Lanka time), ESPNcricinfo reported that the weather was “dry, although there are dark clouds hovering over the stadium”.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) had said “fans have free entry to all” the World Cup matches being played in Colombo.
 
 

As the rivals meet for a fourth consecutive Sunday on the cricket field, tensions from the recent men’s Asia Cup may spill into the ongoing event as well.
Ahead of all the chatter on the issue of handshakes in Asia Cup, Sana made it clear that her side’s focus was solely on cricket.
Earlier this week, a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official said there was “no assurance” that India and Pakistan players would shake hands during their fixtures.
The semi-finals are scheduled for October 29 and 30, before the final takes place on November 2.</p><small>2025-10-05 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0522213255cc9d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946818/pentagons-hegseth-says-he-has-every-authorisation-needed-for-caribbean-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Pentagon’s Hegseth says he has every authorisation needed for Caribbean strikes</strong></a><br><p>United States Secretary of War Pete Hegseth said he has every authorisation needed for military strikes on vessels just off the coast of Venezuela, allegedly carrying illegal drugs.
Hegseth was speaking in a Fox News interview broadcast on Sunday. The United States killed four people in a strike in the Caribbean Sea on Friday, at least the fourth such attack in recent weeks.
“We have every authorisation needed. These are designated as foreign terrorist organisations,” Hegseth said in an interview on Fox News’ ‘The Sunday Briefing’.
He did not provide more details about the authorisation.
Washington has cited the US Constitution, war powers, designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organisations, the right to self-defence and international law on unlawful combatants as the legal basis for the strikes.
Legal experts and some lawmakers argue that using military force in international waters against alleged criminals bypasses due process, violates law enforcement norms, lacks a clear legal foundation under US and international law and is not justified by the cartels’ terrorist designation.
Hegseth and US President Donald Trump have not provided evidence for claims that the targeted boats were carrying drugs. Trump told Congress last week that he had determined the US to be in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels, without providing any new legal rationale.
Critics say the boat strikes are a further effort by Trump to test the scope of his presidential powers. Legal experts have questioned why the military is carrying out these attacks rather than the US Coast Guard, the country’s maritime law agency.
“If you’re in our hemisphere, if you’re in the Caribbean, if you’re north of Venezuela and you want to traffic drugs to the United States, you are a legitimate target of the United States military,” Hegseth said.
Trump said on Sunday that the US military buildup in the Caribbean had halted drug trafficking from South America.
“There’s no drugs coming into the water. And we’ll look at what phase two is,” he told reporters at the White House.
 


Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday told his Venezuelan counterpart that the country condemns the US strikes and is concerned about the dangers of potential escalation in the Caribbean.</p><small>2025-10-05 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0521553581b7c0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946817/ji-urges-nation-to-stage-street-shows-on-oct-7-for-expressing-solidarity-with-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>JI urges nation to stage street shows on Oct 7 for expressing solidarity with Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Sunday addressed a massive rally on Karachi’s Sharea Faisal and called on the nation to take to the streets on October 7 as a show of solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.
According to a press release from the JI, the participants of the “Gaza Solidarity March” chanted slogans against Israel and its supporters over the ongoing genocide in the enclave. They were also carrying placards and banners and people from all walks of life participated in the event and formed a chain to express solidarity.
“Any paradigm shift in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine — [which was] set by none other than Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah — will not be tolerated at any cost,” Rehman said in his keynote address, according to the press release.
“On March 23, 1940, two resolutions were passed by the Muslim League — one called [the] Pakistan Resolution and the second one was for Palestine,” he added. “There is only one state and that is Palestine, whereas there is only one leadership in Gaza and that is Hamas.”
The JI chief demanded that the government recognise Hamas as the leadership in the Gaza Strip, while “warning them strongly” against joining the Abraham Accords, a series of normalisation agreements between Israel and Arab states.

“He (Rehman) further said that Israel had totally failed militarily in Gaza as it couldn’t get its soldiers freed by Hamas and was in fact engaging Hamas in one way or another to secure their release,” the statement read.
“Hamas is a resistance movement that represents the people of Gaza. However, the ruling class is not even willing to mention the name … because they are afraid of any movement that comes from the people,” Rehman was quoted as saying. “The ruling elite dislikes any movement that opposes the United States and Israel.”
The JI chief added that Hamas was a legal political movement and if they had taken up arms, it they did so according to the UN Charter. Moreover, he demanded that the government “abandon hypocrisy and double standards” and accept the people of Gaza and Hamas, adding that Hamas offices must be opened in Pakistan.
“On the occasion, he stressed the need [for] another United Nations as the present one became a total failure and agent of the US and Israel,” the press release read.
“It never solved the issues of Muslims. He (Rehman) was of the view that the massacre in Palestine happened not because of Hamas, but because of the cowardly Muslim rulers.”
According to the press release, Rehman said that October 7 is a “symbol of struggle and resistance” and that people around the world will come out of their homes to “express solidarity with the resistance forces and oppressed people of Gaza”.
“On October 7 at 11 am, the entire Pakistan will come out on [the] roads in support of Palestinians and [we] ask the nation to join the global solidarity demonstration,” Rehman was quoted as saying.
The Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced.
Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.
 
 

US President Donald Trump worked with eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to formulate a peace plan to end the conflict. The proposal was accepted by both Israel and Hamas, although Tel Aviv’s attacks still continue in the Strip.
Moreover, Israeli forces also intercepted and arrested activists aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla — a fleet of boats trying to deliver aid to the enclave — on October 1, drawing global ire and condemnation. One of the participants arrested was former JI senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who led a Pakistani delegation on the flotilla.</p><small>2025-10-05 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05212259302ddf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946816/pakistan-sees-sharpest-drop-in-default-risk-only-country-showing-consistent-improvement-finance-ministers-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan sees ‘sharpest drop’ in default risk; only country showing consistent improvement: finance minister’s aide</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has recorded one of the “sharpest drops” in sovereign default risk globally and now ranks as the second-best performer in the world, according to Credit Default Swap (CDS)-implied data reported by Bloomberg, adviser to the finance minister Khurram Schehzad said on Sunday.
A Credit Default Swap-implied probability estimates the likelihood that a borrower — such as a company or a country — will fail to repay its debt. This probability is derived from the market price of its CDS, which is a type of financial insurance investors buy to protect themselves against the risk of default, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
If the cost of a CDS drops, it means investors see the borrower as less risky. So, when Pakistan’s CDS-implied probability falls sharply, it indicates that global investors believe the country’s chances of defaulting on its debt have significantly decreased.
“As per the latest data posted by Bloomberg, Pakistan stands out globally as the 2nd most improved economy in terms of reduction in sovereign default risk, as measured by CDS-implied default probability globally,” Schehzad wrote in a post on X.
 






He added that the country stood second only to Turkiye in the global emerging market (EM) rankings in default risk reduction, as the country has recorded one of the sharpest drops in sovereign default risk globally over the last 15 months (from June 2024 to September 2025).
“Notably, Pakistan is the only country in the EM sample showing consistent quarterly improvement across the past year,” he wrote, adding that the country’s default probability has decreased by 2,200 basis points.
“This marks the sharpest decline among major EMs, ahead of South Africa (3 per cent), EI Salvador (2pc). In contrast, countries like Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, and others have seen their default risks rise.”
Schehzad further said the sharp decline in the country’s risk signalled “strengthening investor confidence, underpinned by macroeconomic stabilisation, structural reforms, timely debt servicing, and staying the course with the International Monetary Fund.”
He also cited the recent positive ratings movements from global credit rating agencies like S&P Global, Fitch, and Moody’s as a factor.
In a message to investors, Schehzad said. “Pakistan is steadily rebuilding market credibility, standing out as one of the most improved sovereign credit stories in the emerging market universe.”
Pakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the IMF released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.
After averting default, Pakistan has undertaken tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators.</p><small>2025-10-05 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05213043ad591f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946750/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-malaysia-for-comprehensive-talks-on-economic-engagement' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Malaysia for ‘comprehensive’ talks on economic engagement</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has arrived in Malaysia for a two-day official visit, according to state broadcaster PTV News.
The broadcaster reported in a post on X that he arrived at Kuala Lumpur’s Banga Raya International Airport, being welcomed by the Malaysian information and communications minister and the Pakistani high commissioner to Malaysia.
PM Shehbaz was then escorted with a royal protocol to his accommodation, where he was welcomed by his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim.
 






“I am extremely delighted to be in Malaysia; I express my gratitude to the prime minister of Malaysia for the warm reception,” PTV News quoted him as saying. “This visit will further strengthen Pakistan-Malaysia bilateral relations.”
 






Upon his departure, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






Later, a post by the PM Office’s official X account confirmed the premier had departed from Lahore for the three-day official visit.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) earlier said PM Shehbaz would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other federal ministers and senior government officials on the trip.
Sharing details of the visit in a statement, the FO said talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.</p><small>2025-10-05 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627112-50-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-quetta-and-surrounding-areas' target='_blank'><strong>5.0-magnitude earthquake jolts Quetta, adjoining areas</strong></a><br><p>

According to PDMA, the earthquake was recorded at 06:29pm, approximately 65 kilometres west of Quetta at the geographical coordinates of Latitude 30.19°N and Longitude 66.33°E, with a focal depth of 25 kilometres.
The monitoring data were analysed through automatic seismic mode. Tremors of mild to moderate intensity were reportedly felt in Quetta and adjoining areas, it said in a statement.
It said that the authority was in coordination with the district disaster management authorities to assess the situation. “As of now, no immediate reports of losses or damages have been received from any district.
“The PEOC (Provincial Emergency Operations Centre) [of] PDMA Balochistan is in coordination with DDMAs (District Disaster Management Authorities) to assess the situation,” the authority said in a statement. “As of now, no immediate reports of losses or damages have been received from any district.”
In June this year, two separate earthquakes were reported within the province.
On June 30, a moderate 5.5 magnitude quake struck the Musakhail district, injuring five people and damaging dozens of mud houses. The PMD said that the first tremor struck Musakhail, Rarashram, Kingri and surrounding areas at 3:24am with a magnitude of 5.5 and a depth of 28km, while the second tremor, measuring 4.8, was recorded at 7:30am.
On June 15, an earthquake hit Pasni, with tremors felt as far as Karachi. According to the PMD, the first tremor struck at 9:53am and measured 3.2 on the Richter scale.

At the time of the May 9 riots, a caretaker government with Mohammad Azam Khan as the chief minister was in power in KP, after the PTI had dissolved the provincial assembly as rifts with the Centre grew.
“For the public’s information, I want to inform that 29 false cases were registered on May 9, 2023 in anti-terrorism courts that were based on political victimisation, lack of evidence and misuse of authority,” said KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel in a video statement seen by Dawn.com.
Uthmankhel said KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur took notice of the matter as “courts had already acquitted all suspects in most of the cases”, while some suspects were discharged and some cases were sent to ordinary civil courts.
It could not be confirmed whether the cabinet had recommended withdrawing all 29 cases mentioned by the advocate general or some of them.
“This proves that all the anti-terrorism cases were illegal, unconstitutional and based on political victimisation,” he said, adding that the KP cabinet decided that the home department will withdraw the cases.

Recalling that the cabinet appointed KP Additional Advocate General (AAG) Muhammad Inam Yousafzai as the special prosecutor for the cases, Uthmankhel said Yousafzai appeared in the court and submitted an application for withdrawing the cases.
“The court examined the documents thoroughly and fixed October 15 as the next date for hearing arguments on the withdrawal.”
Uthmankhel further asserted that the cases forwarded to ordinary courts had “no testimonies either so, God willing, they will soon be ended”.
The video clip also included screenshots of letters sent by the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department to the advocate general’s office. They included a recommendation of withdrawal for a case filed in Mardan on May 9, 2023 at the City police station.
 
 

A letter dated October 3 showed that the KP cabinet wrote to its home department, saying that the matter of withdrawal was placed before the cabinet on an “urgent basis” after Uthmankhel wrote to CM Gandapur, who approved taking up the matter.
The KP cabinet also sought an implementation report on its decision on a “top priority basis”.

A response letter written by the KP home department to Uthmankhel on October 3, seen by Dawn.com, conveyed the cabinet’s approval of his recommendation to withdraw the cases.
It stated that the “KP additional chief secretary (home)/ home secretary was permitted to withdraw from the prosecution of FIR No. 833” under Section 7c (additional powers of district public prosecutor) of the KP Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions, and Powers) Act 2005, read with Section 494 (effect of withdrawal from prosecution) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The cabinet also approved the appointment of AAG Yousafzai as special prosecutor in the Mardan case.
On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan, who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.</p><small>2025-10-05 14:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05185125497a323.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946784/pension-not-charity-but-a-constitutional-right-says-justice-mansoor-ali-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Pension not charity but a constitutional right, says Justice Mansoor Ali Shah</strong></a><br><p>Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah of the Supreme Court (SC) has observed in a recent judgement that an employee’s pension is not a matter of bounty, charity, or benevolence but a right protected under Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution.
Article 9 entails that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with the law, while Article 14 protects the dignity of a person.
He made the remarks while hearing a petition filed by Shakeel Ahmed Kayani challenging an Islamabad High Court judgment (IHC) dated February 2, 2022, which had dismissed his plea seeking entitlement to an additional pension.
The SC heard the case on Sept 17, 2025, while the order of the judgement was released this week.
“[Pension] is inseparably linked with the right to life, dignity and livelihood, for without sustenance in old age, these rights ring hollow,” Justice Shah observed in his judgement.
According to the order, a copy of which was made available to Dawn.com today, the petitioner joined the erstwhile Oil and Gas Development Corporation established under the Oil and Gas Development Corporation Ordinance, 1961, as accounts assistant (BPS-14) on Feb 2, 1995, after earlier serving with the Pakistan Military Accounts Department Office, Wah Cantt.
During his service, the Oil and Gas Development Corporation (Reorganisation) Ordinance, 2001, was promulgated, converting the Corporation into the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited. The petitioner, by operation of law, became an employee of the company and retired as a senior accountant (E-04) on June 17, 2021, after rendering a total service of 40 years and 10 months.
The petitioner’s lawyer had argued that his client was entitled to an additional pension under Regulation 15(1A) since, as a former OGDC employee, his service terms were protected by the 2001 Ordinance. He maintained that federal government directives, such as the 2001 Finance Division memorandum discontinuing additional pensions, cannot override this statutory protection. Citing company letters from 2005 and 2010, he added that OGDC staff were not civil servants but employees of an autonomous body governed by its own regulations.
The company rejected the petitioner’s claim through an office memorandum issued on August 20, 2021. The petitioner then challenged this decision in the IHC, which dismissed the case on February 2, 2022, leading to the filing of the present petition.
In his judgement, Justice Shah added that pensions should be taken more seriously for those public servants for whom it was “a crystallised return on years of faithful service, a form of deferred wages earned through the sweat, labour, and loyalty of an employee.”
He went on to say that the concept of pension embodied the principle that those who serve must not be cast aside in their twilight years.
“To deny or withhold pension is to strip a person of the security they have justly earned, leaving them exposed to indignity, vulnerability, and want. Therefore, this right must be protected in the shape of a grant of pension that is not only adequate but also predictable.”
He further said that an element of respect and empathy is to be maintained while granting pension, which would “be in consonance with the values that Pakistan’s Constitution espouses with dignity as the highest constitutional value”.
Concluding the judgement, the judge stated in the order: “For the above reasons, we set aside the impugned judgement and declare that the petitioner is entitled to Additional Pension under Section 5 of the Ordinance, 2001 read with Regulation 15(1A) of the Pension Regulations with the direction to the Company to pay the Additional Pension to the petitioner in accordance with the Pension Regulations within 30 days from the receipt of this judgement and submit a compliance report to the Registrar of this Court.
“In case the compliance report is not received by the first week of November 2025, the case will be put up on the judicial side for necessary orders.”</p><small>2025-10-05 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/05134854a270b1a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946766/taking-our-cover-to-settle-own-issues-with-pm-sharjeel-accuses-punjab-govt-of-conspiring-against-centre' target='_blank'><strong>‘Taking our cover to settle own issues with PM’: Sharjeel accuses Punjab govt of conspiring against Centre</strong></a><br><p>The latest accusation in the ongoing rift between the PPP and PML-N came from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon on Sunday when he alleged that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government.
Memon’s PPP and the PML-N, who are coalition partners in the Centre, have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
As the row continues between the two sides, Memon alleged while addressing a press conference in Karachi that on the face of it, the Punjab government was “indirectly targeting” the PPP, but their “actual target is the federal government”.
“They are taking our cover to settle their own issues with the prime minister or the federal government. Or they are trying to create an environment to [compel] us not to support the federal government, which would create problems for the federal government,” he claimed.
 






Clarifying that the PPP was supporting the federal government on specific issues and to keep the country’s “political system running”, he asserted that the circumstances that the Punjab government tried to create spoke of their intentions of creating a rift between the allies in the Centre.
“But we will not let this conspiracy of the Punjab government against the federal government succeed,” Memon asserted.
“I do not know why they have these jealousy factors,” he quipped, highlighting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief’s recent “successful” visits to Saudi Arabia and the United States. “A person thinks that ‘maybe this should have come in my share, why is it going to the prime minister’.”
The PPP leader further said that while the chief ministers of Sindh and Balochistan usually receive the premier whenever he visits the provinces, “his own Punjab administration neither receives him nor gives him any protocol”.
“If you have any issues with the prime minister, please keep them among yourselves. Do not bring the PPP into it,” Memon said.
Regardless, the Sindh minister said, the focus at the moment should be on providing relief to the flood-hit people. “Even if you had blacked out the news from some places, but if you look on the ground […] especially in southern Punjab, the condition of the people is very bad.”
 






Memon further said: “You say we are doing politics [on the issue]. We are not doing politics. We are genuinely worried for our brothers and sisters in Punjab. Instead, those people who are even putting their pictures on boxes of biscuits are doing politics.”
He recalled that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had asked the Centre to issue an appeal for international assistance and that his party had demanded that immediate flood relief be provided through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The minister pointed out that the appeal was towards the federal government but it was the Punjab government that was reacting negatively to them, despite the Centre giving the PPP “reassurances”.
South Punjab way better than any rural Sindh area: Bokhari responds
Responding to Memon in a statement, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said she accepted the Sindh minister’s challenge for a debate, with “time and venue of your choice”.
Bokhari alleged that as a foreign minister, Bilawal was “weakening the roots of the federal government, including his party, and the prime minister”. “The house where a father and son do not agree are now trying to hide their sins by making futile taunts against our house.”
She further said that the PPP was “conspiring” against both the Centre and the Punjab government. “You start playing the ‘province card’ when your own performance is questioned,” the information minister said.
 
 

Bokhari asserted that south Punjab was still “way better and developed than any area of rural Sindh”. “Who are you to order Punjab?” she asked.
The minister also took exception to the PPP highlighting water right issues “day and night but telling us that Punjab will use water as per your (Sindh’s) wishes”.
Assailing the PPP for “delayed” work, Bokhari said: “You are still selling the 2002 floods, [while] cheques have started being distributed in areas where surveys have been completed.”
In a post on X, Bokhari said Memon was “more worried about interfering into Punjab’s political and administrative issues because they have decided not to do any work in Sindh”.
“Saying things is easy. Do work if there is. See your conditions; our south Punjab is better than them in every way. Is there any shame?” Bokhari added.
 






Both parties have been engaged in a social media contest today, with the PPP sharing complaints from purported flood-affected people from Punjab and the PML-N countering those by sharing interviews lauding its provincial government.
 






Memon assails Punjab-backed campaign to support vlogger’s anti-Sindh remarks
Memon also indirectly referred to the remarks made last month by YouTuber Rizwan Razi, whose content aired on national electronic media was decried as hate speech against the Sindhi community and led to a war of words between the coalition partners.
 
 

While a Senate committee had grilled Razi for making the derogatory remarks and the PTV had terminated his services, CM Maryam openly came out in support of the vlogger, with a social media campaign launched to express solidarity with him.
During his media briefing, Memon alleged that the Punjab government “staged another drama to divert from this entire matter (of floods), which is extremely unfortunate, damaging, and I think it was handled in a very childish manner”.
Detailing the sequence of events without naming Razi, the PPP leader said the Senate panel’s proceedings were still ongoing when a “campaign strongly in his favour” was launched from the social media accounts of the Punjab government and some of its top ministers.
 


Recalling that Maryam had “urged that the person be forgiven as he had apologised”, Memon questioned how the country’s anti-hate speech and electronic media laws would be implemented if people were to be let go in this manner.
“If you are giving these examples, then release all the people that are sitting in your  jails across Punjab,” he said.
“However, I would say that she is not at fault. Her scriptwriter is leading her onto the wrong path […] and advises her to run campaigns […] Remember a ‘Vote Ko Izzat Do’ campaign was run once, and very good respect was also given,” Memon quipped.
The PPP minister affirmed that whether it was a Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, Pashtun or from any other community, “all live like brothers and respect each other”.

On Friday, Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan — which was announced on Monday after a meeting between the US president and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and seek further negotiations. While the Trump administration worked with eight Muslim countries last month to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end, reservations have been expressed from that latter’s side that the plan unveiled by the White House was not the one originally agreed upon.
Nevertheless, they see Hamas’s partial agreement to the plan as an opportunity for a ceasefire in Gaza after an onslaught of around two years.
 
 

“The Foreign Ministers of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the Republic of Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Republic of Turkiye, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the State of Qatar and the Arab Republic of Egypt, today welcomed the steps taken by Hamas regarding US President Donald Trump’s proposal to end the war on Gaza, release all hostages, alive or deceased, and the immediate launch of negotiations on implementation mechanisms,” a FO statement said.
The foreign ministers also welcomed Trump’s call on Israel to immediately stop the bombing in Gaza and begin implementation of the prisoner-hostage exchange agreement, it added.
“They expressed appreciation for his commitment to establishing peace in the region. They also affirmed that such developments represent a real opportunity to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable ceasefire, and to address the critical humanitarian conditions facing people in Gaza Strip,” the FO statement read.
According to the FO, the foreign ministers also welcomed the announcement by Hamas of its “readiness to hand over the administration of Gaza to a transitional Palestinian Administrative Committee of independent technocrats”.
They also emphasised the need for the immediate launch of negotiations to agree on mechanisms to implement the proposal and address all of its aspects.
“The foreign ministers reiterated their joint commitment to support efforts towards the implementation of the proposal to work for the immediate end of the war in Gaza and achieve a comprehensive agreement that ensures unrestricted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of the Palestinian people, that no measures are taken that threaten the security and safety of civilians, the release of hostages, the return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, unifying Gaza and the West Bank, reaching a security mechanism that guarantees the security of all sides in a manner that leads to the full Israeli withdrawal […] the rebuilding of Gaza and that […] a path [is created] for just peace on basis of the two-state solution,” the statement said.
From Gaza invasion to Trump’s plan
Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced.
Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.
After multiple attempts to mediate a truce between Palestine’s Hamas and  Israeli, a significant development came last month when Trump engaged eight Muslim countries, including Pakistan, to end the onslaught in Gaza.
Merely days later, the White House revealed the US president’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Simultaneously, Trump held a meeting with the Israeli prime minister and held a press conference alongside him, announcing his agreement to the proposal.
 
 

But, some Muslim countries engaged on the matter have said that Trump’s plan was not the one they originally agreed to.
Meanwhile, US news outlet Axios reported that the deal now before Hamas was significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention.
The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process.
Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported.
According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios.
 
 

On Monday, Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas following which Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal or meet “a very sad end”.
Later, he gave Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning that the Palestinian resistance group would face “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms.
On Friday, Hamas — which had not been included in negotiations about the proposal — said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza invasion, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations.
Yesterday, Trump called on Israel to stop bombing Gaza immediately and he believes Hamas was ready for peace. However, reports of bombing in Gaza continue to come.</p><small>2025-10-05 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0517050113c30dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946786/demolishing-new-yorks-roosevelt-hotel-to-build-skyscraper-an-option-for-pakistan-report' target='_blank'><strong>Demolishing New York’s Roosevelt Hotel to build skyscraper an option for Pakistan: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is considering options for the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, including demolishing the building, as part of its efforts to meet commitments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), US outlet Bloomberg reported on Saturday.
Named after former US president Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter.
As part of its $7 billion IMF loan agreement, the government approved a “transaction structure for the Roosevelt Hotel” in July, saying it would not conduct an outright sale but decided to adopt a joint venture model to maximise long-term value.
Muhammad Ali, the adviser to the prime minister on privatisation, told Bloomberg that one of the options is to raze the storied landmark and build a skyscraper in its place.
“The government is keen on a joint venture where Pakistan will contribute the land and the partner will bring in the equity,” he told Bloomberg in Islamabad. “The other option is to retain the hotel if it makes economic sense.
“We will have clarity on this in the next few months after finalisation of the JV partner and market sounding,” Ali said.
 
 

The federal government is making an effort to restructure or privatise state-owned enterprises as committed to the IMF under the terms of the $7bn loan agreement, Bloomberg reported.
“The first asset to be sold could be PIA (Pakistan International Airlines), which has been surviving on periodic bailouts that the government can no longer afford,” the outlet added. “The adviser is hopeful that the national carrier will be sold by November.”
Ali also said that the groups interested in buying PIA are among the largest business groups in the country and have the capacity to run it, according to Bloomberg. He estimated that an investment of about half a billion dollars would be needed to turn the airline around.
“Pakistan is in the process of appointing advisers for the hotel transaction, dubbed by some as “the new Ellis Island” for its historical role as a migrant intake point,” the outlet reported.
“The government will finalise a new adviser later this month after bids from seven groups, including Citigroup Inc, CBRE Group Inc, and Savills PLC.”
PIA posted a pre-tax profit in the first half of 2025, which a company source said is its first such for the period in about two decades, ahead of a planned sale of the national carrier later this year.</p><small>2025-10-05 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627068-sharjeel-memon-dares-punjab-ministers-to-debate-says-ppp-being-used-to-target-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Sharjeel Memon dares Punjab ministers to debate, says PPP being used to target Centre</strong></a><br><p>
