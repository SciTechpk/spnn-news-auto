Climate change is a pressing reality for Pakistan, directly impacting millions of lives. Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, disproportionately affecting communities with limited resources to adapt.
“The prevailing heatwave condition over most parts of the province is expected to subside from tomorrow,” the PMD said in its advisory issued today.
“A westerly wave continues to grip the upper parts of the country,” it added.
According to the advisory, thunderstorms and light rain were expected in Jamshoro, Hyderabad, Mitiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, Badin, Tharparker, and Umerkot with occasional gaps from May 2 to 5.
“Strong windy conditions are likely in most parts of the province during [the] next two days,” the advisory said.
The forecast also said that Karachi was likely to experience hot and humid weather with occasional winds till May 3, adding that the maximum temperatures would be between 35°C and 37°C and the wind direction would be west and southwesterly.
PMD urged the public to take precautionary measures, avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and remain hydrated.
The advisory cautioned that “wind-thunderstorm/hailstorm and lightning may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels etc.”
“Farmers are advised to manage their crop activities keeping in view the weather conditions and take care of their livestock as well,” it added.
A day earlier, the PMD had predicted wind and thunderstorm along with rain and isolated hailstorm in upper and central parts of the country from May 1 to 4, saying that the current heatwave conditions are likely to subside.</p><small>2025-05-01 09:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/01113256d07c0d4.jpg?r=134638' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907749/as-india-pakistan-tensions-heat-up-gilgit-baltistan-tour-operators-see-their-earnings-evaporate' target='_blank'><strong>As India-Pakistan tensions heat up, Gilgit-Baltistan tour operators see their earnings evaporate</strong></a><br><p>A large number of foreign tourists have cancelled their trips to Gilgit-Baltistan due to heightened tensions between Pakistan and India, depriving local tour operators of much-needed earnings, a trade body official said on Thursday.
The April 22 attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. New Delhi has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi granting “operational freedom” to his military. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said yesterday morning that there was credible evidence of an Indian attack within 36 hours, while Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan wouldn’t strike first, but would respond decisively and strongly in the face of aggression.
With tensions running high, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan, while India shut its airspace for all Pakistan-registered aircraft, or those owned and operated by Pakistani airlines or operators, including military craft.
Ali Anwar Khan, General Secretary of the Gilgit-Baltistan Tour Operators Association, said, “The threat of war between Pakistan and India has impacted the region’s international tourism this year.”
He added that tourists, including well-heeled visitors from European and Commonwealth countries, have cancelled their trips to the region due to the heightened geopolitical tensions. Khan added that many tourists from Thailand had cancelled their reservations.
Additionally, he noted that around eight to ten foreign groups from his company had cancelled their trips, while 200 tour operators had also reported a number of cancellations.
According to Khan’s estimate, each operator lost at least $50,000 to $80,000 in potential earnings due to the current situation.
He said that most countries have already issued travel advisories due to which foreign tourists are rapidly cancelling their tours, while others have confirmed or are waiting for updates.
He said that one foreign tourist spends an average of $1,500 on a tour. “Now the cancellations will affect the entire industry — from hotels to transport,” he added.
He said the foreign tourists that are presently in Gilgit-Baltistan are worried about a potential escalation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. “They want to return to their countries immediately,” he said. “They are expressing fears that if they stay in Gilgit-Baltistan for longer to complete their tours, they will be caught in a possible war between the two countries.”
With regard to foreign mountaineers who visit the region to scale eight-thousander peaks, including K2, he said that the sector had already been “severely impacted” due to legal battles.
Previously, tour operators took to court to protest against the hike in taxes and fees for trekking and mountaineering by the Gilgit-Baltistan government.
A dispute between tour operators and the tourism department in Gilgit-Baltistan continues to impact the sector in the mountainous region, as the Supreme Court after suspending the increase in permit fees for foreign visitors had yet to provide clarity on the way forward.
Khan said that the circumstances impacted a total of 2,000 foreign tourists.
 
 

According to a statement issued by the GB tourism department on Sunday, about 25,000 foreign tourists visited Gilgit-Baltistan last year.
It said 2,300 foreign mountaineers and trekkers were issued permits by the GB government after paying permit fees, but 22,000 foreign tourists visited Gilgit-Baltistan, and many of them were allowed trekking and climbing without paying fees.
The Information Department also informed the GB Tourism Department that 700 foreign tourists interested in mountaineering and trekking have applied for permits this year.
However, due to the Pakistan Tour Operators Association approaching the court against the permit fees, the issuance of permits — which used to be completed in two to three days — has now been suspended due to court proceedings.
According to Director of Tourism Gilgit-Baltistan Iqbal Hussain, around 1.5 million domestic tourists visited the region last year.
He estimated that the revenue from tourism — domestic and foreign — would be around Rs64 billion.</p><small>2025-05-01 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602651-pakistani-media-at-crossroads-amid-rising-threats-shrinking-freedom-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani media at crossroads amid rising threats, shrinking freedom: report</strong></a><br><p>

Now, they head to X and Instagram to share memes. If that offends or confuses you, perhaps you’re not as chronically online as some of us who are following the escalation in tensions with India in the form of memes and jokes.
When the term ‘fifth generation warfare’ was coined, its creators would never have imagined it would come to include snide memes and videos mocking a country’s battle strategy. But here we are in 2025, and as India threatens to attack Pakistan and cut off its water supply vis-à-vis the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistanis are responding in the way we know best — with rather inane memes and jokes.
To the uninitiated, this may sound like another round of “the tea was fantastic” jokes à la Abhinandan, which now elicit nothing more than a side eye or a grimace. In contrast, these jokes are self-deprecating taunts more in the style of a class clown getting a rise out of riling up his opponent the way they know best — with a humour so self-deprecating, it gags your opponent and deprives them of a witty comeback.
Ironically, the jokes aren’t even always aimed at Indians — many of them are poking fun at Pakistan’s own problems — from lack of water to high PTA taxes on phones. In fact, the majority of the jokes are so ridiculous that many Indian netizens can do little more than scoff in amazement at just how unserious the Pakistani internet is and chuckle along. After all, if India cuts off Pakistan’s water supply, even Atif Aslam and Hania Aamir will be thirsty… but Indians wouldn’t know now that the superstars have been blocked too.
Whither the meme goest
What is particularly striking is the ingenuity of the jokes — ranging from young Pakistanis bemoaning the prospective chapter to be added to the Pak Studies exam should the country go to war to sneaking water off from across the border for your favourite celebrity, phones magically starting to work once they’re out of the PTA’s jurisdiction and sniggers at the thought of India having to draft Babar Azam for the Indian Cricket Team in the unlikely possibility of it conquering Pakistan.

Not that anyone seems to actually believe India will be able to best our armed forces or even attack — these jokes are precursors to any actual events happening. They do, however, poke fun at the idea of a war, mocking it in a way only Gen Z can.
They come in all forms, from pictures of sad kittens pleading with India to “turn the water back on” so they can complete their skincare routine to videos of young Pakistanis running in the mountains as news of “Captain Ajay Devgan, Major Akshay Kumar and General Hritik Roshan” sneaking into the country spreads. Another favourite is the furious debate over just how troublesome it will be to have to say ‘j’ instead of ‘z’.

As perturbed Indians scroll through the inanity of Pakistani humour, many have decided to join in on the fun. While some are offering water to their favourite Pakistanis, others are planning side quests to Burns Road for Karachi’s famous kababs during the ‘war’ or meet-ups with internet friends in Pakistani cities.

They’re all laughing at the idea of a war in a way only Gen Z can — a generation mocked incessantly for its failure to take things seriously. But if there’s one thing they do seem to be taking quite seriously, it’s mocking the very suggestion that we could go to war.
Couple a failure to take things seriously with a general sense of disillusionment and a tendency to use humour as a coping mechanism and you’ve got yourself the perfect recipe for memes.
A meme a day keeps the war mongers at bay
Using memes in times of crisis isn’t new. Come what is thrown at Pakistan, its netizens have often responded in the form of memes and self-deprecating jokes.
From losing cricket matches to being threatened with actual war, Pakistanis pride themselves on their meme game — and making fun of everyone else’s atrocious sense of humour. We’ve heard of he who laughs last, but Pakistanis are masters at laughing first. After all, if you laugh first, you don’t leave the other with much ammunition.
And we Pakistanis love to laugh — at ourselves as well as at others — and meme warfare isn’t new to us.
On February 14, 2019, 40 Indian paramilitary troops were killed in Pulwama in Indian-Occupied Kashmir, and India lay the blame squarely on Pakistan’s shoulders. Pakistan was quick to deny the claim. Notwithstanding the denial, however, India retaliated by conducting an airstrike in Pakistan. Unfortunately for the Indians, they ended up destroying some trees instead of causing any real damage. Even more unfortunate for them was the subsequent capture of Indian Air Force pilot Captain Abhinandan Varthaman, whose plane was shot down after entering Pakistani airspace. He was soon sent back but not before being served a cup of “fantastic” tea that sparked an avalanche of memes that continue till this day.
The situation was indeed serious — further escalation between two nuclear armed countries is not something to joke about — but at the time, the majority of the jokes began after Abhinandan’s capture and when the danger of an outright war was all but over.
But even the jokes of 2019 couldn’t have foretold just how unserious Pakistanis would have become in 2025, joking about a war that could very well happen and the suspension of a treaty that is vital for the livelihood of millions of people in the country.
Therapy, one meme at a time
This self-deprecating form of humour isn’t unique to Pakistan, though the rampant mockery of a war through a never-ending barrage of self-deprecating memes could well be.
People have been using humour as a coping mechanism for decades and Gen Z, as a generation, is reportedly more depressed than the generations before it. Studies have shown that teenagers today see anxiety and depression as major problems among their peers, with many viewing their mental health as a source of stress.
This kind of humour — gallows humour, if you will — comes at a time when Pakistanis are going through an economic crisis to beat all others. Electricity prices are high — when you get electricity that is. If you live in Karachi, water’s an issue. No matter where you live, gas is an issue. If you stay in Pakistan too long, you’ll get a hefty tax bill from the PTA in order to use your phone. At the same time, people are finding it difficult to get jobs and there’s a general sense of insecurity in the country. Is it any wonder then that Pakistanis are fed up and turning to humour as an ever-reliable coping mechanism?
From adding comical video game music to videos of people doing parkour on containers placed to block protesters from entering Islamabad to near constant jokes about VPNs, many young Pakistanis are turning very serious issues into jokes, not because they don’t see the severity of the issues, but because they don’t seem to know how else to process these major events happening in the country and around the world.
They’re disillusioned and that is becoming all the more apparent in their jokes and memes.
Is this a healthy coping mechanism? Likely not. But it is a form of black humour that unites people in high-stress environments and allows them to process difficult emotions. Usually, that applies to medical professionals, journalists, law enforcers and sometimes even prisoners of war who all often use humour as a way to better their mental health, but today, most Pakistanis live in a high stress environment that’s enough to send their blood pressure rising regardless of their profession.
The kids are going to be alright
But there is something to be said for these young Pakistanis’ resilience and refusal to be blindly coerced into hating our neighbours. No amount of war-mongering or vitriolic speeches from across the border seem to be able to penetrate the dark humour-cloaked armour we are wearing. We are, effectively, the nonchalant kid in the back of the class who cracks jokes even at times when the situation doesn’t call for it, or the funny best friend in a 2000s movie, always ready with snappy one-liners, brushing off insults with a casual shrug of the shoulder.
As some Pakistanis sit wondering if this recent escalation could result in a war, scrolling mindlessly through Instagram and watching videos of people making self-deprecating jokes about Indians invading Pakistan and heading straight back after being buried in a mountain of debt and other problems, these jokes provide not only comic relief, but a sense of calm.
There’s no fear mongering or calls for violence here — just a reassurance that it’ll all be okay, come what may. And if living in Pakistan has taught us anything, it’s that no matter what is thrown our way, Pakistanis have a way of shrugging it off, laughing and moving on. And if that isn’t the Pakistani way, I don’t know what is.</p><small>2025-05-01 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602660-one-day-of-applause-364-days-of-exploitation' target='_blank'><strong>One day of applause, 364 days of exploitation</strong></a><br><p>

As the world commemorated International Labour Day, the president and the premier issued separate messages to mark the occasion.
According to the International Labourers Organisation (ILO), Pakistan has yet to ratify 55 conventions and protocols. While labour laws exist but enforcement is weak, and despite government promises to create millions of jobs, issues like low pay, lack of social protection, and poor representation remain unresolved.
President Zardari paid tribute to the men and women labourers in the country and highlighted their struggles around the world, according to state-run Pakistan Television (PTV).
 






In his statement, he said: “We reiterate our commitment to workers’ autonomy, fair wages, a safe environment and social security. Workers and the working class are the driving force of our economy and national development.”
He highlighted the role of workers “in building our infrastructure, developing industries, agriculture, and the economy”.
He added: “Our workers are our pride. Our national development is due to the hard work and character of workers. In a rapidly changing world, we must focus on skilling our youth and workers for a bright future. We need to equip our workers and youth with modern skills.”
 
 

The president also stressed the need to create a comprehensive system for the skill development of workers.
“We will have to work to create a fair labor environment and for the welfare of workers. Let’s promote meaningful policies, inclusive development, and a culture in the country where the role of every worker is respected,” he added.
 
 

Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to promoting safe, healthy, and dignified conditions for workers”, PTV reported.
“Our hardworking workforce is the driving force behind our nation’s progress and our resilience,” he said.
“The protection of fundamental rights of workers is enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and is fully consistent with the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), to which Pakistan is a committed signatory,” he added.
The premier highlighted that the country has undertaken legislative and administrative reforms to strengthen labour and workforce protection, including key international labour conventions, such as the Forced Labour Convention and the 2014 Protocol to the Maritime Labour Convention.
He stated, “For the first time, every worker in Pakistan is benefiting from a national occupational safety and health profile, ensuring safe and healthy workplaces across the country.”
He urged workers, activists, civil society and the government to play their role for “a society that respects workers, upholds their rights, and creates opportunities for decent work”.
 






Senate Chairman Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani also paid tribute to all hardworking individuals of the nation, stating that May 1 is a shining symbol of determination, sacrifice, and human dignity.
Gilani said workers were the backbone of any nation. He emphasised that as a nation, we must realise that unless the labour class is provided with social, economic, and legal protection, the dream of sustainable development will remain incomplete.</p><small>2025-05-01 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602659-on-labour-day-daily-wage-workers-in-pakistan-share-stories-of-survival-struggle' target='_blank'><strong>On Labour Day, daily wage workers in Pakistan share stories of survival, struggle</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued from the office of Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan today, the gun battle took place in the Spin Tangi area of Chashmi, Bannu.
Bannu CTD personnel Assistant Sub-Inspector Benyamin Khan, Constable Inam Khan and Constable Musawar were martyred. Two constables, Wafid Khan and Imran, were wounded.
He said two khawarij — a term the state uses to refer to terrorists — were killed and another two injured in police firing, and their accomplices took bodies and injured with them.
“Weapons, ammunition, IEDs (improvised explosive device) and hand grenades were recovered from the terrorists, which were seized by the police,” the spokesman said.
As soon as the incident was reported, RPO Khan, Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kalachi, and CTD Superintendent of Police reached the CTD hospital where they visited the injured personnel and inquired after their well-being.
They also issued instructions to the hospital staff for the best treatment of those injured.
RPO Khan said that all available resources will be utilised for the best treatment of the injured personnel.
“We will soon avenge our martyred brothers and engage the terrorists with an iron hand till the very end,” he said.
A large contingent of Bannu police and CTD police have cordoned off the area and are engaged in search operations. Raids are being conducted on the hideouts of the terrorists, the spokesman said.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and expressed his condolences to the families of the martyred.
According to a statement issued by his office, KP Governor House, Kundi paid tribute to the personnel for bravely confronting the terrorists.
“The sacrifices of the police and security forces against the terrorists will not go in vain,” he said.
In March, two officials of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s CTD were martyred at Tanda Dam in Kohat district in a gun attack carried out by unidentified assailants.
In January, an official of the police’s CTD was martyred when unidentified persons opened fire at him in Mirali Bazaar.</p><small>2025-05-01 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602648-criticism-mounts-as-india-names-suspects-hours-after-pahalgam-killings' target='_blank'><strong>Criticism mounts as India names suspects hours after Pahalgam killings</strong></a><br><p>

The new indictment comes as Yoon stands trial for orchestrating an insurrection with his December 3 martial law attempt, which sought to suspend civilian rule in democratic South Korea.
Armed soldiers were deployed to parliament under the decree, but the order lasted only around six hours as it was swiftly voted down by opposition MPs, who scaled fences to enter the building. They later impeached Yoon over the martial law declaration.
Yoon, 64, was stripped of all power and privileges in April by the Constitutional Court, which upheld the impeachment motion. He was soon forced to move out of the presidential residence.
Prosecutors first indicted Yoon in January — when he was still president — as “the ringleader of an insurrection”, a charge not covered by presidential immunity.
“We have since proceeded with the (insurrection) trial while conducting supplementary investigations into the abuse of power allegation, leading to this additional indictment,” prosecutors said in a statement on Thursday.
The fresh charge comes a day after investigators raided Yoon’s private residence in Seoul as part of a probe into bribery allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee and a shaman accused of receiving lavish gifts on behalf of the former first lady.
If convicted of the insurrection charge, Yoon could be sentenced to life in prison or to death — although South Korea has had an unofficial moratorium on executions since 1997.
Yoon was the second South Korean president to be removed from office, and the third to be impeached by parliament.
With Yoon out of office, South Korea is set to hold a snap election on June 3.</p><small>2025-05-01 06:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602645-three-ctd-men-martyred-two-terrorists-killed-in-bannu-gun-battle' target='_blank'><strong>Three CTD men martyred, two terrorists killed in Bannu gun battle</strong></a><br><p>

Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, who has led an interim government since autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled into exile as crowds stormed her palace in August, has said elections will be held as early as December, and at the latest by mid-2026.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), widely tipped to win the poll, will hold a May Day rally in Dhaka.
“We are confident this will be the most memorable grand rally in recent times,” BNP media officer Shairul Kabir Khan said.
Jamaat-e-Islami will also take to the streets of the capital on Thursday.
The Jatiya Party, formerly close to Hasina’s regime, will also hold a rally.
It will be its first outdoor political event since its offices were vandalised in October, allegedly for helping Hasina’s Awami League cling to power.
On Friday, the National Citizens Party (NCP), formed by students who spearheaded the youth-led protests that overthrew Hasina, will hold a rally.
NCP leader Nahid Islam initially joined the interim government led by Yunus, before resigning to form the party.
“Political programmes help us build public engagement,” said senior NCP official Ariful Islam Adib. “This rally isn’t about showing strength, but we expect 20,000 to 30,000 attendees.”
Hefazat-e-Islam, a platform of Islamic seminaries, will hold a “grand rally” on Saturday.
“Our rally is a reminder to the government of the sacrifices we’ve made,” said its leader Mamunul Haque, adding they will use the event to present their demands.
Key among them is scrapping recommendations by a government women’s commission for ending discriminatory provisions against women, a further indication of how hardline, religiously fuelled activism is strengthening after years of suppression.
“We will present four demands. Chief among them is scrapping the recommendations of the Women’s Rights Commission,” Haque said.
“We don’t care if it’s Muhammad Yunus in charge or someone even more prominent, we’ll take to the streets,” he added.
Hasina, who remains in self-imposed exile in India, has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.</p><small>2025-05-01 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/01095217fa4f929.jpg?r=095223' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907647/body-of-boy-who-died-in-india-reaches-karachi-after-mishap' target='_blank'><strong>Body of boy who died in India reaches Karachi after mishap</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The body of a 23-year-old Quetta resident, Aryan Shah, who died in Chennai, India, last week while undergoing cancer treatment,  arrived in Karachi on Wednesday after a delay caused by an airline  mishap.
Aryan Shah, who had been receiving treatment for several months in a  hospital in Chennai, succumbed to the illness last week. He had travelled  to India with his parents for medical care.
Following his death, Shah’s mother appealed to Balochistan Chief  Minister Sarfraz Bugti for financial assistance to repatriate the body  as the family could not afford the costs.  Chief Minister Bugti arra­nged financial  support and contacted the Pakistani ambassador in India through the  Foreign Office to facilitate the transfer.
The parents travelled to Karachi via an international airline with the coffin. However, upon arrival, they discovered that the body had been  mistakenly left in Colombo.
“I have received the body of my son  from Colombo,” Shah’s mother said. “The Indian government or hospital  did not extend any help in shifting the body of my son.”
Pakistani  authorities contacted the airline, which subsequently flew the body  from Colombo to Karachi, where it arrived on Wednesday.
Officials  in Quetta said the family has arranged to transport the body to Quetta  by ambulance. They departed Karachi late on Wednesday evening and are  expec­ted to reach Quetta early Thursday morning.

Sindh’s Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon made this announcement in a social media post.
He said that the aim of this project was to bringing a revolutionary change to the public transport system, empower women, ensure safe travel, and promote eco-friendly transport across the province, said a press release issued on Wednesday evening.
Mr Memon, who also holds the portfolio of transport and information departments, described the Peoples Pink and Normal Taxi Service as a “historic milestone for Sindh”.
He said that the Sindh government was committed to modernising the transport system and creating equal opportunities for all segments of society.
Earlier, Mr Memon had said that the provincial government was working to bring ride-hailing services in Karachi under one system, Dawn.com reported.
“We are working to bring the [online] taxi system in Karachi under one umbrella in an integrated and modern manner,” he said while chairing a meeting of the transport department.
He added that these services will be organised under one umbrella so that safe, standard and legal facilities can be provided to passengers. “All online taxi services like Careem, Yango would be brought under one system,” he said.
Speaking about an earlier announcement by the Sindh government about providing pink scooters to women free of cost, Mr Memon said that rapid progress was being made in this regard to provide women with ease of transport facilities.
“Double-decker buses for the transport sector will arrive by June this year. A large batch of new buses is expected in late June or early July,” he added.

• Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Jaffarabad, Sohbatpur, Nasirabad identified as hotspots
ISLAMABAD: The United Nations has launched a comprehensive ‘Heatwave Contingency Plan’ for Pakistan, targeting areas most vulnerable to extreme heat.
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), which prepared the plan, anticipatory action efforts in Pakistan are closely aligned with the ‘Inter-sectoral Heatwave Contingency Plan’ and are being further reinforced through OCHA’s coordination role.
By working in close collaboration with provincial disaster management authorities (PDMAs) and humanitarian partners, the OCHA is facilitating joint planning, mapping of heatwave response efforts and fostering collective preparedness.
In 2025, pre-arranged fuel funding amounting to $829,728 has been secured to support the readiness and activation phases of heatwave response activities. These interventions aim to reach around 776,000 people across 12 high-risk districts in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Anticipatory actions will be triggered based on pre-agreed thresholds and guided by established action plans.
 
 

The ‘Global Climate Risk Index’ has ranked Pakistan as the fifth most vulnerable country to climate change, highlighting its high exposure to extreme weather events and the resulting economic and human impacts. This ranking indicates that Pakistan is significantly exposed to the effects of climate change, particularly extreme weather events, such as floods and heatwaves.
A mild to moderate heatwave occurs when the daily maximum temperature is three to five degrees Celsius above the normal maximum temperature for a duration of three to five days, which can lead to physical and mental health issues like fatalities and hospitalisation, according to UNOCHA.
Local factors such as humidity, wind speed, air pressure, population sensitivity and acclimatisation play a role in determining the influence of a heatwave. Urban areas with populations over one million are typically one to three degrees warmer than surrounding areas.
Urban areas — particularly Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur in Sindh and Jaffarabad, Sohbatpur, and Nasirabad in Balochistan — are at high risk and require heat management strategies and public awareness to protect vulnerable populations.
Under the contingency plan, a total of 38 districts will be targeted in all the four provinces with an estimated affected population of 36.08 million. Sindh will be most affected by the heatwave, followed by Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Based on the 2024 heatwave situation, the UNOCHA has observed that despite recurring heatwaves, urban areas like Karachi lack effective early-warning systems to mitigate heat-related deaths.
The absence of affordable cooling technologies, public cooling centres and hydration points exacerbates heat risks in urban settings, it said, calling for subsidies for affordable cooling technologies, public cooling centres in high-density areas, and water kiosks in urban and rural locations.

• Says India has no legal authority to unilaterally revoke IWT
• Lawmakers slam repeated Indian ceasefire violations, unprovoked firing at LoC
• India will face defeat if war is imposed, warns Muqam
MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly on Wednesday strongly condemned India’s false flag operation in Pahalgam and the immediate, baseless accusations against Pakistan, as well as the anti-Muslim and anti-Kashmiri propaganda pushed by Indian media in its aftermath.
In a unanimous resolution jointly tabled by members representing almost all parliamentary parties, the House decried the arrest of over 2,500 civilians, demolition of homes, and other oppressive measures in India-held Kashmir.
The lawmakers also denounced the decisions of India’s Cabinet Committee on Security, terming them a deliberate attempt to malign Pakistan and discredit the indigenous freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir without any investigation.
The resolution asserted that India had no legal authority to unilaterally revoke the Indus Waters Treaty, which was guaranteed by the World Bank.
Any such move by New Delhi, the House warned, would be seen as a deliberate attempt to push the region toward instability and war.
Fully endorsing the “bold stance and decisions” taken by Pakistan’s National Security Committee, the assembly called it a fitting response to India’s expansionist and aggressive posturing.
The lawmakers also condemned repeated ceasefire violations and unprovoked firing by Indian occupation forces along the Line of Control (LoC), while paying tribute to Pakistan’s armed forces for responding with strength and professionalism.
“This House salutes Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir for his principled and unambiguous stand on the right to self-determination of Kashmiris, for exposing India’s Hindutva agenda, and for highlighting the human rights abuses in occupied Kashmir,” the resolution read.
Reaffirming their full support, the lawmakers declared that the people of Jammu and Kashmir stood shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan’s armed forces in the defence of the country and were ready to make any sacrifice for its security and stability.
They termed India’s expansionist ambitions a threat to international peace and security, and condemned the ongoing persecution of religious minorities — particularly Muslims — in India, including attacks on their places of worship, enforced conversions, and state-backed violence.
Paying tribute to the martyrs of occupied Kashmir and the resilience of its people, the House reiterated that the people and government of AJK would continue to stand with them in their just struggle.
The resolution pointed out that the Kashmir freedom movement aligned with international law and United Nations resolutions, and that no Indian action could change the disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir.
It urged the UN and international community to hold India accountable for implementing the relevant UN resolutions and to take notice of the serious human rights violations in occupied Kashmir.
Unity across political lines
During the session, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq called for unity across political lines to confront the prevailing situation, urging all sides to remain prepared for any eventuality.
He announced that the assembly session would continue until the situation returned to normal, and reaffirmed that the Kashmir cause remained the government’s top priority.
Expressing their views, lawmakers from both sides of the divide noted that India was putting the lives of millions in the region at risk. They made it clear that the Kashmiri struggle was against fascist ideology and an oppressive military, not against India’s Dalit and other minority communities who themselves faced systematic persecution under the Modi regime.
They stressed that the people of AJK would be at the forefront, alongside Pakistan’s armed forces, in the event of any aggression.
Meanwhile, at one point during the session, the speaker asked the government to restrict tourist movement to Neelum Valley in view of the current war-like situation. He said the threat of Indian aggression made it necessary to prevent tourists from becoming stranded or endangered, and asked the administration to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all visitors.
Meanwhile, federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam on Wednesday said that the people living along the LoC were not alone — the entire nation, the government, and Pakistan Army stood by them.
Addressing a “Solidarity with Kashmir” rally in Sharda, located in the upper belt of Neelum Valley, he said Pakistan had always desired peace, but if India initiated a war, the entire nation would stand shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan Army to defeat it. “No power in the world can defeat the passion of the Pakistani nation and the commitment of its armed forces,” he declared.
The minister reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to playing an active role at every forum to secure the Kashmiri people’s fundamental right to self-determination and vowed never to backtrack on the cause of their freedom.

Led by Sanjay Kumar, a PPP minority member of the Balochistan Assembly, the rally included men and women carrying placards and banners with anti-Modi and anti-India slogans.
The protesters marched through various roads and streets of the provincial capital before gathering outside the Quetta Press Club.
Chanting slogans against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government, protesters rejected any involvement by Pakistan in the Pahalgam attack.
“The Hindu community in Pakistan stands united with the country’s armed forces. If India dares commit aggression, over 10 million Hindus in Pakistan will stand behind our military,” Sanjay Kumar said while addressing the gathering.
 
 

Other speakers, including several women, also condemned the Indian government’s actions and rhetoric. They criticised India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it a violation of international agreements.
“India cannot unilaterally suspend the treaty signed in 1960 without the consent of other stakeholders,” protesters said.
The protest ended peacefully after the speeches.

Titled “Free speech and public interest journalism under siege”, the report finds that the existential crisis was triggered by amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in January 2025 that now “makes it easier” for authorities to arrest, fine and imprison journalists and dissidents — both offline and online — besides other challenges.
 
 

“The existential threat is serious as such a situation is seen rare in Pakistani media history. This situation is threatening the very foundation of democracy and the state is more brutal now than it was before to tolerate hard questions,” Freedom Network Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said, as the report launch coincides with World Press Freedom Day being commemorated globally on May 3 every year.
Authored by Adnan Rehmat, the report provides an overview of the freedom of expression and media freedoms in Pakistan prevalent during May 2024-April 2025.

Freedom Network says crisis has been triggered by amendments to Peca; KP emerges as the most dangerous for journalists, followed by Islamabad and Punjab

“These challenges reflect the broader shrinking space for media freedoms in the country. Such a declining media space means citizens will have little access to information they need to know,” co-author Iqbal Khattak said.
Five journalists were killed during the period the report covered. Three journalists were killed in Sindh and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while at least 82 journalists and other media professionals had faced different types of threats during the same period.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa emerged as the most dangerous province for journalists where 22 cases were documented while Islamabad recorded the second highest number of 20 cases against journalists and followed by 18 cases in Punjab. Four cases were recorded in Balochistan and one in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The report said at least 14 journalists faced legal cases, mostly under Peca law while in eight cases journalists were arrested or detained in pursuance of legal cases.
Growing censorship, legal restrictions, violence against journalists, impact of disinformation on media and its practitioners’ integrity, challenges for women media practitioners, effects of political polarisation on media freedom and safety of journalists were key areas the report identified as main reasons for the current situation facing the freedom of expression and media freedom.
The women’s representation in the country’s media has improved over the time, but significant disparities remained in the period under review.
“Even though inadequately represented in media in quantitative terms, women are active in various forms of media, including print, television, radio and digital platforms,” the report says.
It recommended “national movement to protect and pursue the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression and the right to express dissent with policies and state action that impinge on the fundamental rights of citizens”.
The report also seeks inclusion and engagement to mobilise public and civil society actors to make “the national movement” stronger and working.
A national consensus of key stakeholders for a new charter on digital rights of the citizens of Pakistan that “guarantees the same constitutional guarantees online as offline, and ensure internet access for all, quality internet and digital rights including the right to digital freedom of expression”.

Imperious after winning their opening five games of the ongoing HBL Pakistan Super League season, they were routed by a rampant Lahore Qalandars at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.
The 88-run victory saw Qalan­dars win for a second time in two matches and move up to second in the table behind United.
Lahore were powered by a brilliant all-round show by Sikandar Raza, as well as valuable contributions from the bat by Sam Billings and Fakhar Zaman with Haris Rauf showing signs of returning to his lethal best with the ball. 
After Raza and Billings’ late onslaught had boosted Qalandars to 209-6, the former and Haris shared six wickets equally as United were shot out for 121. 
Raza  (39 off 17, three fours and three sixes) and Billings (38 not out off 17, one four and four sixes), coupled up  with poor fielding by United saw Qalandars bounce back from a tricky  start. 
Coming in at number five and six respectively,  Billings and Raza combined for a 64-run partnership for the fifth  wicket, which came in only 23 balls as Qalandars posted a winning total.
Billings  was the third Qaland­ars batter to be handed a reprieve by the United  fielders — who missed catching chances to dismiss Fakhar and  Daryl Mitchell.
United looked to have kept things in control until  Hunain Shah dropped a simple catch to hand Fakhar -- at four at  that point -- a reprieve in the fourth over off pacer Ben Dwarshuis. 
The  missed opportunity was followed by three consecutive boundaries and a  six by Fakhar before his opening partner Mohammad Naeem lifted Naseem  Shah’s pace for another maximum over square-leg.
Naeem’s stay was  ended by a brilliant fielding effort by Dwarshuis to run the youngster  out before Fakhar cleared deep square off Jason Holder to take Qalandars  to 56-1 by the end of the powerplay.
The incoming Abdullah  Shaf­ique took on Hunain for three fours in the eighth over before Fakhar  showed his prowess through the off-side off Shadab Khan’s spin to take  Qalandars to 91-1 at halfway stage.
On a roll, when Fakhar  attempted to go big against spinner Imad Wasim in the 11th over, he  missed the line for United wicket-keeper Azam Khan to stump him for 44  off 30 (five fours and two sixes).
Imad then returned in the 13th  to trap Abdullah (22 off 17, three fours) lbw. The former Pakistan  all-rounder would have gone on to get his third two overs later, had  Sahibzada Farhan held on to an opportunity presented by Billings at deep  point after the Englishman had reverse-swept Imad for a six and a four.
United  faltered in the field once again in the next over with vice-captain  Salman Ali Agha misread a skier at long-off to see a Mitchell hit  sail over the boundary before the New Zealander, swivelled to clear  Holder over deep backward square.
Mitchell (28 off 18, two fours  and two sixes), however, finally became United’s fourth breakthrough,  holing Dwarshuis to Haider Ali at deep midwicket before Billings picked  the Austr­alian bowler up over the same reason for six to take Qalandars  past 150.
Billings muscled Naseem before scooping him for two more  sixes in the next over and the incoming Raza  plundered Dwar­shuis  audaciously for two fours and as many sixes in the penultimate over.
The Zimbabwean pumped a six off Holder and squeezed him past point for four more in the final over as Qalandars crossed 200.
In response, United struggled to 49-1 in the powerplay, which also saw Sahibzada Farhan fall to Shaheen Shah Afridi in the third over. But Salman Ali Agha (36 off 25, two fours and three sixes) and Andries Gous responded to the early loss in style, playing some brilliant strokes to put up 69 off 43 together before the former was cleaned up by a yorker by Sikandar Raza.
With United at 87-2 by the 10th over, Haris’ fiery pace trapped Azam  lbw. Asif Afridi followed it up with Haider’s wicket in the next over as the right-hander hol­ed the spinner out to long-off, where Tom Curran took a decent catch.
Haris then returned to wreck the stumps of Gous (41 off 27, two fours and three sixes), as the ball skid in with pace, and bowled a bouncer to get the incoming Jason Holder caught behind down the leg-side.
Imad followed suit, finding Shaheen at mid-off off Curran as United crumbled at 109-7. Raza was holed out to the boundary by Dwashuis and Shadab in the next over before Haris saw Naseem caught in the deep as the Islamabad outfit was bundled out by the end of the 17th over.

MADRID: Madison Keys of the US returns to Poland’s Iga Swiatek during their Madrid Open quarter-final at Caja Magica on Wednesday.—AFP

 
MADRID: Iga Swiatek kept her Madrid Open title defence alive, as she avenged her Australian Open defeat to Madison Keys with a 0-6, 6-3, 6-2 win against the American in the quarter-finals on Wednesday.
The second seed will next square off with Coco Gauff, who beat 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva for the third time in as many meetings, 7-5, 6-1.
Searching for her first title of the season, the second-seeded Swiatek recovered from a poor opening set to improve her clean record on clay against Keys to 4-0 and reach a third consecutive Madrid semi-final.
Keys knocked out the Pole on her way to a maiden Grand Slam title in Melbourne three months ago and seemed to have cracked the Swiatek code when she handed her a bagel in the first set on Wednesday.
But Swiatek, who was contesting a 17th consecutive quarter-final on clay, cut down on her errors and struck back to book a last-four clash with Gauff.
“It was one of the weirdest matches I played,” said Swiatek on court.
“Madi was playing perfectly at the beginning. I just tried to play a bit shorter, put the ball in. I just stayed in there.”
Swiatek is famous for dishing out 6-0 sets and it was unusual for the five-time Grand Slam champion to be on the receiving end of one.
“It didn’t feel good. At least it’s fast, you know, but that’s the only positive thing,” she said.
On court in the Arantxa Sanchez stadium, Gauff saved two set points while receiving at 4-5 before seizing a one-set lead after 63 minutes of play against Andreeva.
Gauff cruised in the second set to dismiss the seventh-seeded Russian and reach her first semi-final of the year — outside of the mixed team United Cup event.
The fourth-seeded American gave herself a 9/10 grade for her performance, adding:  “I think I played really well and stayed composed, even when facing those set points.
Elsewhere, Elina Svitolina extended her winning streak to 11 consecutive matches with a swift 6-2, 6-1 rout of Japan’s Moyuka Uchijima in just 52 minutes.
A champion in Rouen last week, Svitolina is undefeated on clay this season and is the first Ukrainian woman to reach the semi-finals in Madrid. The 30-year-old has won her last 22 consecutive sets on the red dirt.
In ATP action, Novak Djokovic’s conqueror Matteo Arnaldi earned multiple top-20 wins in one event for the first time by knocking out 16th-seeded Frances Tiafoe 6-3, 7-5 to move into the Madrid quarter-finals.
The Italian world number 44 will take on Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 quarter-final on clay with a 6-2, 6-2 result against world number 12 Tommy Paul.
On Tuesday, world No 2 Alexander Zverev was knocked  out of the tournament in the round-of-16 by Argentina’s Francisco  Cerundolo. Cerundolo, ranked 21, beat the German — a two-time former winner in Madrid — 7-5, 6-3 to repeat his feat from last year.

“Novak Djokovic has announced he won’t take part to #IBI25,” organisers of the clay court tournament announced on social media.
The organisers did not state the reason for 37-year-old Djokovic’s withdrawal.
The Serb’s wait for a 100th ATP title goes on after his withdrawal from the Masters event in the Italian capital which he has won six times, most recently in 2022.
His last silverware came at the Paris Olympics last year — at the site of Roland Garros where the next Grand Slam in the calendar will take place from May 26 to June 8.
The Belgrade-native’s absence from the final main warm-up event to the French Open casts further doubts over his chances of claiming a fourth title at Roland Garros.
Indeed, Djokovic is yet to lift a trophy this season after enduring a turbulent start to 2025.
Djokovic lost the Miami Open final to Czech teenager Jakub Mensik last month, before suffering early exits on the clay in Monte Carlo and Madrid.
He was eliminated from the Madrid Open on Saturday after defeat to Italy’s Matteo Arnaldi, which followed on from his loss to Alejandro Tabilo in his opener at the Monte Carlo Masters.
Prior to the start of the clay court season, the world number five said he was suffering from the effects of an eye infection, and he has endured a winless run of form as he adapts to the  “new reality” of his career.
“I was hoping I can play one more match than I played in Monte Carlo,” Djokovic said after losing in Madrid.  “(It’s) kind of a new reality for me, I have to say.
“Trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament... It’s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis.” Following Djokovic’s elimination in the Spanish capital, he hinted it might be his last appearance at the event.
“It could be (my last appearance). It could be. I’m not sure if I will come back. So, I don’t know. I mean, I’ll come back, maybe not as a player, of course. I hope it’s not, but it could be,” Djokovic said.

The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief becomes the country’s tenth NSA.
A notification issued by the Cabinet Division on Tuesday said that Gen Malik would retain his role as DG ISI, a position he has held since September 2024.
“Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik HI(M), DG (I), shall hold the additional charge of the National Security Adviser, with immediate effect,” the notification stated.
His appointment marks the first time a serving ISI chief will concurrently serve as the NSA.
The posting comes amid heightened tensions with India following the recent Pahalgam attack.
The NSA position had remained vacant since April 2022, when the PTI government was ousted after former Prime Minister Imran Khan lost a vote of confidence. At the time, Moeed Yusuf was serving as the NSA.
The NSA holds the status of a federal minister and serves as the principal adviser to the Prime Minister on matters of national security, foreign policy, and strategic affairs.
The adviser also heads the National Security Division, based at the Prime Minister’s Secretariat in Islamabad.

“There was a deliberate and predetermined sch­e­me to take over IHC,”  feared Muneer A. Malik on behalf of five IHC’s judges who have  petitioned the SC on an inter-se seniority dispute.
The counsel will further dilate upon the aspect when the constitutional bench will meet again on May 7.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, the five-judge constitutional bench was hearing a set of petitions of five IHC judges namely Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz have moved a joint petition before the Supreme Court with a plea not to treat the three transferred judges as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
The senior counsel also furnished a 37-page rejoinder to rebut federal gover­nm­ent’s statement before the bench contending that judges were transferred to IHC after six high court judges wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Comm­­ission (SJC) on March 25, 2024 complaining instances of executive’s interference in their judicial functions and attempts to intimate them and conduct their secret surveillance.
 
 

On Wednesday while going through summaries initiated for the transfer of the three judges to IHC from different high courts, the counsel emphasised that these summaries were approved by the Prime Minister as well as the President on the same day. Such mode of approval indicated that there was no independent application of mind on part of the President contrary to what was held in the 2021 Qazi Faez Isa reference case.
To substantiate, the cou­nsel cited the second summary of Jan 30, 2025 rela­ted to the transfer of the Balochistan High Court judge to IHC and pointed out that the summary was approved by the President as well as the Prime Minister on the same day in the same manner.
Referring to the initiation summaries moved by the law secretary to the registrars of the three high courts, the counsel highlighted that these summaries suggest that the representation of judges from Punjab was disproportionate to the total strength of 13 judges in the IHC whereas there was no judge in the IHC from the rural Sindh. The counsel highlighted that these summaries were initiated by the executive and not by the judiciary.
At this, Justice Muha­m­mad Ali Mazhar acknowledged that Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz in the IHC belongs to Sindh, whe­reas Justice Salahuddin Panw­har reminded that the sum­mary has pointed out about the absence of any judge from the rural Sindh.
The counsel, however, reminded the court that Article 200 contemplated “meaningful and purposive” consultative process for the transfer of the judges from one high court to another.
As Justice Mazhar asked him to read out the concurrence of Chief Justice Yahya Afridi for the transfer of judges to the IHC, the counsel said he would not shy away from reading any document and then read out CJP’s approval for the transfer.
The chief justice in his Feb 1, 2025 opinion which was communicated thro­ugh the Supreme Court registrar had stated, “The proposed transfer of the three judges from the high courts of different federating units to IHC completely syncs with the spirit of the federalism as enshrined in the Constitution.”
“It is also in conformity with Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010.” “The thoughtful consideration behind the proposal illustrates resolve in providing an equitable share to linguistic diversity of our country and fair chance of representation to all the federating units in the high court of the common capital of the federation ie IHC.”
“Notice none of these summaries addresses the issue of oath or seniority of the judges to be transferred to IHC,” the counsel emphasised.
But Justice Mazhar rem­inded that we don’t know about summaries regarding opinions of the chief justices of the respective high courts, adding may be CJP had consulted with the respective chief justices through phone calls.
“How CJP could give his consent unless he asked first from chief justices of the respective high courts,” Justice Mazhar observed.
But the counsel emphasised that even in that process the issue of seniority and oath of the transferred judges were side stepped and not touched upon.
“I must reiterate that there must have been some consultation between the CJP and chief justices of the high courts may be on phone giving the fact that CJP had given ample reasons in his concurrence,” observed Justice Mazhar.
The counsel contended that it was after and not before the concurrence, the summary to the Prime Minister said that no fresh oath was needed under Article 200 of the Constitution rather it was for the first time that these issues were addressed.
Justice Mazhar reminded that the summary was referring to Article 200 and it was a matter of interpretation.
The counsel contended that in the process of transfer of judges under Article 200, the judiciary has to be insulated from the executive and ought to have been approved by the Cabinet since the transfer was an act of the executive.

And thereby hangs a tale.
It is, of course, abundantly clear that whoever carried out the massacre at Pahalgam or whoever backed the hideous killing of men by identifying them by their religion, helped the BJP’s divisive agenda under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch.
This was just as true of the killing of 40 troops in Pulwama in 2019. It too was turned into a communal incident.
A division of Indians along Hindu-Muslim lines inevitably helps negate the predominant social reality of caste, not only among Hindus but also for minorities, including Muslims. The killing of 27 men in Pahalgam, predominantly Hindu, by suspected Muslim gunmen, premeditated or not, was quickly turned into a Hindu-Muslim slugfest.

Pahalgam incident seen as helping ‘BJP’s divisive agenda’; quickly turned into ‘Hindu-Muslim slugfest’

“They didn’t ask one’s caste. They asked about their religion.” Pamphlets were put out on TV post haste within moments of the slaughter. The opposition said it was the BJP at work.
This was the currency that works sure footedly for political mileage. In Gujarat, too, almost moments after the burning of the train coach in Godhra in 2002, the Indian government blamed Pakistan before quickly turning its finger at well-to-do Muslims who had recently won the municipal elections in Godhra.
 
 

The “Mian Musharraf” slur continued to describe Gujarat Muslims to extract the last drop of political elixir. But poll-bound Bihar doesn’t respond quite so well to Hindu-Muslim mischief given its more entrenched, centuries-old social reality around caste.
Nitish Kumar and Lalu Yadav were part of the JP Movement, but belonged to different castes. (Nitish Kumar is the current chief minister of Bihar while Lalu Yadav is a predecessor).
The BJP too needs to move along the caste ruts while seeking to keep the religious pot boiling. When it overlooks the caste angle, its poll arithmetic is likelier challenged. That’s how a Dalit politician from the opposition could defeat the BJP candidate in Ayodhya in the general election last year.
Change of tact
When the full cabinet met under Mr Modi’s watch on Wednesday, the discussion was expected to be entirely on the India-Pakistan tensions. But the headlines were unexpectedly different, suggesting a more politically savvy preparation for Bihar than the Hindu-Muslim cliché.
No timeline was given and polls are due in the politically crucial state in October. The promise was made but the timeline was not provided about when the promise would be honoured. That’s what the newspapers focused on.
“With an eye on the Bihar elections, the Union government on Wednesday announced that a caste census will be conducted along with the decadal census,” The Wire reported.
Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw made the announcement at a cabinet briefing. “However, he did not provide any timeline for when the decadal census or the corresponding caste census will be conducted,” the report said.
The last population census was conducted in 2011 and the 2021 census, which was delayed by the pandemic, is yet to be conducted.
“Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) has decided that caste enumeration should be included in the forthcoming census. This demonstrates that our government is committed to the values and interests of society and country.
“Like in the past, when our government had introduced 10pc reservation for the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society without causing any stress in any section,” said Vaishnaw.
A nationwide caste census has been a long-standing demand of the opposition parties and was a central issue during the Lok Sabha elections last year. Vaishnaw, while making the announcement on Wednesday, accused the INDIA alliance of using the caste census as a “political tool” and said that Congress governments have “always opposed caste census”.
The cynicism hasn’t abated on the communal front, though. Reports are coming of assaults on and beating up of Muslims in BJP-ruled states.
In Kashmir, where the police are controlled by New Delhi, the people helped arrest the slide. But, as Mirwaiz Umar Farooq noted on Wednesday, Kashmiris are being assaulted elsewhere.
“The physical and verbal assault on Kashmiri shawl vendors in Mussoorie (a hill station in Uttarakhand state), who had to flee when police refused to guarantee their safety, is very disturbing,” he said in a statement. “After large-scale detentions, demolition of homes, and crackdowns inside Kashmir, ordinary citizens, students, and small traders outside of J&K are being attacked and forced to return.”
Mirwaiz slammed the communal upsurge and the killings in Pahalgam in the same breath.
“Being themselves at the receiving end of all forms of violence and subsequent suffering for decades, Kashmiris’ condemnation, empathy, and grief for the victims of the Pahalgam bloodbath is straight from the heart, yet they are being vilified and targeted. I appeal to the people of India not to fall prey to hatred and media propaganda creating mistrust of Kashmiris, and reciprocate in ensuring their safety, as they have always done in times of crisis towards all visitors and tourists.”
Pahalgam has set a political agenda, however, in which caste calculations have surged to the fore. The delicate manoeuvre requires a balance between keeping the India-Pakistan border hot and not losing the state polls.

• Bushra Bibi’s appeal to be taken up by division bench next week
ISLAMABAD: In a major blow to Imran Khan’s hopes for a legal reprieve, the Islamabad High Court has signalled that his appeal against a 14-year sentence in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case won’t be heard this year — effectively keeping the former prime minister in legal limbo throughout 2025.
The report by the IHC registrar office was submitted to a division bench in response to an application, seeking the early hearing of an appeal against the conviction of the PTI founder and his spouse, Bushra Bibi.
As per the report, a criminal appeal filed in January 2025 by Mr Khan, sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, faces indefinite delays, with the court confirming that the case would not be heard during the current calendar year.
 
 

The report cited the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) recommendations, according to which the court had approved a ‘fixation policy’ in February 2023 to expedite pending cases, particularly the appeals filed by convicts. Key measures included designating special benches to resolve cases pending for over five years within two months. However, despite these directives, fresh cases like the 2025 appeal remain trapped in procedural limbo.
As per the report, 279 convict appeals are pending before the court, including 63 about the death sentence and 73 against life imprisonment. In 88 cases, the sentences are more than seven years and while in 55 cases, they are up to seven years.
The subject appeal, filed in January 2025, relates to a convict sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, said the report. Despite its recent filing, the case remains at the “motion stage”, requiring the preparation of paper books (mandatory legal documents) before admission.
“After [the appeal’s] admission, paper books are required to be prepared. So far, its fixation for regular hearing… is not in sight during the calendar year 2025,” the report stated, underscoring the procedural bottleneck. The report explicitly stated that due to existing priorities under the NJPMC’s policy—which focuses on older cases—the appeal of Mr Khan has “no sight of fixation for a regular hearing in 2025”.
Bushra’s appeal next week
During the hearing on the application for early hearing of this matter, the division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif scheduled Bushra Bibi’s plea for suspension of her seven-year sentence for hearing next week.
Barrister Salman Safdar, representing the petitioners, raised concerns over the court office’s handling of urgent applications. “For the third time, the PTI founder is in jail in this case, and our applications for suspension of sentence remain pending,” he told the bench.
He alleged that the registrar’s office was not processing the relevant applications and was instead prioritising other appeals unjustifiably.
Mr Safdar also emphasised that Bushra Bibi had no direct involvement in the case and requested immediate relief for her. He further urged the bench to fix the case for next Tuesday, citing travel arrangements from Lahore. In response, Acting Chief Justice Dogar remarked, “Let me tell you the day, I will see.”
Commenting on the development, advocate Faisal Hussain said that the delay has exposed the strategy of the PTI’s legal team. He said that the legal team should convince the court that this was not a routine case, and being its peculiar nature, the case should be heard on priority basis.

• India closes airspace for Pakistani planes until May 23; flights to GB cancelled for a few hours
• US Secy of State urges PM Shehbaz to help probe Pahalgam attack; tells New Delhi to work with Pakistan for de-escalation
ISLAMABAD: Amid a flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at calming tensions in the Subcontinent, fears of a possible military confrontation between India and Pakistan continued to persist on Wednesday.
Following a statement by Information Minister Atta Tarar in the early hours of Wednesday, where he warned of a possible incursion by India within the next 24-36 hours, a number of incidents of Indian aggression heightened tensions.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Pakistani security forces delivered a robust response to India’s unprovoked ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC), destroying an Indian checkpost after late-night aggression on April 29-30.
According to security officials, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked small arms fire in the Kiani and Mandal sectors, which was met with a prompt response.
Sources told APP that the retaliatory strikes destroyed several bunkers, including the Chakputra post in India-held Kashmir.
Reuters also reported that a conversation was held between top army officers from India and Pakistan — without naming them.
 
 

Separately, state media also reported that a “timely and swift response” by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had forced four Indian Rafale jets to retreat.
Quoting security sources, state-run PTV and Radio Pakistan said that the previous night, four Indian Rafales were detected patrolling over the territory of held-Kashmir. A timely and prompt action by the PAF forced them to retreat.
They said that Indian jets became flustered and retreated owing to the PAF’s prompt response.
Airspace concerns
With tensions running high, Pakistan briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan, while India shut its airspace for all Pakistan-registered aircraft, or those owned and operated by Pakistani airlines or operators, including military craft.
A Notam (Notice to Airmen) issued by New Delhi said the closure would be from April 30 to May 23, 2025.
While PIA flights to the Gilgit and Skardu airports were cancelled on Wednesday, two Airblue flights between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, sources said.
The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”.
However, the airspace closure ended after a few hours and flight schedules were restored.
One source told Dawn that the airspace closure was carried out due to certain exercises that were being carried out, but it was not clear if this was directly linked to the heightened tensions with India, or due to inclement weather, as rain and wind storms are predicted to sweep across the country’s northern parts from today.
Residents and visitors obviously faced difficulties, as alternative land routes are often less reliable and more time-consuming.
Diplomatic efforts
Meanwhile, the United States has urged both Pakistan and India to take steps to de-escalate tensions in the region.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio conveyed the message in separate calls with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.
In a readout of the call with PM Shehbaz, issued by the State Department, Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said: “The secretary spoke of the need to condemn the terror attack on April 22 in Pahalgam. Both leaders reaffirmed their continued commitment to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence.”
“The Secretary urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack. He also encouraged Pakistan to work with India to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace and security in South Asia,” the statement said.
A separate readout of Rubio’s conversation with India’s foreign minister said: “[Secretary of State Marco Rubio] encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.”
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz shared Pakistan’s perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Rubio.
During the call, the prime minister condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and termed India’s escalatory and provocative behavior as deeply disappointing and worrisome, adding that these would only distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism.
He categorically rejected Indian attempts to link Pakistan to the incident and pointed to his call for a transparent, credible, and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.
He urged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly.
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar contacted leaders from European Union countries, apprising them that Pakistan was open to an transparent investigation into the Pahalgam attack.
Mr Dar spoke with Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares and Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi, briefing them on recent regional developments, including Indian propaganda and illegal unilateral measures against Pakistan, and placing Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of international law.
He also met with US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker, who called on the foreign minister in Islamabad. Both leaders exchanged views on recent regional developments, a statement said.
In the meeting, Mr Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Ms Baker conveyed the US desire for de-escalation, adding that Washin­gton would stay engaged with both countries on the evolving situation.

Ukraine’s prime minister said First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko was flying to the United States to sign the deal, which is central to Kyiv’s efforts to mend ties with Donald Trump and the White House as the US president tries to secure a peace settlement in Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Two sources said the signing could happen later on Wednesday. But one source said the US was pushing Ukraine to sign two additional documents as well as the main minerals deal and that Kyiv felt they were not ready yet. “Who knows maybe today they will take (those) two docs and finish them too,” the source said.
A draft of the main minerals agreement showed Ukraine had secured the removal of any requirement for it to pay back the US for past military assistance, something Ukraine had staunchly opposed. Ukrainian officials hope that signing the deal promoted by Trump will help firm up softening American support for Kyiv in the more than three-year-old war.

Agreement will give Washington access to new natural resources 

The draft agreement gives the US preferential access to new Ukrainian natural resources deals but does not automatically hand Washington a share of Ukraine’s mineral wealth or any of its gas infrastructure, the draft showed. “Indeed, it is a strategic agreement... it is a truly equal, good international agreement on joint investments in the development and recovery of Ukraine,” Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said.
Joint fund
The draft sets out the creation of a joint US-Ukrainian fund for reconstruction which will receive 50 per cent of profits and royalties accruing to the Ukrainian state from new natural resources permits in Ukraine. The draft does not spell out how the joint fund’s revenues will be spent, who benefits or who controls decisions about the spending. 
Shmyhal said in televised comments that once the main agreement was signed, the two sides would agree two further technical and supplementary documents outlining issues such as how the funds are accumulated.
He said Ukraine would retain control of all its resources in the deal, while the fund will invest in the development of Ukraine for a period of 10 years. 
“Ukraine will only make a contribution from new licenses, from new royalties on mineral resources. This will be our contribution, 50pc of which will be given to this fund,” he said.
The US could use its future military assistance to Ukraine as its contribution to the fund, Shmyhal said, with no previous military aid to the country reflected in the deal. The two sides signed a memorandum, published on April 18, as an initial step towards clinching an accord on developing mineral resources in Ukraine.
In the memorandum, they said they aimed to complete talks by April 26 and to sign the deal as soon as possible. Trump and officials in his administration threatened this month to walk away from efforts to broker a peace deal unless there were clear signs of progress soon.

Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organisation and the US president’s son, attended the signing ceremony with Qatari Diar and a second real estate developement partner, Dar Global.
The 18-hole Trump International Golf Course and Trump Villas are to be constructed as part of a major government-backed development scheme unveiled last year, the Simaisma Project, which will also include a theme park and a marina.
“We are incredibly proud to expand the Trump brand into Qatar through this exceptional collaboration with Qatari Diar and Dar Global,” Eric Trump said in a statement.
“Trump International Golf Club Simaisma and our luxury villa community will reflect our highest standards of quality,” he added.
Abdullah bin Hamad bin Abdullah Al Attiya, Qatar’s municipality minister and chairman of Qatari Diar, said:  “We are delighted to partner with Dar Global to bring the prestigious Trump brand to Simaisma.”  
“Through this collaboration, we look forward to further strengthening Qatar’s position as a preferred destination for investment, tourism and luxury living, both regionally and internationally,” he added.
The Trump Organisation has already partnered with Saudi developer Dar Global on a high-rise apartment complex in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, a luxury building in Dubai and a hotel complex in Oman.

US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued the order after immigrant rights advocates argued the administration had violated a court order he issued by flying four Venezuelans held at the US naval base in Cuba to El Salvador on a flight conducted by the US Department of Defence.
Murphy in late March had issued a temporary restraining order, which he later extended into an injunction, restricting the Department of Homeland Security’s ability to rapidly deport migrants to countries other than their own without allowing them to first raise concerns about their safety or potential torture.
Republican President Donald Trump’s administration argued it did not violate the judge’s order as it only applied to the Homeland Security Department, which oversees US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, not the Defence Department.
The US Department of Justice called three of the four migrants members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and said the Department of Defence removed them to El Salvador without the knowledge or direction of the Homeland Security Department.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.  Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and Modi granting “operational freedom” to his military.
The US has urged restraint and said it was planning talks with both sides to ease the crisis.
 


A statement issued from the Prime Minister’s Office later today said the premier received a telephone call from the US Secretary of State
Marco Rubio in the evening during which Shehbaz “urged the US to impress upon India to dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly”.
“Terming India’s escalatory and provocative behaviour as deeply disappointing and worrisome, the prime minister said that India’s provocations would only serve to distract Pakistan from its ongoing efforts to defeat terrorism, particularly from militant groups, including ISKP (Islamic State Khorasan Province), TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) operating from Afghan soil,” it added.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz “categorically rejected” India’s attempts to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident, highlighting his call for a transparent, credible and neutral investigation to bring out the facts.
It said the prime minister shared Pakistan’s perspective on recent developments in South Asia since the Pahalgam incident with Secretary Rubio.
“While condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the PM underscored Pakistan’s leading role in the war on terror and its sacrifice of over 90,000 lives and over $152 billion in economic losses,” the statement read.
“It is most regrettable that India chose to weaponise water, which is a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan,” the premier was quoted as saying, while also stressing that the Indus Waters Treaty had no provision for either side to unilaterally renege from its commitments.
The prime minister added that the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute was the “only way to ensure lasting peace in South Asia”.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted to America’s top diplomat that Pakistan and the US had worked together closely over the past seven decades and there was much that both sides could cooperate on, including counter-terrorism and enhanced economic cooperation, particularly in the minerals sector.
“The prime minister also stressed that his government had undertaken major economic reforms over the past year, and consequently, Pakistan was now on the road to economic recovery,” the statement read.
“Secretary of State Rubio thanked the prime minister for the detailed conversation and emphasised the need for both sides to continue working together for peace and stability in South Asia,” it concluded.
The US State Department said in a statement that Rubio also “urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack”.
Rubio also spoke to Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, according to State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.
“The Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam, and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,” she was quoted as saying in a press release. “He also encouraged India to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.”
Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar for talks in which they exchanged views on recent regional developments.
Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and security while safeguarding national interests, while Baker conveyed the United States’ desire for de-escalation, saying that the country would stay engaged with both Pakistan and India on the evolving situation.
FM Dar also held a telephone conversation with his Omani counterpart Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al Busaidi.
Dar briefed him on the current regional situation, including “India’s inflammatory propaganda, illegal unilateral actions, and the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — a clear violation of international law”, the FO said.
The Omani FM underscored the importance of de-escalation, dialogue, and diplomacy to address issues.
FM Dar appreciated Oman’s efforts for Iran and US talks and conveyed best wishes for their success.
Separately, the Saudi foreign ministry issued a statement expressing concern regarding the escalating tension between Pakistan and India and the continued exchange of fire in the border areas.
“The kingdom calls on both countries to reduce tension, avoid escalation, resolve differences through diplomatic means, respect the principles of good neighbourliness and work to achieve stability and peace for the benefit of their peoples and the peoples of the region,” the statement said.
Indian Rafales patrolling above held Kashmir retreat after PAF scrambles jets
Earlier today, Indian fighter jets patrolling above occupied Kashmir were forced to flee after the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) scrambled its jets, state media reported.
PTV News and Radio Pakistan, citing security sources, said that four Rafale fighter jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were spotted conducting “patrolling overnight” in occupied Kashmir without crossing the Line of Control.
“PAF jets promptly detected the presence of these Indian warplanes,” Radio Pakistan added.
“As a result of PAF’s diligent action, the Indian Rafale jets panicked and were forced to flee,” PTV News reported. The security sources also reaffirmed that the armed forces were “fully prepared and vigilant to give a befitting response to any aggression from India”.
India also shut its airspace to Pakistani airlines today. The ban on Pakistani aircraft will be from April 30 to May 23, according to a Notice to Airmen issued by the Indian government.
The developments come after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar earlier today said “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the “next 24 to 36 hours”.
In a televised statement issued shortly after 2am, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to carry out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”
Tarar said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” and it was completely “reckless”.
 


“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” the minister said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”
Being a responsible state, Tarar noted, Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.
“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” he stressed.
The information minister said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives”.
“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” he added.
Tarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.
“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of [an] escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India.”
He reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.
FM Dar has said Pakistan will not strike India but reserves the right to retaliate. He informed the Senate yesterday that intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.

Today’s incident also comes after the Pakistan Army yesterday shot down two Indian quadcopters after they violated the country’s airspace along the Line of Control (LoC) in two separate areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, official sources said.
The first drone was brought down in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district, where it was reportedly engaged in aerial surveillance when intercepted and destroyed by Pakistani troops. The second unmanned aerial vehicle was shot down in Poonch division’s Satwal sector.
 
 

The downing of the drones occurred amid continued exchange of fire along the LoC in Leepa Valley since the night of April 25.
Meanwhile, as concerns over a potential breakdown of peace grew, shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) faced a major fall in intraday trade today.
Pakistan responds to unprovoked Indian firing on LoC
Meanwhile, state broadcaster PTV reported that the Pakistan Army responded to overnight unprovoked Indian firing on the LoC in AJK.

“According to security sources, on the night of April 29 and 30, India violated the ceasefire on the LoC. India opened unprovoked fire in the Kayani and Mandal sectors of the LoC,” PTV reported.
India used small arms in the unprovoked firing incident, the state broadcaster added.
“Security sources have confirmed that the Pakistan Army has responded forcefully and given a befitting reply to the Indian Army. The enemy has been silenced with an effective response,” the report said.
The state broadcaster cited reports of the destruction of several Indian bunkers due to the effective response of the Pakistan Army, adding, “Security sources have said that India’s Chakpatra post has been destroyed”.

“Earlier, India had also evacuated the border areas of occupied Kashmir while a crackdown against Muslims is underway,” PTV said, adding that the Pakistan Army was always ready to defend the integrity of the country.
PIA flights from Gilgit, Skardu cancelled
Amid heightened tensions, all Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flights operating from the Skardu and Gilgit airports to Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad — and vice versa — were cancelled today, according to PIA officials.
However, two Airblue flights destined between Skardu and Islamabad operated as per their schedule, the sources added.
The PIA official noted that the air route between Gilgit-Baltistan and other cities passes “near Indian territories”. When the passengers reached the airports, they were told that the flights had been cancelled due to security concerns.
 
 

Flight-tracking website Flightradar24 also confirmed the cancellations of a total of 10 PIA flights and departures of the two Airblue flights.
Iqra Khan, a flight inquiry officer at Islamabad International Airport (ISB), also told Dawn.com that PIA cancelled its flights today from the federal capital to Gilgit and vice versa, citing “airspace security” as a reason.
Yesterday, amid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, authorities had refuted rumours of a possible closure of airports.
According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Indian cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries were foiled earlier in the week.
The National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) has warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.
Ex-PM Imran says peace is ‘priority’, calls for unity
Amid the ongoing situation, the opposition PTI has proposed a multi-party conference with incarcerated former premier Imran Khan in attendance.
A statement posted on Imran’s X account, which is handled by a PTI member, quoted the ex-premier as telling his lawyers yesterday: “Peace is our priority but it should not be mistaken as cowardice.”
Recalling the 2019 Pulwama-Balakot incidents during his tenure, Imran said, “We offered to extend all-out cooperation to India but India failed to produce any concrete evidence.
“[…] Instead of introspection and investigation, Modi sarkar is again placing the blame on Pakistan,” the former prime minister added.
 
 

He urged India to act responsibly instead of messing with a region already known as a “nuclear flashpoint”.
“I have always emphasised the importance of the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, as guaranteed by United Nations resolutions,” Imran stressed.
“Needless to say, to win the war against an external enemy, the nation must first be united. It is high time to put a halt to all actions that are further polarising the nation,” he said, adding that the “state’s excessive focus on political victimisation at this critical time is deepening internal divisions”.
“Ironically, Narendra Modi’s aggression has united the people of Pakistan in one voice against Indian hostility,” the ex-premier noted.
India okays ‘operational freedom’ to army amid calls for restraint
A week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi yesterday told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP.
The government released video images of a stern-faced Modi holding a closed-door meeting with his army and security chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.
India’s cabinet committee on security (CCS) — consisting of Modi and his interior, defence, home and finance ministers — is scheduled to meet later today, a government source told Reuters.
This would be the second such meeting of the CCS since the attack on April 22. In its first meeting, the committee had decided to take a series of measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty.
Last week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.
“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said. “We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.
 
 

Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
Amid escalating tensions, friendly countries and global powers have urged India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, advising them to solve the matter through diplomatic engagement.
Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. In the past few days, Dar has also spoken to the foreign ministers of China, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary to brief them about Pakistan’s concerns.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint”, with its chief Antonio Guterres yesterday offering “his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”.
In his phone call with the UN chief on Tuesday, PM Shehbaz encouraged him to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.
The worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.
Indian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, the PAF undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.
