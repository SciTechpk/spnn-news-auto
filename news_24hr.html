Pakistan’s mineral wealth is estimated at $8 trillion, spread across 600,000 square kilometres and comprising 92 identified minerals, 52 of which are commercially extracted, according to an estimate by the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICMA).
He made the remarks while addressing the Pak-China Mineral Cooperation Forum in Islamabad.
Noting the scale of Pakistan’s mineral wealth, the minister highlighted the gap between the sector’s potential and performance, stating that the “gap is a result of structural constraints”.
He maintained that the mineral sector’s “transformation” was dependent on “strategic partners”, terming China’s role “central” in the matter.
“Chinese enterprises bring advanced expertise to the entire mining value chain, including geological surveying, modern extraction techniques, mineral processing, smelting, refining and manufacturing,” the minister said.
He held that existing projects with China, such as “Sandak copper gold, Duddar lead-zinc, and Thar coal demonstrate what the partnership can achieve”.
“Our objective now is to move decisively, and beyond extraction,” the minister said.
He elaborated that Pakistan is seeking to “develop mineral processing plants, smelters, refining facilities and mineral-based industrial [..] linked with special economic zones and transport corridors”.
On that note, he also suggested the establishment of a “Nokundi, Mashkel, Turbat, Gwadar corridor, through which we will be able to link the mineral sector in Balochistan to the Gwadar port”.
Iqbal noted that “the country hosts around 5,000 operational mines, producing nearly 68.5 million metric tonnes”.
However, Pakistan’s mineral exports stood at a “modest” estimate of $2 billion, the minister said, and added that the exports contribute “only 2-3 per cent to the GDP”.
The minister noted that despite having a “whole range of granite from Turbat to Chitral”, the country remained unable to utilise the full potential of the industry.
“We are still using blasting technology and destroying the value of the valuable treasure we have,” he added, calling for the need to bring in modern technology to enhance mineral extraction in Pakistan.
The minister further said that “only 40pc of Pakistan’s land had been geologically mapped, while 90pc of our exports are either raw or [..]”.
“Mineral exports have the potential to reach $6-8bn annually within this decade,” he stressed.
The minister also held that the mining initiatives should “strengthen national cohesion, rather than deepening disparities”.
He stressed that the people of Balochistan and parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa “must see tangible results in the form of job skills, infrastructure, education, and health services”.
The minister also reaffirmed the government’s commitment towards the safety and security of Chinese nationals, terming it a “top national priority”.
“The future of Pakistan-China mineral cooperation lies in co-creating values, innovation, human capital development, and long-term partnerships,” the minister said.
He extended an invitation to Chinese enterprises to “take a leading role in copper, gold, antimony, tungsten, rare earth elements and other critical minerals shaping the future of clean energy and advanced manufacturing”.
“With China as our trusted partner, we can convert mineral wealth into industrial strength, export competitiveness and shared prosperity,” the minister maintained.
In a joint communique issued earlier this month, the two countries had vowed to build an upgraded version of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with mining as one of the key sectors. Pakistan exports nearly $1.2bn worth of copper ore to China annually.
Last year, Pakistan also formally entered the global critical minerals market by dispatching its first shipment of enriched rare earth elements and critical minerals to Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM) under a $500m agreement.
The consignment sent on Oct 2, 2025, signaled Pakistan’s evolution from a resource-rich yet underutilised economy into an emerging player in strategic global supply chains.</p><small>2026-01-28 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647661-gul-plaza-blaze-took-79-lives-most-in-mezzanine-floor-report' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza blaze took 79 lives, most in mezzanine floor: report</strong></a><br><p>

Spot gold jumped 1.4 per cent to $5,262.66 per ounce, as of 05:58 GMT, after scaling a record high of $5,266.37 earlier. It has gained more than 20pc since the start of the year.
US gold futures for February delivery surged 3.4pc to $5,255.30 per ounce.
“(Gold’s rise) is due to the very strong indirect correlation with the dollar and … Trump’s remark to a casual question about the dollar, which implied that (there is) a broad-based consensus within the White House to have a weaker greenback going forward,” said Kelvin Wong, a senior market analyst at OANDA.
The US dollar was grappling with a “crisis of confidence” as it struggled near four-year lows, exacerbating dollar selling, after President Donald Trump said the currency’s value is “great” when asked whether he thought it had declined too much.
US consumer confidence, meanwhile, slumped to its lowest level in more than 11 years in January amid mounting anxiety over a sluggish labour market and high prices.
Trump added that he will soon announce his pick to serve as head of the Fed, and predicted interest rates would decline once the new chair takes over.
“Given the tension between the Fed’s mandates and the White House, I think the markets are just getting defensive ahead of (Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks later today),” Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive said.
The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady at its January monetary policy meeting, currently underway.
Wong added that near-term resistance for gold could be seen around $5,240/oz. Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday that gold could climb to $6,000 per ounce in 2026, citing persistent investment demand as central banks and investors increase allocations to non-dollar and tangible assets.
Spot silver was up 2pc at $115.40 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $117.69 on Monday. The white metal has jumped almost 60pc so far this year.
Spot platinum gained 1.7pc to $2,685.16 per ounce after hitting a record $2,918.80 on Monday, while palladium was up 0.7pc at $1,946.75.</p><small>2026-01-28 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2812570771a5e38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969520/lhc-seeks-govt-response-on-plea-seeking-to-ban-social-media-for-under-16s' target='_blank'><strong>LHC seeks govt response on plea seeking to ban social media for under-16s</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday sought replies from the federal government and other authorities on a petition seeking a ban on the use of social media by children under the age of 16.
LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum heard the petition filed by Aliya Saleem and others through Advocate Shiza Qureshi on Tuesday.
Justice Neelum observed that it was an important matter and a policy issue that should be addressed by the government.
The counsel for the petitioner contended that social media was causing serious harm to the mental, moral and educational development of children.
The petitioner’s counsel stated that developed countries were also considering restrictions on social media use by underage children.

 

The lawyer informed the court that Australia imposed a ban on children’s use of social media in December 2025, while France, Norway, Malaysia and New Zealand were in the process of legislating on the matter.
Qureshi asked the court to order a ban on social media use for children under 16 years of age.
Justice Neelum directed a law officer to seek instructions from the government and submit a report by February 16.

 

Earlier this month, senators Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Aimal Wali Khan, Saadia Abbasi and Dilawar Khan called for keeping tabs on the use of social media platforms by children under the age of 18.
Presiding over the sitting, Senator Sherry Rehman said some checks were needed and suggested forming a special committee to develop safeguards in consultation with relevant ministries.
In September, the LHC issued notices to the federal government and other respondents on a petition seeking a ban on the use of Facebook and TikTok by children.</p><small>2026-01-28 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/281233067416338.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969518/five-players-move-to-platinum-as-pcb-confirms-local-player-category-renewals-for-upcoming-psl-season' target='_blank'><strong>Five players move to Platinum as PCB confirms local player category renewals for upcoming PSL season</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday confirmed the category renewals of 89 local players for the upcoming season of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), promoting five players, including Salman Ali Agha, to the Platinum category.
A press release issued by the PCB said that the five players moved to the Platinum category were T20I captain Salman Ali Agha, Sahibzada Farhan, Mohammad Nawaz, Hasan Ali and Abrar Ahmed.
“Going forward, each franchise may retain a maximum of four players, limited to one player per category,” the statement said.
It added that, following the completion of retentions, the teams will participate in the first-ever PSL player auction on February 11 to complete their team rosters.
The statement also said that the registration date for foreign players had been extended to February 3.
According to the PCB, among the newly-designated Platinum players, only Sahibzada was previously in the Gold category, while the others made the jump from the Diamond category.
“Shadab Khan, Naseem Shah, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Babar Azam, Saim Ayub, Mohammad Rizwan, Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Amir managed to remain in the Platinum category after featuring in the HBL PSL X in the same category as well,” the statement added.
A total of 11 players are in the Diamond category, which includes three from Quetta Gladiators, three from Multan Sultans, two each from Lahore Qalandars and Karachi Kings, one from Peshawar Zalmi and none from Islamabad United, it said.
Mohammad Salman Mirza, Sufyan Moqim and Mohammad Wasim Jr have jumped up from Gold to Diamond, it added.
Among the 32 players assigned to the Gold category this year, four each are from Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars, eight from Karachi Kings, six from Peshawar Zalmi and five each from Multan Sultans and Quetta Gladiators.
The statement added that Multan Sultans have seven players in the Silver category, Lahore Qalandars have three, Peshawar Zalmi and Islamabad United have two each, and Quetta Gladiators and Karachi Kings have one each.
Meanwhile, the Emerging category comprises of 14 players with three each listed in Islamabad United, Karachi Kings and Peshawar Zalmi; two each in Quetta Gladiators and Multan Sultans, and one from Lahore Qalandars, it said.
“Hunain Shah, Ubaid Shah, Mirza Mamoon Imtiaz, Mohammad Naeem and Mohammad Azab are the players who have made the move from Emerging to Silver for the upcoming season, while Hasan Nawaz went to Gold after featuring in the HBL PSL X in the Emerging category,” the PCB added.

The storm started to develop on Friday and dumped snow across a large region over the weekend. The snow snarled road traffic and led to widespread flight cancellations and power outages before subsiding Monday, leaving behind bitter cold that is expected to linger.
By Tuesday, cities were mobilising emergency responders and resources to ensure that residents, particularly homeless people, were safe, even as more than 550,000 homes and businesses across the country lacked electricity.
Ten of the storm’s fatal victims were in New York City, where temperatures were the coldest they had been in eight years, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said at a news conference on Tuesday, when the low hit -13° Celsius.
While the 10 victims were found outside, it was not clear whether they were homeless. Mamdani told reporters Monday that some of the dead “had had interactions with our shelter system in the past. It is still too early to share a broader diagnosis or a cause of death.”

New York City postponed from this week until early February an annual count of its homeless population required by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
“Outreach workers should be focused on bringing New Yorkers inside, not on data collection,” Mamdani said. “Here is the bottom line, New York City: Extreme weather is not a personal failure.”
Around 500 of the more than 4,000 homeless people estimated to live in the city’s streets and subway have been placed in shelters since January 19, Mamdani said. Outreach workers were checking every two hours on 350 homeless people who are at particular risk due to underlying medical conditions.
In Nashville, Tennessee, a city of about 680,000 where more than 135,000 homes and businesses remain without power, the temperature is expected to drop to -14°C by Wednesday morning with below-zero wind chills.
“Let’s be clear about what this is,” Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell said at a Tuesday press conference. “It is an historic ice storm.”
Nashville officials said about 1,400 homeless people had filled all three of the city’s homeless shelters and two overflow shelters, with police and firefighters working overtime and emergency workers checking the streets.
The Nashville Rescue Mission, a homeless charity that feeds, clothes and offers shelter year-round, typically might have about 400 people a night, but in the cold snap that number has swollen to about 7,000.

 

“We’re always full, but we never turn anyone away,” an attendant who was not authorised to speak to reporters, so did not give a name, told Reuters by telephone. “When the weather is bad, people come in out of the cold.”
Various causes of death
Across the country, storm-related causes of death ranged from hypothermia and exposure to cardiac incidents while clearing snow.
In Bonham, Texas, about 55 miles northeast of Dallas, three young boys died after falling in an ice pond over the weekend, though the exact circumstances were unclear, according to the local fire department.

Several hours away in Austin, Texas, a person died of apparent hypothermia while trying to shelter at an abandoned gas station, authorities said. Other hypothermia deaths were reported from Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Michigan, local media reported.
Almost 200 million Americans remain under some form of winter cold warning at least through February 1.
Forecasters are watching for another possible winter storm to impact the eastern US this weekend, said David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Centre.</p><small>2026-01-28 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28115149c242fc0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969419/scotland-name-squad-for-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Scotland name squad for T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>EDINBURGH: With new head coach Owen Dawkins at the helm, and under the captaincy of Richie Berrington, Scotland have named their squad for their seventh appearance at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.
Scotland have replaced Bangladesh at the global showpiece being staged jointly by India and Sri Lanka from Feb 7 to March 8. Bangladesh refused to play their World Cup matches in India due to security concerns amid political tensions between New Delhi and Dhaka.
The European side had also participated in the inaugural edition of the tournament staged in 2007 in South Africa.
Zainullah Ihsan is a first-time call-up, with the Afghan-born fast bowler having recently qualified to play for Scotland.







Also in contention is former New Zealand international Tom Bruce, who will boost up their batting line-up. The 34-year-old Bruce has featured in 17 T20 Internationals for the Black Caps before he changed his allegiance to Scotland.
Squad: Richie Berrington (captain), Tom Bruce, Matthew Cross, Bradley Currie, Oliver Davidson, Chris Greaves, Zainullah Ihsan, Michael Jones, Michael Leask, Finlay McCreath, Brandon McMullen, George Munsey, Safyaan Sharif, Mark Watt, Bradley Wheal.
Travelling reserves: Jasper Davidson, Jack Jarvis
Non-travelling reserves: Mackenzie Jones, Chris McBride, Charlie Tear.

Pawar, who hailed from a top political family, was en route to his home region to canvass in local body elections, media said.
Two of his staff and two crew were also aboard the aircraft, the directorate general of civil aviation said.
“No person on board has survived,” it added in an initial statement.
Pawar backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in the state government, leading a faction that split in 2023 from the opposition Nationalist Congress Party.
Video showed billows of smoke rising from some of the burning wreckage of the plane, scattered across an open field.







Media said Pawar’s aircraft, travelling from the financial capital of Mumbai, tried to make an emergency landing in the family stronghold of Baramati, 250 km away, where he was set to canvass in the elections.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, expressed sympathy with the families of the deceased.
“Saddened by the tragic air crash in Baramati, Maharashtra. My thoughts are with all those who lost their loved ones in the crash,” he said.
“Praying for strength and courage for the bereaved families in this moment of profound grief,” the indian prime minister added.







The incident comes a week after an Indian Air Force (IAF) training aircraft crashed in India’s northern Uttar Pradesh state, with both pilots emerging unharmed.
In July 2025, more than 200 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff, in what was said to be the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
Only one person was known to have survived, as the plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel.</p><small>2026-01-28 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647623-80-year-old-man-killed-in' target='_blank'><strong>80-year-old man killed in another deadly Karachi fire</strong></a><br><p>

In a phone call with Pezeshkian, the crown prince affirmed his country’s support for any “efforts that would resolve differences through dialogue” to bolster security and stability in the region.
Earlier, Iranian media reported that Pezeshkian told bin Salman that Tehran welcomes any process, within the framework of international law, that prevents war.







The statement by the Saudi de facto ruler follows a similar statement by the United Arab Emirates that it would not allow any military action against Iran using its airspace or territorial waters.
Uncertainty over the possibility of military action in Iran has lingered after US President Donald Trump said last week that an “armada” was heading toward the country but that he hoped he would not have to use it.
Trump said on Tuesday another US “armada” was floating towards Iran and he hoped that Tehran would make a deal with Washington.
“There is another beautiful armada floating beautifully towards Iran right now,” Trump said in a speech.
“I hope they make a deal.”



Trump’s warnings to Tehran were against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated.
A US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East, two US officials told Reuters on Monday, expanding Trump’s capabilities to defend US forces, or potentially take military action against Iran.
Iran has been embroiled in protests during which rights groups say security forces killed thousands of people, including bystanders.
The rights groups describe the unrest as the biggest crackdown since the Iranian leadership took power in the 1979 revolution. Iranian authorities have blamed the unrest and deaths on terrorists and rioters backed by exiled opponents.</p><small>2026-01-28 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28101234685e5ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509/india-confirms-two-nipah-virus-cases-says-it-ensured-timely-containment' target='_blank'><strong>India confirms two Nipah virus cases, says it ensured ‘timely containment’</strong></a><br><p>Indian authorities said they had ensured “timely containment” of the deadly Nipah virus after two cases were confirmed in West Bengal state.
Nipah, spreads from animals to humans, has no vaccine and a fatality rate ranging from 40 to 75 per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
“Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, and field investigations were undertaken… which ensured timely containment of the cases,” India’s health ministry said in a statement late Tuesday.
It did not give further details on the two infected patients.
“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health measures are in place”, it added, saying 196 contacts linked to the cases had been traced, and all were negative.
Nipah was first identified in 1998 after it spread among pig farmers in Malaysia.
In India, the first Nipah outbreak was reported in West Bengal in 2001.
In 2018, at least 17 people died from Nipah in Kerala, and in 2023, two people died from the virus, also in the southern state.
Symptoms include intense fever, vomiting and a respiratory infection, but severe cases can involve seizures and brain inflammation that results in a coma.
Fruit bats are the natural carriers of the virus and have been identified as the most likely cause of subsequent outbreaks.</p><small>2026-01-28 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/281013212ad7772.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969412/children-flouting-kite-flying-law-will-be-fined-heavily' target='_blank'><strong>Children flouting kite flying law will be fined heavily</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The children who will be found involved in flouting the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance-2025 will be tried under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice System Act-2018.
The children, if found guilty of flouting the ordinance, would be punished with a fine of Rs50,000 for the first offence and Rs100,000 on account of repeating the same offence, the ordinance says.
On the other hand, the government will award cash prizes to whistle-blowers who will provide information about those flouting the regulations, Dawn has learnt.

 

According to the ordinance, if a child (below the age of 18), contravenes the provision of sub-section-1 (commits or abets an act of kite flying) shall be tried in accordance with the provisions of the Juvenile Justice System Act-2018.

The fine will be recovered from parents as land revenue arrears

“If a child is punished and [is] unable to pay the fine, it shall be recoverable from his parents or guardians, as the case may be, it shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue,” reads the ordinance.

 

According to Section-12 (1) titled “Reward to Whistle-blower,” the commissioner, on the recommendation of the deputy commissioner, may sanction reward (not exceeding Rs5,000) to the whistle-blower (person who, in the public interest, discloses commission of any offence under the ordinance) providing credible information to the DC concerned about the commission of any offence under the ordinance.
However, under sub-section 2, the whistle-blower shall not be entitled to reward under sub-section (1), if the information provided is of no value, or the DC concerned already has such information.
The ordinance, “under statement of objects and reasons” generally prohibits kite flying across Punjab, but it also empowers the government to allow permissible kite flying under a regulatory framework at specific places and days. Besides, it provides for registration of manufacturers, traders and sellers of permissible kite flying material, as well as that of kite flying associations.
The ordinance also provides for punishments to deter people who may act in contravention of the provisions of the ordinance. “It also provides [for] whistle-blowers in identifying the miscreants involved in violation of the provisions of the ordinance,” the ordinance reads.
It empowers the DCs to cancel registration of a person or kite flying association registered under section 5 or 7, in case of contravention of any provision of the ordinance, rules or regulations.

The vocabulary is predictable and well-rehearsed: exports, productivity, human capital, technology, governance, national coordination. These concepts are presented as panaceas, as if merely invoking them charts a path to freedom from the Fund. What is almost always missing is the road to get there. The discussion rarely addresses concrete policy actions, operational instruments and institutional changes needed to achieve the objective. Wishes are communicated as targets, outcomes are mistaken for reforms, and reform itself is reduced to rhetoric.
Most ‘exit plans’ suffer from a basic flaw which confuses aspirations with instruments. Saying exports must rise is not a policy. Declaring that human capital must improve is not reform. Calling for better coordination or implementation is not an economic strategy. These are desired results, not mechanisms. The real question is far simpler and far more uncomfortable: what specific changes will alter behaviour tomorrow morning?
This confusion is not accidental. Pakistan does not return to the IMF because it lacks ideas or plans. It returns because the design of its economic system systematically produces balance-of-payments crises. IMF dependence is not a technical failure but the predictable outcome of a political economy that rewards rent-seeking, blocks entry, protects incumbents, misprices energy, taxes exports obliquely, and relies on administrative discretion instead of rules. You do not exit the IMF by declaring independence from it. You exit by dismantling the domestic machinery that repeatedly recreates the financing gaps which invite the Fund back into the parlour.
The IMF appears when three conditions converge. First, foreign exchange earnings fail to grow fast enough to close the external gap. Second, fiscal deficits are financed by printing money or unsustainable borrowing. Third, credibility collapses, shutting the country out of global capital markets. Pakistan finds itself in this position repeatedly not because of bad luck or external shocks alone, but because an extractive state apparatus actively suppresses productivity and growth, particularly through trade, by distorting incentives. The result is a structurally weak economy that periodically runs out of foreign exchange and credibility.

Most ‘exit plans’ suffer from a basic flaw which confuses aspirations with instruments.

The starting point, therefore, is to abandon the illusion of planning.
For decades, Pakistan has treated growth as something that can be engineered through plans, projects, committees and conferences. Strategies are announced, PSDPs approved, monuments built, and targets proclaimed. Meanwhile, the real economy is strangled by a predatory and unfair convoluted tax regime, discretionary permissions, distorted prices, and regulatory sludge, which is manifested in primitive, excessive, opaque regulations applied unevenly, reflecting a deep distrust of markets and an exaggerated belief in the state’s omnipotence.
Growth does not emerge from better plans. It occurs when firms can enter, scale, export, hire, and invest without begging for permissions — within a competitive, predictable and rule-based environment. That is where IMF dependence is born, and that is where it must be defeated.

 

Reform must begin with energy — electricity and gas — because this is where every IMF programme eventually unravels. Pakistan’s energy crisis today is not a capacity problem. It is a failure of policy, pricing and governance. Consumers and taxpayers are punished for government inefficiencies through unreliable and unpredictable supply and pricing of energy, steadily eroding state credibility. The energy sector is neither competitive nor realistically priced. It is governed by a fragmented institutional structure involving nearly two dozen entities operating without integrated coordination.
Policy incoherence (a mix of guaranteed returns, illogical subsidies, and politicised operational decisions) along with weak management across the supply chain disfigures the tariff structure and shields inefficiency. Distribution companies continue to flounder without accountability for losses, theft, or recoveries. The consequences are entirely predictable: distorted and mispriced consumption, corrupted investment signals, rapid off-grid migration through falling solar costs, and a permanent circular debt that becomes a quasi-fiscal deficit. This eventually resurfaces as inflation, borrowing, or IMF conditionality.
The solution is neither more subsidies nor ad hoc bailouts. It is a rules-based pricing system: transparent, cost-reflective tariffs under a competitive framework, automatic adjustment mechanisms, and enforceable governance contracts that hold utilities accountable. The poor should be protected through direct, targeted cash transfers, not by penalising commercial and industrial activity through pricing distortions that bankrupt the entire system.
Next comes taxation. The structure needs to be fixed, not the rates. Pakistan’s tax system is broken by design. It is fragmented across multiple agencies and jurisdictions, riddled with inconsistent thresholds and legal interpretations, and undermined by weak trust.
The problem is not a shortage of tax policy papers; it is the distortionary structure created by exemptions, lack of equity, discretion and predatory enforcement. Tax authorities aggressively pursue those already in the net while tolerating habitual non-payers. The illusion that high rates, complexity, and coercion can force formalisation must be discarded. Decades of experience demonstrate the opposite. Punitive, tortuous and unpredictable tax regimes entangle the taxpayers’ navigation of a labyrinth of arbitrary changes in laws, rates and procedures, shrinking the formal sector, expanding informality, eroding compliance and discouraging investment.
A growth-oriented tax system must be simple, predictable, low-rate, and broad-based, treating all income streams uniformly. Its purpose should be to attract firms into formality, not to punish them for entering it. Broadening the base means freezing new exemptions, publishing the fiscal cost of existing ones, fully digitising enforcement, and taxing sectors that have permanently learned to live outside the net. Until the state actively penalises non-payment and taxes privilege instead of productivity, deficits will persist and borrowing will continue.
Pakistan must also accept that a large informal economy will persist during the transition. Formalisation follows growth; it does not precede it, making absorption feasible. Criminalising cash or banning transactions in the name of fighting ‘black money’ merely drives activity further underground and slows growth.

At a high-level open debate in the UN Security Council on Monday evening, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad described India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty as “another blatant breach of international obligations, threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions and endangering peace and security”.







He informed the world body that “Pakistan rejects the weaponisation of water and other natural resources. Treaty compliance is a cornerstone of the international legal order”.
Later, Pakistan also used its right of reply to respond to the allegations and claims of the Indian ambassador, Parvathaneni Harish.

Rejects New Delhi’s unilateral suspension of Indus treaty, ‘weaponisation’of water

“By unilaterally and illegally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, India now seeks to bring about the desertification of Pakistan’s ancient fertile plains,” Pakistan’s representative Zulfiqar Ali said, responding to India’s threat.

 

“We will counter this latest provocation — this water terrorism — with the same resolve, clarity, and success with which we defended our country against India’s aggression in May last year,” he added.
At the UN Security Council debate, Ambassador Harish reiterated New Delhi’s position that “the treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably ends its alleged support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism”.
Despite multiple independent assessments backing Pakistan’s position, the Indian ambassador also challenged narratives from Washington and Islamabad portraying Pakistan as the victor in the May 10 conflict.
Ambassador Ahmad addressed this issue, recalling that last May, India “carried out an unprovoked military aggression in breach of international law and Pakistan’s sovereignty”.
“Acting in accordance with Article 51 of the (UN) Charter, Pakistan exercised its inherent right of self-defence in a responsible, restrained and proportionate manner,” the Pakistani envoy added. “Our response established that there can be no ‘new normal’ based on coercion or impunity. Respect for international law remains the only legitimate norm governing inter-State conduct.”
The May 10 conflict also underscored that “the root cause of instability in South Asia remains India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir, in gross violation of Security Council resolutions,” Ambassador Ahmad said.
Pakistani representative Zulfiqar Ali reminded the Indian envoy that Pakistan not only prevailed in the previous conflict but remains fully capable of thwarting any future attempts.
In his right of reply, Mr Ali described India’s statements as “spurious claims” and part of an “old ploy” to deflect attention from its illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir.







“India’s sermons on law, justice and fairness ring hollow from a country that spreads falsehoods, orchestrates global assassination campaign, and plots terrorism regionally and beyond,” he said, highlighting India’s politicisation of even innocuous fields like sports.
Mr Ali also criticised India’s internal policies, saying the country exemplifies “how tyranny of majoritarianism can disrupt the social fabric of a political entity”.
He pointed to state-sanctioned pogroms against Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and other minorities, noting that sham claims of being the world’s largest democracy could not conceal these atrocities.

Inclement weather continues to hold up the evacuation process, which has been temporarily halted. Those who had already left their homes and became stranded due to snow storms have also finally reached Bara after two days of hectic rescue operations.

 

Heavy snowfall and the slow pace of registration at multiple locations along the 110-kilometre road from Tirah to Bara has multiplied the miseries of displaced families, with most spending sleepless nights on the road in severe cold.
District administration officials told Dawn that though the exact number of families who arrived in Bara was not yet known, but by Tuesday, they estimated that only around 15pc were yet to be evacuated.

Evacuation process still on hold amid inclement weather; authorities increase number of registration centres at Bara to facilitate the displaced

They said the final date for evacuation had been extended after heavy snowfall and the remaining families were told to stay back till weather improves, though no exact completion date was given.

 

Officials explained that the relaxation was given in light of weather-related hurdles, as it was imperative to give the Tirah people some ‘space’ prior to the restart of their final evacuation after an improvement in weather condition.
Dawn has also learnt that families still stranded in their homes due to the suspension of the evacuation process are facing an acute shortage of edibles, as authorities were not allowing anyone into the valley.
In Bara, local tribal elders, former parliamentarians and political party representatives blamed both governments for forcing families to vacate their houses to pave the way for yet another military operation.
Demanding an immediate halt to the ongoing ‘inhuman’ treatment’ of displaced families, Hamidullah Jan Afridi, a former MNA, sought transparency in the registration process, and called for honouring all commitments made with the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders prior to the start of displacement.
He also demanded stopping of political interference in the registration process and due compensation against all losses the people of Tirah had incurred during their displacement.
Hashim Khan Afridi, president of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, insisted the decision about the military operation and ‘forced displacement’ was jointly taken by federal and KP governments after holding a series of consultations with local tribal elders. He also demanded an open audit of all funds released in the name of Tirah IDPs and sharing required data with people of both Tirah and Bara.
Registration process
The district administration has also increased the number of registration centers in Bara to expedite the process and make it more transparent.
Officials said that alongside the Paindi Cheena centre, four new centres had been made operational in Alamgudar, Bar Qambarkhel, Malakdin Khel and Qambarabad localities of Bara.
They said that separate desks for female registration were established at all centres, as many displaced families had complained that the women had to be herded into the same centres as men, which they considered against their culture and traditions.
Officials said that along with district administration officials, local tribal elders, bank staff and staff of a mobile phone company were deputed at all centres for instant verification and issuance of SIM cards to Tirah families.
They said previous polio vaccination records would also be used for verification of genuine IDPs with timely provision of basic necessities.
Sources in Bara informed that a majority of newly arrived families from Tirah were staying with relatives in different parts of Bara, with some having second homes while a limited number went to Peshawar suburbs where they own houses.
Authorities also started registration of hundreds of Zakhakhel families at Paindi Cheena after reaching understanding with Nadra staff. The Zakhakhel families were earlier denied registration on the pretext they had acquired CNICs from Landi Kotal tehsil and are not actual residents of Tirah.

ISLAMABAD: In a landmark ruling with far-reaching constitutional and fiscal implications, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Tuesday, while accepting parliament’s competence to legislate for the imposition of taxes, upheld the vires of the super tax, ruling that certain provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO) 2001 will apply from the dates on which they were levied at the prescribed rates.
Various businesspersons, banks and companies had challenged the imposition of the super tax before the high courts, arguing that its retrospective application amounted to double taxation.
Later, appeals were filed in the Supreme Court against judgements of the Sindh, Lahore and Islamabad High Courts concerning the levy of super tax through Sections 4-B and 4-C, inserted into the ITO 2001 through the Finance Acts of 2015 and 2022, respectively.
After 71 hearings before the Supreme Court, the cases were transferred to the FCC following the passage of the 27th Amendment.
Headed by Chief Justice of the FCC Aminuddin Khan, a three-judge bench comprising Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah announced the much-anticipated short order in the afternoon, following a brief morning hearing, at which the court had reserved its verdict.
The detailed judgement will be issued later.
According to a senior counsel representing Revenue Secretary Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, the FCC decided more than 2,200 long-pending tax cases relating to Sections 4-B and 4-C of the ITO, thereby safeguarding an estimated Rs310 billion in public revenue.
The tax was initially imposed in 2015 through a money bill, with the stated purpose of rehabilitating areas affected by Operation Zarb-i-Azb against terrorism. It was introduced as a one-time measure to fund the rehabilitation of areas devastated by the military operation.
An additional five per cent super tax was levied on annual profits exceeding Rs300 million. In 2022, however, the super tax was extended to individuals earning more than Rs150m annually, with a maximum rate of 10 per cent.
Introduced by the PML-N government in 2015, the super tax applies to wealthy individuals, associations of persons and companies earning above Rs500m. It imposes a tax rate of four per cent on the income of banking companies and three per cent on other sectors, aimed at funding the rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons.
In its ruling, the FCC held Sections 4(b) and 4(c) to be intra vires of the Constitution, reaffirmed Parliament’s exclusive authority to determine taxation under these provisions, and clarified that the courts’ role was limited to interpretation. The court declared that the high courts’ judgements striking down or reading down Section 4(c) were constitutionally invalid as they had exceeded their jurisdiction and therefore stood set aside.
The FCC held that courts could not re-determine tax slabs, rates, thresholds or fiscal policy, and that the high courts had committed judicial overreach in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers. All appeals filed by the Secretary, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Commissioner Inland Revenue were declared maintainable.
The court ruled that the super taxes were valid, with specific exclusions for benevolent funds. It also allowed oil and gas exploration companies to approach the relevant tax commissioner individually for exemptions, to be assessed on a case-by-case basis under the 1948 concessions regime.
Petroleum sector gets relief
A senior counsel, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the petroleum sector was the only one granted relief on the basis of petroleum concessions signed by the President with exploration companies. He recalled that it had been argued before the FCC that imposing taxes beyond what was agreed under these concessions could lead to international arbitration, potentially resulting in heavy damages, as seen in past cases such as Reko Diq and rental power projects.
During the hearing, it was contended that the government could not breach the agreed tax ceiling without violating petroleum concession agreements. The counsel added that the association of petroleum companies had also served a notice on the federation, warning of the possibility of invoking international arbitration. He said it appeared that this argument had proved persuasive.
Commenting on the implications of the judgement, senior counsel Isaac Ali Qazi told Dawn that to offset the impact of the super tax, industry might adopt two strategies: companies close to the super tax threshold might freeze sales and production to avoid the levy, or they might pass on the tax burden by factoring it into profit margins, which could fuel inflation.

Real GDP to expand 3.5 per cent in FY26, before strengthening to 4.4pc in FY27, it said while commenting on SBP’s monetary policy decision that kept benchmark interest rate unchanged at 10.5pc on Monday.

 

This is generally in line with SBP that projected real GDP growth in the range of 3.75-4.75pc in 2025-26, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated momentum in commodity-producing sectors and spillovers to services. This momentum is expected to extend into FY27, aided by earlier monetary easing and ongoing macroeconomic stability.
These projections are relatively higher than 3.2pc growth rate projected by the International Monetary Fund last week, down from 3.6pc of its previous estimate.
On the external front, the SBP projected the current account deficit to remain within 0-1pc of GDP in FY26. With continued remittance inflows and planned official financing, foreign exchange reserves are projected to surpass $18bn by end-June 2026 and rise further in FY27, approaching the benchmark of three months of import cover, the central bank had observed.
S&P Global Market Intelligence (not S&P Global Ratings) projected a current account deficit of 0.5pc and 1.3pc of GDP, respectively, in calendar years 2026 and 2027 with a disclaimer. “Risks weigh on the downside, owing to elevated global tariff uncertainty, volatile commodity prices, and geopolitical fragmentation,” S&P noted.
On inflation, the SBP expected stabilisation within the 5-7pc target range over the next two years, after temporarily exceeding the upper bound for a few months during calendar year 2026.
The S&P, on the other hand, projected inflation to come at 5.1pc in 2026 before slightly inching upwards to 5.6pc in 2027, again with a caveat. “Risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, linked to volatility in global commodities and domestic wheat prices, possible adjustments in administered energy tariffs, and a stronger-than-assumed pickup in domestic demand,” it concluded.

“During July-November FY26, Rs144.9 billion was spent under Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) against Rs156.7bn last year,” the Ministry of Finance said in its economic update and outlook for January.
This is despite the fact that the government has committed to increasing unconditional cash transfers, the Kafaalat benefit from Rs13,500 to Rs14,500 to adjust for inflation, and to entail a structural benchmark for end-January 2026 under the IMF programme. The coverage for this programme has also to be expanded by 200,000 to 10.2m families by end of FY26.
The ministry said the economy was well-positioned to sustain its growth momentum in FY26, supported by the encouraging performance of large-scale manufacturing (LSM) and other high-frequency indicators. The MoF claimed that this reflected the impact of prudent policies, ongoing structural reforms, and easing of monetary conditions due to subsiding inflationary pressures. “Inflation is expected to remain within the range of 5-6pc in January,” it said.
On the external front, the current account would remain a deficit, the ministry said, hoping that robust remittance inflows and steady performance in IT and services exports would likely “cushion external pressures”.
The improved fiscal management is also expected to continue supporting the macroeconomic stability, it added.
It said the economy completed the first half of the current fiscal year with continued macroeconomic stability, as reflected in contained inflation, rebounding LSM growth, and strengthened foreign exchange reserves, with a stable exchange rate. The sustained growth momentum has been complemented by fiscal discipline, resulting in fiscal and primary surpluses. LSM has gained momentum, signalling improved growth prospects for the remaining period of the fiscal year.
Remittances remained robust, supporting the external account. In parallel, the Pakistan Stock Market has maintained a strong rally, ranking among the world’s top-performing markets and reflecting improved investor sentiment.
Building on these gains, the government has launched economic governance reforms to embed stability in institutions and enable sustainable, private-sector-led growth.

Addressing a press con­­f­e­r­ence, senior leader MQM-P Dr Far­ooq Sattar, along with Haider Abbas Rizvi at the party’s Baha­durabad headquarters, said that Sindh’s current system of governance was “opp­ressive and feudal” and had pushed the province to the brink of collapse.
He said Karachi, des­pite being the country’s econo­mic hub, continued to be deprived of its constitutional and admin­istr­ative rights. He demanded the formation of a judicial com­mission to investigate the recent Gul Plaza blaze and assess broader gov­ern­ance issues in the province.

 

“I urge the federal government and the relevant state institutions to intervene in Sindh’s affairs, act as an arbitrator in Kar­achi’s matters, and constitute a high-level judicial commission to review adm­inistrative failures and the worsening law and order situation in the province,” he said.
Dr Sattar expressed gra­ve concern over the withdrawal of security for MQM-P leaders. He said police headquarters had informed the party that security cover had been removed, creating serious risks.
“After media reports, there were claims that some security arrangements would be restored, but the ground reality remains alarming,” he said, warning that if the Sindh government failed to provide security, the ruling ally would demand protection from the Islamabad police.
He praised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir, stating that their efforts had restored the dignity of Pakistan’s green passport and improved the country’s standing at the international level.
“Their hard work and sacrifices should not be undermined by the incompetence of the Sindh government,” he said.
Criticising the PPP leadership, Dr Sattar urged PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to demonstrate sincerity towards Karachi by ensuring the implementation of Article 140-A of the Constitution, which mandates the devolution of powers to local governments. He said the 18th Constitutional Amendment was meant for all provinces, not for the continuation of “one-family rule”.
Dr Sattar warned that continued neglect of Karachi’s issues could further aggravate the situation in the city.
“We were mocked when we raised Sindh’s concerns earlier, but today the consequences are visible,” he said, adding that it was time for serious and practical decisions rather than political slogans.
The press conference was also attended by MQM-P leaders Shabbir Qaimkhani, Arshad Vohra, as well as members of the National Assembly and Sindh Assembly.
Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan denied the MQM-P claims about the withdrawal of security for the party leaders and called it “baseless”.
In a statement, he said that no decision has been taken to withdraw security for the MQM-P leaders.
“Both senior leaders of the party, Mustafa Kamal and Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, are currently in Islamabad,” he said. “There’s no directive from the government regarding the removal of security from any political figure.”

GILGIT / RAWALPINDI: A fresh spell of snowfall brought life to a standstill across parts of Gilgit-Baltistan amid freezing temperatures, power outages and road closures.
Snowfall continued on Monday and Tuesday, blocking the Karakoram Highway (KKH), the Ghizer-Shandur Road, Baltistan Road and several link roads.
Temperatures in upper areas dropped below minus 15 degrees Celsius. Police said that up to six inches of snow was recorded in parts of Skardu, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Kharmang, Hunza, Nagar and Ghizer, disrupting routine life and making travel hazardous.
Residents said the latest snowfall compounded existing hardships. Shafqat Ali, a resident of Astore, told Dawn that road links in upper parts of the district had been cut off. He said roads to Shounter, Dasskharam, Tirshing, Rattu, Gultari, Minimarg, Bobin and other areas were blocked.
In Hunza, Nagar, Shigar and Ghanche, heavy snowfall left roads slippery and risky, cutting off several localities. The situation was particularly difficult for earthquake-affected residents in Chipurson and flood-affected communities in Ghizer, many of whom are living in tents or temporary shelters.
Ali Ahmed, a resident of Chipurson, said more than 200 affected families had been struggling since the recent earthquake and the snowfall had worsened their conditions. Road closures also hampered relief activities.
In Diamer, snowfall since Monday night paralysed life in upper areas, including Tangir, Daril, Thak Babusar and Goharabad. Police said several communication links were blocked, raising fears of food shortages, while residents also faced electricity outages.
Travel between Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country remained suspended on parts of the KKH on Tuesday as snow and rain made sections of the road slippery. In a public advisory, authorities warned of rockfall risks in the KKH’s Gilgit-Kohistan section and urged travellers to avoid unnecessary travel.
Officials in Ghizer said land connectivity to several areas was cut off. Roads in upper parts of Yasin, Phander and Ishkoman were closed, while residents continued to suffer due to prolonged power outages and road blockages.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, caretaker Chief Minister Justice (retd) Yar Muhammad directed the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority, district administrations and the Communications and Works Department to clear snow from highways and take timely measures to prevent damage during the ongoing snowfall and rains.
He also urged residents of remote areas to avoid unnecessary travel due to accident risks and directed relevant departments to utilise all available resources to ease public hardship.
Snow blankets Murree
Snow also blanketed Murree and adjoining hills, with the district administration reopening the GT Road to traffic after temporary restrictions.
A Met official said nine inches of snow was recorded at the Murree observatory, with one to two inches in upper hills, while the temperature dropped to minus 3 degrees.
The official said the weather was expected to clear by Wednesday morning, but temperatures could fall further in Murree and the twin cities in the coming days. A westerly wave was affecting upper parts of the country and was likely to persist in northern areas until Wednesday, she added.
“The snowfall stopped in the afternoon and district administration opened the traffic for all kind of traffic.
Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Shirazi told Dawn that traffic restrictions were lifted in the afternoon after snowfall subsided. He said vehicular movement on the GT Road had earlier been restricted to locals and visitors with advance hotel bookings, while Murree Expressway remained open.
He said main roads had been cleared, though some link roads were still snow-covered and work was under way to clear them. The deputy commissioner said officials had been deployed on roads, hospitals were functioning normally with sufficient medicine stocks, and there was no electricity breakdown in the hill station.
Divisional Commissioner Amir Khattak also visited Murree to review arrangements, saying that major connecting roads were open and unnecessary closures would not be allowed.
He directed that machinery be kept fully operational during snowfall and roads cleared at the earliest. Tourists were advised to follow official instructions, avoid unnecessary travel and contact facilitation centres and helplines in case of emergencies.
Heavy snowfall in Quetta
The Quetta valley and surrounding areas received heavy snowfall on Tuesday, while Ziarat and several towns across northern and central Balochistan were also blanketed in white, disrupting routine life and affecting traffic on key highways and inter-provincial routes.
The snowfall began around midnight in Quetta and continued until noon with brief breaks. Residents welcomed the spell, saying it had broken a prolonged dry period in the provincial capital and adjoining areas.
Officials said Hanna Urak valley, about 20 kilometres from Quetta, also received snowfall, drawing large numbers of families from the city.
District administration officials said Ziarat received heavy snowfall overnight, which continued into Tuesday noon and led to the closure of the Quetta-Ziarat Road, suspending traffic.
Snowfall was also reported in Zhob, Muslim Bagh, Qila Abdullah, Chaman and the Khojak Pass, Kan Mehtarzai, Khanozai, Toba Kakari, Toba Achakzai, Qila Saifullah, Harnai, Duki, Sanjavi, Mastung, Kalat, Surab, Noshki, Dalbandin and Taftan, among other areas.
Reports said the Quetta-Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan highway was affected, with snow and ice hampering movement between Balochistan and other provinces.

ISLAMABAD: Days after the appointment of leader of the opposition in both the Senate and the National Assembly, the main opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), is seriously considering rejoining the standing committees of parliament, a move that remains contingent on the consent of its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.
A majority of PTI leaders are said to be keen to regain the chairmanship of standing committees, particularly the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), in order to “resist” what they describe as controversial decisions and policies of the government.
As the final decision to rejoin the committees rests with Mr Khan, political analysts believe he is likely to decide on the matter after the PTI’s countrywide protest scheduled for Feb 8.
PTI previously held the chairmanship of more than a dozen standing committees in the National Assembly and five in the Senate, besides participating in several others. However, on the directives of its founder, the party withdrew from all standing committees in both houses of parliament in August last year.
It has been learnt that a majority of PTI legislators now believe the party should not have exited the standing committees, as doing so allowed the government to function without effective parliamentary scrutiny. They believe Mr Khan’s decision ceded crucial ground to the ruling coalition.
Talking to Dawn, a senior PTI leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many key party decisions were pending and linked to a meeting between the jailed PTI founder, party legislators and his sisters. “The government should arrange a meeting between Imran Khan and party legislators so that he can be convinced that we must rejoin the standing committees,” he said.
He added that relinquishing the chairmanship of the PAC was not a sagacious decision, as the party had used the forum effectively to expose alleged wrongdoing by the government.
The PTI leader said that, besides the PAC, the party should not have vacated three other important committees — finance, law and justice, and human rights.
He recalled that when PTI workers and members of the Punjab Assembly were recently maltreated by the police, the matter was taken up by a privilege committee. “On the other hand, PTI parliamentarians are often humiliated and manhandled by the police, but they cannot take such matters to the privilege committees of the Senate and the National Assembly,” he said.
All decisions linked to jail meeting
PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar, while talking to Dawn, agreed that all pending party decisions were linked to a meeting between Imran Khan and party leaders in jail.
The newly-appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Achakzai, shortly after his maiden speech in the house, declined to comment on the possibility of PTI’s return to the standing committees.
However, PTI acting chairman Barrister Gohar Ali said the decision regarding rejoining the standing committees would be taken by the party’s parliamentary committee.
According to observers, Mr Khan’s decision to exit the standing committees mirrored his move in 2022, when he opted to quit parliament following the no-confidence vote instead of positioning PTI as a “heavyweight opposition” after his ouster from power.
They believe the decision to withdraw from the committees did not create any vacuum in parliament. The absence of three or four PTI lawmakers from a committee did not affect the quorum, which requires the presence of one-fourth of the total members. Moreover, the departure made little practical difference, as members from the treasury benches replaced PTI representatives. In effect, PTI remained the sole loser in the entire episode.
Courage to disagree
Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who heads the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said PTI leaders were effectively helpless, even if they favoured a return to the committees, as the authority to decide rested solely with Mr Khan.
He noted that most PTI leaders lacked the courage to even disagree with Mr Khan’s position as they wished to remain in his good books.
Mr Mehboob was of the opinion that Mr Khan would first assess the outcome of PTI’s Feb 8 countrywide protest and then decide on the issue of standing committees.
He said democracy required PTI to return to the committees and play an effective role. However, he added, Mr Khan remained the final authority. “A lack of opposition representation in these important committees negatively impacts the quality of parliamentary proceedings,” he said.
Calling the situation ironic, the Pildat chief said PTI’s decision to leave all standing committees, including the PAC, echoed its earlier move to quit the National Assembly and relinquish governments in provinces.
Meanwhile, a source in the National Assembly Secretariat said NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had advised PTI on several occasions to return to the committees and that any such move by the party would be welcomed by the secretariat.

The IGA between the two sides was proposed by Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik here during his meeting with the new Australian High Commissioner (AHC) to Pakistan, Timothy Kane.
It builds on a July 2025 Australian proposal made through former AHC Neil Hawkins for collaboration between Australian universities, mining firms, and Pakistani institutions to provide specialised training programmes in modern mining techniques and services and enhance local expertise and support Pakistan’s mining sector development.
An official statement said the new AHC Kane and the petroleum minister discussed avenues for enhanced bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors. The minister welcomed the strong interest of Australian companies in Pakistan’s mining sector and highlighted the country’s immense untapped mineral potential, particularly in the Tethyan Belt.
“He proposed the possibility of an IGA between Pakistan and Australia to promote structured and long-term cooperation in the mining sector,” the statement said.

Discuss possibility of long-term cooperation agreement to tap country’s vast mineral potential

Australia had been operating in Pakistan’s mineral and natural resources sector, almost in all resource-rich regions, including Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, mostly in research and exploration and identified critical reserves in copper, gold, coal, zinc and other precious resources, including oil and gas.
Australian BHP Billiton’s joint venture with the Geological Survey of Pakistan had led to the discovery of the multi-billion dollar Reko Diq copper-gold deposits, now being developed for commercial production by Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada. BHP had left Pakistan under its global restructuring almost two decades ago.
Mr Malik briefed the new envoy about the government’s efforts to develop and formalise the gemstones sector to unleash its true potential for value addition, exports, and employment generation.
The AHC reiterated that Australian companies were already actively involved in the Reko Diq project, and additional Australian firms had shown keen interest in joining the project. He said the Australian companies would be encouraged to participate in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF), expressing hope for a strong Australian presence at the event.
The diplomat highlighted the growing global importance of copper and gold for the energy transition, adding that Pakistan’s mining sector had attracted significant international attention. He also expressed “optimism for collaboration in the gemstones sector through knowledge exchange, training, and technical assistance”, the statement said.
The two sides also discussed the recent visit of the petroleum minister to Australia for the International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC) and the fruitful discussions with leading and junior Australian mining companies on investment and cooperation opportunities in Pakistan’s minerals sector. The two sides agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors for mutual benefit.
The presence of mineral deposits in the Reko Diq area was identified by the Geological Survey of Pakistan in the early 1990s in collaboration with BHP Billiton of Australia. Later in 2000, Tethyan Corporation (TCC) of Australia took over the project from BHP and invested $30 million by raising funds through an international listing and drilled over 75,000 meters to prove the reserves.
The TCC was subsequently taken over by two of the world’s largest copper and gold mining firms — Antofagasta of Chile and Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada for A$158 million ($130m) at the time. The agreement between Pakistan and the two mining firms signed in the Musharraf era ran into trouble, leading to international arbitration followed by an out-of-court settlement for penalties and project revival. In the process, the Reko Diq project production, due in 2010, was delayed by at least 15 years.
It was announced at the time of discovery by GSP and BHP that the Reko Diq mining area had proven estimated reserves of two billion tonnes of copper and 20 million ounces of gold, valued at $65bn at the time.
The recent feasibility studies completed by Barrick have also established that the project would have a 45 million tonnes of throughput per annum (Mpta) for the first five years and then 90 Mpta for the following 32 years of the second phase. Based on existing reserves, the Reko Diq project is expected to yield production of 13.1m tonnes of copper and 17.9m ounces of gold over the life of the mine (100pc basis), according to state-run Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), one of the shareholders.
The feasibility study has also confirmed a lucrative 25pc rate of return on investment on one of the biggest copper-gold projects. Under the updated feasibility study, Phase 1 is planned to process 45m tonnes of mill-feed annually (Mtpa) from 2028. Previously, it was estimated to be close to 40m tonnes. By 2034, Phase 2 is planned to double the processing capacity to 90Mtpa.

The court has summoned the defendants to appear on Jan 31 to respond to the allegations.
Muhammad Usman Malik, a consumer, had filed an application under the consumer protection law before the judicial magistrate of the consumer court (East) against Maria.B, a clothing brand, and a postal service, PostEx (Pvt) Ltd, alleging “gross negligence” and that the defendants had committed serious deficiencies in service and engaged in unfair trade practices.
After a preliminary hearing, the court summoned the defendants to appear before the court on Jan 31.
In the application, the plaintiff claimed that on Dec 1, 2025, he had placed an order through the official website of Maria.B for the purchase of garments worth Rs55,864. Four days later, the courier service contacted him, informing that the order was out for delivery and shared the rider’s details along with a tracking number.
He added that although the rider handed over the parcel to him, he discovered after opening it that instead of the ordered item, the parcel contained a five-kilogram sack of flour.
Referring to a screenshot of the complaint lodged with the clothing brand’s customer support through email, the plaintiff claimed that he did not receive any immediate response to his grievance.
The plaintiff later sent a legal notice to the defendants through his counsel through courier. In response, he claimed, the clothing brand initially assured him that the amount would be refunded. However, despite this assurance, the brand later offered him a voucher or coupon in instead of a cash refund, which he described as a deliberate waste of time.
The plaintiff asked the court to issue a decree against the defendants to refund the amount of Rs55,864 along with 25 per cent interest. He also pleaded for an amount of Rs200,000 as compensation for mental agony, stress, discomfort and undue hardships.

The fresh initiative, under the directions of Mr Abdul Fatah Shaikh, had been in the planning stage through the last year but was delayed due to budget constraints.
According to the Sindh Culture Department’s Directorate General of Antiquities & Archaeology, the excavation is underway at four different sites since it was started in Nov last year. Upon completion of the Rohri Hills project, “an exciting underwater  heritage excavation is set to commence, a statement issued by the department said.
The month-long project is led by Zahida Quadri, the head of the excavation and explorations.

Underwater excavation soon, says Directorate General of Antiquities & Archaeology

The work is being supervised by Dr Paolo Biagi from Italy, who had begun a research on the Rohri Hills in 1988. The other members of the experts’ team are Dr Maarco Madella from the Univer­sity of Barcelona, Dr Ghulam Mustafa Sher, Dr Tasleem Abro (head of the Archaeology Department at the Shah Abdul Latif University) and Mohammad Amin Chandio from the Aror University, Sukkur.
Prof Shah Mohammad Luhrani, the Dean Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration at SALU, Khairpur, Dr Zaheeruddin Sher, and Faiz Ali Katohar have also joined the fieldwork.
The team has explored Ziyarat Pir Subhan Hill, Rohri Bypass, Pir Shadi Shareef Hill and Pir Adam Sultan Hill to document several stone tools factories that might have been operational around 80,000 years ago.
“Some sites on the hilltops remain so intact that it seems as if the workers have just stepped away and will return soon,” the statement observed, and noted that it is hard to believe that these sites had remained untouched for thousands of years. The tools, including axes, scra­pers, flakes, cores, blades and raw materials, are scattered over a vast area.
It said that some hills appeared significantly disturbed by human activity. Local authorities have even used grenades to destroy parts of these hills to establish a cement factory and extract stone for construction. 
The destruction is sheer injustice to the precious Sindh heritage, which still vividly illustrates the craftsmanship of the Stone Age people.
The Directorate Gene­ral has protected these sites under the Antiquities Act, 1975 and did not issue any NOC for the establishment of a cement factory or for any activity that could cause damage to these historical sites. 
Despite a ban ordered by the Sindh chief minister, stone crushing is still going on at the Kalkan Mata Temple within the area, the statement noted.

According to the President’s Secretariat, President Zardari, who is currently undertaking a four-day official visit to the Gulf country, met his UAE counterpart while being accompanied by a high-level delegation.
“The leaders discussed ways to further deepen the longstanding and brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE,” the statement said.







“They reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral cooperation and explored new opportunities in trade, investment, energy, infrastructure, technology, and people-to-people exchanges, highlighting the significant potential for expanding economic and strategic partnership,” the statement said.
President Zardari highlighted the significance of the UAE president’s recent visit to Pakistan and expressed “appreciation for the UAE’s continued support for strengthening bilateral ties”.
“Both sides also exchanged views on a range of regional and international developments and reaffirmed their commitment to promoting peace, stability, and sustainable development,” the statement said.
“President Zardari’s visit underscores the enduring friendship and strategic partnership between Pakistan and the UAE,” it stated.
Earlier in the day, the president had met with UAE Minister of Tolerance and Coexistence Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi, according to a separate statement by the President’s Secretariat. He also paid tribute to the leadership of the UAE president.
“The meeting underscored the importance of promoting dialogue, inclusivity, and peaceful coexistence,” the handout said.
It said the president paid tribute to the visionary leadership of the Emirati president and “lauded the UAE’s national vision of tolerance and human fraternity, noting that it has positioned the country as a leading global example of harmony among diverse communities”.
“He appreciated the UAE’s success in fostering unity and mutual respect among over 200 nationalities as a compelling model of social cohesion,” it added.







President Zardari noted that “these values strongly resonate with Pakistan’s own commitment to interfaith harmony, social inclusion, and respect for cultural and religious diversity, as enshrined in its Constitution and societal traditions”.
First Lady Bibi Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE were also present on the occasion, according to the statement.
Meanwhile, AD Ports Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi also paid a courtesy call to President Zardari.
A separate handout said the president appreciated the group’s “long-term investment and growing role in Pakistan’s maritime and logistics sector, describing it as a key pillar of Pakistan–UAE economic cooperation”.







“He highlighted the group’s ongoing investments at Karachi Port as instrumental in enhancing port capacity, efficiency, and regional competitiveness,” it added.
The statement said that both sides agreed that “the expansion and modernisation of port infrastructure would strengthen trade flows and support Pakistan’s broader economic development and the country’s seaborne trade”.
“President Zardari also welcomed the establishment of AD Ports Group’s representative office in Islamabad and appreciated the group’s collaboration on digital and customs facilitation initiatives aimed at improving trade efficiency,” it added.
According to the Foreign Office, during the four-day official visit, the president will hold high-level meetings with the UAE’s leadership to review the “full spectrum of bilateral ties, especially in the domains of trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties”.







It said that Zardari’s trip, which follows the brief visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Pakistan last month, “reflects the deep brotherly ties between the two nations and reaffirms commitment to transforming the strong friendship between Pakistan and the UAE into a mutually rewarding partnership”.</p><small>2026-01-27 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647551-kazakhstan-envoy-outlines-rail-vision-linking-pakistan-to-central-asia' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakhstan envoy outlines rail vision linking Pakistan to Central Asia</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement released on the social media platform X, the party demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and associates. It also demanded that he be allowed medical treatment at a hospital of his own choice.







The statement said the party had learnt through credible media reports that Imran had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, “resulting in a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein”.
“According to medical experts who reportedly checked him in jail, this is an extremely sensitive and serious medical condition which, if not treated promptly and properly, carries a high risk of permanent damage to his eyesight,” the party said.
“Despite this, the jail administration is stubbornly insisting that the treatment be carried out inside the jail, while the attending specialist doctor has clearly stated that such treatment is not possible in jail and that it requires an operation theatre and specialized medical facilities,” the party said, adding that this “reckless attitude” put Imran’s vision and his overall health in grave danger.
It said that Imran was last granted access to his personal physician in October 2024, who had not been allowed to examine him since then, despite order issued by the Islamabad High Court.
“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights. Moreover, a petition regarding Imran Khan’s regular medical check-ups has been pending since August 2025, which is being deliberately ignored. The government’s conduct clearly demonstrates that, in its obsession with political vendetta, it is willing to gamble with the life and health of a prisoner,” the party said.
It demanded that Imran be immediately allowed an unrestricted meeting with his family and close associates so that the “public may be reassured about his condition”.
“We also demand that he be allowed without delay to Shaukat Khanum Hospital or to any other reputable hospital of his own choice, where he can receive proper treatment under the supervision of qualified specialists with full medical facilities. We strongly appeal to the judiciary to treat this as a matter of health and human life, not politics, and to ensure that no negligence or delay is allowed in his medical care,” it said.
The statement said that if there was permanent damage to Imran’s eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be responsible as they were “obstructing his treatment despite clear medical advice and court orders”.
Shaukat Khanum Hospital, which was established by Imran, also issued a statement, saying it was “gravely concerned” about the ex-premier’s health.
“While we have every confidence in the abilities and professionalism of the physicians currently looking after him, we nevertheless request that a team of physicians from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be given immediate access to Khan sahib and be allowed to participate in his care so as to reassure all those who are concerned for his welfare,” the statement said.







Imran’s sisters question reports about his ailment
For their part, Imran’s sisters raised doubts about the reports of his ailment. The three, among other PTI supporters and workers, had gathered near Adiala jail — where Imran is incarcerated — on Tuesday. Speaking at the spot, one of Imran’s sisters, Noreen Khanum, was asked to comment on the restriction on meetings with Imran.
In response, Noreen said, “We come here to [protest] against the cruelty being meted out to Imran.”
She also addressed the reports of Imran having an eye ailment, saying: “If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment.”
Without naming anyone, she alleged that “they [float rumours] as a tester, they lie to worry and disappoint the people and this is why I don’t believe this.”
She asserted that Imran was healthy and fit, further warning that “if they are planning to do something, then damaging Imran’s eyes will mean that even their eye will not be spared”.
Imran’s other sister, Aleema Khanum, said no one from the jail administration was sharing any details about him with his family and lawyers.
“So who has leaked this news? Which institution has leaked this? Because can you believe that this can be leaked without the involvement of any agency?” she said, adding, “We have just one demand: release Imran Khan.”







She also said that Imran had been imprisoned for the past two-and-a-half years because he was adamant that he “will not secure his release through a deal”.
The ex-premier’s third sister, Uzma Khanum, said that she had last met her brother on December 2, 2025 for just 20 minutes. “During that conversation, he said nothing about his eyesight,” she said.
However, Uzma continued, in a meeting held two months earlier, Imran had told her that he had an infection in his right eye, but only eye drops were given to him.
Presently, “we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him”, she said.
Aleema spoke to the media again at night, saying that the last time Imran met someone was two months ago when his lawyer, Salman Safdar, was allowed to meet him for eight minutes.
Later, the PTI claimed in a post on X that Aleema was stopped by police when she was returning from the Adiala jail.







The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also alleged in a statement that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” when they were returning from the Adiala jail.
The statement said that Imran’s sisters were not just barred from meeting him, but also “wrongfully confined” while they were returning.
“This act is another clear example of the brutal and illegitimate use of state power, the objective behind which is to scare citizens and intensify political revenge,” the statement said.
The TTAP demanded that Imran and his family be allowed to meet, the fundamental right of peaceful assembly and free movement be respected, and legal action be taken against those responsible for the wrongful confinement of Imran’s sisters.
PTI MNAs file fresh plea for meeting Imran
Separately, PTI MNA arrives at the IHC to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, along with MNAs Ali Muhammad Khan, Shehryar Afridi, Salman Akram Raja, Aamir Dogar, Ali Asghar Khan and Shahzada Gustasp, among others, appeared at the IHC court premises and completed the biometric verification to submit their application.
Speaking to the media outside the IHC, Gohar said that Tuesdays were the designated day for meetings with Imran. He said that the party leadership had approached the IHC chief justice multiple times but had not been granted a meeting.







He added that a letter signed by PTI MNAs was being submitted to the IHC chief justice, requesting that meetings with the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi be scheduled in accordance with the law and court orders.
The PTI chairman also expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi stressing that meeting a prisoner was a fundamental legal right and should not be politicised.
Gohar reiterated that PTI’s mandate had been “robbed” and reiterated the opposition’s nationwide protest call for February 8, including a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike, calling on shopkeepers and transporters to participate.
PTI Secretary General Raja said that the youth’s right to vote had been snatched. He called for a peaceful protest and expressed concern over reports that Imran was suffering from an eye problem. He added that the party would raise these concerns with the IHC chief justice.







Separately, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka extended interim bail to Imran in five additional cases related to May 9 and to Bushra Bibi in a fake receipts case related to the Toshakhana.
The PTI founder could not be presented before the court, either physically or via video link, due to which arguments could not be concluded. The court ordered that he be presented at the next hearing and extended interim bail until February 6.</p><small>2026-01-27 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2716260304e71d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969360/no-question-of-military-operation-in-tirah-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No question of military operation in Tirah: defence minister</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said that there was no question of a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah, insisting that migration was a routine practice in the valley.
Asif made these remarks during a press conference in Islamabad, where he was flanked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Information and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan.
The press conference came two days after the federal and provincial governments traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of planned military action against terrorists.
The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles.
At the outset of the press conference, the defence minister said members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had been residing in Tirah with their families. “They are around 400-500 in number,” he said.
The defence minister further stated that the provincial government had approved a package of Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah, who were to migrate.
“The armed forces deployed in that area have nothing to do with it. This is an arrangement between the jirga and the provincial government, and as a result of that, this notification was issued,” he added, holding up a notification that he said was issued by the KP government.
On Sunday, the information ministry had also referred to the same notification by the KP Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement department for the release of funds, reportedly Rs4 billion, for the anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of the population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh). These funds were seemingly required for relief-related arrangements for those leaving Tirah.
The ministry also asserted that the armed forces or the federal government had not issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Tirah.
During the press conference, Asif said that a military operation in the area had been carried out years ago. “And it was strategically decided then that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) are way more effective than operations; the collateral damage is way less. So, the armed forces have not carried out an operation in years in favour of IBOs,” he said.
The minister added, “This is why this practice has been ongoing there for many years, and that is why there is no question of any operation there.”
Moreover, the minister continued, migration in the valley was a routine practice.
He also criticised the KP government’s performance, highlighting a lack of hospitals, schools and police stations in the valley. The minister claimed that there was a “complete absence of civilian law enforcement agencies” in Tirah. “There is no police station there,” he added.
Asif further stated that hemp was being harvested in Tirah over 12,000 acres. Hemp harvested over each acre gave a profit of around Rs3-3.5 million, he said, adding that “this is a major factor” in this matter.
He said that hemp had several uses, including in medicines, construction material and bricks.
“Hemp is harvested there and dividends earned from it either go to the people associated with politics or the TTP. We have initiated measures to stop this, so that [Tirah’s] people benefit from this harvest, and schools and hospitals are constructed there,” Asif added.
He went on to allege that the interests of the provincial government aligned with those of the TTP in Tirah, “as they are together exploiting this source (hemp)”.
The minister recalled that the jirga in Tirah had held meetings on December 11, 21 and 31 last year on the matter.
“It has been meeting the civilian government. You don’t see the military anywhere in this [matter]. And this jirga was constituted many years ago […] And all 24 members of the jirga are onboard. All the things that I have listed that are required there [Tirah], it is their (jirga) demand. Now, in the presence of the jirga and this notification, where do you see the military’s [involvement] in this?” Asif said.
He alleged that the KP government wanted to deflect the blame for its “failures” to the military or an operation that did not even exist.
Then, ostensibly referring to the movement of people in Tirah, he maintained that this “tradition has been in place for decades” due to the climate and topography of the area. It was even mentioned in a gazette from the British era, he added. “This transition takes place every year.”
“This is nothing unusual, but the PTI government has tried to make it [appear] unusual,” he said. Moreover, the KP government had claimed spending Rs2-4bn on setting up camps for the evacuated residents, he said, alleging that those camps did not protect from the cold.
He again asserted that the military presence or an operation in Tirah was an “assumption”. “No operation has been carried out there for years,” he maintained.
He added that if the KP government wanted to work for the betterment of the people of Tirah, the federal government would provide it with the wherewithal needed for that purpose.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Tarar said it was stated in the official gazetteer in the 1880s that the Afridi and Akakhel tribes of Khyber descended and migrated to other areas in winters and returned to Tirah in summers. “This is an established fact,” he insisted.
For his part, PM’s aide Wali said it needed to be uncovered how much money from the Rs4bn package approved by the provincial government had reached the people who had been “forced to relocate”.
“Because the PTI has been in power [in KP] for 13 years. They create such programmes and use these funds for campaigns such as street movements,” he alleged.
Wali further highlighted that the KP government’s notification said that the movement of people from Tirah would be “voluntary”.
“This proves my points that a project was created to mint money,” he argued, adding that the armed forces had nothing to do with the movement of people in Tirah.
The PM’s aide said that to his understanding, the people of Tirah would be used to ensure the success of the opposition’s protest on February 8.
Following that, a journalist sought confirmation of the number of people who had left Tirah, saying that international media had reported that 65 per cent had vacated their houses.
To that, Asif said, “People escape the snowfall in the area and relocate. And more or less 65pc of the people migrate […] There is historical evidence of this. And this will continue to happen in the future as well”.
He said that this matter had been “politicised”, asserting that an impression had been created as if “forced relocation” had been taking place in Tirah.
“And it is being linked to us. Even if forced [relocation] is taking place, it is between the provincial government and the population. We or the military have nothing to do with it.
“The military has been carrying out IBOs there and will continue to do so. As I said, there are around 500 TTP members there […] The military conducts IBOs and weeds them out,” he said.
When asked about KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s claim that he had not been involved in talks with tribal elders from Tirah, Asif said: “This is his and his government’s problem. The talks were held with his government, and if he was not in the loop, that is not my problem or the problem of the federal government.”
He also alleged that some TTP militants had been paying extortion money to some individuals in the KP government.
In response to another question, he clarified that no operation was being carried out in Tirah.
The minister was also asked whether the option of reversing the decision to merge erstwhile tribal areas with KP was being considered in a potential “next amendment”. Asif said no such proposal was being considered.
Asked who formed the jirga that held talks regarding the evacuation of people from Tirah, Asif insisted that it was the provincial government.
A journalist also pointed out to the government representatives that migration from Tirah had been taking place in late October or early November. “What migration is this that a man, along with his five children, goes towards his death?” he questioned.
At that, Information Minister Tarar reasoned that it was due to the shift in weather patterns due to climate change. “Previously, there was no snowfall at the end of January. It used to start in November,” he said.
‘Injustice is being done’
Separately, KP CM Afridi also issued a video statement on the situation in Tirah, condemning a planned “military operation” in the valley and warning that “decisions taken behind closed doors have once again pushed the region toward instability, displacement and distrust”.
The KP CM’s statement in Pashto was a repeat of his earlier rebuke of the Centre on the matter, in which he said that “people are being forcibly displaced due to a military operation, the decision for which was taken behind closed doors”.
In his latest video statement, he said that “harsh conditions have once again been imposed on Tirah Valley”.







The CM further recalled that after PTI founder Imran Khan was removed from power in 2022, “warnings were issued in Khyber, Hazara, Malakand, Dera Ismail Khan and Waziristan about terrorism and instability again being imposed on the Pashtun belt”.
“Peace jirgas and public mobilisation campaigns were organised to alert the people that their future was being traded without their consent,” he added.
He criticised the then-Pakistan Democratic Movement government for dismissing those warnings as “propaganda”, claiming that people came out in large numbers and rejected the “decisions taken behind closed doors”.
Afridi said that presently, there was peace in the districts where the decisions were rejected, while terrorism had reared its head in areas where the warnings were ignored.
“Decisions taken behind closed doors not just toppled a democratic government but also triggered the return of terrorism and economic collapse, forcing investors and young people to search for opportunities abroad,” he lamented.
Referring specifically to Tirah, he said he had raised his voice against “imposing decisions” that were taken without the public consent and questioned the logic of launching another operation when “22 major and more than 14,000 IBOs had failed to eliminate terrorism”.
The KP CM recalled that a jirga held at the KP Assembly had finalised a 15-point agenda. He said the jirga also unanimously agreed that a military operation was not a solution and that sustainable peace could only be achieved through dialogue and consensus.
Despite that, he said, another “operation was being imposed”. The CM also claimed that the 24-member committee that was said to have held talks on a military operation in Tirah was headed by the corps commander and frontier corps inspector general.
“Elders of the Afridi [tribe] were told to vacate their houses on the pretext of militants operating from residential areas. Despite people’s objections, they were forced to leave their homes during the harsh winter and amid snowfall.
“And the world is now witnessing elderly people, women, and children being displaced in freezing conditions while the operation, too, cannot be carried out due to snowfall,” he said.
In light of this, he raised questioned the purpose and wisdom behind the decision to conduct a military operation. The CM said that the operation was being launched to malign him and destablise his government.
“But, the people continue to show me respect and support.”
He also condemned the information ministry’s statement on the situation in Tirah, according to which the valley’s residents were leaving their homes voluntarily.
The CM termed the statement “dangerous and an attempt to create conflict between the province and federal government and institutions”. It was also an attempt to “erode public trust in the leadership and state institutions”, he said.
Afridi reiterated his announcement of holding a grand jirga of all tribes residing in Khyber on the coming Sunday at 2pm at Jamrud Football Stadium. He said displaced people will be asked at the meeting whether they had left their homes voluntarily or were forced to do so.
“Then, the world will see that injustice is being done,” the CM remarked.
He said that the people of KP were “not subjects to be experimented upon and their blood is not cheap”. Their dignity must be respected, he stressed.
Afridi said his government had released Rs4bn for the displaced families, adding that previous military operations had resulted in the destruction of houses while promises of compensation to those affected also remained unfulfilled.
The KP government was resolute that it would not abandon its people “in the face of decisions taken in secrecy”, he emphasised, reaffirming that he stood with the Pashtun people and would defend their rights till his last breath.</p><small>2026-01-27 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647526-federal-constitutional-court-upholds-super-tax' target='_blank'><strong>Federal Constitutional Court upholds super tax</strong></a><br><p>

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the clock to 85 seconds before midnight, the theoretical point of annihilation. That is four seconds closer than it was set last year.
The Chicago-based nonprofit created the clock in 1947 during the Cold War tensions that followed World War Two to warn the public about how close humankind was to destroying the world.
The scientists voiced concern about threats of unregulated integration of AI into military systems and its potential misuse in aiding the creation of biological threats, as well as its role in spreading disinformation globally. They also noted continuing challenges posed by climate change.
“Of course, the Doomsday Clock is about global risks, and what we have seen is a global failure in leadership,” nuclear policy expert Alexandra Bell, the Bulletin’s president and CEO, told Reuters.
“No matter the government, a shift towards neo-imperialism and an Orwellian approach to governance will only serve to push the clock toward midnight.”
It was the third time in the past four years that the scientists moved the clock closer to midnight.
“In terms of nuclear risks, nothing in 2025 trended in the right direction,” Bell said.
“Longstanding diplomatic frameworks are under duress or collapsing, the threat of explosive nuclear testing has returned, proliferation concerns are growing, and there were three military operations taking place under the shadow of nuclear weapons and the associated escalatory threat. The risk of nuclear use is unsustainably and unacceptably high.”
Bell pointed to Russia’s continued war in Ukraine, the US and Israeli bombing of Iran and border clashes between India and Pakistan.
Bell also cited continuing tensions in Asia, including on the Korean Peninsula and China’s threats toward Taiwan, as well as rising tensions in the Western Hemisphere since US President Donald Trump returned to office 12 months ago.
The last remaining nuclear arms pact between the United States and Russia, the New START treaty, expires on February 5.
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that the two countries agree to observe for another year the limits set under the pact, which caps each side’s number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550.
Trump has not formally responded.
Western security analysts are divided about the wisdom of accepting Putin’s offer.
Trump in October ordered the US military to restart the process for testing nuclear weapons after a halt of more than three decades. No nuclear power, other than North Korea, most recently in 2017, has conducted explosive nuclear testing in more than a quarter-century.
No country would benefit more from a full-scale return to such testing than China, given its continued push to expand its nuclear arsenal, according to Bell, a former senior official at the US State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability.
‘Aggressive and nationalistic’
Trump has upended the world order. He sent US forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, threatened other Latin American countries, vowed to restore US dominance in the Western Hemisphere, talked about annexing Greenland and imperilled transatlantic security cooperation.
Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and there is no end in sight. Among the weapons Russia has used is the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile.
Russia released a video in December of what it said was the deployment of the Oreshnik in Belarus, a move meant to boost the Russian ability to strike targets across Europe.
“Russia, China, the United States and other major countries have become increasingly aggressive and nationalistic,” Bell said.
Their “winner-takes-all great power competition” undermines the international cooperation needed to reduce risks of nuclear war, climate change, misuse of biotechnology, potential AI-related hazards and other apocalyptic dangers, Bell said.
Bell also cited Trump’s domestic actions against science, academia, the civil service and news organisations.
Maria Ressa, a 2021 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for her journalistic efforts exposing abuses of power in the Philippines, including how social media platforms were used to spread disinformation, participated in the announcement.
“We are living through an information Armageddon — the crisis beneath all crises - driven by extractive and predatory technology that spreads lies faster than facts and profits from our division,” Ressa said in a statement.
