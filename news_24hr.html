The session opened on a positive note, driven by continued bullish sentiment from the previous day, as heavyweight banking stocks led early gains. According to Topline Securities Ltd, the index surged to an intraday high of 1,245 points before sentiment turned sour in the second half.
Selling pressure intensified as investors sought to lock in gains, triggering a broad-based sell-off. The index swung sharply during the session, touching an intraday low of 676 points before settling at 135,939.87 — down by 562.67 points or 0.41pc. The day’s movement reflected a tug-of-war between optimism and caution.
United Bank Ltd, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Allied Bank Ltd, Pakistan Services Ltd, and Engro Holdings were among the top contributors, adding a combined 564 points to the index. However, losses in Meezan Bank Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Hub Power Company, and Oil and Gas Development Company pulled the index down by 350 points.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation stated that the market closed lower due to institutional profit-taking in overbought stocks, foreign outflows, and concerns over high corporate taxation and the expanded powers granted to FBR officials. He added that rupee volatility and fears that tax waivers on sugar imports could breach the $7bn IMF bailout conditions also weighed on investor sentiment.
Ali Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Ltd, described the session as one of consolidation. “Early optimism driven by yesterday’s rally quickly faded as profit-taking at peak levels reversed momentum,” he noted.
Market watchers identified the 135,000 level as initial support, bolstered by strong corporate earnings and foreign inflows. If breached, the next key support lies at 132,000, where attractive valuations and prospects of monetary easing could revive interest.
Trading activity remained strong, with volume rising by 4.47pc to 879.11 million shares, while traded value increased by 4.20pc to Rs38.60bn. Bank of Punjab led the volume chart with 61.3 million shares changing hands.

This marks the third consecutive month of positive growth, attributed largely to a significant cut in the key interest rate to 11pc. The LSM sector showed positive growth from December 2023 to May 2024 but slipped back into negative territory in June 2024. On a year-on-year basis, LSM declined by 2.65pc in August, followed by a 1.92pc drop in September.
It registered a marginal growth of 0.02pc in October before contracting again by 3.81pc in November, 3.73pc in December, 1.21pc in January and 3.51pc in February. A slight recovery was noted in March, with production increasing by 1.79pc.
On a month-on-month basis, LSM showed a significant growth of 7.93pc in May.
The LSM sector recorded a negative growth of 1.21pc during the first 11 months of the current fiscal year compared to the same period last year. In FY24, LSM contracted by 0.03pc against a 0.92pc growth in the preceding year.
The food group declined by 2.32pc in 11MFY25 on a YoY basis. Wheat and rice milling rose by 5.96pc and starch and its products by 0.76pc, primarily due to better crop harvests. However, production of vegetable ghee declined by 1.06pc, tea blended by 3.75pc and cooking oil by 0.02pc.
The textile sector grew by 2.79pc in 11MFY25 on a YoY. Cotton yarn production increased by 8.22pc and cotton cloth by 0.72pc. These two categories make up more than 80pc of the textile sector.
Garment exports recorded a 5.20pc growth on a YoY basis, largely because foreign buyers diverted orders from Bangladesh to Pakistan.
Coke and petroleum products grew by 4.74pc in 11MFY25. Petrol production rose by 2pc, high-speed diesel by 9.65pc and kerosene by 25.90pc. However, LPG production declined by 2.18pc and jet fuel oil by 10.62pc. The automobile sector registered a significant growth of 43.94pc in 11MFY25 on a YoY basis. This was driven by a 39.35pc increase in jeeps and cars, followed by 173.95pc growth in LCVs, 100.04pc in trucks and 72.63pc in buses.

Sources familiar with the meeting said a final decision on the retail price is expected in the next few days. However, it was emphasised during the meeting that the price should remain close to Rs 170 per kg. The PSMA chairman assured that sugar prices would decline within a day or two.
While the government claimed the PSMA has agreed to supply sugar at an ex-mill price of Rs165 per kg, the actual retail price for consumers remains unannounced. Observers noted that Monday’s agreement yielded substantial profit margins for mills, leaving consumers to bear the brunt of high retail rates.
Previously, for the 2023-24 crushing season, the ex-mill price was set at Rs140 per kg during the sugar export period under an agreement between the government and the industry. However, retail prices have surged nationwide, ranging between Rs180 and Rs200 per kg, while wholesale rates hover around Rs159.

TCP cuts import tender volume to 50,000 tonnes

According to a statement from the Ministry of National Food Security, the meeting “addressed the implementation of the government-notified ex-mill price of sugar and ensured its smooth availability in the market.” It added that the impact of the new ex-mill price is expected to be reflected in retail markets within the next two to three days.
The meeting also discussed enforcement mechanisms and steps to guarantee uninterrupted sugar supply across the country. PSMA representatives welcomed the government’s move and assured full cooperation in stabilising prices.
Mr Tanveer reaffirmed the government’s commitment to providing relief to the public, stressing that hoarding and profiteering would not be tolerated. He said an effective mechanism had been developed to curb artificial price hikes and ensure consistent supply. “Public interest remains our top priority,” he said, adding that the ministry would maintain close coordination with the sugar industry to uphold price stability.
Import tender volume cut
Meanwhile, according to a Reuters report, the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has scaled back the volume of white refined sugar it seeks through an international tender to 50,000 tonnes, down from an initial range of 300,000-500,000 tonnes.
European traders said the deadline for submitting price offers has been extended to July 22, from the earlier date of July 18. The shipment is now expected to arrive in two consignments of 25,000 tonnes each, to be loaded between Aug 1 and 15. All sugar procured must arrive in Pakistan by Aug 30. The federal cabinet had approved the import of 500,000 tonnes of sugar on July 8 to ease pressure on domestic prices.

The three-member ben­ch was headed by Nisar Ahmad Durra­­ni, with Shah Mohammad Jatoi and Justice (retd) Ik­­ram Ullah Khan as members.
However, PTI has criticised the election watchdog alleging that it did not de-seat the PML-N president for submitting a “fake” consent affidavit, claiming that PTI MNA Adil Khan Bazai had joined the PML-N. The party claimed that a genuinely elected public representative and a staunch supporter of Imran Khan had been disqualified unjustly.
A three-member ECP bench declared Mr Dasti’s seat vacant after finding him guilty of submitting a fake degree. The bench ruled that the MNA had committed an offence pu­­nishable under the Elec­tion Act, recommending legal action against him.
It is worth mentioning that Mr Dasti, elected from NA-175 during the current tenure of the National Assembly, was a powerful voice against the ruling party in the House. Earlier this year, ECP had sent Mr Dasti’s educational credentials to the Karachi education board for verification.
Meanwhile, PTI Cent­ral Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram lashed out at the electoral watchdog for not de-seating the PML-N president over the allegedly fake affidavit regarding MNA Adil Khan Bazai.
He asserted that such desperate and “illegal” ac­­tions could neither sile­nce the voice of the people nor prolong the government’s grip on power, adding the rising tide of public dissent would soon sweep away their “unconstitutional” rule.

• PMD officials rebuff administration’s claims of ‘cloudburst’
• Many areas remain without power for over 30 hours
HYDERABAD: When those charged with keeping the city dry cannot even keep their own offices from being flooded, how can they be expected to ensure proper drainage for the rest of the city?
This was the question many citizens seemed to be asking themselves on Tuesday, in the aftermath of a deluge that left many parts of the city inundated and virtually paralysed.
On Monday, the second most populous city in Sindh witnessed a total collapse of all utility services, including electricity and water, for up to 30  hours.
Rainwater finally started receding from settlements, roads and streets by late Tuesday night.
 
 

Mayor Kashif Shoro said claimed that 99pc areas of Hyderabad city had been cleared of rainwater.
He told Dawn on Tuesday evening that only 1pc areas were those pockets of low lying areas where water was being collected for disposal as it could not be drained out in mainstream drainage system.
Absent officials
During and in the aftermath of the deluge, Rescue 1122 personnel remained inactive for want of supervision by relevant officials, who were also missing from the scene. Resultantly, hundreds of thousands of people kept waiting for relief work until late in the night.
The divisional commissioner, a BS-20  officer, was also conspicuous by his absence at such a critical juncture.
Even on Tuesday, rainwater remained accumulated in Commissioner House as well as Shahbaz Building – where administration officers sit to discharge their duties – which speaks volume of the performance of both divisional and district administrations.
Cloudburst or no?
The head of the civil administration – the local deputy commissioner – attributed the crisis to ‘severe cloudburst’ in Hyderabad, only to be met with a strong rebuttal from the chief meteorologist, in addition to flak from social media users.
“It was in no way a cloudburst either by definition or by phenomenon”, Amir Hyder Leghari of Pakistan Meteorological Department Sindh told Dawn.
Rainwater from most part of city, rather old city areas, is drained on a gravity based system comprising a series of nullahs into two Phuleli canals unlike Latifabad where rainwater is pumped for disposal. These drains have not been desilted.
Power situation
Ironically,  the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC) blames the  Hyderabad Electric  Supply Company (Hesco) for its failure to ensure uninterrupted power supply. However, the Hesco chief holds weather responsible for the collapse of its system.
In many areas power supply, could not be restored even 30 hours after it was suspended at about 4:20pm on Monday.
Hesco’s role, undoubtedly, is critical in every monsoon season, and even this time around, a considerable part of Hyderabad remained without power after trees fell on its feeders at different places following a powerful dust storm. No one from the HMC, administration or Hesco had bothered to trim the trees ahead of monsoon.
On its part, Hesco claimed on Tuesday evening that “100pc power supply has been restored in the city”, adding that six grid stations still remained offline.
According to Hesco’s spokesman Sadiq Kubar, said that 12 towers had fallen down during the dust storm and rainfall.

The multi-stakeholder committee will conduct a 30-day consultation process to develop a consensual and actionable proposal, which will be submitted to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the federal cabinet.
According to sources present at the meeting, officials from various ministries clarified that the new tax amendments are primarily intended to curb large-scale sales tax fraud. The committee will only consider trader concerns that are deemed genuine and substantiated, the officials added.
Traders were firmly told that the government remains committed to documenting the economy and discouraging cash-based transactions. Several trade associations have already called for strike actions in protest against the new measures.

Committee tasked with addressing concerns over tax reforms and documentation efforts within 30 days

An official statement announced that the decision was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Finance Minister Aurangzeb, which brought together representatives from Pakistan’s business community, chambers of commerce, and trade organisations. The session primarily addressed trader concerns over Section 37A and other provisions introduced in the Finance Act 2025.
The committee will be led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, and will include Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, the Prime Minister’s Trade Coordinator Rana Ehsan Afzal Khan, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial, and nominated members from the business community.
Business leaders expressed concerns about the impact of the new legislation on routine commercial transactions. In response, Mr Aurangzeb assured full transparency and cooperation from the government, reiterating that the reforms aim to combat widespread tax evasion, not to harass legitimate businesses.
The traders also shared their reservations and proposals, prompting the government to promise a considerate and inclusive approach. It was mutually agreed that efforts would be made to avoid placing undue hardship on the business community during the implementation of the reforms, the official announcement added.
Under the Finance Act 2025, a new Section 37A has been inserted into the Sales Tax Act 1990, empowering the FBR to constitute a three-member committee that can authorise the Commissioner to issue an arrest warrant against individuals involved in tax fraud, provided the tax loss exceeds Rs50 million.

The order came during the hearing of a case seeking the formation of such a commission Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while hearing the case, ordered  that the commission should complete its work within four months.
However, he allowed the commission to seek an extension from the court, if  required.
While concluding the hearing, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan  said the court’s primary task was to determine whether there were  sufficient grounds to form a commission.
 
 

Satisfied with the  arguments, he ordered the government to form the commission within 30  days and instructed that it must submit its findings within four months.  Any request for an extension must be brought before the court.

IHC judge concerned by ‘disappearance’ of woman believed to be a central figure in a number of related cases

The judge also expressed concern over the disappearance of a woman who is the elusive central figure linked to an ongoing blasphemy-related case.
During the proceedings of this case, Komal Ismail had been identified as ‘Iman’, a shadowy figure who was allegedly involved in ‘trapping’ a number of those accused of blasphemy.
Earlier this month, Justice Ejaz Ishaq Khan had ordered her CNIC to be blocked over her failure to appear before the court.
On Tuesday, an official from the National Cyber Crimes  Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed the bench that four SIMs were registered under her identity, but all these numbers had became inactive after November.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq noted that while the petition in the case had been filed on September 14, and Komal went missing in November.
The officer also said that Ms Ismail had not left the country and was believed to be still in Pakistan. Her name has been placed on the Exit Control List (ECL), and efforts to trace her are ongoing.
The judge observed that the matter directly concerned Komal’s personal safety. “Her life may be in danger. What action can the agency take in such a situation?” he asked.
Advocate Hadi Ali Chatha informed the court that earlier, it had asked for WhatsApp data of three mobile numbers, but telecom companies had responded that WhatsApp data is not covered under Call Detail Records (CDRs), and even standard CDRs are only available for the past year.
The judge remarked that if an intelligence agency has the capability to retrieve such data, the commission should be empowered to request its assistance, adding, “This is a matter of people’s lives”.
The court also reviewed the conduct of the investigation.
Naik Muhammad, one of the accused, had claimed he was trapped by a woman named ‘Iman’.
Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq questioned the thoroughness of the investigation, observing that officials had merely retrieved five images from Naik Muhammad’s phone and built a case without establishing whether ‘Iman’ had ever contacted him.
Advocate Chatha also revealed that the complainant in the case, Shiraz Farooqi, had remained in contact with the accused just a week before filing the complaint. When questioned by the court, Farooqi denied the claim, calling it “a complete lie.”

Unknowingly or otherwise, it thereby facilitated the extermination camps and pogroms that stand out as the most reprehensible aspects of World War II.
The end of that war is celebrated as signifying the triumph of good over evil. That’s not an absurd claim, but one wonders why the commitment to ‘never again’ has frequently fallen short when tested — albeit perhaps never so obviously than since Oct 2023, when the atrocities committed by Hamas served as a convenient excuse to fulfil the extreme Zionist dream of a purely Jewish territory from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River.
The means? A process of displacement and extermination that began in 1948. The genocidal goal now appears within reach, with the active collaboration of many of the powers that joined hands to defeat Nazism, as well as Germany, whose guilt as the primary perpetrator of the Holocaust apparently blinds its political elite to recognising an obvious repetition of recent history just because it is being committed by the descendants of its victims.
It is always moving to see those who survived the Holocaust as infants or children, or the succeeding generation, turn up at protests against the Gaza genocide. If only such voices could become the norm rather than the exception. Once upon a time it was possible to assume that the resistance to Zionist aims would emerge from within Israel. That remote prospect has now been reduced to a fantasy. Substantial numbers of Israelis demand a ceasefire to save the surviving hostages, but far fewer seem to be bothered about the daily toll in Gaza, where children lining up for food, water or medical aid are routinely targeted by the IDF.
One of the more original placards at last Sunday’s weekly rally for Palestine in Sydney read, “They’re so stupid, they think genocide is self-defence”. Several of the speeches focused on the report delivered by Jillian Segal, the Zionist lobbyist appointed by the Albanese government as its ‘antisemitism envoy’, which has been described by academics and journalists alike as an attempt to clamp down on criticism of Israel based on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s widely discredited definition of antisemitism. PM Anthony Albanese stood by Segal’s side as she delivered her report, but it remains to be seen whether the government will accept its absurd recommendations on curbing freedom of expression. She has denied any involvement in a far-right lobbying group co-directed by her husband.

Few Israelis seem to be bothered about the daily toll in Gaza.

The aforementioned rally — where the best speaker was a young Jewish activist — would not have been legal if Segal and her ilk had their way, just as the advent of the Trump administration has effectively relegated pro-Palestinian protests to the past via a series of authoritarian measures that even the proudly Zionist Joe Biden might have deemed an overreach. Like most of their US counterparts, Australian universities might not put up much resistance if they are accused of overlooking antisemitism based on Segal’s favoured definition. Various cultural institutions have already tied themselves up in knots over any possible criticism of Israel, and the mainstream media largely struggles to disassociate itself from the Israel lobby.
In Britain, Palestine Action — rather than the IDF — has been proscribed as a ‘terrorist organisation’, and anyone publicly opposing this ridiculous designation faces 14 years in prison. Despicable curbs on freedom of expression when it comes to Palestine stretch pretty much across Europe, with the honourable exceptions of Ireland and Spain. In the so-called Global South, Israel’s chief ally is India, which was once proudly wedded to the Palestinian cause.
Pakistan is among the nations expected to be represented at the ‘emergency conference’ summoned in Bogota this week by Colombia and South Africa. It will be attended by UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, lately sanctioned by the wretched US after naming the commercial entities complicit in the current genocide. Unlike her Australian namesake, she stands out as an unbiased champion of human rights who has much to teach other influential Europeans about the disgusting brutality of their pro-Israeli inclinations.
The official Western efforts to silence opposition to Israeli fascism are neither new nor entirely surprising. Hopefully, one day they will be seen for what they are: cover for genocide, with little prospect that it can be halted. Just shut up and bear it is the response of the self-ordained paragons of virtue and free speech. Let’s see whether posterity upholds their prejudiced cowardice.

• NLC accused of PPRA rule violations, acting as middleman
ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday directed the planning division’s secretary to conduct an inquiry into additional expenditures and submit a report within a month.
PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar stressed that the planning division should serve as a role model for other ministries. The committee’s member Sanaullah Mastikhel voiced concerns that development funds were being withheld from lawmakers who refused to compromise their integrity.
A case involving the lapse of Rs220 million from the planning division’s development budget also came under scrutiny. The amount had reportedly been earmarked for an event that was cancelled due to the prime minister’s absence. PAC members questioned why such a large sum had been allocated for a single event. Planning Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra clarified that the funds were intended for a social sector project that the prime minister was meant to inaugurate.
MNAs Riaz Fatyana and Sanaullah Mastikhel objected that the planning ministry suffered from poor planning. Mr Fatyana questioned the role of the Planning and Development division, noting that nearly 45 per cent of the country’s population lives below the poverty line.
PAC also reviewed irregularities in the disbursement of funds to district administrations during the census. Audit officials revealed that out of Rs8.69 billion allocated to 157 districts, the leftover funds remained unaccounted for. Mr Sumra noted that accounts for 11 districts were still pending, prompting PAC to order that complete financial records from all remaining districts be collected.
A separate audit found that 219 out of 126,000 tablets purchased for the census were untraceable. The planning secretary said only 24 devices remained missing. PAC decided to close the audit on that matter.
In a separate session, the committee reviewed an audit report on the National Logistics Corp­oration (NLC), focusing on Rs3.2bn in irregularities related to steel procurement.
Audit officials said steel initially contracted at Rs108,000 per tonne was later procured at Rs298,000 per tonne. NLC officials responded that the revised rates were board-approved and aligned with market trends. Audit authorities also flagged a procedural violation in extending a one-year contract with Faizan Steel to three years instead of the permissible two six-month extensions.
The committee also reviewed the Bara Kahu Bypass project, where contractual flaws reportedly led to a Rs2.47bn loss for NLC. The project, awarded without tender under emergency conditions, was initially estimated at Rs6.51bn but ballooned to Rs8.82bn.
The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has yet to approve the additional cost. NLC attributed the overrun to court stay orders and design changes, such as an extension in the length of a bridge.
Committee members observed that the NLC violated Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules with impunity. “Had any other division or private firm committed such violations, the matter would have been referred to NAB or the FIA,” Mr Mehmood said. The committee condemned the practice of awarding development projects to NLC without tendering and at inflated costs, often 120pc higher than standard estimates. It was also observed that NLC acted as a middleman by subletting projects to third parties at lower rates.

Pushed to the wall, the PTI now threatens to take to the street once again. Meanwhile, the party’s overseas supporters are approaching international forums to raise a voice against “political repression” in Pakistan.
A US bipartisan congressional committee was due to meet early on Wednesday Pakistan time reportedly to examine “the government of Pakistan’s persecution of opposition political figures and journalists”. Nothing may come out of this hearing that could trouble the present dispensation, but it’s not all well for the hybrid power structure. It’s not that a fractured PTI can bring down the system through street power, yet the heightened political confrontation has once again highlighted the question of legitimacy of the current political setup.
While the recent controversial judgment by the Supreme Court on the reserved seats for women and minorities may have given the ruling coalition a comfortable two-thirds majority in parliament, it has further exposed the dubiousness of the entire power structure. Not only has the control of the security establishment strengthened, but democratic space has also shrunk.
The perception of a compliant judiciary and a tamed press may have provided a semblance of stability, but the falseness of the existing power structure is evident. The latest crackdown on social media platforms is part of the move to stifle freedom of expression. It’s also a sign of weakness of a dispensation that cannot tolerate any kind of dissent. One can understand the desperation of the PTI to take its case to international forums with no judicial and political recourse available at home.
It may not be justifiable to take the domestic political battle outside and seek support from any other country but unfortunately, this happens when all democratic avenues are closed. Scores of PTI leaders and activists, including former prime minister Imran Khan, are incarcerated allegedly on concocted charges and human rights violations have become the norm. Speculation is rampant that the ruling alliance, with its newfound absolute majority, is planning to bring more changes to the Constitution to establish authoritarian rule. It should be a cause of serious concern for all democratic forces.

Any move to unseat the KP government through engineering would turn the situation extremely volatile.

A government installed in power allegedly through stolen elections doesn’t have any legitimacy. The ruthless use of force by the state to break up even peaceful protests, as witnessed last November in Islamabad, leaves no room for rationality on part of the opposition. The PTI’s call for countrywide protests and the government’s threat to use force to stop it have increased political uncertainty.
This politics of confrontation is extremely perilous for the country facing multiple external and internal security challenges and with its economy still not out of danger. According to some media reports there is now a move to dislodge the PTI’s government in KP following questionable allocation of reserved seats that has drastically altered the numbers game in the provincial assembly.
Although the PTI’s majority in the house remains unassailable despite the party having been deprived of reserved seats, there is some talk about horse trading to buy the support of some provincial ruling party members. Any such move to unseat the PTI government through political engineering would turn the situation in the troubled province extremely volatile. Any undemocratic political change could exacerbate matters in a province already facing resurgence of violent militancy that has already claimed hundreds of lives, most of them soldiers.
Worsening political instability could provide more space to terrorist groups operating from inside the province and across the border. It is a dangerous power game that presents a serious threat to national security. Instead of understanding the gravity of the situation and ending confrontationist politics, the federal government is now reportedly considering restoring the jirga system in the merged tribal districts against the wishes of the provincial government. Any such unconstitutional move would push the province into complete lawlessness.
It’s not just about KP; there is also a move to unseat some two dozen PTI legislators in the Punjab Assembly on the charge of disrupting the assembly proceedings. One cannot condone any kind of hooliganism by members violating the sanctity of the house. But unfortunately, such scenes of rowdyism have become a norm in our assemblies for long involving every political party while in opposition. Surely it’s important to maintain the sanctity of the house, yet there is no precedent of any member being unseated for disrupting the proceedings of the house. It is hoped sanity would prevail.
While the main responsibility for ending political tension and restoring the democratic process mainly lies with the government, the PTI should also lower the political temperature. There is certainly lack of a coherent leadership that could guide the party to a rational path. It may be true that despite adversity the PTI has remained the most popular mass party, but it remains completely rudderless with so many leaders trying to pull the party in different directions.
It may also be the reason for the party’s failure to effectively mobilise its mass following. The biggest harm to the party has been done by the self-appointed party spokespersons operating from overseas who, through their reckless social media campaign, have also fueled confrontationist politics. Their irresponsible rhetoric has given ammunition to the hybrid rulers to suppress all kinds of dissent.
Their attacks are not only confined to the ruling alliance but they have also been targeting their own party leaders and lawmakers. Their hope to get American backing has massively damaged the party’s politics. Many of them even campaigned for Donald Trump hoping that he would get Imran Khan released. That did not happen.
The politics of confrontation and derailing of the democratic process has pushed the country to a serious crisis threatening its unity. The country can only safeguard its sovereignty when its people are free to exercise their democratic rights. Authoritarian rule and unelected forces cannot effectively deal with the serious challenges the country is facing.

Talking to Interior Min­ister Mohsin Raza Naqvi, who met him in Tehran on Tuesday, Pezeshkian said the Jewish state was trying to create division among Muslim countries and stressed that unity and harmony among Islamic nations was needed to foil machinations by Israel and its allies in the West.
“Muslim countries must wake up to the need for unity and form a united front against the Zionist regime,” the Iranian president said, according to a communication received through the media wing of the interior ministry.
President Pezeshkian stated that Iran attached great importance to its relations with Pakistan, emphasising that “we will never forget the support extended by  Pakistan” during the war with Israel.
 
 

President Pezes­h­kian ex­pressed satisfaction over the current state of relations between Iran and Pakistan. He underlined the importance of diplomatic exchanges and constructive dialogue to expand bilateral cooperation.
The Iranian leader said there were many avenues to expand collaboration between Tehran and Islamabad. Mohsin Naqvi congratulated President Pezeshkian on Iran’s victory in the war thrust on it by Israel.
Mr Naqvi praised Iran’s Supreme Leader and the entire nation for standing up to Israeli aggression.  He added that the prudent leadership of Ayatollah Khame­nei played a decisive role in the war. “It is a source of pride for the Muslim Ummah.”
He said Pakistan had condemned the attack on Iran at every forum, recalling “our parliament was the first to pass a resolution condemning the imposition of war on Iran”.
The interior minister conveyed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s best wishes to President Peze­sh­kian.
Iran’s Interior Minister Eskandar Mo­me­ni, Presi­dent Pezesh­kian’s Special Assistant, the Ambassador of Iran in Islamabad, and Pakistan’s Ambassador in Tehran were present on the occasion.
Naqvi calls on ex-FM
Mohsin Naqvi later called on Iran’s former foreign minister Dr Ali Akbar Velayati, who is currently serving as Senior Adviser on International Affairs to Ayatollah Khamenei.
The two leaders discussed matters of mutual interest and the regional situation. Mr Naqvi conveyed good wishes from Pakistan’s political and military leadership to Ayatollah Khamenei.
Mohsin Naqvi said Pakistan and Iran have always stood by each other in war and peace. “No enemy can create rift between Pakistan and Iran,” he added.

Nearly 1,500 lives were lost, over $30bn just evaporated from the economy and agricultural lands turned into stagnant ponds. The world took notice, albeit briefly.
The deluge was not just an act of God. A study in Natural Hazards finds that it was the perfect storm of both climate change and human failings. Southern Pakistan was emerging from a multi-year drought when it was struck by punishing pre-monsoon rainfall, double the historical average. Soils were already sodden when the monsoon itself arrived, with rainfall more than five times the norm. To make matters worse, the region was warming rapidly. Higher temperatures accelerated snowmelt in the high Himalayas, compounded by rain-on-snow events that unleashed torrents into the Indus and its tributaries. Streamflows at Sukkur Barrage surged to 170pc above average.
Our own actions — or inaction — made things worse. Cropland expansion and population growth along riverbanks have erased natural buffers that once absorbed excess water. Urban sprawl, especially in Sindh, has further buried the land beneath concrete, making drainage all but impossible. Reservoirs upstream, such as Tarbela and Mangla, were not drained pre-emptively, missing a critical opportunity to mitigate downstream flooding risks. What happened happened, but unfortunately it was a taste of things to come.
The study warns that if global emissions keep rising unchecked, Pakistan will face far more frequent multi-day extreme rainfall by 2100. Temperatures are forecast to climb by 7°C in the upstream basins by the end of the century. Combined, these trends point to more intense floods, driven by heavier rain and faster glacier melt. With our weak economy and poor public services, we run the risk of each flood not just washing away our homes, but our very futures.
 
 

What then is to be done? Pakistan must get serious about managing rivers and the land surrounding them. Reservoirs must be managed with real-time data on snowmelt and rainfall to prevent flooding. Urban planning, too, is in need of a radical rethink. For one, building further into floodplains must be banned. Green belts along rivers need restoration, not destruction.
Moreover, investment in climate-resilient infrastructure — flood defences, drainage systems, early-warning networks — is of critical importance. Pakistan will need international support, not least because it is a negligible contributor to the carbon emissions warming the planet. However, the primary responsibility lies with the state itself, to prepare for a future where extreme floods are not just possible, but probable.
The 2022 floods were not a freak event. They were a preview. Pakistan, and others vulnerable to climatic extremes, must heed the warning before the next deluge arrives — because it surely will.

On Tuesday evening, the FBI’s Washington Field Office released ‘seeking information’ posters identifying three senior Iranian intelligence officials alleged to have played key roles in Levinson’s disappearance and in efforts to conceal Tehran’s involvement.
Ambassador Moghadam — also known as Ahmad Amirinia — previously headed the operations unit of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), during which time he oversaw agents operating across Europe. He now serves as Iran’s top diplomat in Islamabad.
According to the FBI, Moghadam is suspected of supervising the operation that led to Levinson’s abduction and later taking part in the cover-up. Levinson, a retired FBI special agent, arrived on Kish Island on 8 March 2007 and went missing the following day.
 
 

In a statement, the FBI said the posters were released as part of an ongoing investigation into Iranian officials “who allegedly played roles in Bob’s abduction and Iran’s attempt to obfuscate its responsibility”.
The two other officials named are:
Taghi Daneshvar, also known as Sayyed Taghi Ghaemi, a senior MOIS counter-espionage officer who reportedly supervised Mohammad Baseri — also known as Sanai — around the time Levinson disappeared.
Gholamhossein Mohammadnia, a senior MOIS deputy who served as Iran’s ambassador to Albania in 2016. He was expelled from Albania in December 2018 for allegedly “damaging its national security”. The FBI claims he led efforts to shift blame for Levinson’s disappearance to a terrorist group in Pakistan’s Balochistan region.
“These three intelligence officers were among those who allegedly facilitated Bob’s 2007 abduction and the subsequent cover-up by the Iranian government,” said Steven Jensen, Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Field Office. “Bob likely later perished in captivity far away from his family, friends, and colleagues.”
Images and a video showing Levinson in captivity surfaced in 2010 and 2011, but there has been no confirmed sighting of him since. In March 2025, the US Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on Moghadam and several others in connection with the case.
The FBI maintains that its investigation remains active as it seeks to identify further Iranian officials involved in the abduction. While Pakistani authorities have not been linked to the incident, the case now has a direct connection to Islamabad through Moghadam’s diplomatic posting.</p><small>2025-07-16 03:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/16082654de27af1.jpg?r=082800' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924439/us-panel-holds-hearing-on-rights-issues-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>US panel holds hearing on rights issues in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The chairperson of a US congressional panel on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to monitor alleged human rights violations in Pakistan, as witnesses spoke of widespread abuses across the country.
“Extraordinary ordinary situation! Not only Congress but the executive branch should also sit up and take notes,” said Rep Christopher H. Smith, the Republican co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. He made this remark soon after Zulfi Bukhari, an aide to Imran Khan, claimed before the panel that the former prime minister and his wife had been wrongfully implicated in almost 200 cases, all of which were politically motivated.
 
 

Smith also emphasised that the US could not stand by while civilian rule was subverted by military influence. In his remarks, Mr Bukhari claimed that the basic human rights of Pakistani citizens had been curtailed, the media silenced, and those who dared to speak were either sacked or forced to leave the country. He also alleged that courts had been prevented from holding fair trials through coercion and parliamentary amendments.
Sadiq Amini, founder of the Afghanistan Impact Network, drew attention to what he called Pakistan’s “duplicity” in its relationship with the US.
He also claimed that former PM Imran Khan was “used” to mislead US President Donald Trump during his first term in office.
He said that Mr Khan had taken a message of peace from the Taliban to Washington, which was, in fact, a “deception, carefully crafted by his Russian counterparts”.
 
 

“He convinced President Trump to pursue a peace deal with these terrorists, which only empowered the Taliban.” The peace process inevitably failed, leading to the US withdrawal and the establishment of a “gender apartheid regime” in Kabul, he said.
Mr Amini also said that as PM, Imran Khan had virtually acted as a spokesperson for the Taliban, going around the world indicating that they were an indigenous group serving the interests of the people of Afghanistan.
 
 

“Pakistani leaders, both military and civilian, complain about the Taliban threat. But even now, according to them, the Taliban is good for Afghanistan but bad for Pakistan,” he said, calling it a blatant display of duplicity.
Others scheduled to testify before the panel included Ben Linden, Advocacy Director for Europe and Central Asia at Amnesty International; and, Jared Genser, Managing Director of Perseus Strategies.

The data shows South Asia has reached its highest-ever immunisation coverage for children, according to new data released by WHO and Unicef for 2024. This marks a milestone in the region’s drive to protect every child from vaccine-preventable diseases, the UN agencies say.
The new data shows strong government commitments, investments, and partnerships have propelled South Asia to achieve its highest-ever immunisation coverage.
In 2024, 92pc of the infants in the region received their third dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP) vaccine, a crucial global indicator of vaccination progress.

Pakistan may become the only country in the world having poliovirus, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal tells Senate

This marks a two percentage point increase since 2023. During the same period, the proportion of children receiving their first dose of DTP increased from 93pc to 95pc.
These figures show a strong bounce back, surpassing pre-Covid levels — reflecting efforts of the South Asian governments to prioritise children’s health.
Additionally, there was a 27pc reduction in the number of children who did not receive a single dose of the vaccine, also known as zero-dose children, decreasing from 2.5 million to 1.8 million in a year.
“This is a proud moment for South Asia. More children are protected today than ever before, thanks to tireless frontline health workers, strong government leadership, donors’ and partners’ support and the unwavering trust of families,” said Unicef Regional Director for South Asia, Sanjay Wijesekera.
“But we cannot forget the millions of children who are under-vaccinated or unvaccinated. Now is the time to push further, especially into the most rural areas, to give every child his or her right to healthcare in the earliest years of life,” he said.
 
 

However, while the region made leaps in immunising children in 2024, more than 2.9 million children remain un- and under-vaccinated and, therefore, unprotected. With this in mind, Unicef and WHO have urged governments in South Asia to sustain political commitment and increase domestic financing for immunisation.
‘Only country with poliovirus prevalence’
In a separate development, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal told Senate on Tuesday Pakistan might become the only country having poliovirus as in Afghanistan polio vaccination drive face no hurdles and people there are not refusing to vaccinate their children against the crippling disease.
Replying to a calling-attention notice in the Senate, the health minister said that apart from Kandahar, there is door-to-door campaign being held across Afghanistan.
“In Kandahar announcements are made at mosques and people are called to come and get their children administered polio drops in mosques,” he said.
The calling-attention notice was moved by Senator Abdul Shakoor Khan who said that polio cases are being reported and there are misconceptions regarding the disease and suggested that religious scholars must be involved to play their role for curbing the disease.
 
 

Mr Kamal said that Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries of the world where polio cases are being reported.
He said he himself went to Balochistan to discuss the issue of polio. Last year, he said, 79 cases of polio were reported and this year only 14 cases have been reported so far out of which five cases have been found in Bannu where there were people who had refused to get their children vaccinated.
He said there is a perception that there is resistance against polio drive in Afghan­istan, but the fact is that an extensive polio drive is going on in Afghanistan to eradicate the disease.
He said that earlier police were being used to ensure administration of polio vaccine in Pakistan, but he has stopped it and now influencers of the area are being used to convince the people that they should save the lives of their children and get their children vaccinated.

• Files have now been sent back to IHC; legal experts believe he can’t give reasons now as SC judge
ISLAMABAD: More than three years after then Islamabad High Court (IHC) chief justice Athar Minallah struck down Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the decision has found itself in a legal limbo as the judge has yet to issue detailed reasoning for his verdict.
In his order dated April 8, 2022, Justice Minallah declared illegal the provision — introduced by the PTI government — which expanded the definition of defamation to include criticism against institutions and state authorities and proposed an imprisonment of five years.
“The criminalisation of defamation, protection of individual reputations through arrest and imprisonment and the resultant chilling effect violates the letter of the Constitution…,” Justice Minallah had noted in his short order.
As per standard legal practice, a judge issues a short order, outlining the verdict, and gives a detailed order later elucidating their reasoning for reaching the conclusion.
However, Justice Minallah never issued the detailed reasoning. In November 2022, he was made a Supreme Court judge.
The judge kept the case files with him for writing a detailed order and did not return them to the IHC registrar despite his elevation to the top court.
 
 

According to court officials, the files were returned recently without any detailed order.
The move has created a legal ‘grey area’ as the IHC is once again hearing a set of petitions filed against amendments introduced to Peca earlier this year by the incumbent government.
Some petitioners, who challenged the fresh amendments, relied on Justice Minallah’s 2022 short order to substantiate their case against criminalisation of defamation.
However, in the absence of detailed reasoning, legal experts term such citation as weak.
While a court official told Dawn the case files might be handed over to a bench for rehearing, legal experts think otherwise.
According to former law minister Farooq H. Naek, a short order is a “perfect judgement”, but in the absence of detailed reasoning, the judgement can be labelled as weak.
He wondered why the files were not returned to the IHC registrar by Justice Minallah for three years.
Legal expert Mohammad Akram Sheikh told Dawn the Supreme Court thoroughly discussed the validity of short orders in a judgment authored by former chief justice Moham­mad Ajmal Mian in 1997.
He pointed out that a short order announced and signed by a judge is considered a valid judicial order.
According to Mr Sheikh, Justice Minallah, now being a Supreme Court judge, cannot give reasoning for his judgement passed in the IHC.
In February 2022, the PTI government had promulgated a presidential ordinance amending the Peca.
The controversial ordinance modified the definition of a ‘natural person’ to include “company, association or body of persons whether incorporated or not, institutions, organisations, authority or any other body established by the government.”
Essentially, it enabled any per­son to lodge a complaint over criticism of a civic body or any government entity or institution.
Two factions of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, Pakistan Broadcasters Asso­cia­tion and other activists challenged the ordinance.
Justice Minallah, in his short order, “allowed” the petitions and struck down Section 20, which dealt with the defamation of a ‘natural person’.
Subsequently, the court decl­ared the ordinance “unconstitutional” and “invalid” and declared it void.

• Says measures implemented to expand tax base, plug leakages
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday urged the leading US rating agency — Moody’s — to improve Pakistan’s credit rating and help its return to international capital markets at favourable conditions. Pakistan has been postponing the launch of international bonds since July 2021 due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and resultant poor credit rating and relying mostly on time deposits from friendly nations to meet external liabilities and stay afloat.
Moody’s had upgraded Paki­stan’s credit rating by one notch to Caa2 from Caa3 (downgraded in February 2023 due to suspension of the IMF programme) and changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions, including liquidity and external position from very weak levels.
On Tuesday, Mr Aurangzeb led Pakistan’s economic team, including Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, State Bank of Pakistan Governor Jameel Ahmed, and senior officials from relevant ministries, and held a virtual engagement with Moody’s Rating Agency.
The rating agency was provided an in-depth briefing on Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook, reform agenda, and financial stability.
During the session, the minister apprised the Moody’s team of the significant strides Pakistan has made in stabilising its economy and laying the foundations for sustainable and inclusive growth, said an official statement. He underlined the successful completion of the final IMF review under the Stand-By Arrangement, including the disbursement of the second tranche and progress under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), as key milestones that have restored confidence in Pakistan’s economic management.
The minister highlighted a series of structural reforms undertaken by the government to anchor long-term stability. These included prudent fiscal measures in the recently announced budget, tariff and trade liberalisation geared towards export-led growth, and concerted efforts to rationalise expenditure. The ongoing discussions with the United States on preferential tariff access were also noted as making encouraging headway.
The meeting further outlined Pakistan’s re-engagement with global financial markets, including the successful arrangement of $1 billion in financing from the Middle East, plans for an inaugural Panda bond, and Pakistan’s intent to explore the Eurobond and other international debt markets as credit ratings improve.
The statement claimed that the Pakistani team presented evidence of macroeconomic recovery, including a reduction in inflation, a cut in the pol­i­­cy rate, stabilisation of the exchange rate, a current account surplus, and a surge in foreign exch­a­­nge reserves. Impro­vements in remittance infl­ows and export performance were also cited as signs of resilience and renewed investor confidence.
The Moody’s team was provided an overview of Pakistan’s reform journey, with emphasis on improving the tax-to-GDP ratio through technology-driven tax administration reforms and robust enforcement measures.
The finance minister emphasised that under the direct oversight of the prime minister, who chairs regular meetings on tax reform, the government was impl­e­m­e­nting measures to expand the tax base, plug leakages, and enh­ance compliance. He noted that the Rs2 trillion revenue delta achieved this year had come thro­ugh autonomous efforts, and the government was committed to reaching a tax-to-GDP target of 13 to 13.5pc in the next few years.
He also addressed queries from the Moody’s team and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to staying the course on macroeconomic reforms, including in areas of privatisation, restructuring of state-owned enterprises and rightsizing of government.
Senator Aurangzeb expressed optimism that the improving macroeconomic indicators and reform momentum would be positively acknowledged by rating agencies.

The prime minister was accompanied by senior cabinet members, including Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, and Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that the president and the prime minister agreed that no one will be allowed to harm peace in the country in the name of ‘political rally and sit-in’.
It was decided that PTI protesters will not be allowed to enter the federal capital and will be stopped by any means necessary.
A suggestion also came during the meeting that a specified place away from the central parts of the capital could be allocated for the protest of the main opposition—PTI, which is coming out for its main demand of the release of its jailed founder Imran Khan.
The source said that Presi­dent Zardari, widely regarded for his political acumen despite PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s formal leadership, is known for securing support from non-allied parties during critical political moments.
According to the source, the president assured the prime minister of his cooperation in making efforts to win the maximum number of Senate seats from KP.
Earlier this month, the Election Commission of Pakistan had finally announced the schedule for the long-overdue Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, setting July 21 as the polling date.
The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise will see elections on 11 seats — seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.
Experts believe the outcome will hinge on how PTI-backed and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F (JUI-F) members vote. If the opposition remains united and PTI-backed members strictly follow party discipline — with JUI-F support — the ruling coalition may win only one general seat.
However, the scenario would shift dramatically if some PTI members defect and JUI-F strikes a deal with the ruling coalition. In that case, the coalition might bag around five seats, potentially gaining a two-thirds majority in the upper house of Parliament. JUI-F already holds five seats in the Senate.
Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate — 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).

• ANP also denied relief, told allocation is calculated on basis of general seats, not by-election
ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan has decided to allow the PML-N to retain a general assembly seat while rejecting a similar request by the PTI-Parliamentarians, saying it was not supported by the law.
In its decision on a case about the allocation of reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, announced on Tuesday, the commission provided relief to the ruling party that had sought a greater share in the KP Assembly reserved seats on the basis of the additional general seat handed to the PML-N, which was initially declared to be held by an independent candidate.
The announcement followed a Peshawar High Court order, asking the ECP to redistribute reserved seats in the provincial assembly. With the addition of one more seat, the PML-N is eligible for an extra reserved seat in the KP Assembly and holds the same number of seats as the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F).
 
 

After the PML-N received the general seat, the ruling party and the JUI-F hold the same number of seats in the KP Assembly, and the former is entitled to get at least one more reserved seat in the provincial assembly.
The ECP had determined the quota of reserved seats for women and non-Muslims on the basis of party position as it stood on Feb 22 — the legal deadline for the issuance of victory notifications.
In its decision, the commission accepted the plea that Malik Tariq Awan — an independent candidate — who joined the PML-N a day after the allocation of reserved seats did not get three days to join a political party. Interestingly, a similar plea by the PTI-Parliamentarians has been rejected by the ECP.
The ECP order referred to proviso of Article 51(6)(e), read with Article 106 of the Constitution, which provides that the calculation of quota for the reserved seats shall be made on the basis of total number of general seats won by political party, which shall include the independent returned candidate or candidates who may duly join such political party within three days of the publication in official gazette.
Mr Awan was declared an independent returned candidate on Feb 22, 2024. The commission, after the passage of around one and a half years, now reached the conclusion that Mr Awan joined the PML-N on Feb 23, which was within three days of the victory notification.
The commission held that he was eligible to be considered as a member of for an additional seat on the basis of the same grounds was rejected by the ECP. The ECP order conceded that PTI-P won two KP Assembly general seats in the Feb polls, but it could not recalculate the reserved seats at the request of the party because it would be an ‘unending process’ if such a request was entertained.
The order said that at the time of calculation of quota, one seat was duly notified for PTI-P from PK-73 (Peshawar-III).  Subsequently, another candidate of the said party from PK-103 was notified on Feb 27 after the calculation and allocation of reserved seats to the political parties.
Without explaining if the commission can punish a political party for belated issuance of a victory notification, the ECP said recalculation of quota for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims at belated stage after allocation of reserved seats to the political parties was not supported by the Constitution and law.
“The rationale for calculation of quota for the reserved seats on the basis of party position on 22-02-2024 was to avoid unending controversies. For example, if a political party succeeds in getting more seats as a result of recounting or by-election or decision of the tribunal, the quota will be revised again and again and it will be an unending process which is against the spirit of Constitution and Law as enshrined in Articles 51(6) & 106 of the Constitution and Section 98 & 104 of the Elections Act, 2017 and Rule 92 of the Election Rules, 2017,” it noted, while dismissing PTI-P’s plea for another reserved seat.
The commission directed the office to take follow-up action in light of the order and submit the case to the commission accordingly.
ANP by-election seat
Meanwhile, the Awami National Party (ANP) had secured one general seat from PK-75 Peshawar-IV during the General Elections 2024, which was notified on Feb 22. Subsequently, the ANP secured another seat from PK-22 Bajaur-IV, held on July 11, and the returned candidate was notified on July 25.
The order said in accordance with the Constitution and applicable legal provisions, the quota for allocation of reserved seats is calculated on the basis of general seats and not on the basis of subsequent by-elections.
“Results of by-elections cannot be included as it is not the spirit of Constitution provided under Article 224(2) of the Constitution read with Section 98 of the Elections Act, 2017.
In case, this petition is accepted it will be un-ending processes which will result recalculation/fluctuation of seats from time to time after each and every by-election or decision of the tribunal,“ the commission observed while rejecting ANP’s plea for another seat.

Filing a plea before the SHC, petitioner Malik Shahzain Ahmed sought compensation and an inquiry into the incident.
He cited the ministry of aviation, Civil Aviation Authority, Airport Security Force, Federal Investigation Agency and AirSial as respondents, and sought directive for effective implementation of mandatory standard operating procedures (SOPs) and documentation procedures.
The petitioner submitted that he is a resident of Korangi, Karachi, and frequently travels within the country for work-related assignments as he is a professional civil engineer.

Seeks compensation for financial and mental distress caused by airline’s negligence; urges high court to order implementation of SOPs

He stated that on July 7, he had purchased a ticket of AirSial to travel from Lahore to Karachi, but due to alleged gross negligence and procedural failure of the airline, he was “wrongfully and unlawfully boarded on an international flight of the same airline to Jeddah despite lacking valid passport, visa and international travel clearance”.
The petitioner also submitted that such a reckless conduct of the private airline resulted in his prolonged detention and interrogations at the Jeddah Airport and eventually he was deported back to Lahore by the Saudi immigration authorities without any assistance or representation of the respondent airline.
He further maintained that after returning to Lahore, he was again compelled to purchase a new ticket to reach Karachi.
He said he sent a formal legal notice to the airline for legal intimation and initiation of appropriate action, but no response had been received so far. He alleged that the airline has failed to offer any apology, remedy, or compensation and instead attempted to suppress the incident and such action was amount to gross violation of his fundamental rights as guaranteed in the Constitution.
The counsel for petitioner, Nawaz Dahri, submitted that besides violation of constitutional provisions, such an act has also caused immense mental distress, financial loss and reputational damage to him as well as exposing him to criminal liability abroad.
He also argued that the regulatory authorities have also failed to perform their statutory duties in order to prevent such gross misconduct and their inaction has caused violations.
The lawyer maintained that actions of respondents have also violated various laws and regulations including Rules 272 and 273 the Civil Aviation Rules 1997 requiring passengers’ verification, the Pakistan Immigration Ordinance 1979, barring international travel without valid documents and the Montreal Convention 1999 and International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 9 binding the air carrier to ensure secure and lawful travel procedures.
He further submitted that the petitioner was also facing threats and intimidation not to pursue the matter in question publically and legally while his client was subjected to unlawful detention, loss of dignity, deprivation of liberty and financial injury.
The counsel argued that the conduct of the private airline has posed a serious threat to the aviation safety standards and inaction on the part of aviation authorities has undermined public confidence in aviation institutions.
He also contended that no alternative remedy was available with the petitioner but to invoke the constitutional jurisdiction of the SHC primarily to safeguard his fundamental rights.
The lawyer further maintained that the petitioner had been able to demonstrate infringement of fundamental rights, meriting the exercise to move the SHC.
The petitioner pleaded for a full transparent inquiry into the incident and to fix responsibility upon delinquent officials or persons and sought compensation for damages.
He also sought directives for the respondents to suspend the license of the airline and effective implementation of mandatory SOPs and documentation procedures.

• Central govt debt soars to Rs76tr                     
KARACHI: Bank lending to the government has exceeded Rs44 trillion, while lending to the private sector accounts for just 21 per cent of total advances, highlighting the growing imbalance in the country’s credit landscape.
According to the latest data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), government borrowing from banks surged by Rs8.5tr in FY24 alone. In stark contrast, private sector lending fell to a mere Rs46bn in FY23, rose modestly to Rs513bn in FY24, and stands at around Rs742bn so far in FY25.
As of May, the government’s holdings of market securities stood at Rs44.889tr, of which 78.9pc (Rs35.440tr) were held by scheduled banks and 21.1pc by non-bank entities.
Notably, the corporate sector is increasingly parking its liquidity in government securities, a trend that underscores the diminishing appetite for or opportunity in real-sector investment. Corporate holdings in government papers have now reached Rs9.5tr — capital that, in a healthier economy, would be channelled into industrial expansion and job creation.
This shift toward risk-free government paper has profound economic implications. Private sector credit stagnation has contributed to an average GDP growth of just 1.7pc over the past three years — far below the level needed to absorb Pakistan’s growing labour force and meet the rising costs of housing, health, and education for over 250 million citizens.
The government has acknowledged the lacklustre performance of the agricultural sector, with wheat farmers, in particular, being hit by a 21% drop in wheat prices this year, further eroding rural incomes and disincentivising production.
SBP data up to May 31 shows that scheduled banks’ largest exposure is in Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), totalling Rs24.7tr, while the corporate sector has invested Rs5.05tr in PIBs. Ijara Sukuk (Islamic bonds) have attracted over Rs6tr, with more than 88pc held by scheduled banks. Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) saw total investments of Rs9.084tr — Rs5.399tr by banks and Rs3.685tr by corporates.
Meanwhile, the central government’s total domes­tic debt rose to Rs53.468tr and external debt to Rs22.585tr by May. This brought the total government debt to Rs76.045tr, up Rs7.131tr from Rs68.914tr in June 2024.

The surge in lending last year was driven by a government policy announced in the FY25 budget, which imposed an incremental tax of up to 15pc on banks that failed to maintain a minimum ADR of 50pc. The move was aimed at encouraging private sector credit and boosting economic growth, which had remained below desired levels.
The policy triggered an aggressive response from banks. Some major institutions reportedly advised large depositors to withdraw funds or face penalties as banks scrambled to meet the new threshold. In a bid to comply, banks significantly increased lending to Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFIs), with loans reaching a record Rs1tr by December 2024 — 130pc higher than the total credit stock of NBFIs at the time.
According to a State Bank report, this sharp increase was a strategic manoeuvre by banks to manage surplus liquidity and meet the mandatory ADR by year-end. Despite achieving the target, the government eventually withdrew the 50pc ADR condition and still imposed an additional tax on banks.
Following the removal of the requirement, banks shifted back to risk-free avenues, primarily investing in government securities. This shift pushed the investment-to-deposit ratio (IDR) to 103pc by June 2025.

A press release from the Finance Division said the revised prices were based on recommendations by Ogra and concerned ministries.
The new petrol price is Rs272.15 per litre and Rs284.35 for HSD.
The press release did not mention any changes in the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil.
According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol was projected to rise by about two per cent to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD was likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre.
Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.
Diesel fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters had already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.
Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.
Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.
Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.
In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.</p><small>2025-07-15 19:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/152342564bf2815.jpg?r=234300' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924401/3-children-killed-5-people-injured-as-two-roofs-collapse-in-kps-malakand-after-heavy-rains' target='_blank'><strong>3 children killed, 5 people injured as two roofs collapse in KP’s Malakand after heavy rains</strong></a><br><p>Three children were killed and five people were injured as roofs collapsed in two separate incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand division after heavy rains in the region.
Last week, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) alerted the district administrations across KP to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Lower Dir Rescue 1122 spokesperson Abdur Rehman told Dawn.com today, “An under-construction mud house roof collapsed, burying four children underneath debris.”
He said the incident occurred at the Shahi Moro Barawal area along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Lower Dir.
According to the Rescue 1122 spokesperson, the rescue team had reached the site and retrieved the children from the debris and shifted them to a Samar Bagh hospital, where doctors declared two of them dead.
He said the remaining two children were undergoing medical assistance at the hospital.
In another incident, a child was killed and a mother and two others were injured when a mud-roof collapsed due to heavy rainfall in the Opal area of Chakesar tehsil in Shangla.
Shangla Rescue 1122 spokesperson Rasool Khan Sharif told Dawn.com that the family was asleep at night when the roof collapsed due to torrential rain.
“The local people had retrieved the trapped family members who were all buried underneath debris,” Sharif said.
The rescue spokesperson added that a five-year-old boy was killed while the mother and two other children were injured.
He said the injured family members were taken to the Rasool Khan Sharif Rural Health Centre, from where they were referred to a hospital in Mingora, Swat, for further treatment.
The deaths came amid an alert from the KP PDMA about the increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof).
“Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Islamabad has intimated that a wet spell is likely to affect KP in current week. During this period, scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, are expected in KP. The prevailing weather conditions, increase the risk of Glofs and flash flood events in vulnerable glaciated regions of KP.
“In view of the above weather conditions, you are requested to kindly take all necessary
precautionary measures to avoid any loss of life/ livestock and damages to infrastructure/ crops,” said the alert to the deputy commissioners of Upper and Lower Chitral, Upper Dir, Swat and Upper Kohistan.
 






Ten people, including eight children, were killed in separate rain-related incidents across KP on Monday.
The deaths were reported in Bajaur, Khyber, Malakand, Kohat and Lakki Marwat districts. The PDMA had confirmed six deaths.</p><small>2025-07-15 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614171-viral-video-rant-court-releases-elderly-citizen' target='_blank'><strong>Viral video rant: Court releases elderly citizen</strong></a><br><p>

Rashid has been in prison for more than two years now in connection with multiple cases against her regarding the events of May 9. She was first detained on May 12, 2023, under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance and later arrested for her alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.
She was hospitalised last year in May and July as well.
“Yasmin Rashid was shifted from jail to Services Hospital Emergency Department,” her lawyer Rana Mudassar told Dawn.com.
He added that Rashid was experiencing severe difficulty in breathing and also suffering from extreme stomach pain.
“Dr Yasmin Rashid has also been given oxygen due to her difficulty in breathing,” Mudassar said, adding that she was being tested at the hospital.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram also confirmed the development in a post on X.
“Dr Yasmin Rashid has just been urgently shifted from Kot Lakhpat Jail to a hospital due to her deteriorating health,” he wrote.
 






He added that Rashid was suffering from various ailments and “has been unjustly imprisoned for 24 months”.
“PTI demands that, keeping the requirements of justice in view, Dr Yasmin’s bail be immediately granted,” he added.
Barrister Taimur Malik, who contested the 2024 polls with the support of the PTI and is a member of the party’s legal team, also called for Rashid to be “granted the right to bail like thousands of others in these cases”.
He said that the PTI had asked the courts repeatedly to decide her bail applications.
“More than two years in prison as an under-trial prisoner is punishment itself before any case has even been decided,” he added.
 






PTI leader Musarrat Cheema said, “Rashid is a cancer survivor; she also has a breathing issue, but she was not even provided with oxygen. Every day, she endures jail trials in bogus cases.”
She requested prayers for Rashid’s health.
 






On July 12, an anti-terrorism court reserved its verdict on the bail petitions of former Punjab governor Umar Sarfraz Cheema and Rashid in cases related to the May 9 riots.
The same day, Rashid and four other PTI senior leaders incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat Jail demanded fresh, free and fair general elections in the country in an open letter, and called for learning lessons from the 1970 debacle.</p><small>2025-07-15 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614167-bestway-celebrates-50-years-with-star-studded-tribute-to-founder-sir-anwar-pervez' target='_blank'><strong>Bestway celebrates 50 years with star-studded tribute to Founder Sir Anwar Pervez</strong></a><br><p>

In March, Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
“I urge you [Balochistan CM] to release all Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,” the sample letter by Amnesty read.
It called on CM Bugti to drop all charges and overturn detention orders against Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights.
“End the wider crackdown against activists and protesters across the province by allowing them to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression without undue restriction,” the letter urged.
“The crackdown on Baloch activists, including Mahrang Baloch, Bebarg Zehri, Beebow Baloch, Shah Jee Sibghat Ullah, Ghafar Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, violate Pakistan’s international human rights commitments, particularly the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” the letter continued.
Amnesty said that laws such as the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO) and Anti-Terrorism Act have been used to prolong their arbitrary detention in violation of their rights to liberty and due process.
“This is part of a wider crackdown on human rights in Balochistan through suppression of peaceful assembly, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions,” the human rights organisation said.
It expressed concern for the safety and well-being of all those detained, as “access to family members and lawyers is regularly blocked by prison authorities.”
The letter said that the continued detention of the six Baloch activists, beyond the 90-day period allowed under MPO, has already long passed and violates the law.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the MPO — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.
Last week, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta handed Mahrang and other organisers of the group into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention.
In May, Amnesty and four other human rights organisations had called on Pakistan to release human rights defenders in Balochistan and end the crackdown on dissent.</p><small>2025-07-15 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/152247222e00b9d.jpg?r=224759' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924402/putin-unfazed-by-trump-will-fight-on-and-could-take-more-of-ukraine-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Putin, unfazed by Trump, will fight on and could take more of Ukraine: sources</strong></a><br><p>President Vladimir Putin intends to keep fighting in Ukraine until the West engages on his terms for peace, unfazed by Donald Trump’s threats of tougher sanctions, and his territorial demands may widen as Russian forces advance, three sources close to the Kremlin said.
Putin, who ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in the country’s east between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops, believes Russia’s economy and its military are strong enough to weather any additional Western measures, the sources said.
Trump on Monday expressed frustration with Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire and announced a wave of weapons supplies to Ukraine, including Patriot surface-to-air missile systems. He also threatened further sanctions on Russia unless a peace deal was reached within 50 days.
The three Russian sources, familiar with top-level Kremlin thinking, said Putin will not stop the war under pressure from the West and believes Russia — which has survived the toughest sanctions imposed by the West — can endure further economic hardship, including threatened US tariffs targeting buyers of Russian oil.
“Putin thinks no one has seriously engaged with him on the details of peace in Ukraine — including the Americans — so he will continue until he gets what he wants,” one of the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.
Despite several telephone calls between Trump and Putin, and visits to Russia by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Russian leader believes there have not been detailed discussions of the basis for a peace plan, the source said.
“Putin values the relationship with Trump and had good discussions with Witkoff, but the interests of Russia come above all else,” the person added.
Asked for a comment on the Reuters reporting, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly blamed former president Joe Biden for allowing the war to erupt during his administration.
“Unlike Biden, President Trump is focused on stopping the killing, and Putin will be faced with biting sanctions and tariffs if he does not agree to a ceasefire,” she said.
Putin’s conditions for peace include a legally binding pledge that Nato will not expand eastwards, Ukrainian neutrality and limits on its armed forces, protection for Russian speakers who live there, and acceptance of Russia’s territorial gains, the sources said.
He is also willing to discuss a security guarantee for Ukraine involving major powers, though it is far from clear how this would work, the sources said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will never recognise Russia’s sovereignty over its conquered regions and that Kyiv retains the sovereign right to decide whether it wants to join Nato. His office did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
A second source familiar with Kremlin thinking said that Putin considered Moscow’s goals far more important than any potential economic losses from Western pressure, and he was not concerned by US threats to impose tariffs on China and India for buying Russian oil.
Two of the sources said that Russia has the upper hand on the battlefield and its economy, geared towards war, is exceeding the production of the US-led Nato alliance in key munitions, such as artillery shells.

Russia, which already controls nearly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory, has advanced some 1,415 square kilometres in the past three months, according to data from the DeepStateMap, an open-source intelligence map of the conflict.
“Appetite comes with eating,” the first source said, meaning that Putin could seek more territory unless the war was stopped. The two other sources independently confirmed the same.
Russia currently controls Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, plus all of the eastern region of Luhansk, more than 70 per cent of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and fragments of Kharkiv, Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Putin’s public position is that those first five regions — Crimea and the four regions of eastern Ukraine — are now part of Russia and Kyiv must withdraw before there can be peace.
Putin could fight on until Ukraine’s defences collapse and widen his territorial ambitions to include more of Ukraine, the sources said.
“Russia will act based on Ukraine’s weakness,” the third source said, adding that Moscow might halt its offensive after conquering the four eastern regions of Ukraine if it encounters stiff resistance. “But if it falls, there will be an even greater conquest of Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy and Kharkiv.”
Zelenskiy has said Russia’s summer offensive is not going as successfully as Moscow had hoped. His top brass, who acknowledge that Russian forces outnumber Ukraine’s, say Kyiv’s troops are holding the line and forcing Russia to pay a heavy price for its gains.
Trump and Putin
The US says 1.2 million people have been injured or killed in the war, Europe’s deadliest conflict since the Second World War. Neither Russia nor Ukraine give full figures for their losses, and Moscow dismisses Western estimates as propaganda.
Trump, since returning to the White House in January after promising a swift end to the war, has sought to repair ties with Russia, speaking at least six times by telephone with Putin. On Monday, he said the Russian leader was not “an assassin, but he’s a tough guy”.
In an abrupt break from his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, Trump’s administration has cast the war as a deadly proxy conflict between Russia and the US, withdrawn support for Ukraine joining Nato and floated the idea of recognising Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
Putin portrays the war as a watershed moment in Moscow’s relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union by enlarging Nato and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine and Georgia.
Putin has yet to accept a proposal from Trump for an unconditional ceasefire, which was quickly endorsed by Kyiv. Recent days have seen Russia use hundreds of drones to attack Ukrainian cities.
However, Trump told the BBC in an interview published today that he was not done with Putin and that a Ukraine deal remained on the cards.
The first source rejected Trump’s assertion last week that Putin had thrown “bullshit” around, saying there had been a failure to transform positive talks with Witkoff into a substantive discussion on the basis for peace.
A White House official said on Monday that Trump was considering 100pc tariffs on Russian goods as well as secondary sanctions on other countries that buy its exports as a means to drive Moscow to the negotiating table. China and India are the biggest buyers of crude.
Despite existing sanctions and the cost of fighting Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two, Russia’s $2 trillion economy has performed far better than many in Russia or the West expected. The economic ministry forecasts a slowdown to 2.5pc annual growth in 2025 from 4.3pc last year.
The second person said that Trump had little leverage over Putin and suggested that even if Washington imposed tariffs on the purchasers of Russian crude, then Moscow would still find a way to sell it to world markets.
“Putin understands that Trump is an unpredictable person who may do unpleasant things, but he is manoeuvring to avoid irritating him too much,” the source said.
Looking ahead, one of the sources said there was likely to be an escalation of the crisis in the coming months, and unscored the dangers of tensions between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. And, he predicted, the war would continue.</p><small>2025-07-15 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/15220221c2bf6fe.jpg?r=220334' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924397/gujranwala-court-dismisses-post-arrest-bail-plea-of-ahmadi-man-held-for-distributing-muharram-niaz' target='_blank'><strong>Gujranwala court dismisses post-arrest bail plea of Ahmadi man held for ‘distributing Muharram Niaz’</strong></a><br><p>A Gujranwala court on Tuesday dismissed the post-arrest bail petition of an Ahmadiyya community member, who was arrested on blasphemy charges for distributing Niaz (free food and drinks) on the 10th of Muharram (Youm-i-Ashur).
The first information report (FIR) against the suspect was lodged with the Satellite Town police station in Punjab’s Gujranwala city on the complaint of a Hafizabad Road resident under Section 298(C) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which criminalises certain acts by members of the Ahmadi community, including calling themselves Muslims or referring to their faith as Islam.
In the FIR, the complainant said the incident took place on July 6 at 4:30pm when he saw the suspect distributing free food and drink during Muharram, “posing as a Muslim”. The Ahmadi man was subsequently arrested and sent on judicial remand.
Gujranwala Judicial Magistrate Sidra Gul Nawaz presided over a hearing for the man’s post-arrest bail plea today.
The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said that the suspect was “found guilty” during the investigation and “sufficient material has come on record connecting him with the commission of the offence”, adding that a large silver cooking pot with chicken biryani was recovered from him.
It also pointed out that the offence under Section 298(C) was related to matters concerning the religious sentiments of a particular community and carried “serious repercussions for law and order”.
Thus, the order said that as a “necessary corollary” of the above, the post-arrest bail plea was dismissed.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman had condemned the Ahmadi man’s arrest and expressed hope that the government would annul the FIR.
Last month, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) asked the Punjab police chief to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and take action against its members if found violating the law.
In a letter, the LHCBA said that the followers of other religions and sects — especially the Ahmadis — are neither legally nor religiously permitted to use Islamic symbols and practices.
In March, the Human Rights Com­­mission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it had observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.
The HRCP also spoke of Ahmadis’ “arbitrary detention”, “desecration of their graves” and the “vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women” to forced conversion.
The report, titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24, said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.
One of the key findings of the report said that disinformation on social media sparked most of the registered blasphemy cases.
HRCP observed an “increasing weaponisation of blasphe­­my laws against Ahmadis”, with cases often initiated by law enforcement officials themselves.</p><small>2025-07-15 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614156-pm-shehbaz-meets-president-zardari-discusses-political-and-economic-situation' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with President Zardari, PM Shehbaz discusses political and economic situation</strong></a><br><p>

The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group’s foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders, which will be hosted by China this autumn in Tianjin.
On June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran that targeted military and nuclear sites as well as residential areas, and killed senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians. The attacks began days before a planned meeting between Tehran and Washington aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations. The US, which had been in talks with Iran since April 12, joined Israel in carrying out its own strikes on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. Iranian authorities say the Israeli strikes killed at least 1,060 people.
Addressing the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers today, Dar said: “We have strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Such illegal actions directed against SCO member states are unacceptable.”
Continuing his criticism of Israel, he said: “Israel has shown a reckless disregard for international norms and humanity through its relentless and disproportionate use of force in Gaza, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of civilians causing the worst humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We call for immediate halt to Israel’s atrocities. The only viable remedy to Palestine dispute is the realisation of two-state solution which includes the establishment of Palestine as a viable, secure and contiguous state on the basis of pre-1967 borders with Al Quds as its capital.
“Unilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of UN Security Council resolutions must be strongly condemned and opposed by all.”

Dar said Pakistan was “increasingly concerned at the trends of using aggression as a tool of policy.”
Instead, he called for the resolution of longstanding disputes through peaceful means, dialogue, diplomacy and according to the principles of international law, justice and fairness.
 






On regional issues, FM Dar said Pakistan sought a relationship of peace and stability with all its neighbours.
“However, the last three months witnessed extremely disturbing developments in South Asia. It is most unfortunate that the attribution of the Pahalgam Attack to Pakistan — without a credible investigation or verifiable evidence — brought the two nuclear-armed states to the brink of a major conflict. In the wake of mounting tensions, Pakistan’s restrained and responsible approach was met with legal transgressions, rhetorical belligerence, and strategic recklessness.
“Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the ceasefire and the cultivation of a stable regional equilibrium. However, we cannot accept that the arbitrary use of force is normalised. We believe that disputes and differences are resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, instead of conflict and coercion. In that backdrop, initiation of a comprehensive and structured dialogue can meaningfully address the full spectrum of issues that have long bedevilled the peace and security in South Asia. Strict adherence to bilateral agreements would be equally important in this regard.”
He said the events unfolding in the region since the April 22 terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam reaffirmed a “central truth” of South Asian geopolitics: the peaceful settlement of longstanding unresolved disputes was “imperative for an enduring peace” in the region.
Dar added that enduring peace and stability in Afghanistan also constituted a cornerstone of the SCO members’ shared aspiration. He pointed out that the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group could serve as a valuable platform for pragmatic and results-oriented cooperation.
“Terrorism is the common concern of humanity that threatens global security. All forms of terrorism, including state terrorism are condemnable. We must shun the use of terrorism for political purposes and combat this menace through a cooperative approach, including addressing its root causes.”
He said the SCO was a vital platform for realising the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), pointing out that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship BRI project, not only supplemented the SCO’s vision of regional connectivity and economic integration but also complemented its common objective of shared development and prosperity.
“We need to take concrete steps within existing SCO’s mechanisms for trade and development and promote the use of national currencies for mutual settlement within SCO region to avoid international financial shocks. We support the proposal to create SCO alternative development funding mechanism to give needed impetus to various stalled development initiatives.
“As the permanent chair of the SCO’s Special Working Group dedicated to combatting poverty, Pakistan is fully committed to providing the necessary momentum to our collaborative endeavours to address poverty.”
Dar called on the SCO members to also collectively address the “existential threat” of climate change.
 


“At a time when the global order is experiencing profound challenges, SCO has emerged as a stabilising force. Its inclusive approach underscoring the sovereign equality of states and seeking peaceful resolutions to disputes, offers a compelling alternative to aggression, confrontation and zero-sum rivalries. The SCO’s commitment to consensus, development, and mutual respect is a beacon of hope for building a better and equitable world.”
Stressing Pakistan’s commitment to the organisation and its principles, Dar said: “In our pursuit to peace and security, we believe in non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of its use in international relations, as well as seeking no unilateral military superiority in the region.”
In a post on X after the meeting, Dar said: “At the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting today, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to multilateralism, mutual respect and regional stability. The Shanghai Spirit continues to guide us towards dialogue, mutual trust and the pursuit of a more just and inclusive international order.”
 






Meeting with Xi
Earlier today, Dar met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing as he represented Pakistan in a joint call of the SCO foreign ministers.
In a post on X, the deputy PM said he was “delighted” to meet with Xi and conveyed the “warm greetings of the leadership, government and people of Pakistan”.
“As iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,” he posted on X.
 






The Chinese president, welcoming the heads of delegations, underlined the “salience of regional cooperation” under the ambit of the SCO, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa).
Shortly later, Dar arrived in Tianjin along with other foreign ministers to lead Pakistan’s delegation to the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting, according to Mofa.
 






The deputy premier arrived in Beijing last night, where he was received at the airport by Ambassador Yu Hong and other senior officials of the Asian Affairs department of China’s Mofa, as well as Pakistan’s ambassador to China, Khalil ur Rehman Hashmi.
India’s Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia’s Sergei Lavrov and Iran’s Abbas Araghchi are among the top diplomats arriving in Beijing for the SCO moot.
Meetings with SCO members’ ministers
Dar also met with the foreign ministers of various SCO member states on the sidelines of the joint call on Xi.
“Always good to exchange views for strengthening regional understanding and cooperation in such a challenging time,” he said on X about his meeting with his Iran, Uzbekistan and Belarus counterparts.
 






“Both leaders reviewed bilateral cooperation across diverse areas and discussed the evolving regional situation following the recent Israeli aggression against Iran,” the Foreign Office said of FM Dar’s meeting with his Iranian counterpart.
 






Da also met Russian FM Sergei Lavrov. “Both sides expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and agreed to further enhance cooperation in trade, energy, agriculture and defence,” the FO said, with Dar reiterated the invitation for FM Lavrov to visit Pakistan.
 






In separate meetings with Kazakhistan FM Murat Nurtleu and Kyrgyzstan’s Zheenbek Moldokanovic, Dar and the ministers reaffirmed a commitment to the enhancement of positive bilateral ties and expanding collaboration across areas of interest.
According to an earlier statement from the Mofa, Dar is set to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from the SCO member states during his visit to China.
