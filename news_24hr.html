Police sources told Dawn that the body of Dr Warda Mushtaq was recovered from the nearby forests of Thandiyani. Her body has now been shifted to the hospital for an autopsy.
Police also arrested a friend of the deceased and her husband in relation to the case.
Mushtaq — a doctor at the Benazir Bhutto Shaheed hospital — had been missing since Thursday, prompting her colleagues and the leaders of the Provincial Doctors Association and Grand Health Alliance to stage a demonstration and boycott hospital duties.
They had announced that if she was not found by Monday, protests would be extended to hospitals across the province.
Following the news of the death, the hospital staff staged a protest and blocked the main Karakoram Highway (KKH) road from Fawara Chowk, assailing the police for “delayed action.”
FIR
As per the first information report (FIR), filed by her father under Section 365 (kidnapping or abducting) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), Mushtaq left the hospital with the wife of a well-known Abbottabad businessman and went to Jadoon Plaza, Mandian, within the jurisdiction of Mirpur Police Station, after which all contacts with her were lost.
The FIR further detailed that Mushtaq had given her friend 67 tolas of gold for safekeeping in 2023 and went to Dubai. However, due to a lack of accommodation, she returned and demanded the return of the gold from her; however, the suspect kept evading it.
Police have initiated action against the three suspects named in the FIR, arresting Mushtaq’s friend, her husband and the deceased’s driver.
Subsequently, the suspect filed a petition with the district police officer (DPO), stating that she had returned the 67 tolas of gold to Mushtaq the day she went missing.
She further alleged that Mushtaq had “borrowed Rs8.3 million, for which she gave me five cheques”, and the two parted ways.
“I have no contact with her and I have no information about her,” she said, adding that she came to know about the incident while she was at a wedding.”
The suspects alleged that “this was a conspiracy to defame her husband, who is a businessman.”
“DPO Abbottabad should conduct an impartial inquiry into this so that the real facts can come out,” she said.
KP governor orders probe
Expressing sympathy over the death of Mushtaq, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report into the incident.
In a statement issued today, he termed it a “serious and unforgettable incident, vowing to punish the perpetrators.“
“As the governor, I share the grief of the doctors’ community across the province and the family of the martyred doctor over the said incident,” Kundi was quoted as saying.</p><small>2025-12-08 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08145937ea6ce36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959934/amid-criticism-over-delay-in-appointing-opposition-leader-na-secretariat-seeks-details-of-cases-registered-against-ptis-omar-ayub' target='_blank'><strong>Amid criticism over delay in appointing opposition leader, NA Secretariat seeks details of cases registered against PTI’s Omar Ayub</strong></a><br><p>Amid mounting criticism over the delay in the opposition leader’s appointment, the National Assembly (NA) Secretariat has sent a letter to PTI’s Chief Whip Malik Aamir Dogar and sought details about the status of cases registered against party leader Omar Ayub.
Two key parliamentary offices, the leader of the opposition in the NA and the leader of the opposition in the Senate, have been lying vacant since August after the disqualification of PTI’s Ayub and Shibli Faraz by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with their conviction in the May 9 cases.
The PTI has nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas for the opposition leader slots in the NA and Senate, respectively. However, they have not yet been notified.
In a statement issued today, a spokesperson for the NA Secretariat said that in the letter, the chief whip of the opposition had been asked to provide a written clarification regarding the status of the cases of Ayub and “whether they are pending in any court or not”.
According to the spokesperson, the letter sought the latest updates on the court proceedings against Ayub.
The spokesperson further said that the opposition had informed the NA Secretariat earlier that Ayub’s cases were not pending, but no written confirmation was submitted.
According to the spokesperson, written information is essential to complete the process of nominating the opposition leader.
Therefore, Dogar has been asked to provide the current status of any pending court cases concerning Ayub, the spokesperson said.
The procedure for the appointment of the leader of the opposition of the NA can move forward upon receipt of written confirmation, the spokesperson said, adding that Dogar has been requested to provide the required documents at the earliest.
It should be mentioned that PTI leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser has previously stated that the opposition has provided the necessary documents to Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
For his part, Sadiq has stated that matter of the nomination of the opposition leader in the house is “sub judice”.
Meanwhile, veteran parliamentarians, constitutional experts and parliamentary reporters have almost unanimously demanded that Sadiq and Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani immediately recognise the democratic right of the opposition members by appointing their nominated persons as the opposition leaders in both houses of parliament.</p><small>2025-12-08 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08152303633d949.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959936/public-transport-partially-suspended-in-islamabad-rawalpindi-as-wheel-jam-strike-observed' target='_blank'><strong>Public transport partially suspended in Islamabad, Rawalpindi as wheel-jam strike observed</strong></a><br><p>Operations of public transport in Islamabad and Rawalpindi remained partially suspended on Monday as transporters observed a wheel-jam strike.
The Punjab Public Transport Association had given the call for the strike in the province and the twin cities in protest against a new traffic ordinance that has significantly increased traffic fines. The transporters have demanded the withdrawal of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025.
At the day’s start today, lesser than usual traffic was seen on the roads in the twins cities following the call for the strike. There were also reports of school van owners joining the strike and passengers facing difficulties at main bus stands.
Pirwadhai General Bus Stand, one of the main bus terminals in Rawalpindi, also saw less than usual activity and vehicles for inter-provincial travel were seen lining the bus bays.
While public transport on main roads largely remained suspended, Qingqi rickshaws, small vans and small loading vehicles were operating in Rawalpindi’s commercial areas, including Raja Bazaar, and link roads.
The Goods Transport Association had also joined the strike, but Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi claimed while speaking to Dawn that goods-carrying vehicles remained operational on Monday “despite threats from associations”.
The official said the government “will facilitate the vehicles that will remain on roads”.
On the other hand, there were reports of the supply of food and essential items getting affected due to the suspension of goods transport at Grand Trunk Road — a major north-south artery that traverses the country.
Earlier, transporters’ bodies had held a meeting with the representatives of traffic police and the Regional Transport Authority, where the administration officials had urged the transporters not to hold the wheel-jam strike in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
However, the transporters had refused their request, saying that they would observe the strike to press the government to accept their demand.
Speaking to Dawn today, Muttahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairperson Raja Muhammad Riaz said that negotiations had been held in Lahore between the two sides but, “the government is not interested in resolving the matter and attempted to divide the [transporters’] association”.</p><small>2025-12-08 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08144752af668c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959933/javelin-star-arshad-nadeem-rouses-crowd-wins-gold-at-national-games' target='_blank'><strong>Javelin star Arshad Nadeem rouses crowd, wins gold at National Games</strong></a><br><p>Arshad Nadeem was the man of the hour on Monday morning when he allowed the audience to be part of history as they witnessed him launch his javelin to claim gold at the National Games.
It was not lost on the 28-year-old that the crowd of a few hundred was delighted by his very presence at the PNS Karsaz ground, his throws the cherry on the top as they got to see an Olympic champion in action before their very own eyes.
A robust lineup of track and field events crescendoed with the start of the men’s javelin, headlined by Arshad. A dozen cameramen lined the javelin sector’s periphery to get the perfect shot of Arshad in action as the heat bore down on the synthetic rubber track, the sun climbing higher in the sky to signal the advent of afternoon.
The track reverberated with the soft thud of spikes and echoes of the commentators’ effusive praise for Pakistan’s sporting hero ahead of his first throw of 78.74m that, unsurprisingly, guaranteed him the lead.
“Yeh din Arshad ka hai (this day belongs to Arshad) because he’s the Olympic record holder, and we’re honoured to have him here,” the commentators said.
Praise and appreciation were meted out in equal measure for Yasir Sultan, silver medallist at the Islamic Solidarity Games last month and the closest athlete to potentially challenge Arshad for first place.
“Make videos, take photos, keep a digital memory of this moment — that Arshad Nadeem was here to compete and you witnessed greatness with your own eyes!” the commentator’s voice boomed through the speakers.
The injury-prone athlete was speculated to throw just once, but a sense of disappointment and a thirst for satisfaction was written on his face after two throws in the late 70s.
He wanted to breach the 80m mark — hardly a feat for him when his personal best stands at 92.97m — and he willed it into existence with his third and final throw of 81.81m as he pumped his fists in the air and a smile spread across his face.
Yasir’s lone throw of 70m was enough to secure silver and give Wapda a top-two podium finish as he avoided aggravating an injury, while Army’s Abrar Ali won bronze with a 67.68m throw.
Finishing in sixth place was Arshad’s younger brother Aleem, not quite the replica of the family jewel but perhaps a work in progress to reach that level of sporting excellence.
Arshad’s coach Salman Butt was giving him advice in between throws before pivoting back to Arshad with technical advice and motivation.
Arshad was showered with well-wishes and selfies and handshakes from the end of the event till the medal ceremony.
The international superstar looked just as pleased with the local stardom he radiates everywhere he goes, his very presence at an event marking it as historic.
“If this event were happening in any other South Asian country, people would be leaning out the windows to get a glimpse of his throw,” one of the commentators said.
“We’re thankful that the Olympic record holder is here competing among the younger players and inspiring the next generation. This day will be remembered for ages to come.”</p><small>2025-12-08 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08135205a1c3200.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959918/indonesian-president-subianto-arrives-in-islamabad-on-2-day-maiden-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesian President Subianto arrives in Islamabad on 2-day maiden visit</strong></a><br><p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto arrived in Islamabad on Monday on a two-day official visit at the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
According to state broadcaster PTV News, the Indonesian president was received by PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari upon his arrival at the Nur Khan airbase.







Earlier, state-run Radio Pakistan reported that Subianto will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising key ministers and senior officials.
Yesterday, the Foreign Office (FO) said the Indonesian leader would be in Pakistan from December 8-9 to discuss a “wide-ranging agenda” with Pakistani leaders aimed at strengthening bilateral ties and “exploring new avenues of cooperation”.
According to the FO, this is the president’s first visit to Pakistan, as the last presidential visit was by ex-president Joko Widodo in 2018.
The FO also said that the visit carried added significance as it coincided with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
The statement said that during his stay, President Prabowo will hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz and meet President Asif Ali Zardari. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on Prabowo, it added.
Talks are expected to cover advancing bilateral cooperation in “trade, investment, defence, health, IT, climate, education and culture, as well as enhancing collaboration at regional and global levels”. The statement also said that several memoranda of understanding are expected to be signed during the visit.
Pakistan and Indonesia maintain strong bilateral relations rooted in shared religion and culture, with both countries cooperating in trade, education, and health.
In July, Indonesia’s Defence Minister Lt Gen (retired) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin met with Shehbaz in Islamabad, where he expressed his country’s desire to boost defence ties with Pakistan and explore areas for possible collaboration, particularly in defence production.
In June, the two countries decided to increase cooperation in areas such as vaccine production in Pakistan, the establishment of medical institutions in Indonesia, pharmaceutical development and human resource exchange.</p><small>2025-12-08 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08142038c3d37e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959564/urdus-battle-between-naskh-and-nastaleeq' target='_blank'><strong>URDU’S BATTLE BETWEEN NASKH AND NASTALEEQ</strong></a><br><p>Forty-five years ago, on December 6, 1980, Dr Ishtiaq Hussain Qureishi — then chairman of the National Language Authority (now the National Language Promotion Department) — announced the creation of a computerised Nastaleeq font for Urdu publication. Although it took another year to complete, revolutionising the Urdu publishing industry, this initiative was a crucial link in the centuries-long effort to create a Nastaleeq typeface that would soothe the eyes of Urdu readers.
THE HISTORY OF NASKH AND NASTALEEQ
Nastaleeq, developed in 14th century Iran from the fusion of Naskh and Taleeq, emerged primarily as a Persian calligraphic hand — celebrated for its graceful, hanging rhythm and flowing curves. Designed to express the aesthetic elegance of Persian poetry rather than textual efficiency, it slopes diagonally and relies on rounded, overlapping ligatures that enhance beauty but hinder mechanical regularity.
In contrast, one of the earliest Arabic scripts, rooted in the eighth century CE (second century AH), Naskh, with its balanced geometry, clear proportions and uniform line structure, offers superior readability and accuracy, making it the standard script for the Quran, technical and scholarly writings, and printed books. As explained by the art historian Sheila Blair her book Islamic Calligraphy, while Naskh served functional clarity, Nastaleeq embodied artistic refinement and calligraphic sophistication.
That’s why, even within the manuscript tradition, Nastaleeq, primarily a calligraphic style used for poetry, was not the preferred script for scholarly or technical writing — scholars consistently used Naskh for their treatises, commentaries and personal notes since the 8th century CE. Even today, in Iran, the birthplace of Nastaleeq, it remains mainly an artistic hand, while Naskh is employed for most printed materials, such as books, periodicals and newspapers.

What typeface should Urdu be printed in? The two most popular typefaces, Naskh and Nastaleeq, have competed across empires, technologies and political eras for social acceptance, culminating in a typographic legacy that still shapes how millions read Urdu today. But why did Pakistan adopt the Nastaleeq font for Urdu when Arabic and Persian chose Naskh?

In the Ottoman Empire, and later the Arab world too, Naskh has always been the typographic standard. Only in the Indian Subcontinent did Nastaleeq evolve into the standard script for general Urdu publication. As Blair demonstrates, in 16th century India, Nastaleeq was still used primarily for Persian poetry, art and imperial documents, whereas Naskh dominated in scholarly and technical writings.
Over time, however, Nastaleeq became integral to the visual identity of Urdu, symbolising its literary elegance and elite aesthetic, limiting Naskh to specific religious usage, such as for the Holy Quran and other Arabic religious literature. Since the earliest Urdu writings were primarily poetic — scholarly prose developed much later — readers already associated Urdu with the Nastaleeq form.

Colonial printing and linguistic policies further reinforced this distinct visual identity, separating Urdu typographically from both Arabic and Persian traditions. Yet, Nastaleeq’s very beauty and fluidity would later pose the greatest challenge. This challenge emerged with the establishment of the modern printing press in India, resulting in the Urdu publishing industry spending almost two centuries attempting to create a suitable Nastaleeq typeface.
Quoted by the London-based typographic academic Borna Izadpanah in his research paper ‘Simplifying Urdu’, according to a 1963 bulletin by The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), “Urdu is probably the only important language in the world which still fights shy of type-printing.”
The emergence of the modern printing press in the 14th century replaced the handwritten manuscript tradition with mass-produced printed books. Not only did it provide an easier, more efficient way to mass-produce books, but it also significantly impacted culture, politics and education, ushering in a new intellectual era in human history.
In the East, specifically in Arabic, Persian and related languages, this technology was yet to be accepted. In the West, it became the primary method of publication. Even the first attempts to publish Arabic books were made there in the 16th century, starting with Kitab Salat as-Sawai — an Arabic Christian devotional work on prescribed daily prayers and supplications, traditionally recited at specific hours of the day and night, which was commissioned by Pope Julius II and printed in 1514 in Fano or Venice.

In the mid-20th century, Naskh typefaces were widely used in academic and governmental presses. In Pakistan, Naskh became the preferred style for official and scholarly publications. Early editions of the Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Urdu Lughat [Dictionary], and several other major works were printed in Naskh, valued for its clarity and precision. The Urdu press became a vital arena where the transition from handwritten Nastaleeq to mechanical Naskh type was tested and popularised.

The Holy Quran was the second complete Arabic book to be published in movable type press, titled Alcoranus Arabice. It was printed in Venice by Paganino Paganini and his son in 1537-38. In May 2017, I travelled to Venice to study the only known copy of this edition, which survived its complete disposal before distribution. There’s a very interesting story behind this edition and its destruction. Due to the publisher’s ignorance of Arabic and lack of expertise in Arabic script and diacritics, this edition was completely unreadable, and the excessive number of errors led to the disposal of the printed copies.

Some sources state that Ottoman or Church authorities confiscated the copies and destroyed all printed copies. But after studying the mentioned copy, it was evident to me that the errors and mistakes were the main reason behind this decision. This edition not only raised many apologetic concerns about this new technology within religious circles but also demonstrated that much more effort is required to produce a suitable typographic design for Arabic. Eventually, in the 17th century, a Naskh-based typography was designed for Arabic publication in Europe.
Developed and refined over time, this typeface was designed with readability and accuracy in mind, while preserving the distinctive characteristics of the Naskh. The letters, dots, diacritics and punctuation were clear, and the whole text printed in this type was very easy to read. It was used for a long time in various publications, including the Quran.
Parallel to the movable-type press, lithography printing technology was being widely used for Arabic, Persian and Urdu publications. This was a flat-surface printing method that used chemically treated stone or metal plates to transfer handwritten text or hand-drawn images on to paper. Although this was a quite easy and economical publication method, it required the books and text to be handwritten by scribes, making it time-consuming and slow.
COLONIALISM, INDIA AND FONTS
In the 18th century, India was becoming an important centre for printing and publishing. The East India Company (EIC) also established a modern printing press in Calcutta, known as the Honourable Company Press, to meet its publishing needs.
This significant press made Calcutta a major hub of printing and the book trade. According to Majid Jalise, a specialist in Persianate book and print culture, in September 1770, Warren Hastings, the governor of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal), appointed the orientalist, translator and typographer Charles Wilkins as supervisor of the press.
During his service at the press, Wilkins developed the first Sanskrit and Nastaleeq typeface. This was the first successful attempt to develop a practical Nastaleeq type for modern printing. A volume of Persian and Arabic Works of Sa’dee (1795) printed by him in the Company’s press resides in my library. Its typeface beautifully illustrates the calligraphic nature of Nastaleeq, yet still falls short of fully capturing the script.
Jalise writes, “His Nastaleeq typeface was a success at the time, gaining popularity not only in India but also in Britain.” It was the first time that Nastaleeq met the composing desk of the modern printing press. His efforts made Nastaleeq so popular that, even in Egypt,Ottoman governor Muhammad Ali Pasha commissioned a Persian calligrapher to create a Nastaleeq typeface for the Bulaq press (the Bulaq/Amiri press is a very important and old printing press in Egypt, established by Muhammad Ali Pasha) — thus, the second, short-lived Nastaleeq typeface was created there.

Initially used for Persian, Wilkins’ typeface was employed to print Urdu for the first time in A Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language (1796). Akhlaq-i-Hindi (1803) was the first complete Urdu book published with this typeface. However, Wilkins found it challenging and impractical for publications, and it was soon replaced by a Naskh type. The second edition of Akhlaq-i-Hindi (1868) was published in Naskh type at the same press. Although other printing presses in India used this Nastaleeq type for their publications, the Company’s press didn’t use it for long.
In the 19th century, Nawab Ghaziuddin Haider, King of Awadh, established a movable-type printing press in Lucknow that also used a Naskh typeface. A major investment was made, and large volumes of Haft Qulzum, a Persian dictionary by the Nawab himself, were printed in this press. However, it failed to gain popularity. Consequently, not only did they discontinue using this technology, but they also printed the remaining volumes in lithographic Nastaleeq.
Likewise, Naskh was employed at Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s press, but his press also later switched to lithography. Different volumes of Haft Qulzum and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s works are preserved in my grandfather’s collection, and I personally find the Naskh versions more appealing, easier to read and more admirable.
Major practical efforts were made in the 20th century to create a Nastaleeq typeface for Urdu, beginning with Abul Kalam Azad’s al-Hilal. This weekly journal was initially published with a Turkish Naskh typeface modified for Urdu but, according to the journal itself, it failed to capture readers’ interest. This journal then employed a hybrid printing style, printing some pages in Naskh typeface and others in Nastaleeq lithography.

However, Azad was eager to promote Urdu in modern printing solutions. On the front page of al-Hilal, an announcement was published for five consecutive months starting from August 5, 1927, titled, “Is type printing suitable for Urdu publication? We have to decide now.” This announcement stated that no language can progress without modern printing solutions. As an example, it referred to Arabic, Persian and Turkish, mentioning that the special Urdu typeface used in al-Hilal was the most suitable and advanced typeface designed for this language.
Azad asked a very crucial question: “If this type [Naskh] is suitable for Arabic, Persian and Turkish, why is it not suitable for Urdu?” He also requested that the readers send their opinions to the journal’s office. Readers’ feedback was published weekly, which ultimately demonstrated the popularity of the hybrid Naskh and lithography-based Nastaleeq publication. Notably, the Nastaleeq type received the lowest votes. According to the professor, scholar, writer and poet Dr. Tariq Aziz, in his book Urdu Rasm ul Khat Aur Type, the results of this survey demonstrated that readers were becoming accustomed to reading Urdu in Naskh typeface.
The most extensive efforts to create a Nastaleeq font for Urdu were carried out in Hyderabad Deccan. In the 1890s, the manager of the Government Press (Matba’a-i-Sarkar-i-‘Aliyah) decided to create a new typography from scratch, under the supervision of a master calligrapher who could design an accurate and correct typeface. A detailed report presented in 1895 describes all the technical issues involved.


Nawab Ghaziuddin Haider’s Haft Qulzum, printed at the Royal Press, Lucknow in 1822 | Murtazavi Library, Karachi

The primary challenge in creating a Nastaleeq type was the specific ligatures, which necessitated the design of 472 metal type pieces for individual letters and each unique connection. Naturally, having such a large number of types was impractical, and arranging them was an impossible task for a composer. This font couldn’t even pass the trial phase. But the efforts didn’t end here.
Mir Osman Ali Khan, after ascending to the throne of Hyderabad Deccan, reinitiated the project.
Rooh-i-Japan (1927) by Sir Ross Masood — who was, at that time, employed by the Hyderabad state — was published with the newly designed Nastaleeq typeface, but it ultimately ended with an official statement: “The government regrets that the Nastaleeq typeface has not proven to be commercially viable.” It officially brought the project in the Deccan to an end.
However, in the following years, several Naskh-based fonts were designed in Hyderabad. Tariq Aziz has provided a detailed study of these fonts in his book.
PAKISTAN BUCKS THE TREND
With the spread of movable-type printing across the Subcontinent, Naskh gained popularity because its upright, regular form was better suited to mechanical typesetting than the cursive, overlapping Nastaleeq script. Lithographic and, later, offset printing, however, continued to reproduce handwritten Nastaleeq, preserving its dominance in Urdu literary publishing. In the mid-20th century, Naskh typefaces were widely used in academic and governmental presses.
In Pakistan, Naskh became the preferred style for official and scholarly publications. Early editions of the Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Urdu Lughat [Dictionary], and several other major works were printed in Naskh, valued for its clarity and precision. The Urdu press became a vital arena where the transition from handwritten Nastaleeq to mechanical Naskh type was tested and popularised.
Dawn Urdu (which began soon after Independence, but only ran for a few years) was the first newspaper in Pakistan to experiment with Naskh, but readers remained attached to Nastaleeq. In 1959, the Nawa-i-Waqt group again tested public preference by printing parts of its newspaper in Naskh. The results were unexpected: most respondents favoured Naskh. However, surprisingly, Nastaleeq dominates the publishing industry, despite at least two major public surveys indicating that readers prefer the Naskh over Nastaleeq.
According to a detailed report published in the Sind Quarterly (1982, No. 1), in 1964, the Naskh Committee was appointed by Gen Ayub Khan, then president of Pakistan, to introduce Naskh script for Urdu. The report notes the president’s argument that adopting the Naskh script for Urdu writing and printing would advance Pakistan’s progress and national solidarity, spare children the burden of learning an extra script and — since Naskh is used across the Arab world, Iran, South Asia, Indonesia and Malaya — strengthen Pakistan’s brotherly ties with all Muslim countries.

But S. Ghulam Mustafa Shah, editor of the Sind Quarterly and former federal minister of education, highlighted the ongoing Naskh-Nastaleeq conflict, writing, “Hundreds and thousands of rupees were spent on the work of this committee and on preparation to introduce Naskh script for Urdu. Where all that has gone, nobody knows. Intrigues have destroyed Urdu and its status as a national language. Urdu has to be the property of the people of Pakistan and not of those whose mother tongue is Urdu, if it is to grow to the status of national language.”
In this, he’s referring to the replacement of Naskh by the Nastaleeq font under the partial patronage of the government, ignoring the practicality of Naskh and the efforts and finances invested in the adoption of it as a standard font for Urdu.
By the late 20th century, printing technology had advanced, and computers were now being used for composing. It was the right time to accomplish the centuries-long dream of a Nastaleeq typeface. Ahmed Mirza Jameel and Matlubul Hassan Syed, well-known Pakistani publishers, decided to combine the latest technology with the ancient art of calligraphy to create a computerised font that could preserve the beauty and precision of Nastaleeq.
After extensive research, they visited Monotype International in London, which had already been producing Naskh metal types for Urdu. With the company’s technical expertise and the designing and the calligraphic work of these two pioneers, after 16 years of continuous work, a Nastaleeq font was successfully developed and named Noori Nastaleeq — after Mirza’s father, the celebrated calligrapher Mirza Noor Ahmed. This was in 1981.
The system used over 20,000 precisely designed and handwritten ligatures, an unprecedented technical feat that allowed the font to reproduce the fluid, diagonal composition of handwritten Nastaleeq for the first time in printing history.
This monumental achievement marked the conclusion of a journey that had begun in the mid-18th century and was celebrated as a milestone in the history of Urdu printing. The writer and poet Aqeel Abbas Jafri, in his article in the Pakistan Chronicle in December 1980, mentions Dr Qureishi’s announcement of the creation of the Noori Nastaleeq font. He adds that the Government of Pakistan supported this project by waiving the import duty on the first machines.
Syed Muhammad Ali Anjum, owner of Izhar Sons Lahore and a senior publisher, informed me that the government at the time issued directives to print schoolbooks using this new font. According to him, the first book published with this font was the newly introduced subject Mutaleya-i-Pakistan’s textbook at his father’s press. Jang Lahore became the first newspaper to adopt Noori Nastaleeq, followed soon by others, allowing the font to dominate the Urdu publishing industry in a remarkably short period.
The project not only overcame the long-standing technical challenges of Nastaleeq — its overlapping ligatures, variable baselines and complex kerning — but also bridged the gap between art and technology. In 1995, through an agreement between Concept Software Pvt Ltd and Monotype International, the font was incorporated into the Windows-based program InPage, making Nastaleeq accessible to a wider audience.
Entering the 21st century, with rapid technological advancements, the Nastaleeq font has continued to evolve through numerous enhancements and refinements. Today, multiple digital versions of Nastaleeq are available across all major platforms. However, it is crucial to confront the dilemma of prioritising visual elegance over readability, especially in light of the needs of the modern era and the expectations of future generations.
Thus, the question raised by Azad, Gen Ayub, Ghulam Mustafa Shah and many others remains relevant and unresolved: “If Naskh is suitable for Arabic, Persian and Turkish, why is it not suitable for Urdu?”

Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief of the Air Staff of Pakistan Air Force Zaheer Ahmad Babar were also present at the ceremony.
According to state-broadcaster PTV, the army chief was presented with the guard of honour by contingents from all three armed forces, in recognition of his elevation to the position of CDF.







On Friday, the army chief was notified as the country’s first CDF, in what is considered the most sweeping restructuring of the military command since the 1970s.
The new arrangement consolidates operational, administrative and strategic authority in a single office established through amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment.
The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, shall appoint the chief of the army staff, who will concurrently serve as the chief of defence forces.
The amendment also abolished the office of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), dismantling the tri-service coordination system in place since 1976 and transferring joint command integration to the CDF.
To translate the constitutional overhaul into the military’s legal framework, the government amended the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) of 1952 in the wake of the 27th Amendment.
Sub-section (i) of PAA’s Article 8A now states that “for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces […], the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
It explains that upon the issuance of the notification for the first COAS-plus-CDF, the “existing tenure of the incumbent chief of the army staff shall be deemed to have recommenced from the date of such notification”.
Under sub-section (iii) of Article 8A, the “terms and conditions” of the COAS concurrently with the CDF shall be determined by the president on the prime minister’s advice.
Field Marshal Munir was appointed army chief on Nov 29, 2022, becoming the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government brought changes to the PAA, extending the tenure for all three services chiefs from three to five years, keeping the CJCSC’s tenure unchanged at three years. The same amendments allowed the services chiefs to be reappointed and/or their tenures to be extended for up to five years, instead of up to three years.
Therefore, in line with the restructuring under the 27th Amendment, the recent PAA changes allow the president, on the prime minister’s advice, to reappoint the COAS-plus-CDF for another five years, or extend his tenure by up to five years, creating legal space for him to retain his position till December 2035.</p><small>2025-12-08 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638077-indonesian-president-subianto-arrives-in-islamabad-on-two-day-maiden-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesian President Subianto arrives in Islamabad on two-day maiden visit</strong></a><br><p>

More than two million people — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected by the disaster caused by Cyclone Ditwah, the worst on the island this century.
Sri Lanka is expecting further heavy monsoon rains on Monday, topping 50 millimetres in many places, including the worst-affected central region, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said. It has also issued warnings of further landslides.
The DMC has confirmed 627 deaths, with another 190 people unaccounted for since November 27, when intense rains brought on by Cyclone Ditwah triggered landslides and floods.
The disaster management agency warned residents to “take adequate precautions to minimise damage caused by temporary localised strong winds and lightning during thundershowers”.
Army chief Lasantha Rodrigo said 38,500 security personnel had been deployed to boost recovery and clean-up operations in flood-affected and landslide-hit areas, nearly doubling the inital deployment.
“Since the disaster, security forces have been able to rescue 31,116 people who were in distress,” Rodrigo said in a pre-recorded statement.
Army spokesman Waruna Gamage said additional troops were deployed as the rescue efforts turned into a recovery operation.
“We have almost doubled the deployment as we are now engaged in rebuilding roads, bridges and also helping with the clean-up of drinking water wells contaminated with floodwaters,” Gamage told AFP.
The tea-growing central region was the hardest hit, with 471 deaths reported, according to official data.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who has described the disaster as the most challenging faced by any Sri Lankan government, last week visited affected areas to monitor relief operations.
He also unveiled a recovery package offering 10 million rupees ($33,000) for victims to buy land in safer areas and rebuild.
The government will also offer livelihood support and cash assistance to replace kitchen utensils and bedding and to buy food.
It is not yet clear how much the relief package will cost the government, which is still emerging from its worst economic meltdown in 2022, when it ran out of foreign exchange to finance even the most essential imports.
Dissanayake has said the government cannot fund the reconstruction costs alone and has appealed for foreign assistance, including from the International Monetary Fund.
More than 75,000 homes have been damaged in the disaster, including nearly 5,000 that were completely destroyed. A senior official earlier estimated recovery and reconstruction costs could reach US$7 billion.</p><small>2025-12-08 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638068-cdf-field-marshal-asim-munir-receives-guard-of-honour-at-ghq' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's response will be ‘more severe' next time, CDF warns India at GHQ ceremony</strong></a><br><p>

In remarks aired on the media, he also accused the opposition party of repeatedly criticising the army and its leadership for its own political gains.
Referring to arguments by the PTI that the army should not interfere in politics, Chaudhry said, “The army is not intervening in politics. You, in order to further your own politics or to come into power by riding on someone else’s shoulders, repeatedly try to drag the army and its head into politics.
“You direct unjustified and unnecessary criticism [at them]. You level allegations without any reason,” he said.
He said the army had been serving the country and recalled that it defeated a “big power in the world” recently — an apparent reference to the conflict between Pakistan and India in May.
The state minister further said that the army took pride in its martyrs, victories and in protecting Pakistan, “and you criticise it and its head for no reason”.
“For how long will the institution remain silent? Eventually, it had to respond. The PTI pushed them to respond,” he added.
“The army and its head showed patience and overlooked [the criticism] for a very long time. But every other day, the PTI founder in his tweets and messages, and others in press conferences after meeting Imran, would make unjustified accusations and criticise.”
The state minister also alleged that the PTI never criticised India’s aggression or condemned terrorists.
“Having a soft spot for those terrorists […] and directing all criticism toward Pakistan’s institutions, Pakistan’s army and its head, warrants an answer,” he asserted.“How long can it be ignored, how long can it be overlooked?”
He further stated that the government had invited the PTI to Parliament for talks multiple times. “But we are now embarrassed to have invited these types of people for talks, those who are not worthy of it.”
Chaudhry went on to allege that Imran “came into power by riding on someone else’s shoulders”. He further said that after that only a “mentally ill patient” would consider himself a “know-it-all” and “necessary” for the country. He further alleged that Imran had come into power in 2018 with the support of the military establishment.
“And since no one is supporting you today, you are levelling criticism in an effort to blackmail the army […] so that you can compel them into supporting your rise to power again,” Chaudhry alleged.
The state minister also questioned the PTI’s performance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the last 13 years.
“Why will the people vote for you? Why will they bring you into power again? Those who couldn’t win the by-election in Haripur, how will they succeed in polls in Lahore, Faisalabad or the rest of Pakistan?
“It is because of this that you are taking out your anger and criticising one institution and its head. This will not be tolerated now,” Chaudhry added.
The state minister warned that those raising their voice against Pakistan, its institutions and their heads would now be silenced.
“Come put on a show outside Adiala (jail), and you will be told how the law is implemented,” he said, seemingly referring to PTI’s protests outside the prison for Imran’s visitation rights.
“It cannot be that you disturb peace […], speak the language of our enemy after meeting [with Imran at the jail], and it is all tolerated.”
He further warned that in case such a scene was created outside Adiala jail, “the prisoners in the jail would have to be shifted to a place where they can stay safe”.
The minister also alleged that the KP chief minister was changed in October because the previous one, Ali Amin Gandapur, had refused to obey Imran’s directives.
He also alleged that the new CM and the KP government were being used for efforts for a “jailbreak and riots” so that Imran could “escape his punishment”.
“This will not happen now. KP’s resources will be used for KP,” he said. He further said that a Peshawar High Court order, as well as the law and Constitution, stated that “you cannot use your resources for your politics”.
He ended his talk with a warning that the response to the PTI would now match the party’s actions. “And it is clear now that nothing that will be a source of anarchy in Pakistan will be tolerated. It will not be tolerated that unjustified criticism is directed toward institutions.”
The minister’s censure is the latest in a string of admonishments directed toward the PTI from the country’s politicians, who have been rallying behind the armed forces after a fiery press conference by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaurdhry on December 5.
The press conference, where the army spokesperson assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, followed the former prime minister’s latest outburst against the military leadership, delivered last week through his sister Uzma Khan during a jail visit after weeks of restricted access.</p><small>2025-12-08 08:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08125119e93bc45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959926/punjab-ctd-says-12-suspected-terrorists-linked-to-raw-arrested-in-operations-in-lahore-faisalabad-and-bahawalpur' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CTD says 12 suspected terrorists ‘linked to RAW’ arrested in operations in Lahore, Faisalabad and Bahawalpur</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday said it had arrested 12 suspected terrorists allegedly working for the Indian intelligence agency Research Analysis Wing (RAW) in intelligence-based operations conducted in Lahore, Faisalabad, and Bahawalpur.
According to a statement issued by the CTD spokesperson, the arrests were made in collaboration with sensitive agencies. He said security personnel recovered photos, videos, weapons, and explosives from the suspects, preventing large-scale terrorism activities in the aforementioned cities.
He said the recovered material reportedly also included images and video recordings of sensitive locations, including a religious seminary.
He said the terrorists were planning to incite “fear and religious hatred” in the province and had plans to target “places of worship and other important sites”.
The CTD spokesperson said suspects identified as Sukhdeep Singh, Azmat, Faizan, Nabil, Abrar, Usman, and Sarfaraz were arrested in Lahore. Another suspect, Danish, was arrested in Faisalabad, while four others — identified as Rajab, Hashim, Saqib, and Arif — were arrested in Bahawalpur.
He said that arrests came after the CTD investigated a Facebook account allegedly being operated from India to coordinate terrorist activities.
All of these terrorists were being funded by the Indian agency RAW, the CTD spokesperson said.
“Seven improvised explosive devices, two detonators, 102 feet of safety fuse wire, explosives, weapons, mobile phones, and cash were recovered from the possession of the terrorists,” he added.
“Cases have been registered against the terrorists and further investigation is underway,” he said.
The CTD regularly carries out operations across Pakistan to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence.
In August, Sindh’s CTD had found the involvement of RAW in the target killing of a man in Badin district and arrested six suspects in the case, who were allegedly funded by RAW.
In June, four suspected Indian agents were arrested in a raid carried out in Karachi’s Quaidabad area.</p><small>2025-12-08 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/081023499dc43a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959916/thailand-launches-air-strikes-at-cambodia-as-border-tensions-reignite' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand launches air strikes at Cambodia as border tensions reignite</strong></a><br><p>Thailand has launched air strikes along its disputed border with Cambodia, the Thai military said on Monday, after both countries accused the other of breaching a ceasefire agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump.
At least one Thai soldier has been killed and four wounded in the fresh clashes that broke out around two areas in the easternmost province of Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand’s military said in a statement, after its troops came under Cambodian fire.
“The Thai side has now begun using aircraft to strike military targets in several areas,” the statement said.

 

Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a statement that the Thai military had launched dawn attacks on its forces at two locations, following days of provocative actions, and added that Cambodian troops had not retaliated.
Thailand’s army said Cambodia’s military had fired BM-21 rockets towards Thai civilian areas, adding there were no reports of casualties.
Meanwhile, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim urged Thailand and Cambodia to exercise restraint, warning the fighting risked undoing the careful work that went into a ceasefire he helped to broker.
“We urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint, maintain open channels of communication and make full use of the mechanisms in place,” Anwar, the chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, said in a post on X.







Ceasefire breakdown
The border dispute had erupted into a five-day conflict in July, before a ceasefire deal brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Trump, who also witnessed the signing of an expanded peace agreement between the two countries in Kuala Lumpur in October.
At least 48 people were killed and an estimated 300,000 temporarily displaced during the July clashes, with the neighbours exchanging rockets and heavy artillery fire.
Following a landmine blast last month that maimed one of its soldiers, Thailand said it was halting the implementation of the ceasefire pact with Cambodia.
Cambodia’s influential former longtime leader Hun Sen, father of current premier Hun Manet, said Thailand’s military were “aggressors” seeking to provoke a retaliatory response and urged Cambodian forces to exercise restraint.
“The red line for responding has already been set. I urge commanders at all levels to educate all officers and soldiers accordingly,” Hun Sen said on Facebook, without elaborating.
In Thailand, more than 385,000 civilians across four border districts are being evacuated, with over 35,000 already housed in temporary shelters, the Thai military said.
Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817km land border, first mapped in 1907 by France when it ruled Cambodia as a colony.
Simmering tension has occasionally exploded into skirmishes, such as a weeklong artillery exchange in 2011, despite attempts to peacefully resolve overlapping claims.</p><small>2025-12-08 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08115833c215623.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959925/how-thailand-cambodia-conflict-went-from-trump-backed-ceasefire-to-airstrikes' target='_blank'><strong>How Thailand-Cambodia conflict went from Trump-backed ceasefire to airstrikes</strong></a><br><p>Thailand said it had launched air strikes along its disputed border with Cambodia on Monday, after both countries accused the other of breaching a ceasefire agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump.
Here are key moments in the border conflict.
May 28, 2025: Cambodia’s defence ministry says one of its soldiers is killed after a brief exchange of gunfire with Thai soldiers at a disputed border area, the first such deadly clash since 2011.
July 23: Thailand recalls its ambassador to Cambodia and says it will expel Cambodia’s ambassador, following a landmine incident that injured a Thai soldier along the disputed border.
July 24: Armed clashes erupt along the border. Both sides accuse the other of opening fire first. Thailand deploys F-16 jets, one of which bombs a Cambodian military target.
July 25: Fighting intensifies and spreads with heavy artillery fire and rocket attacks across multiple frontlines, marking their worst clashes in more than a decade. Fighting in the days that follow kills at least 48 people — mostly civilians — and an estimated 300,000 residents are displaced.
July 26: Trump calls leaders of both countries and says both agreed to meet soon to work out a ceasefire, adding their respective talks with Washington on trade tariffs could resume once a truce is in place.
July 28: After efforts by Malaysia, the United States and also China to bring both sides to the table, the two countries’ leaders sign an agreement in Malaysia’s Putrajaya to end hostilities, resume direct communications and create a mechanism to implement the ceasefire.
October 26: The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia sign an enhanced ceasefire deal in the presence of Trump, whose intervention in their fierce border conflict earned him a Nobel Peace Prize nomination from Cambodia. The agreement builds on the truce signed three months earlier.
November 1: As part of the agreement, both countries say they have begun the phased withdrawal of heavy weapons from the disputed border, starting with rocket systems, and conducting de-mining operations. Cambodia says it expects the withdrawal to be fully completed by end of the year.
November 11: Thailand says it is halting implementation of the ceasefire pact with Cambodia a day after a landmine blast maimed a Thai soldier. Cambodia’s defence ministry denies having laid new landmines.
November 12: At least one person is killed in Cambodia as the neighbours accused each other of opening fire.
December 8: Thailand launches air strikes after it said its troops came under Cambodian fire. Both countries accuse the other of breaching the ceasefire agreement and Thai authorities say hundreds of thousands of civilians are being evacuated.</p><small>2025-12-08 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638036-12-suspected-terrorists-linked-to-indian-spy-agency-raw-arrested-in-punjab-raids-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>12 suspected terrorists linked to Indian spy agency RAW arrested in Punjab raids: CTD</strong></a><br><p>

“Deeply saddened by the Goa fire tragedy in which 25 people lost their lives yesterday, including four Nepali nationals,” Nepal’s ambassador Shankar P. Sharma said in a statement.
“My heart goes out to the bereaved families, and I pray for the speedy recovery of those injured,” he said.
The rest of the dead were Indian citizens, mainly the nightclub’s staff, as well as holidaymakers from New Delhi.
The blaze broke out at a club in Arpora in the north of the coastal state, with officials reporting that “electrical firecrackers” had sparked the blaze.
Most people died due to suffocation in the basement and kitchen area after wooden parts of the club caught fire.
Goa’s Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Sunday said that four people had been arrested, and had ordered checks on other nightclubs in the former Portuguese colony.
Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.</p><small>2025-12-08 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/081020003a73b54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959919/case-registered-under-terror-charges-after-participants-of-sindh-culture-day-rally-clash-with-police-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Case registered under terror charges after participants of Sindh Culture Day rally clash with police in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>A first information report (FIR) has been registered under terrorism charges after one of the many rallies taken out in Karachi to mark Sindh Culture Day on Sunday turned violent, it emerged on Monday.
Police on Sunday resorted to tear gas shelling to prevent participants of the rally from moving towards the Red Zone via Sharea Faisal and detained 45 people, 12 of whom were later released. According to the  police, participants of the rally attacked personnel, who then responded with baton-charging and tear gas shelling.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, a case has now been registered against 12 named individuals arrested at the scene and “300-400” unidentified individuals.
The case has been registered under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 324 (attempted murder), 186 (obstructing public servants), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
The complainant, Inspector Abdul Majeed Abro, said that he and other police personnel were present near the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover on Sharae Faisal at 2:30pm on Sunday when a rally, consisting of around 300-400 people on motorcycles and cars, appeared from the direction of the airport, heading toward Saddar.
“Keeping in view the ban on gatherings due to the imposition of Section 144 in the province, police personnel attempted to stop the participants of the rally,” he said.
However, the participants of the rally blocked the main thoroughfare on both sides and began pelting police with stones while also opening fire, he said.
He further said that the participants of the rally also damaged cars that were passing by, including a rescue ambulance and a police mobile, adding that they were also shouting “anti-state” slogans.
“Subsequently, police personnel, with the help of officers present on the scene, fired tear gas at the participants to prevent them from damaging property,” he said.
Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar had taken strict notice of Sunday’s incident and ordered immediate action against those involved.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Sunday that law enforcers had asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”.
“They allegedly pelted stones at the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he had said, adding that this prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them.
When asked why the law enforcers had blocked the road at the FTC flyover, the DIG had said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the cultural day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intended to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal.
He had said that around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached Fawara Chowk/KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants.</p><small>2025-12-08 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08092626950453d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959873/indias-new-normal-doctrine-destabilises-nuclear-south-asia-ciss' target='_blank'><strong>India’s ‘new normal’ doctrine destabilises nuclear South Asia: CISS</strong></a><br><p>• Think tank says the narrative attempts to justify unilateral strikes• Terms Western belief in India as a counter to China flawed
ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad-based think tank on Sunday warned that India’s “new normal” military doctrine is a destabilising force in nuclear-armed South Asia, saying New Delhi’s posture risks triggering a serious escalation in any future crisis.
The assessment from the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) came during a dialogue with Australian scholars and officials, the research institute said in a media statement.
Delegates from CISS argued that India’s narrative of a “New Normal” aims to normalise escalatory actions and justify unilateral military strikes under the guise of counterterrorism.
The security doctrine, central to India’s policy since 2019 and reasserted this year, signals a shift toward conventional military responses such as Operation Sindoor to alleged cross-border attacks, the think tank said.
The approach indicates India will not be constrained by Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent, a stance that directly challenges the region’s long-standing nuclear balance, according to the CISS assessment.
Risk of miscalculation
“Institutionalising assured military retaliation in a nuclearised region is inherently destabilising,” the CISS mentioned. The think tank argued that by leveraging its conventional military advantage for limited war strategies, New Delhi raises the risk of miscalculation.
Pakistani scholars at the dialogue questioned India’s logic of blaming Pakistan for every violent incident while facing more than two dozen separatist and insurgent movements on its own territory. Using such claims as a pretext for military strikes undermines crisis stability, they maintained.
The delegation said Pakistan’s true new normal “Full Spectrum Deterrence” continues to restrain India. They noted that Pakistan wou­ld be prepared to deliver a “Quid Pro Quo Plus” response to any future Indian military action, as it did during a confrontation in May 2025.
CISS also contended that Western support for India’s military modernisation is based on a flawed assumption that New Delhi will serve mainly as a counterweight to China. The think tank argued India’s enh­anced capabilities remain largely directed toward Pakistan.
Australian experts, in turn, outli­ned their country’s rationale for joi­ning alliances like AUKUS and the Quad.
The Australian delegation stressed that AUKUS is a trilateral partnership and there are no plans for expansion. While policy debates occasionally reference possible future members such as Norway, South Korea, Can­ada or India, they said such prospects remain limited. They also emphasised that the alliance adheres to nonproliferation standards fully aligned with IAEA safeguards.
Participants included Justin Burke of the Australian National Uni­versity’s National Security Col­lege; Mike Hughes of the Aust­r­alian Strategic Policy Institute; officials from the Australian High Com­m­i­ssion in Islamabad; and CISS Exe­cutive Director Ali Sarwar Naqvi.

ISLAMABAD: The government is wor­king on large, utility-scale Battery Ene­rgy Storage Systems (BESS) to ensure stability of the national grid, which is currently facing challenges such as frequency fluctuations caused by the induction of intermittent renewable energy sources faster than planned targets.
“The government … is pursuing the development of large-scale battery energy storage systems through private-sector investments to address the intermittency of variable renewable energy, optimise grid demand management, and enhance overall system stability,” Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari told the National Assembly in a written statement on Friday.
In response to a series of questions from various MNAs, the minister also confir­med that the government was gradually moving away from Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) as part of its policy to reduce reliance on imported fuels amid higher capacity contracts, increasing induction of indi­genous renewables, and stagnant demand.
Clean energy share
The minister said the clean energy share in the country had reached 46 per cent by September 2025 against the government’s 40pc capacity target for 2025.
He added that the government had set ambitious targets under its various power policies to increase the share of on-grid renewable energy capacity to 40pc by 2025 and 60pc by 2030.
Currently, 60 private-sector renewable energy projects with a cumulative capacity of 4,753MW are operational, including 680MW of solar, 1,937MW of run-of-river hydropower, 1,845MW of wind, and 291MW of bagasse cogeneration.
Alongside 9,619MW of public-sector hydropower and 100MW of solar in K-Electric’s system, renewables account for more than 37pc of the generation mix.
“Net-metering-based solar photovoltaic [PV] has further added 6,390MW as of September 2025, raising the clean energy share to approximately 46pc, thereby surpassing the government’s 40pc renewable energy capacity target for 2025,” the minister said.
In parallel, the minister said the government had finalised an initial quantum of 800MW for the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market framework to provide market access to renewable ene­rgy producers and enable large consumers to enter into direct supply contracts with producers of their choice, subject to a wheeling charge of about Rs13 per unit.
Mr Leghari emphasised that the availability of reliable, efficient, eco-friendly, and affordable electricity was crucial for sustainable economic growth. “There­fore, the government is prioritising the effective use of renewable and indigenous energy sources through its national policies aimed at diversifying the energy mix by promoting clean and renewable sources such as wind, solar, hydropower, and bagasse,” he added.
LNG reliance
Discussing LNG diversion, the minister reported that dependence on imported fuel plants had comparatively reduced in recent years, and priority was being given to the utilisation of local energy resources, including Thar coal, solar, wind, bagasse, and hydropower, to minimise reliance on imported fuels.
He conceded that dependence on imported LNG had comparatively dec­reased in recent years. “This policy shift is primarily aimed at promoting ind­igenous and renewable energy resources and ensuring least-cost dispatch in the overall generation mix,” he added.
He continued that the government was actively promoting the adoption of solar energy technology at the consumer level across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.
He said the net-metering regulations provided a framework for integrating solar and wind generation systems of up to 1MW capacity, enabling consumers to offset their electricity consumption and contribute to the national grid. This included certification of service providers and installers of solar and wind systems to ensure safe, secure, and quality-assured deployment of products, installation, and maintenance.
To another question, the minister also testified to parliament that load management was being carried out across the distribution system on the basis of average technical and commercial (ATC) losses, and no loadshedding was carried out due to generation shortfall.

According to sources close to the ruling family, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Punjab Chief Min­ister Maryam Nawaz and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif had a detailed discussion on the current political situation.
During the meeting, which lasted more than two hours, they reviewed the PTI’s likely strategy in the coming days and how the federal and Punjab governments could respond effectively.
The conversation also touched upon Imran Khan’s status within his party and whether the PTI leadership would continue relying on guidance from its incarcerated founder, or distance itself from him following the establishment’s strongest-ever reaction against the former prime minister.
Sources said the Sharifs also examined the establishment’s perspective on various political and economic measures being undertaken by the PML-N governments.
They added that Maryam Nawaz briefed her father and uncle on the recently prepared performance review of the Punjab cabinet, highlighting key shortcomings identified in the audit.
According to the sou­rces, the chief minister also expressed her intention to reshuffle her cabinet and induct new ministers to improve the government’s overall functioning.

Speaking at a press conference, PESS President retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum said the misleading campaign, fuelled by internal political elements and external forces, posed a direct threat to national security, unity, and institutional stability.
Gen Qayyum said that after suffering a humiliating defeat in the four-day war, India declared that Operation Sindoor would continue. “Today, India is pursuing this operation through a hybrid warfare, orchestrating terrorist attacks from Afghan soil”, he remarked.
He said Pakistan was currently in a state of undeclared war, where attacks on security forces were being carried out by terrorists guided by Indian agencies, with the tacit approval of the Afghan Taliban government.

Demand stern action against those involved in crimes against national security

The PESS president praised the bravery, professionalism, and sacrifices of Pakistan Army officers and soldiers, who he said were thwarting every terrorist attack with full force.
Lt Gen Qayyum noted that the enemy’s second major tactic was propaganda warfare, largely targeting the armed forces, particularly CDF, on social media. He deplored that some political elements in Pakistan, along with their external backers, were using this campaign for political motives, an act he termed highly condemnable.
Referring to a recent statement by the DG ISPR, Gen Qayyum said certain PTI leaders and their “rogue elements” at home and abroad were deliberately amplifying India’s propaganda.
“PESS strongly condemns this trend and demands strict action against all elements involved in crimes against national security”, he asserted.
Underlining the need for complete national unity, Gen Qayyum appealed to the nation to adhere to Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s golden principles of faith, unity, and discipline. He said political leadership, media, state institutions, and the public must rise above personal and group interests to protect Pakistan’s long-term security interests.
The PESS president welcomed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer to Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov to use Pakistani ports. He said Pakistan was ready to open trade routes for all Central Asian states, with a population of about 80 million, provided the Afghan Taliban fully disarm and dismantle terrorist groups.
He also expressed concern over Russia’s plan to increase trade with India from $68 billion to $100bn.
He said that while trade was a bilateral matter, supplying SU-57 stealth fighter jets or additional S-400 mobile surface-to-air missile systems to India would heighten security risks for Pakistan and other regional countries, as it would strengthen India’s ambitions for regional dominance.
PESS also welcomed the review of the NFC Award and said the burden of defence requirements, debt servicing, development plans, and the impacts of climate change should be fairly shared by all provinces.

In their separate message on the 40th anniversary of Saarc Charter Day falling on Monday, they said that Pakistan is committed to a cooperative, inclusive and forward-looking regional order that can unlock South Asia’s vast potential and ensure a better tomorrow for all.
President Zardari said that Pakistan is ready to work with all willing states in South Asia to promote trade, transit, energy linkages and people-to-people relations that benefit the entire region.
“Pakistan remains committed to a cooperative, inclusive and forward-looking regional order. Our geography places us at the meeting point of South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. We are ready to work with all willing states to promote trade, transit, energy linkages and people-to-people ties that benefit the entire region,” the President said.

PM Shehbaz says Islamabad firmly committed to principles, objectives of Saarc Charter on 40th anniversary

He said: “On this Charter Day, I encourage South Asian nations to approach the future with clarity and sincerity. The region’s challenges are shared and so must be the solutions. With a spirit of respect and practical cooperation, we can shape a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia for our future generations”.
PM Shehbaz’s message
In his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan remained firmly committed to principles and objectives of the Saarc Charter as it believed that genuine cooperation, guided by sovereign equality, mutual respect and constructive engagement, can unlock South Asia’s vast potential and ensure a better tomorrow for all.
He said that in an era of growing regional cooperation, the necessity of economic, digital, and people-to-people connectivity in South Asia could hardly be over emphasised.
“Together, we must work to enhance linkages that facilitate trade, investment, innovation, and cultural exchange in our region,” the prime minister said.
“Our region also faces common challenges such as poverty, climate induced natural disasters, food and energy insecurity and public health issues. These challenges transcend borders and require collective responses based on mutual trust, goodwill, and a spirit of mutual cooperation. It is only by acting together that we can build a resilient and inclusive future for our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said.

Temperatures during this period also remained 0.9°C above the average.
The Met Office’s dro­ught advisory (pre-alert) stated that from May to November, western and southwestern Balo­chistan witnessed a decline in rainfall, along with a rise in the num­ber of consecutive dry days.
Forecasts indicate rainfall in the affected regions below normal till February 2026, while temperatures higher than usual, thus aggr­avating drought conditions in Quetta, Chagai, Gwadar, Kech, Kharan, Mastung, Nushki, Pishin, Panjgur, Qilla Abdullah and Washuk. However, the Met Office also expects partial relief due to a weather system that may bring rainfall to some areas later this month.

Rehman was arrested in August at Lahore Airport by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling and betting applications through his platform. He was granted bail in the case by the Lahore High Court on November 25, but was not released from official custody.
Meanwhile, in September, NCCIA Lahore Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry was removed from his post, reportedly over different controversies, including allegedly beating Rehman.
In the video uploaded on Sunday, Rehman outlined the timeline of events from his arrest and being remanded into the NCCIA’s custody. He described meeting Chaudhry, alleging that he was verbally and physically abusive.
“He stood up from his chair and verbally abused me,” Rehman alleged. “He asked me, ’Where does your money come from?’ I replied that it comes from YouTube. I have eight million subscribers. He accused me of corrupting the minds of children.
“He kept verbally abusing me and slapped me so much I lost count.”



Rehman further alleged that officials tried to bribe him, offering to resolve the issue for Rs70-80 million, which he said he did not have.
“When I was in NCCIA custody, you probably heard about $326,000 during a podcast with the assistant director. He said that they seized this money from me … the investigating officer (IO) ordered me to open my Binance account,” Rehman alleged.
“He closed all my trades and tokens at a loss and converted them to US dollars. He then ordered me to transfer it.”
The YouTuber further accused the IO of transferring the sum to his own personal account.
Rehman said that he felt “very helpless” during the first day of custody, further alleging that he was beaten by authorities despite cooperating with the investigation.
He added that when he met with someone he knew, he asked them to request that the guards “beat him less”.
An NCCIA Lahore spokesperson responded to Dawn’s request for comment on the allegations, replying that it is individuals who engage in corrupt practices, not institutions.
“The NCCIA maintains an uncompromising zero-tolerance policy toward any form of corrupt conduct by its officials,” the spokesperson said.
“All proceedings in this matter are being pursued strictly on merit and in full accordance with due process, and an investigation is already underway with FIA Anti-Corruption,“ he added.
On October 28, six NCCIA personnel were arrested and remanded on allegations of misusing their authority and taking bribes.
Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq told Dawn the six were “taken into FIA custody and arrested on charges of misuse of authority and bribery” and would be produced in district court, where he would represent them.
Ashfaq said the six staffers were Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, In-charge Zawar, Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Yasir Gujjar and Mujtaba Kamran.
The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered against nine people, including eight NCCIA personnel, with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Rehman’s wife, Aroob Jatoi.</p><small>2025-12-08 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08071700f2279c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959875/bulk-of-nab-recoveries-in-form-of-assets-land' target='_blank'><strong>Bulk of NAB recoveries in form of assets, land</strong></a><br><p>• Anti-graft body claims to have retrieved Rs9tr since 2023• Instead of clipping its wings, changes to NAB law expanded scope of its work, says chairman
ISLAMABAD: Claims by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) of recovering almost Rs9 trillion in just two years (2023–25) may seem unbelievable, but the data reveals that most of the anti-graft watchdog’s recoveries are not in cash.
Instead, they consist of non-monetary assets such as land and properties belonging to various state institutions that had been illegally occupied by individuals and groups.
After the ouster of the PTI-led federal government in April 2022, the PML-N-led coalition amended the National Acc­o­untability Ordinance 1999 so that NAB could only take up cases involving Rs500 million or more.
These new laws, which seemingly curtailed its powers, actually ended up expanding the anti-graft body’s scope and led to remarkable recoveries, according to its chief.
“Since passage of the legislation, everybody assumed NAB had become redundant. but in fact, it was a blessing in disguise as we approached many government institutions, offering them help in recovering their illegally occupied land worth trillions,” NAB Chairman retired Lt Gen Nazir Ahmed Butt said in a recent media briefing.
“This has made NAB’s job more demanding but also more useful for the state and its institutions,” he added.
This was the maiden formal media interaction for Lt Gen Butt, who took charge in March 2023.
Comparing his performance with NAB’s past record, he recalled that from its creation in 1999 to March 2023, the bureau recovered $3.15 billion. However, the two-and-a-half-years that he has been in charge, he said the bureau had recovered a staggering of $29.99bn.
These include cash recoveries of Rs1.124tr (roughly $4bn), with the rest coming in the form of assets.
In his remarks, the chairman said that over the past 26 years, the government provided Rs62bn to NAB, while the bureau had recovered Rs9tr, making its performance unmatched by any anti-corruption agency in the world.
New measures
According to NAB documents seen by Dawn, the 2022 reforms made affidavits and undertakings from complainants a mandatory process, and the term “accused” was replaced with “defendant”.
The bureau also developed a mechanism for handling cardinal consideration-complaints against parliamentarians, government officials and businessmen.
In addition, Accountability Fac­ilitation Cells were set up in Nat­ional and provincial assemblies, the Establishment Division and the offices of chief secretaries.
“We don’t approach any lawmaker or businessman directly, but through their respective speaker and chamber of commerce,” the chairman said.
He said this approach had restored bureaucrats’ confidence, as many had earlier stopped signing important files.
Under its new strategy, NAB has been now focusing on recovering several categories of state land, including misappropriated, underutilised, illegally possessed and hidden land, as well as land not registered with revenue authorities.
Meanwhile, the bureau has geared up its efforts to curb money laundering, trace illegal foreign assets, freeze bank accounts and properties, make immediate arrests and ensure swift recovery of crime proceeds.

ISLAMABAD: The government’s expenditure on civil administration and pension payouts has continually climbed over the last five years, with the first quarter of the current fiscal year seeing a double-digit increase despite a strict official austerity policy and an aggressive downsizing exercise.
Fiscal data released by the Ministry of Finance indicates a 13pc increase in ‘Running of the Civil Government’ expenditure in the first quarter, which runs from July to September. The costs rose to Rs161.2bn in the current fiscal year, compared to Rs142.5bn during the same period last year.
This rise in expenses comes as the government claims to be tightening its belt through significant staffing and structural reforms.
The increase is notable as the government abolished more than 150,000 posts last year and has been “rightsizing” various ministries, divisions and their subordinate departments through mergers and closures.
Additionally, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb anno­unced about a week ago that the government had abolished an additional 54,000 vacant posts across various departments, resulting in an annual saving of more than Rs56bn to the exchequer.
He added that the process of merging and restructuring several ministries and divisions was also underway as part of fiscal reforms.
The trend of rising costs is not new. Civil government expenses in the first quarter of last year saw an 8pc increase compared to the same period of FY24, which itself had posted a 29pc surge over FY23.
The data showed that the running of civil government expenses has jumped by almost 80pc since the first quarter of FY22 when the expenditure amounted to Rs89.5bn. The full-year bill for running the civil government had crossed Rs892bn.
Similarly, pension expenditures continue to climb. In the first quarter of the current year, pension payments amounted to Rs249.5bn, a 10pc increase over the Rs223bn spent in the comparable period of FY25.
A year earlier, pension payments had witnessed a 9pc increase. Over the past five years, pension expenditure has surged by almost 125pc, up from the Rs111bn reported for the first quarter of FY22. The total pension bill at the conclusion of the last fiscal year reached Rs911bn.
In contrast to the rigid and monthly due expenses of pensions and civil administration, the official data showed large var­iations in subsidy payments, which the government can postpone. These payments saw a six-time surge in the first quarter of the current year, reaching Rs120bn compared to Rs20bn last year.
The government had disbursed only Rs2.5bn for subsidies in the first quarter of FY24, while payments in the preceding two years were Rs93bn and Rs74bn, respectively. The subsidy bill last year reached Rs1.298 trillion.
On paper, the government has adhered to an austerity policy across all sectors since 2021, driven by stringent fiscal oversight mandated by successive IMF programmes.
In June, the government ann­ounced the continuation of austerity measures for FY26, which included a complete ban on the purchase of all types of vehicles, the procurement of machinery and equipment, and the creation of new posts throughout the federal government.
However, various ministries, divisions and entities kept on fi­n­d­ing ways to bypass such banks on one pretext or another.

Netanyahu, speaking to reporters alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Jerusalem, said that he would hold important discussions with US President Donald Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the plan’s second phase was achieved.
The prime minister’s office in November said that Trump had invited Netanyahu to the White House “in the near future”, although a date for the visit has not yet been made public.
Netanyahu said that he would discuss with Trump how to bring an end to Hamas rule in Gaza. Israel and Hamas entered a ceasefire two months ago, but Israel has continued its bombardment of Gaza, killing Palestinians, as the death toll in the besieged enclave reached over 72,300 as of November 19, 2o25. Gaza’s health ministry says 373 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire started. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed by Hamas.
Earlier today, Israel’s army killed seven Palestinians in northern Gaza, including a 70-year-old woman and her son. Attacks also wounded a child in Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera. Tel Aviv also alleges that Hamas has been violating the ceasefire.
Netanyahu said that it was important to ensure Hamas not only upholds the ceasefire but also follows through on “their commitment” to the plan to disarm and for Gaza to be demilitarised.
Israel retained control of 53 per cent of Gaza under the first phase of Trump’s plan, which involved the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel. The final hostage remains to be handed over are those of an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023, fighting Hamas.
Phase 2 must come out now: German chancellor
According to the plan, Israel is to pull back further in the second phase as a transitional authority is established in Gaza and a multinational security force is deployed, Hamas is disarmed, and reconstruction begins.
A multinational coordination centre has been established in Israel, but there are no deadlines in the plan and officials involved say that efforts to advance it have stalled.
“What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,” Netanyahu said, describing them as central issues.
Merz said that Germany was willing to help rebuild Gaza but would wait for Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump, and for clarity on what Washington was prepared to do, before Berlin decides what it would contribute, but that phase two “must come now”.
West Bank annexation remains subject of discussion: Netanyahu
Netanyahu said that he would also discuss with Trump “opportunities for peace”, an apparent reference to US efforts for Israel to establish formal ties with Arab and Muslim states.
“We believe there’s a path to advance a broader peace with the Arab states, and a path also to establish a workable peace with our Palestinian neighbours,” Netanyahu said, asserting Israel would always insist on security control of the West Bank.
Trump has said he promised Muslim leaders that Israel would not annex the occupied West Bank, where Netanyahu’s government is backing the development of Jewish settlements.
The “question of political annexation” of the West Bank remains a subject of discussion, Netanyahu said.</p><small>2025-12-07 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0718360742a870d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959752/45-arrested-as-citizens-clash-with-police-during-sindh-culture-day-rally' target='_blank'><strong>45 arrested as citizens clash with police during Sindh Culture Day rally</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police arrested 45 people participating in the Sindh Culture Day rally on Sunday, after people allegedly pelted police personnel with stones.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that upon being attacked by participants, police responded with a baton charge and tear gas shelling.
“We detained 45 people on Sharea Faisal,” DIG Raza said. “The South SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) is at the scene, and the situation is under control.”
The DIG said that since the Red Zone has been closed, alternative traffic routes are being provided for citizens and commuters.
He added that the law enforcers asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the main Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”.
“They allegedly pelted stones on the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he said, adding that it prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them.
According to police sources, participants at the rally were arguing with police over being stopped and that dispute escalated into stone-throwing.



Asked as to why the law enforcers blocked the road at the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover, DIG Raza said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the Cultural Day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intend to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal.
“In view of certain past untoward incidents, the law enforcers were asked to ensure that no participant was allowed to move beyond FTC under any circumstances, as the area ahead leads into the Red Zone, which contains sensitive installations.
“Thus, the police and rangers were deployed at the FTC bridge to enforce the diversion and prevent any unauthorised movement.”
Later, the DIG said that 12 of the 45 arrested were released on the surety of the Karachi Bar Association president.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took strict notice of the incident on Sharea Faisal and ordered immediate action against those involved, according to a statement from his office.
In a phone call with the additional inspector general, Lanjar ordered, “Those damaging police vehicles and citizens’ property should be arrested immediately.”







Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh.



Raza recalled that in 2023, during Sindh Cultural Day celebrations, there were violent confrontations between law enforcers and protesters in which a first information report was also registered.
Similarly, last year, Raza said a police van was damaged, and police personnel were manhandled, while some of the protestors managed to cross into the Red Zone and reached the KPC via Jinnah Bridge.
“Around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached the Fawara Chowk and KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants,” he said.

Their goldrush on Sunday was spearheaded by utter dominance in taekwondo and sharp shooting on the ranges.
The clearest demonstration of authority came in the taekwondo Poomsae events, where Army fighters ruled the roost, clinching eight gold medals across age categories.
Their women set the tone: Sana Sabir (Under-50), Naila (U-30), Mehar-Un-Nisa (U-40) and Zeena Sheraz (Under-20)  all stood atop the podium. The men followed suit with Adil Hussain (U-30), Mohammad Mumtaz (U-40), Irshad Ali (U-50) and Syed Zohaib (U-20) securing their own golds.
On the shooting ranges, Army and Navy engaged in a high-class duel, sharing three gold medals apiece.
Navy swept the 10m air pistol events, with Rabia Kabir (232.2) edging Army’s Rimsha Nadeem (231.6) for individual glory before teaming with Rasam Gul and Hadia Liaquat for team gold.
Army struck back in the 25m rapid fire pistol through Mohammad Shabbir while Navy’s G. M. Bashir, Maqbool Hussain and Abdul Quddus took the team title.
Army also claimed both skeet Olympic titles, with Imam Haroon (score 49) leading the charge.
Sindh’s first gold
The day’s most dramatic narrative unfolded away from the established powers, as the Sindh women’s netball team rose above a feisty, fractious final to secure a domineering 20-12 victory over favourites Wapda, claiming a statement gold — a first for the contingent.
It was a triumph of provincial grit over a departmental side with year-round training access.
“That makes this even better,” Sindh skipper Quratulain told Dawn. Team-mate Huma echoed the hunger for more support: “We’ll go a long way if we get that opportunity.”
The match itself descended into chaos. After Sindh seized a 13-9 half-time lead, the stifling heat seemed to boil over.
A third-quarter collision escalated into a shoving match. In the final quarter, a Wapda player made an expletive gesture, inciting the crowd. Sindh held their nerve, but sportsmanship evaporated at the final buzzer.
Handshakes were skipped, and an hour later, a sullen Wapda and bronze-winning Army drowned out Sindh’s celebrations with chants of “losers, losers!”
“The girls need their own court,” said Sindh coach Humaira Huma, a pioneer of Pakistan’s first national team. “Today was just a month’s practice. Imagine what they could do.”
In stark contrast, the men’s final was a pure sporting contest, with Army staging a last-gasp comeback to clinch gold 27-26 against Navy.
Hosts overwhelmed
On the basketball court, Army’s men showcased their systemic power, overcoming a raucous home crowd to dismantle Sindh 97-62.
Sindh started strong, leading 6-4 early. “We started brilliantly, but I guess that’s where we spent most of our energy,” Sindh’s leader Ans Azhar told Dawn.
Army’s towering 7’3“ center, Taglub Ammar, proved unsolvable. “We took the competition lightly initially,” Taglub conceded. Once settled, Army took control, leading 15-12 at halftime and stretching it to 20 by the final quarter.
Top-scorer Shiraz Aslam revelled in the atmosphere: “This is what we play for… The crowd made the match very exciting.”
Sindh’s physicality cost them nearly 20 points from free throws.
“We were very physical… you play to win,” said Ans, who vowed improvement: “We will beat those professional sides.”
In women’s basketball, the powerhouses marched on.
Army delivered a merciless 56-6 rout of Balochistan while Wapda, led by Kainat Zafar, powered past Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 66-24.
“We were trying to conserve energy and avoid injuries,” said Kainat, highlighting Wapda’s key advantage. “This chemistry is the advantage we have over provincial teams.”
Crushing win
Other sports saw their opening salvos. In a staggering display, Wapda’s women’s hockey team crushed Balochistan 18-0, with ten players on the scoresheet.
On the badminton courts, stars like Mahoor Shahzad (Wapda) and Palwasha Bashir (Sindh) led their teams comfortably into the semi-finals.
Army and Punjab also ensured progress with dominant wins.
Murad Ali (KP), Pakistan’s number one, led his team into the last-four in the men’s section as his side beat Railways to advance in the semis.
Army and Police also confirmed their berths in the next round.
The fencing mat witnessed a historic gold for the Higher Education Commission (HEC), delivered by Abdul Mussawir, who dashed Balochistan’s title hopes in the final.
Other sports that kicked off on Sunday included, rugby, volleyball, baseball, softball and table tennis.
Action continues across Karachi on Monday, with Army’s golden machine looking to build on a formidable lead, and provincial sides like Sindh aiming to channel their fighting spirit into more podium finishes.</p><small>2025-12-07 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0722580207891a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959760/transporters-press-ahead-with-wheel-jam-strike-in-islamabad-rawalpindi-tomorrow-despite-administrations-appeal' target='_blank'><strong>Transporters press ahead with wheel-jam strike in Islamabad, Rawalpindi tomorrow despite administration’s appeal</strong></a><br><p>Local public transporters on Sunday announced a wheel-jam strike for tomorrow (December 8) in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, rejecting the local administration’s request to delay the protest against the new traffic ordinance, which has raised fines for heavy vehicles.
The strike was announced on the call of the Punjab Public Transport Association. Before the announcement, representatives of the association, along with the Goods Transporters Association, met City Traffic Police officer Farhan Aslam and Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi. The administration urged transporters not to observe a wheel-jam strike in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
However, local transporters refused to withdraw their decision, insisting they would go ahead with the strike to pressure the provincial government into repealing the ordinance.
“We tried to convince the transporters not to go for a wheel-jam strike, but they demanded to abolish the new amendments, and it was beyond our authority to do anything about it,” Shirazi said.
He added that the Punjab government had been informed of the demands of the transporters, and it would hold negotiations with the United Transport Association in Lahore.
Mutahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairman Raja Muhammad Riaz told Dawn that “transporters were facing problems due to heavy fines, and it was difficult to manage their household budgets.”
“Heavy fines from Rs5,000 to Rs20,000 had become routine, and it destroyed their business,” Riaz said, adding that the government was trying to recover its financial burdens from transporters, who were already struggling with fuel and spare parts.
He demanded an immediate reduction in fines and an end to policies that “destroyed the sector.”
During the meeting, he said that the traffic police agreed not to impose fines on vehicles having a fitness certificate.
Meanwhile, the President of the Goods Transport Association, Shakeel Qureshi, said that freight vehicles and goods transporters in Rawalpindi would support the wheel-jam strike on Monday.
“We will join them in the decision of the Pakistan United Transporters Committee to strike on December 8,” he said, adding that the Rawalpindi transporters will keep their bases completely closed.
“We strongly condemn the traffic laws passed by the Punjab Assembly and the rate of fines,” he said. “Amendments to the customs laws that will be made are tantamount to economic murder of transporters.”
Qureshi went on to say that the government should take the time to be conscious and make decisions, keeping in mind the interests of the people. “It should not be that decisions are made by listening to one side and making laws without consulting stakeholders,” he said.
On the other hand, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) Rawalpindi district has announced its full support for the December 8 strike of the Transport Action Committee against heavy traffic fines.
Spokesperson JUI Rawalpindi Hafiz Ziaullah said that heavy fines imposed by the Punjab government have made life difficult for the people of Rawalpindi, especially the poor motorcyclists.
He demanded that the Chief Minister of Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, “adopt a people-friendly policy and reduce the unnecessary and unfair burden of fines.”</p><small>2025-12-07 17:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07222639a82bbc8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959758/un-calls-on-taliban-to-lift-ban-on-afghan-women-in-its-offices' target='_blank'><strong>UN calls on Taliban to lift ban on Afghan women in its offices</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations called on the Taliban authorities on Sunday to lift its ban on Afghan women working in its offices, saying the restriction puts “life-saving services” at risk.
Since the Taliban regained power in 2021, Afghan women have been barred from doing most jobs, visiting parks and beauty salons, and attending school beyond the age of 12.
In September, the Taliban authorities began prohibiting women staff members from entering UN offices.
“We call for the ban on Afghan women staff and contractors from entering United Nations premises to be reversed, and for their safe access to offices and the field,” Susan Ferguson, the special representative of the UN’s women’s agency in Afghanistan, said in a statement.
“The longer these restrictions remain in place, the greater the risk to these life-saving services,” Ferguson said, adding that they violated the UN’s principles of human rights and equality.
The statement did not say how many staff were affected, but UN sources indicated that several hundred women were facing the ban.
Staff have been working remotely for the past three months, notably assisting the victims of deadly earthquakes and Afghan migrants deported from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, Ferguson said.
Describing their work as “indispensable”, she said: “Only through their presence can we reach women and girls safely and provide culturally appropriate assistance.”
The Taliban authorities did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.
In September, the UN’s refugee agency suspended cash aid to returned Afghan migrants, citing the impossibility of interviewing and collecting information on more than 50 per cent of returnees who were women.</p><small>2025-12-07 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637954-not-our-fault-kp-cm-rejects-blame-over-security-lapses-urges-policy-reform' target='_blank'><strong>'Not our fault': KP CM rejects blame over security lapses, urges policy reform</strong></a><br><p>
