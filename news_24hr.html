The top judge observed that the conference, initiated in 1970, provided the court with an opportunity to reflect on its performance. He said that after assuming the CJP’s office in October 2024, he felt the need for reforms, which were categorised based on “five principles”.
“We prioritised service delivery through technology, transparency in cases, and legal framework,” the CJP said. Noting that the apex court had eight sections, CJP Afridi said each section prioritised speedy justice.
Highlighting the meetings held to discuss the SC’s reform plan, the top judge said digital case-filing and case-tracking were among the measures raised.
“Everyone speaks of technology and artificial intelligence,” Justice Afridi said, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
“Cases will be fixed using artificial intelligence,” he announced. However, he cautioned, the judiciary was “not yet ready” to utilise AI. The usage of AI would be initiated once the digital scanning project is completed, according to the CJP.

Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former National Party senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.

Traders, transporters, and businesses pledge support to opposition alliance

Leaders of six opposition parties — Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aain-i-Pakistan, Awami National Party (ANP), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and National Party — strongly condemned the tragic incident in a meeting and announced a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike throughout the province.
They declared that during the strike highways, intercity roads, and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked. Other airports in the province would also be shut, with no air travel allowed.
 
 

Opposition leaders and their supporters also distributed pamphlets about the strike among traders, business centres, hotels, and the general public. They urged the business community and transporters to support the strike.
Trader organisations and transporters had already expressed their support for the strike call. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, also announced closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing.
Though the government has not announced the closure of its educational institutions today, the Private Schools Association declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.

The 22-year-old Alcaraz won 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to capture his second US Open crown and sixth Grand Slam title, avenging his lone defeat in a major final by Sinner at Wimbledon in July.
“It’s a great feeling. I’m working really hard just to lift this trophy. It’s my second one but it’s still a dream come true,” said Alcaraz.
Alcaraz will reclaim the world number one ranking from Sinner, returning to top spot on Monday for the first time since September 2023 after ending the Italian’s 27-match winning run at hard-court Grand Slams.
 


“It was one of the first goals that I had, to recover the number one (ranking),” said Alcaraz, who also defeated Sinner in an epic French Open final in June.
Alcaraz has now won seven of the past eight meetings and is 10-5 overall against Sinner.
“I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more,” said Sinner. “I felt like he was doing everything slightly better today.
“He raised his level when he had to … He played better than me today.”
Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the last eight Grand Slams on offer, winning four apiece to assert their superiority over the rest of the sport, including Novak Djokovic.
But while Sinner is 109-4 against the rest of the tour over the past two seasons, Alcaraz has had his number.
“It’s going to be on me if I want to make changes or not,” said Sinner. “That’s what I have to do, trying to become a better tennis player.”
 


Sinner’s defeat at Flushing Meadows extends the longest drought without a successful men’s title defence of any Grand Slam in the Open era.
No man has retained the US Open crown since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004 to 2008.
Anticipation for the third straight Grand Slam final between the game’s top two players assumed an even greater dimension with the presence of Trump.
It was the latest in a series of visits to major sporting events for the US leader after his trip to the NFL’s Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.
 


He appeared before the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, waving to the crowd, which greeted him with a mix of cheers and boos. He was given a frostier reception later in the match though, when shown again on the stadium’s big screens.
A constellation of showbiz and sports icons turned out as well on Sunday, with rock star Bruce Springsteen, fashion icon Tommy Hilfiger, actor Michael Douglas and basketball superstar Stephen Curry all on hand.
 






Start delayed by Trump visit
The start of the final was pushed back 30 minutes to allow fans additional time to enter Arthur Ashe Stadium as a result of tighter security measures in effect due to Trump’s attendance.
Even then, the 23,000-capacity venue was no more than three-quarters full when Alcaraz broke Sinner in the opening game of the match.
As he did in the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz pinned Sinner on the back foot early and broke a second time for a 5-2 lead before serving out to love.
With hundreds of spectators still waiting to get in at the start of the second set, Alcaraz sought to hammer home his advantage against Sinner.
He created a break point but Sinner hung on and stalled Alcaraz’s momentum, belatedly ramping up his game and surging 3-1 ahead as the Spaniard suffered a brief dip on serve.

Sinner levelled the contest at a set apiece but Alcaraz stormed back with another break early in the third, wriggling out of a tight spot on serve with the help of a sensational baseline smash that sliced away from his rival for a 3-0 edge.
He padded his lead with another break and quickly wrapped up the set, keeping his foot down to corner Sinner again to begin the fourth set.
This time Sinner saved two break points but Alcaraz made another charge in the fifth game, delivering the decisive blow for an advantage he never relinquished as the Spaniard became only the fourth man to win multiple majors on hard courts, grass and clay.</p><small>2025-09-08 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/080803035703fb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940394/pakistan-to-have-cancer-registry-national-institutes-of-health-bill-signed' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to have cancer registry; National Institutes of Health bill signed</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a bid to reform the health sector, President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday appro­ved the National Institutes of Health (Reorganisation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to reorganise the institution and also set up a cancer database.
The president also approved the Anti-Dumping Duties Amend­ment Bill 2025 for legal clarity regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on projects funded by Chinese grants.
The National Assembly passed the NIH bill on August 12, 2025. “There is a dire need for establishing the national cancer registry to understand the actual burden of disease, and to implement a nati­onal action plan for cancer prevention, and management strategies to control the growing epidemic,” according to the bill.
“Through this bill, the structure and governance of the National Institute of Health will be made more effective. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the reorganisation of the institution and enhance its performance,” the President Secretariat’s press wing said in a press release. It said that the approval of the bill marked a significant step toward reforms in the health sector and institutional improvement.
The NIH bill said that the centre “shall assure the registration of cancer patients in central repository” to understand the actual burden of disease and to implement a national action plan for its prevention.
It also envisaged management strategies to control the growing epidemic, collect data on the cancer cases and establish a database of the cancer pat­ients.
Through this bill, the government also aimed to encourage awareness at the village and union council level and to work with other governmental and non-governmental agencies whose goal was the eradication of cancer.
It said the center would register the cancer cases under the ‘confirmed cancer cases’, ‘deaths due to cancer’, ‘recoveries from cancer’, ‘hospitalised pendency of cancer’, and cancer demographic information (age, gender, location).
 
 

As per the bill, the personal particulars of a cancer patient would not be disclosed to any unauthorised person without the prior written consent of the patient.
The bill said the cancer cases were rising globally at a remarkable rate. According to the Global Cancer Observatory, the total number of cases in Pakistan was 178,388 in 2020; and these figures were provided by the Punjab Cancer Registry, which represented the population of Lahore and some parts of central Punjab.
“Considering the overall 220 million population, these figures are severe underestimation of the true cancer burden in Pakistan,” the bill added. It said that several atte­mpts at establishing a national cancer registry in the country had failed in the past due to resource limitations.
Anti-dumping duties bill
President Asif Ali Zardari has approved the Anti-Dumping Duties Amendment Bill 2025. “Following his approval, the duties will be effective from July 1, 2020. The bill was sent to the President after (it was) adopted by the National Assembly and (the) Senate,” the President Secretariat’s media wing said.
 
 

It said that the bill was approved to provide legal clarity regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on projects, funded by China.
The decision for this amendment was made during the progress review meeting of the Gwadar projects in October 2022.

While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
“Thunderstorm and rains are expected tomorrow [Monday] in Karachi with possibility of heavy falls,” said PMD’s focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham.
An advisory issued by the PMD stated that a depression over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Guajrat has intensified further into a deep depression. “It is very likely to move westward and entered in southeastern Sindh during the next 24 hours causing widespread rains with strong winds.”
During the day, Karachi experienced overcast and humid conditions, with dense cloud cover persisting throughout. Light rain was also reported in the outskirts of the city.
The maximum temperature in the city was 32.6 degrees Celsius with 75 per cent humidity, increasing the discomfort for residents even before the anticipated downpour.
The Met office has warned that thundershowers with strong gusty winds and scattered “heavy to very heavy falls” are likely in Karachi Division, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Dadu, and Mirpurkhas until September 10.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has called on all institutions to remain fully prepared in view of the heavy rains in Sindh.
He directed provincial, district and municipal authorities to stay on high alert and ensure advance arrangements. He also emphasised the need for close monitoring of water levels in Hub Dam and other reservoirs to safeguard communities.

His livestock grazing at a distance inside the main dyke of the river was his only concern. The main dyke that covers a certain mileage of Hyderabad and Matiari districts is located downstream of Sukkur and the area here provides ample land for crops as well as grazing grounds for cattle. “Pani aaye ga tu dekhey gey (We will worry once the floodwater arrives),” Zubair said smilingly when asked if he had an idea about when floodwaters from the Sukkur barrage would reach the katcha area. He looked somewhat uninterested in talking about the anticipated flood, unlike other members from his community.
At a distance, a separate group of Hajjano men were sitting underneath an acacia tree before returning to their village located across Ghalyan Bund — a 13-mile-long dyke starting from Matiari to the Jamshoro front bund. Acacia trees are a common sight in Sindh’s katcha area on both sides of the river within its two dykes, whose construction began by the British when they started building Sukkur in 1930s.
Unlike Zubair, Sajjad and Zaheer were a bit more cautious, whom I met about 1km beyond the main dyke. Amid all the hullabaloo about super floods, they were making their own assessments about the incoming deluge daily. Their quest to predict the floods was guided by indigenous knowledge.

Unruffled Indus riverine area dwellers rely on indigenous methods to prepare for deluge

“Water gradually rises on a daily basis when floodwaters enter the area,” Sajjad explained. He pointed towards a manmade bank of a drain, called Chandhan, that brings effluent from Matiari located on the left bank of the Indus downstream of Sukkur. The drain’s outfall is inside the riverine area, touching the Ghalyan Bund in the Hyderabad district.
“When flows increased last month, the water had touched this drain’s bund…before it receded, leaving its mark behind,” he recalled, alluding to a brief high flood of 510,798 cusecs in Guddu downstream on Aug 24’s afternoon. The barrage attained a medium flood level of 477,864 cusecs at 6pm the same day.
“I check a certain stone or a piece of wood to see whether it is soaked or drowned. If the surface shows some dried surface, then it means the levels are still lower than expected. The next morning, I repeat the exercise again…” a complacent Zaheer added.
“For our communities, different landmarks serve as determinants of floods’ arrival,” said Chakar Chalgari, an irrigation department employee. Ahmed Ali Chalgari, another resident, agrees with him. “The month of August is a harbinger of floods for us. We do maintain benchmarks inside the area. For instance, I will keep checking some plants like devi — wild vegetation — in the area to have an idea of increasing river flows”.
The Hajjano community lives in the Bodhani village across Ghalyan Bund, feeding off the riverine land. Many of them own small pieces of land for agricultural purposes, while others work as peasants managing the lands of influential landlords. These large tracts of land are, by and large, owned by those having political connections or government backing, and they either have direct land ownership or have occupied massive forestlands. Successive orders by the Sindh High Court a couple of years back led to the retrieval of encroached forest land and entry in revenue record.
Katcha economy
The katcha area — infamous for its bandits — is actually the region’s breadbasket due to its rich soil. Various streams flow from the Indus to water these farmlands, with several protected by private embankments. Landowners build these private bunds, called zamindari bund, around their lands to protect them against floods, but if the Indus has very high or super floods, like in 2010, these are washed away.\
 
 

The riverine area contributes to the country’s food security to a great degree, producing grain and other crops. Kharif crops, like cotton, and winter crops like wheat, pulses, gram and vegetables, are grown here besides the large-scale sugarcane cultivation. A previous visit in 2021 revealed a mindboggling scale of cane cultivation inside the katcha area.
A Board of Revenue document showed that Sindh’s katcha land and river island spanned an area of 977,527 acres (3,697 square kms); 3pc of Sindh’s total land i.e. 34,820,640 acres (140,914 sq kms).
Katcha dwellers pay 50pc of dhal (revenue charges) when compared with their settled area farmers. Abiyana (water charges) are not recoverable from them, as they are not dependent on regular irrigation supplies.
“Output from the katcha area is part of the overall production of grain and other crops in Sindh,” informed Agriculture Extension DG Munir Jumani. He said the recent flooding downstream of Guddu and Sukkur, however, damaged sugarcane, cotton and vegetables.
For the locals, if inundation becomes evident, then they move out with their livestock and wait for the water to recede.
In the 2010 floods, water flows had hit this dyke. In July of that year, officials had not expected floodwaters would inundate gauges — usually installed along every river dyke to record historic flows — at the Ghalyan dyke. This super flood still haunts the dwellers.
Wahid Magsi, who actually hails from Jhalg Magsi, said it was water everywhere, forcing them to settle atop this embankment. These floods proved to be the most destructive for Sindh, displacing millions and washing away hundreds of cattle heads.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Hum­a­n­itarian Affairs reports that during the current monsoon season, 785 lives have been lost; the number is increasing with each passing day. July 2025 saw 82 per cent more rain than July 2024, reports the Pakistan Meteorological Department. In Punjab alone, two million people have felt the season’s impact; and visuals from KP and Sindh are grim to say the least.
Sadly, it will only get worse as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects 26pc faster warming rates till 2050. This means more frequent heatwaves, erratic weather, glacial lake outburst floods and riverine and pluvial floods.
 
 

Pakistan’s challenges are multifold; they include an aging infrastructure, fragmented institutions working in silos, and under-resourced local governments, to name a few. Most urban areas have non-existent storm-water management, often piggybacking on decaying sewerage systems, and leading to compounded fiascos. For the urban poor living in informal settlements on city margins, the situation is even more dire — when downtowns catch a cold, slums catch fever. Every year, the monsoon triggers disasters that result in life-threatening conditions for the less-privileged urbanites in particular.
As a developing country with limited resources, Pakistan must make smart choices to address the aforementioned ills while improving public service delivery too. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can learn from global best practices, leading to customised solutions for our local challenges. Globally, there are two approaches when it comes to dealing with storm-water: get rid of it as soon as possible or treat it as an asset instead of viewing it as a threat. The latter approach is reckoned as more progressive, and cities adopting it are referred to as ‘sponge cities’. A sponge city essentially acts like a sponge: it absorbs water and can release it whenever needed. This property can resolve a problem faced by our cities: deluges and droughts throughout the year.
Sponge cities are based on blue-green infras­t­r­u­c­ture (BGI), comprising a specially designed network of water bodies and green spaces such as urb­an parks, wetlands, bioswales and water plazas.

The BGI model presents Pakistani urban centres with an opportunity to enhance livability.

BGI, unlike single-purpose grey infrastructure (storm-water drains), is multifunctional and provides ecosystem services through urban nature. This climate infrastructure is not buried underground and provides flood mitigation, storm-water management, urban heat island impact reduction, recreational opportunities as well as enhanced biodiversity.
We present Copenhagen’s example and how the city’s climate adaptation model can help Pakistani cities be climate-proofed for the future. Cop­enhagen has made great strides towards climate resilience using BGI over the last decade or so. The city was jolted by a cloudburst event in 2011, sending shockwaves and losing more than $1 billion in damages. Consequently, the city came up with its pioneer Cloudburst Management Plan, 2012.
The plan serves as a blueprint for the city’s climate adaptation and envisages urban nature as its fundamental pivot. The plan provides a robust system consisting of BGI to manage storm-water on the ground in addition to four underground tunnels. The city found out that its limited sewer capacity led to combined sewer outflows during intense downpours.
The Cloudburst Plan responded to this challenge through a unique idea. Relying on hydraulic modelling, experts divided the city into seven catchment areas based on where it would rain and where the city would want its rainwater to go. The surface system comprises more than 350 projects spr­­­ead over seven catchments. Further, each cat­chment area is divided into cloudburst branches comprising various BGI projects in diffe­rent neighbourhoods. These projects are meant to stop storm-water from entering the sewers as the city expects 30pc more than usual rain in the future.
A Copenhagen climate neighbourhood (building block of the system) comprises streets, courty­ards and parks acting as BGI. With a focus on the water in the neighbourhood, these urban spaces are all connected and have a dual function. The system ensures that rain falling in the neighbourh­o­od can flow through the BGI projects. The water, which cannot infiltrate, has an outlet to the next system. Therefore, the idea is not just to drain water quickly, but to slow it down, store it and use it, turning excess water into an urban asset. These functions to retain, detain and convey storm-water are performed by various cloudburst typologies. For example, parks and plazas are designed to ret­ain storm-water from surrounding rooftops. Green roads delay storm-water conveyance and clo­­­udb­urst boulevards ensure its speedy transportation.
 
 

Instead of relying solely on conventional drainage systems, the plan reimagines Copenhagen’s streets, parks and public spaces as dynamic tools for managing storm-water, reducing flood risks, and enhancing urban livability. These BGI projects in Copenhagen are expected to be completed over 30 years, aligning with the city’s broader urban development agenda.
The model presents Pakistani urban centres with an opportunity to enhance urban livability while managing storm-water and urban flooding effectively. It would create synergies amongst government agencies, break management silos as well as provide a systemic approach for cost-effective and integrated sustainable development. Every city with a peculiar water cycle, topography and public participation must chalk out its own unique plan to climate-proof itself through a multifunctional climate infrastructure. This is a crucial moment for Pakistan to propose pragmatic climate-adaptation projects for climate justice funding worldwide. The time to act was yesterday; let’s at least start today. n

The force said 857 people had been arrested under anti-terror laws for supporting a proscribed group during Saturday’s demonstration, with an additional 33 arrested for other offences including assaults on police officers.
“We have a duty to enforce the law without fear or favour. If you advertise that you are intending to commit a crime, we have no option but to respond accordingly,” Deputy Assis­tant Commissioner Claire Smart said in a statement.
The government in July proscribed Palestine Action under the UK’s Terrorism Act, 2000, following several acts of vandalism, including against two planes at a Royal Air Force base, which caused an estimated 7 million pounds in damage.
Critics, including the United Nations, have condemned the ban as legal overreach and a threat to free speech, but ministers insist that people are still able to attend pro-Palestinian marches.
“The contrast between this demonstration and the other protests we policed yesterday, including the Palestine Coalition march attended by around 20,000 people, was stark,” Mr Sm­art added. “You can expr­ess your support for a cause without committing an offence under the Ter­rorism Act or descending into violence and disorder, and many thousands of people do that in London every week.”
An estimated 1,500 took part in the Palestine Action protest outside parliament, with the Met condemning the “intolerable” abuse it claims its officers suffered. Of the 33 people arrested for non-terror offences, 17 were for assaults on police officers, the force said.
The organisers of the protest, the campaign group Defend Our Juries, said the “Lift the Ban” rally had been “the picture of peaceful protest.” Many of those detained for showing support for Palestine Action appeared to be older people.
Most face six months in prison if convicted, but orga­nisers of the rallies could be sentenced to up to 14 years if found guilty.

This has been driven largely by President Donald Trump’s disruptive policies, which have upended global trade by a tariff war and also reordered Washington’s geopolitical priorities. The US president’s aggressive trade policy applied against both allies and adversaries has encouraged them to seek closer ties with each other even as they pursue negotiations with Washington to secure lower levies.
Trump’s coercive approach has pushed China and Russia even closer together. His trade assault on India and imposition of penalties over Indian import of Russian oil has undermined strategic ties built over decades with New Delhi. This has urged India to reach out to China and deepened the thaw in their relations. It is also the principal reason why Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to undertake his first visit to China in seven years to attend the SCO summit.
These developments shaped the environment for the high-profile SCO summit. This was its biggest gathering so far since the Eurasian organisation’s inception in 2001. It was attended by leaders of 10 member states and another 16 observer or dialogue partner countries as well as heads of 10 international organisations. A regional security and economic grouping, SCO represents over 40 per cent of the world’s population and accounts for a quarter of the global economy.
 
 

The summit marked an opportunity for President Xi Jinping to set out an alternative vision for the global order that places emphasis on cooperation in contrast to the confrontation represented by Trump’s policies.
In a volatile international landscape created by Trump’s actions, China offered stability and more responsible and reliable global leadership. It also offered to be a strong voice for the Global South.

The summit convened in the backdrop of Trump’s disruptive actions that accelerated geopolitical trends.

The summit was important for its symbolism, messages to the world, especially the US, display of Global South solidarity and for bilateral meetings on the sidelines aimed at strengthening regional relationships or as some said, “redrawing the geopolitical map”. President Xi’s speech called for a fairer, more equitable international system. He reiterated China’s support for multilateralism, stressing the need to strengthen it and accord the UN a key role. Taking aim at the US, without naming it, he rejected “bullying behaviour” by certain countries and decried the “Cold War” mentality that “continues to haunt the world”. He also called for “a clear stand aga­inst hegemonism” and to oppose “u­n­­­­i­­lateralism”.
Declaring the global governance system was at a crossroads, he announced a ‘Global Governance Initiative’ predicated on international law and equal participation of all states with a greater voice for developing countries. More significantly, President Xi received support from member states to establish a new SCO development bank and pledged two billion RMB in grants and 10bn in loans for SCO members. This marks the first time the organisation’s economic role has been backed by development finance funds and reflects China’s increasing weight in the global finance system.
The Tianjin declaration issued at the summit called for the “creation of a more just multipolar world order”. In implicit criticism of the US, it said member states opposed “confrontational approaches to resolving international issues”. It rejected “unilateral coercive measures”, including economic ones and vowed to boost trade within the organisation — again a veiled reference to Trump’s tariff actions. The joint communiqué “strongly condemned the military strikes by Israel and the US against Iran in June 2025”, calling them “a gross violation of the UN Charter and international law”. It expressed concern at the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza. It called for an immediate ceasefire and a just settlement of the Palestinian issue. Conspicuous by its absence was any mention of the Ukraine war.
A significant part of the lengthy declaration was devoted to affirming the collective commitment to fight terrorism. In a display of even-handedness, it condemned both the Pahalgam incident and the terrorist attack on the Jaffer Express without mentioning where these took place. This language obviously had both Pakistan and India’s approval.
The bilateral meeting ahead of the summit between President Xi and Prime Minister Modi — the second this year — received much international attention. Positive statements by both sides after the meeting reflected the warming in their relations that had gone into deep freeze in 2020. India had previously made normalisation conditional on settlement of the border dispute while the Chinese insisted the bilateral relationship should not be limited to the border issue. The Indians seemed to have now come around to the Chinese view.
The Sino-India thaw had in any case begun earlier especially with the border management agreement reached in August. The meeting between the two leaders in Tianjin was seen as helping to further normalise the relationship. How far this is tactical, reflecting Modi’s reaction to Trump’s humiliating conduct towards India, or a shift that could gather momentum, remains an open question. It would be a mistake to read too much into the Sino-Indian re-engagement because they have more divergent interests than convergences.
 
 

Interestingly the Indian opposition cautioned the Modi government against adopting a “knee-jerk foreign policy” because of the current hostile US stance towards India.
The other bilateral meeting that attracted attention was between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This underlined the desire of both countries to improve relations and expand trade. It also signalled Pakistan’s intent to chart an independent course in its foreign policy. Sharif held important meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang. Both countries committed to further solidify their strategic partnership, usher in the next phase of CPEC and upgrade the Free Trade Agreement. They also approved an Action Plan for 2025-2029 and signed over a dozen MoUs. This indicated that for all the recent warming in Pakistan-US ties, China remained Pakistan’s overriding strategic priority.
The Tianjin summit reflected the geopolitical shifts underway in a world marked by growing multipolarity and in which Trumpian policies are accelerating some of these shifts. Of these, efforts by non-Western powers to shape the new world order may turn out to be the most consequential.

The deluge has wiped out crops on thousands of acres across Punjab, the country’s food basket, sparking calls for an agricultural emergency.
While an official assessment of the exact agricultural losses caused by floods and excessive monsoon rains is awaited, a business body has claimed that the flooding has led to staggering losses to crops and rural livelihoods. A preliminary assessment by the Pakistan Business Forum shows that 60pc of the rice crop, 35pc of cotton and 30pc of sugarcane in central and southern Punjab have been damaged, besides widespread losses to rural livelihoods. In a letter to the prime minister, the forum has asked that an agricultural emergency be declared. Stating clearly that “such destruction in Punjab due to flooding has never been witnessed before, with Sindh soon facing a similar devastation if immediate preventive measures are not taken”, the letter cautions the government that the key agricultural targets set for the current fiscal year may be unattainable now.
The forum’s call has not come a moment too soon as the unfolding economic upheaval and humanitarian crisis have exposed the fragility of our farm sector. With food inflation already rising, and large amounts of wheat stored in warehouses or at home by farmers for personal use damaged or swept away by the floodwaters, the devastation risks jeopardising the food security of tens of millions of people in both the rural and urban areas.
 
 

More crucially, the recent monthly finance ministry report has predicted that flood-related damage may worsen fiscal pressures as food and industrial crop losses are likely to necessitate imports.
Not just that. The farm sector, which forms nearly a quarter of the economy and employs almost 40pc of the labour force, was in troubled waters even before the rains lashed down and floods inundated vast swathes of farmland. The sector had grown only marginally by 0.56pc — the lowest in almost a decade — in the last fiscal year against the five-year average of 3.38pc, depressing overall GDP growth and affecting both the industrial and services sectors. With agriculture growth falling short of the target, the story will likely repeat itself this year.
While declaring an agricultural emergency is necessary to support rural communities, the government must also use the unfolding crisis to push overdue structural reforms in this neglected sector. As a PBF member stressed, the present crisis should serve as a wake-up call to overhaul agricultural strategies. Without decisive action to mitigate the immediate fallout and avert longer-term decline, the country risks deepening its economic vulnerabilities.

At least 46 people have been killed in strikes on a school, tents and houses across Gaza on Sunday, while a drone launched from Yemen hit an airport in southern Israel forcing suspension of flights for some hours.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the army was “deepening” its assault in and around Gaza City, as it seeks to step up pressure on the Palestinian group Hamas.
Israeli air strikes have flattened two high-rises in Gaza City as troops intensified their operations in the area, aiming to conquer the Palestinian territory’s largest urban centre. “We are deepening the manoeuvre on the outskirts of Gaza City and within Gaza City itself,” Netanyahu told ministers at the start of a cabinet meeting, according to a video shared by his office.

Netanyahu says army ‘deepening’ assault on Gaza City

“We are destroying terrorist infrastructure, we are demolishing identified terror towers,” Netanyahu said.
Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 64,368 people and wounded 162,776 others since October 2023.
The Israeli military has claimed that the two high-rises flattened in the latest strikes were used by Hamas to “monitor” Israeli troops — an accusation denied by the Palestinian group.
The escalation has fuelled fears of a further deterioration in already dire humanitarian conditions for Palestinians living in the area.
Netanyahu said that Israel had “established another humanitarian zone to allow the civilian population in Gaza to move to a safe area”.
Netanyahu said around 100,000 residents had already left Gaza City, accusing Hamas of trying to prevent evacuations and of using civilians as “human shields”.
Mustafa Al-Jamal, who lives in Gaza city, told AFP that he did not plan to leave. He said the area in southern Gaza residents were told to evacuate to has been repeatedly bombed despite being declared “a safe zone”.
“Where can we go? We have no money, no tent, no house, no food.”
Meanwhile, families and supporters of Israeli prisoners take to the streets, demanding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sign a deal to secure the release of their loved ones instead of prolonging the war. Israeli protesters took to the streets to call on their government to reverse the decision to conquer Gaza City, fearing for the fate of prisoners believed to be held there.
“I am mortified by the fact that the Israeli army is conquering Gaza right now,” said Edith, a protester in Jerusalem who declined to give her full name.
Ramon airport hit
Earlier, Israel’s Airports Authority said that a drone launched from Yemen struck the arrivals hall at Ramon Airport near the Red Sea city of Eilat. It said takeoffs and landings at the airport were halted. Hours later, normal operations were restored.
The Israeli military said it was investigating the crash of a drone that was launched from Yemen and fell in the airport’s area. The military said the incident was under review without providing details on the impact.
The airport located near the resort city of Eilat on the border with Jordan and Egypt mostly handles domestic flights.
Israel’s military said it intercepted on Sunday three drones launched from Yemen, whose Houthi rebels have vowed to avenge the killing of their prime minister in an Israeli air strike last month.
“A short while ago, the IAF (Israeli air force) intercepted three UAVs that made their way from Yemen,” the military said in a statement, adding two were downed before entering Israeli airspace. It did not specify what happened to the third.
Israel assassinated the head of the Houthi government together with 11 other senior officials in air strikes two weeks ago. In retaliation, the Yemeni group launched eight ballistic missiles and seven UAVs at Israel, all of which were intercepted or fell on the way, according to Israeli media reports.

“Following the interior minister’s directives, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency has constituted a special inves­tigation team to probe into the matter and submit its report within 14 days,” says an official press rel­ease issued by the Interior Ministry here on Sunday.
It said the team will thoroughly examine the circumstances and those involved in the data leakage will be identified and brought to justice through legal action.
Media reports say that data of all SIM holders, including Interior Minister Naqvi, was sold at Google.
They further said that information regarding mobile location was being sold for Rs500, mobile data record for Rs2,000 and details of foreign trips for Rs5,000.
A couple of months ago, the National Cyber Emer­gency Response Team of Pakistan (PKCERT) iss­ued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan have been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures. Media reports said PKCERT had identified the global breach involving a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing more than 184 million unique account credentials.
“The breach exposed user names, passwords, emails and associated URLs tied to major social media services, as well as government portals, banking institutions, and healthcare platforms worldwide,” the reports said quoting the PKCERT’s advisory.
“The leaked database is believed to have been compiled using infostealer malware — malicious software that extracts sensitive information from compromised systems,” it added.  “This data was stored in plain text and left completely unprotected, without encryption or password safeguarding.”
PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
It outlined the potential impacts of the data breach, warning that the stolen credentials could be used for account takeovers, identity theft and unauthorised access to government portals or other sensitive sites.
The advisory highlighted that the publicly hosted database was storing credentials stolen from “infected endpoints” without any form of authentication or protection and “included sensitive login information for major platforms, enterprises, government agencies, and financial institutions”.
“Attackers may exploit this breach through credential stuffing across services with reused passwords; phishing attacks using associated emails and historical data; targeted social engineering leveraging exposed personal content; unauthorised acc­ess to business and gove­rnment accounts; and malware deployment using credentials,” the advisory warned.
The advisory also recommended that people change their passwords annually and use a credible online service to find out about potential breaches.
In March 2024, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registr­ation Authority (Nadra), told the interior ministry that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million people had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.

• Judges, bar councils wary of rules approved by circulation instead of deliberations in full court
• Justice Shah sent letter to CJP on the issue
ISLAMABAD: While the full court comprising all Supreme Court judges is scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon, other than the tweaks suggested by Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) to the proposed Supreme Court Rules 2025, no feedback on the matter has been received by the four-member committee that had prepared the draft months ago.
Senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, however, in a recent strong-worded letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had questioned why the historic revision of the 1980 rules was ‘approved by circulation’, rather than after a thorough discussion in the full court.
An informed source said when the draft of the new rules was circulated among the judges for consideration, some senior judges opposed the idea of approving them without a full court meeting, while legal fraternity also expressed reservations about certain provisions.
Subsequently, CJP Yahya Afridi convened a full court meeting on Sept 8 (today) to finalise the rules and reconstituted the four-judge committee under Rule 1(4) of the proposed rules to recommend solutions for any difficulties in implementation.
The same committee comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had earlier prepared a comprehensive draft on March 13 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 after deliberation and thorough review of the earlier Supreme Court Rules, 1980. However, apart from SCBA, the committee has not received any other suggestions.
The committee had formulated the draft with an aim to enhance transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness in judicial proceedings. It had invited proposals from judges, office of the Supreme Court, bar councils and associations, keeping in view modern legal requirements and the need for streamlined procedures.
Once the new rules were uploaded on the Supreme Court’s website, various stakeholders, including bar councils and associations raised concerns. Some senior judges were also of the opinion that instead of circulating the draft, the proposals should be discussed in a session of the full court.
The full court, comprising all Supreme Court judges, will meet on Sept 8 (today) at the start of the new judicial year. The meeting will be held on the administrative side in the committee room, not in Courtroom No. 1. Deliberations are expected to begin at 1:00 pm, with the CJP presiding, and will focus solely on written suggestions submitted by SCBA and earlier statements issued by the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC).
It is also expected that a newly-built facility centre in the Supreme Court building will be inaugurated on the occasion of the new judicial year.
On Sept 3, SCBA proposed open inquiries by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) into complaints against superior court judges, arguing that open hearings would not only ensure accountability but also uphold the constitutional guarantees of equality before law under Article 25 and the right to fair trial under Article 10A.
According to SCBA, once a complaint is admitted, the SJC should hold open proceedings subject to safeguards of dignity and decorum and decide references within a fixed time frame, preferably six months.
The key reform proposals include rationalisation of court fees demanding withdrawal of the recent increase to ensure inexpensive justice, as seen in Norway and Germany, where only nominal fees are charged.

Besides CM Khan, members of GB Legislative Assembly Surayya Zaman, Shamsul Haq Lone, Raja Nasir Khan Maqpoon, Raja Azam Khan Amacha, Syed Amjad Zaidi, Mushtaq Ahmad, Haji Shah Baig, Dilshad Bano, Abdul Hameed and Fazal Rahim were given formal termination notices, all containing identical wording.
“This letter serves as formal notice of termination of your membership, effective immediately. This decision has been made in accordance with party’s policy and procedures. The reason for this termination is your actions in the GB Assembly, specifically making a forward bloc and voting against the party decision, which is a clear violation of our party’s policy.
“Your actions have caused harm to the party’s interests and reputation,” stated the letters issued by Additional Secretary General of PTI Firdous Shamim Naqvi.

Party announces complete support for strike in Balochistan against lawlessness

All the 11 lawmakers were directed to “refrain from using party’s [PTI] name, designation and/or membership in any manner or whatsoever, failing which the party reserves to take action against you which may also lead to legal action,” the letters stated.
However, according to a party insider, the issuance of letters may not make any difference to them, as the “whole system” was allegedly backing them.
Also, the PTI issued a show-cause notice to former GB governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon, according to Dawn.com. The notice, dated Sept 5, said it had come to PTI’s notice that Mr Maqpoon had “conspired against the party and approached party members for defection”.
“In view of these reported activities, you are hereby called to explain yourself in writing within two days of this notice. If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules,” it added.
Backs strike in Balochistan
Meanwhile, acting on the direction of PTI founder Imran Khan, the PTI announced complete support for the wheel-jam and shutter-down strike in Balochistan on Monday against escalating lawlessness, rising terrorism, and the government’s failure to protect citizens.
The call for province-wide strike was given by a six-party opposition alliance comprising Balo­chistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP), and Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen (MWM).
A statement from PTI’s central media department explained that the coalition had announced the joint protest against the recent attack at Shahwani Stadium on BNP-M rally, which claimed several precious lives and left many others injured. It emphasised that the strike was intended not only to mourn the victims of the tragedy but also to expose the government’s abject failure to provide security to its citizens.
The PTI warned that militancy and extremism were witnessing an alarming resurgence in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and other parts of the country due to government’s policies and priorities.
“PTI strongly believes that the people’s voice cannot be suppressed by terrorism, state oppression, or the use of coercive force. Our democratic struggle for peace, justice, and fundamental rights will not only continue but will be pursued with renewed determination and even greater resolve,” it stated.
On the other side, the PTI extended felicitations to the nation on Pakistan Air Force Day. It stated, “September 7 stands as a symbol of the unmatched bravery, sacrifice, and valour demonstrated by the Pakistan Air Force in the defence of our homeland.
On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to safeguard the nation’s sovereignty.”

• Authorities order evacuations in downstream cities; seven die

• PM wants steps to ensure fuel supply in flood-affected areas
LAHORE: An extremely high flood threatened to engulf Jalal­pur Pirwala, a tehsil of Multan district, as the water level in the Chenab River continued to rise on Sunday, prompting the authorities to evacuate residents from a city with a population of 500,000.
Multan City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Ali Dogar told Dawn that low-lying areas of the city had been inundated and could be completely submerged by Sunday night. He, however, assured that evacuations from most areas had been completed. The police official stated that the water was not moving towards Head Panjnad and could submerge the entire city, and the administration had called in helicopters to rescue people from hard-to-reach areas.
A senior official, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that the government attempted to breach a bund to divert the water, but the villagers did not allow them to do so. He claimed that the government was planning to “save the city by diverting the water towards villages but did not succeed”. He said it was not possible to divert the flow since the water had already started entering the city. Residents of Jalalpur also confirmed this version.
In order to aid the administration in relief measures, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority provided three helicopters for aerial rescue — two from the army and one from Askari Civil Aviation. The PDMA director general said a coordinated rescue operation was underway, involving multiple agencies.
 
 

A rescue spokesperson said that 38 additional rescue boats were sent to the most-affected areas of Jalalpur Pirwala. “Another shipment of boats has been dispatched for Jalalpur Pirwala,” the spokesperson said.
Amid rising water levels, the authorities ordered evacuations in the downstream cities. According to the rescue spokesperson, an appeal has been made to the people of Muzaffargarh, Alipur and Jatoi to evacuate immediately.
Seven drown
Meanwhile, five people, including four children, drowned in Jalapur Pirwala after a boat capsized in the Chenab during the evacuation.
“The causes of the boat accident are being carefully examined. Initially, five deaths… have been confirmed,” Multan Deputy Commissioner (DC) Wasim Ham­id Sindhu was quoted as saying in a statement. A statement from the PDMA also put the toll at five. “Rescue operations are being carried out to search for more people who were present on the boat,” Sindhu said.
The initial report from Rescue 1122 explained that while evacuating people from floodwaters in Jalalpur Pirwala, the boat had hit a tree and overturned due to the strong current. It added that mostly the women and children were on board and the water was 15 to 20 feet deep where it had capsized.
According to the rescue authorities, more than 9,000 people had been rescued in the Multan district, while over 350,000 people and more than 300,000 animals had been evacuated in advance.
In another incident, a man drowned while trying to cross the Chenab near Head Panjnad on Saturday evening. His body could not be recovered. A young man in Alipur tehsil drowned as he atte­mpted to reach his submerged house in a catchment area near Head Panjnad.
River flow
As of 10:30pm on Sunday, the Marala Headworks on Chenab reported a steady flow of 89,604 cusecs, while both Khanki (steady) and Qadirabad Headworks (rising) reported flows of 147,294 and 147,039 cusecs.
At the Chiniot bridge, the flow was steady with 91,528 cusecs and Riwaz Bridge was holding steady with 521.60 ft (max value 525 ft). Trimmu Headworks (steady) reported a very high flow of 543,579 cusecs.
Jassar on River Ravi was steady with 48,360 cusecs and Ravi Syphon reported a steady flow of 91,463 cusecs. Sidhnai Headworks was rising with a very high flow of 120,239 cusecs. On the River Sutlej, G.S Wala reported an exceptionally high flow of 319,295 cusecs and Sulemanki Headworks reported 135,832 cusecs. Islam Headworks was steady with 110,028 cusecs, while Punjnad Headworks reported an extremely high flow of 609,664 cusecs. Mailsi had reported flows of 99,811 cusecs and steady.
Rain forecast
Amid floods, torrential rainfall is expected across Pakistan, particularly in Sindh, till Sept 10.
In Punjab, rain and thunder showers with isolated heavy falls are expected in Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Sahiwal, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, Vehari, Khanewal, Mul­tan, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Rahimyar Khan, Rajanpur, Kot Addu, and Dera Ghazi Khan till Sept 9.
According to the Met office, heavy to “exce­ptionally very heavy falls” are exp­ected in Tharparker, Umer Kot, Mir­purkhas, San­ghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Bena­z­i­rabad, Matiari, Tando Allayar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Hyderabad, Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Dadu, Kashmore, Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Shikarpur and Ghotki for next couple of days with occasional gaps.
The rainfall will occur at isolated pla­ces in Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Attock, Jhelum, Mandi Baha­uddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafi­z­a­bad, and Wazirabad during the forecast period.

In KP, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Man­sehra, Abbottabad, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Swabi, Peshawar, Mardan, Kohat, and Kurrum will receive rainfall till September 9.
 
 

The rain spell would likely cause urban flooding in cities and flash floods and landslides in the hilly areas across the country, warned the Met office.
It said that the water level may rise in the Hub Dam, while the deluge may exacerbate the situation in the flood-affected areas during the forecast period.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed special vigilance to ensure the transportation of petroleum products to the flood-affected areas without any interruption.

Around a hundred people, mostly women, had gathered for a Holy Quran recital at a community hall in West Java’s Bogor district to commemorate the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) birthday when the building suddenly collapsed, said Adam Hamdani, an official from the local disaster mitigation agency.
“According to initial data, 84 people are being treated, three people died,” Hamdani said. 
He said it was likely the building, which was used as a meeting hall as well as a place of worship, collapsed because it was overcrowded.

“Perhaps the structure was not strong, as people were enthusiastic to follow the event to commemorate the holy prophet’s birthday,” he said.
All the people inside had been accounted for, he said.
Victims were immediately taken to nearby hospitals, with the majority suffering minor injuries.
Hamdani said it was not raining at the time and there did not appear to have been a landslide.
Lax construction standards have raised widespread concerns about building safety in Indonesia.
In 2022, a three-storey minimarket in South Kalimantan collapsed and killed five people. Two people were also injured when a five-storey building in Jakarta partially collapsed two years earlier.
Teenagers rehearsing for a musical show were among seven people killed in Cirebon, east of Jakarta, in 2018 when the building they were in collapsed.
At least 75 people were also injured the same year when a mezzanine floor at Indonesia’s stock exchange building in Jakarta collapsed into the lobby.

Player of the match Nawaz became the third Pakistani bowler to take a hat-trick in T20Is for the Green Shirts and ended up with figures of 5-19 as the Afghan batters had no response to his wily left-arm spin — getting bowled out for a paltry 66.
He also contributed with the bat in Pakistan’s first innings by hitting two sixes and scoring 25 of 21 deliveries.
 






Earlier, Afghanistan men’s spinners restricted Pakistan to 141-8 after skipper Salman Ali Agha had elected to bat first after winning the toss, and the Green Shirts had one change since their last encounter against Afghanistan on Tuesday, with spinner Abrar Ahmed playing in place of pacer Haris Rauf.
Spinners Abrar and Sufyan Moqim picked up two wickets each as the Pakistani spinners outbowled their Afghan counterparts to win the final by 75 runs at the packed Sharjah Cricket Stadium.
In the first innings, Pakistan suffered an early blow when they lost opener Sahibzada Farhan to an inswinger by Fazalhaq Farooqi that made a mess of his stumps.
Fazalhaq, along with left-arm leg-spinner Noor Ahmad, continued their good form with the ball against the Green Shirts — grabbing two wickets each and supporting skipper Rashid Khan, who ended up with three wickets.
Fakhar Zaman hit the first maximum of the match off the bowling of Muhammad Nabi when he danced down the wicket and deposited the ball in the stands.
Pakistan were 41-1 at the end of the powerplay with the Afghan bowlers keeping scoring in check.
Opener Saim Ayub was the next wicket down for the Green Shirts as he prodded at a length delivery by spinner Noor Ahmed — resulting in a regulation catch for Afghan skipper Rashid Khan at covers.
Fakhar did not last long after that, getting out leg before wicket to a straighter delivery by Rashid in the very next over.
At the halfway mark of the innings, the Green Team managed 61-3 as the Afghan spinners continued to cause trouble.
Batter Hasan Nawaz tried to up the momentum but got out miscuing an aerial shot off Rashid — getting dismissed trying one shot too many after hitting a six earlier in the over.
Mohammad Haris was the next to go, as his troubles against spin continued in the series. Noor beat him all ends up as he attempted an aerial shot on a flighted delivery.
The innings meandered along till Mohammad Nawaz hit a six off newcomer AM Ghazanfar in the 15th over to regain some momentum.
Skipper Salman hit two sixes off Rashid in the 17th over before top-edging one to short third man — getting dismissed for 24 off 27 balls.
Faheem Ashraf and Nawaz hit a couple of boundaries before getting dismissed as the Pakistani innings ended at 141-8 at the end of 20 overs.
 






Afghanistan’s reply never got going after losing regular wickets from the very first over of the innings and got the wind knocked out of their sails when Nawaz took a hat-trick by dismissing key batters in the 6th and 8th overs.
Pakistan had secured their spot in the T20 tri-series final by a second 31-run win over the United Arab Emirates, while Afghanistan beat the UAE in a close finish by 4 runs on Friday.
In the tournament that was played as a warm-up ahead of the Asia Cup — which starts on September 9 — both teams faced each other twice in the lead-up to the final, with both winning one encounter each.
Pakistan beat Afghanistan comprehensively by 39 runs in the tri-series opener, while Afghanistan won the last encounter on Wednesday by 18 runs.

The partial eclipse will continue until 12:57am, while the entire eclipse event will conclude by 1:55am.

According to Suparco, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are completely safe to observe with the naked eye, binoculars or telescopes.
In a press release on Saturday, the space agency had said that the eclipse will be visible in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, with clear visibility expected in most regions of Pakistan if the weather permits.
“The event will start at 8:30pm and reach its maximum at 11:57pm,” the press release read, stating that the eclipse will conclude at 1:55am.
Sunday’s eclipse is also known as a “blood moon”, due to its red hue during the event. When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022. A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.</p><small>2025-09-07 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07232933929ff75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940309/balochistan-govt-warns-protesters-against-disrupting-law-and-order-ahead-of-shutter-down-strike' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan govt warns protesters against disrupting law and order ahead of shutter-down strike</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan government on Sunday put out a statement warning protesters against disrupting law and order during a shutter-down strike across the province, including Quetta, on September 8 (Monday).
Six opposition political parties announced a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike earlier this week, to protest against the suicide bombing that targeted a Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) pu­­blic meeting at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium on Tuesday, which left 15 dead and 38 injured.
The strike call has been given jointly by six political parties, including the BNP-M, PTI, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), National Party, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen and Jamaat-i-Islami.
While the provincial government noted in the statement that protest is a fundamental right, it warned demonstrators against blocking roads and highways.
“Strict and immediate action will be taken against those who try to obstruct the freedom of movement and routines of life of citizens,” the Balochistan Home Department warned.
“Elements who take the law into their own hands will not be tolerated under any circumstances and those who put citizens in danger through force or violence will not be forgiven.”
The statement added that nobody would be allowed to obstruct public facilities and that “strict legal action will also be taken against any attempt to affect any federal subject”.
The department declared that hospitals, public transport, fuel stations and markets will remain functional at all times and the closure of schools and medical facilities would not be tolerated.
Meanwhile, BNP-M chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal issued a video statement calling upon people to join the strike. Calling the suicide attack a “painful and tragic act”, he asked why the state did not respond to it.
“Isn’t the state responsible for this? Wasn’t it the duty of the state to protect these innocent people?” he asked. “What was their (BNP-M workers) fault? They did not pick up a gun. They did not kidnap anyone or engage in corruption. They raised the BNP flag.
“The Balochistan National Party, Pashtun Khamili Awami Party, National Party, PTI, Wahdatul Muslimin, have decided that on September 8, the Balochistan Bar will be shut down, and a mass strike will be carried out,” he added.
“My request to all the people of Balochistan, regardless of whether they are from a certain district or speak a certain language, or whether they are Baloch, Pashtun, Hazara, or settlers, is to make the strike on September 8 successful.”
Mengal said that the protest “will not affect the rulers”, but noted that the world would observe their movement.
“We want the world to know that these criminals, whoever they are and their atrocities, will be exposed,” he added. “I would like to request the people of every sect of thought to succeed in this protest and prove to the world that the people and protectors of Balochistan are alive.”</p><small>2025-09-07 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622472-kazakh-dpm-to-arrive-in-pakistan-tomorrow-on-two-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakh DPM to arrive in Pakistan today on two-day visit</strong></a><br><p>

Flames could be seen rising from the roof of the sprawling government complex that houses Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers in the heart of the city — the first time it has been hit during the three-and-a-half-year conflict.
Drone strikes also damaged several high-rise buildings in the Ukrainian capital, according to emergency services.
Russia has shown no sign of halting its onslaught despite efforts by the United States to broker a peace deal, and Kyiv residents have become hardened to the daily rhythm of strikes and alerts.
“This is already routine for us, unfortunately,” Olga, a 30-year-old resident of a damaged building, told AFP after the latest strikes. An AFP reporter saw helicopters dropping buckets of water over the government building’s roof, as emergency services rushed to the scene.
Enemy ‘terrorises’
Russia denies targeting civilians in Ukraine.
It said it struck a plant and a logistics hub in Kyiv, with the Russian defence ministry saying “no strikes were carried out on other targets within the boundaries of Kyiv”.
Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko posted a video showing a damaged floor in the government building.
“We will restore the buildings,” she said. “But we cannot bring back lost lives. The enemy terrorises and kills our people every day throughout the country.”

Russia fired at least 810 drones and 13 missiles at Ukraine between late Saturday and early Sunday in a new record, according to the Ukrainian air force.
“Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have already begun long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,” Zelensky said.
He discussed the attack in a call with French President Emmanuel Macron and said France would help Ukraine strengthen its defence.
Macron was among European leaders condemning the attack, posting on X that Russia was “locking itself ever deeper into the logic of war and terror”.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the attacks “cowardly” while EU chief Ursula von der Leyen accused the Kremlin of “mocking diplomacy”.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Washington was prepared to increase pressure on Russia by slapping tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil.
“The Russian economy will be in full collapse. And that will bring President (Vladimir) Putin to the table,” Bessent told NBC Television.
Horses killed
At least two people were killed in a strike west of Kyiv, prosecutors said.
More than two dozen were wounded in Kyiv, according to the emergency services.
Among them was a 24-year-old pregnant woman who delivered a premature baby shortly after the attack, with doctors fighting to save her life and that of her baby, state TV Suspilne reported.

Two more died and dozens were wounded in overnight strikes across the east and southeast, authorities said. Ukraine’s foreign ministry highlighted that seven horses had also been killed at an equestrian club.
“The world cannot stand aside while a terrorist state takes lives — human or animal — every single day,” it posted on X.
 






The barrage came after more than two dozen European countries pledged to oversee any agreement to end the war, some of whom said they were willing to deploy troops on the ground.
Ukraine has insisted on Western-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks, but Putin has warned that any Western troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable and legitimate targets.
US President Donald Trump has tried to find a way to end the war in recent weeks but has little to show for his efforts.
On Sunday, Trump said he was prepared to move forward on new sanctions on Moscow, hours after Russia’s aerial barrage.
Speaking outside the White House, he replied “yeah, I am” when asked if he was ready to impose more sanctions against Russia, without giving further details.
Russia has continued to claim territory in costly grinding battles and now occupies around 20 per cent of Ukraine. Tens of thousands have been killed and millions forced from their homes in Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War II.</p><small>2025-09-07 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07172804068b3aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940286/pti-terminates-basic-party-membership-of-11-gb-lawmakers-including-cm-gulbar-khan' target='_blank'><strong>PTI terminates basic party membership of 11 GB lawmakers, including CM Gulbar Khan</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has terminated the basic party membership of 11 legislators of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly, including Chief Minister Gulbar Khan, saying that they made a forward bloc and voted against the party decision, it emerged on Sunday.
Most of these legislators are also members of Gulbar Khan’s cabinet, who was elected as the CM while leading a forward bloc in the PTI.
Apart from the CM, the almost identical termination notices — dated September 5 and available with Dawn.com — were issued to Abdul Hameed, Haji Shah Baig, Mushtaq Ahmad, Syed Amjad Ali Zaidi, Shamsul Haq Lone, Dilshad Bano, Raja Nasir Ali Khan Maqpoon, Surayya Zaman, Raja Azam Khan Amacha and Raja Fazal Rahim.
The notices stated that the decision to terminate memberships was effective immediately and in line with the PTI’s policy and procedures.
“The reason for your termination is your actions in the GB Assembly, especially making a forward block and voting against the party decision, which is a clear violation of our party’s policy. Your actions have caused harm to the party’s interests and reputation,” the notices read.
The lawmakers were also asked not to use the party’s “name, designation and/or membership in any manner or whatsoever, failing which the party reserves to take action against you which may also lead to legal action”.
Moreover, the PTI also issued a show-cause notice to former GB governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon.
The show cause notice, also dated September 5 and available with Dawn.com, said it had come to the PTI’s notice that Maqpoon had “conspired against the party and approached party members for defection”.
“In view of these reported activities, you are hereby called to explain yourself in writing within two days of this notice. If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules,” it added.
Gulbar Khan’s election as CM
Gulbar Khan — a disgruntled member of the PTI — had replaced party’s Khalid Khurshid as the GB chief minister in July 2023, after the latter was disqualified by the GB Chief Court for obtaining a licence from the GB Bar Council allegedly based on a fake education degree.
His disqualification had led several PTI lawmakers to switch sides, and ultimately, a coalition government, comprising PTI’s disgruntled members and PML-N and PPP lawmakers, was formed in the region, with Gulbar Khan as the CM.
Prior to that, a Dawn report had cited sources as saying that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in consultation with the PPP, had nominated Gulbar for the coveted role.
Following Gulbar’s election, the PTI, through its Central Media Department, had issued a statement condemning the “robbery of public mandate in Gilgit-Baltistan in broad daylight”.
Later, the PTI had issued show cause notices to 11 of its members for voting in favour of Gulbar Khan. Those served notices also included Gulbar Khan, Amjad Zaidi, Shams Lone, Abdul Hameed, Dilshad Bano, Haji Shah Baig, Surayya Zaman and Raja Fazal Rahim — all of whom were sent termination notices on Thursday.</p><small>2025-09-07 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/071720482f46a4a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940285/parts-of-karachi-receive-rain-as-met-office-warns-of-urban-flooding' target='_blank'><strong>Parts of Karachi receive rain as Met Office warns of urban flooding</strong></a><br><p>Parts of Karachi received rain on Sunday evening as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast that the fresh rain spell in the city would continue till September 11 (Thursday).
It would witness “rain-wind/thundershowers with a few moderate to isolated heavy falls/ very heavy falls”, the forecast said.
According to DawnNewsTV, Bahria Town, Liaquatabad, FB Area and North Karachi began receiving rain today evening. Rainfall was also reported in North Nazimabad, Scheme-33, Gulshan-i-Hadeed and the M-9 motorway.
According to the forecast by the Met Office, this spell of rain will possibly continue till Thursday “with occasional gaps” and may cause urban flooding and waterlogging in low-lying areas.
At 5pm, the Met Office issued a weather warning, directing all concerned authorities to remain on high alert for the duration of the rain spell.
 

The weather warning issued by the Met Office on Sept 7.

Earlier, the Met Office also predicted “widespread rain wind/thundershower with scattered heavy to very heavy falls” in Sindh’s Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Dadu, Mitiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal and Jamshoro till Thursday with occasional gaps.
It has also forecast “widespread rain wind/ thundershower with scattered moderate to isolated heavy falls” in Larkana, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Sukkur, Jacobabad and Ghotki districts of Sindh till Thursday with occasional gaps.
Meanwhile, DawnNewsTV reported that a fresh spell of rains had also begun in Umerkot, Tharparkar and Tando Muhammad Khan.
All teams are on alert amid the ongoing rain, says Mayor Wahab
In the wake of the ongoing rains in Karachi, Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that all teams are on alert.
“Municipal services staff are present at selected locations with machinery,” Wahab was quoted as having said in a press statement.
Rapid response teams have also been deployed to deal with any emergency situation, he added.
“Along with this, city wardens and anti-encroachment staff will also be present on the roads for the relief of citizens,” the Karachi mayor said.
The staff should be in constant contact with the officers; strict action will be taken in case of negligence, according to Wahab.
“A rain emergency centre will be established in case of further or heavy rain,” he continued.
However, the rainfall in Karachi turned the weather pleasant, as its citizens welcomed the decline in mercury.
 


Last month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.
Most of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.</p><small>2025-09-07 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07203334ff88182.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940301/verstappen-puts-brakes-on-mclaren-with-record-breaking-italian-gp-victory' target='_blank'><strong>Verstappen puts brakes on McLaren with record-breaking Italian GP victory</strong></a><br><p>Max Verstappen slowed McLaren’s Formula One dominance on Sunday with a phenomenal display of driving on his way to victory at the Italian Grand Prix, the fastest ever race in the sport’s history.
Starting from pole, reigning world champion Verstappen completed a magical weekend at Monza, which included the fastest lap ever in F1 during Saturday’s qualifying by schooling McLaren pair Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri at Monza.
Red Bull’s Verstappen has little chance of securing a fifth straight drivers’ title as he still trails championship leader Piastri by 94 points, with the Australian finishing third.
“It was really enjoyable,” said Verstappen, who took the chequered flag in 1hr 13mins 24.325sec. “I think we pitted at the right time and with the hard tyres at the end you can push a bit more… It was a fantastic execution by everyone.
“I think the whole weekend we were all in. It was super enjoyable to win here.”

Piastri leads the drivers’ standings by 31 points from Norris, who finished second and would have finished third behind his teammate due to an awful pit stop had McLaren not enforced a position swap between the pair.
“I always know it’s going to be a good fight with Max and it was,” said Norris.
“But just not the speed today, not the pace of Max and the Red Bull. But it was still fun, still a good race.”
Charles Leclerc, last year’s winner and the last driver to win at Monza from pole position back in 2019, couldn’t take a podium spot for the massed ranks of Ferrari fans in the stands, the Monegasque finishing fourth.
Leclerc’s teammate Lewis Hamilton gave it his best shot after a five-place grid penalty had him bumped back to 10th at the start, charging up to sixth thanks to some spectacular driving early in the race.
But the seven-time F1 champion couldn’t push past his former Mercedes teammate George Russell and was left with another underwhelming result in his first Monza GP with Ferrari.
Verstappen show
Sunday’s win, which hinged on a bold overtaking move against Norris on lap four, was just Verstappen’s third of a season dominated by a McLaren car, which has blown away the competition by winning all but four GPs.
But a second win in Italy this year, after triumphing in the last Emilia Romagna GP back in May, caps a historic weekend for the blunt 27-year-old.
 
 

Verstappen was forced to allow Norris into first place after a frantic start in which he appeared to force his British rival off the track.
That move caused Norris to call Verstappen an “idiot” over the team radio, but he was soon back behind the Dutchman, who took control of the race by passing Norris with a daring move at the chicane on lap four.

From there, Verstappen sped off into the distance, developing a gap of around six seconds over Norris by the time he pitted to switch from medium to hard tyres on lap 38.
Verstappen only lost two places in the pits and soon closed the gap again on the two McLarens, who left it very late to pit, with Norris not heading into the box until lap 47.
That slow pit stop left Norris third, bringing back memories of the mechanical failure at last weekend’s Dutch Grand Prix, which cost him 18 points in his title battle with Piastri.
But with the race effectively won by Verstappen at that point, McLaren ordered Piastri to let Norris pass so that another case of bad luck didn’t cost him.
It was a gesture which caused Verstappen to chuckle on the Red Bull team radio as he was left to cruise around the track on his way to a hugely impressive victory.</p><small>2025-09-07 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07184116b741e10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940293/social-media-influencers-kidnap-bid-case-islamabad-court-extends-remand-of-suspect' target='_blank'><strong>Social media influencer’s kidnap bid case: Islamabad court extends remand of suspect</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Sunday extended the remand of a suspect, who allegedly threatened and attempted to abduct social media influencer Samiya Hijab.
The suspect was arrested on Monday and a case was registered in the capital’s Shalimar Police Station at her complaint under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 392 (punishment for robbery), 500 (punishment for defamation), 509 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code. He was later remanded in police custody by a judicial magistrate.
According to a copy of the court order issued today, available with Dawn.com, police requested that the suspect be further remanded for eight days, but the court ordered three days.
“Learned counsel for the accused has opposed the request of the IO (investigating officer) and submitted an application that on a previous date, two days [of] physical remand was granted, thus the accused was supposed to be produced on [September 4], however, has been produced today,” the order read.
The court ordered that the suspect be produced before it on September 10.
The hearing
The suspect was produced in court before Duty Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Azhar Nadeem today after completing five days of physical remand. Police stated that the suspect had a two-day remand before his defence counsel, Chaudhry Zubair Gujjar, noted that the suspect had been produced after five days.
“We can see the first remand order,” Gujjar argued, to which police responded by saying that the two-day remand was a clerical error that was quickly resolved.
 
 

Meanwhile, the suspect’s transaction history with the social media influencer, as well as a video statement of her addressing her parents, were presented before the court.
“The suspect and the plaintiff are engaged,” Gujjar stated, showing photographs of their engagement.
However, the prosecution said that Rs45,000 had been recovered from the suspect and that his alleged accomplices needed to be arrested.
“[The suspect] got bail in one case but was deliberately arrested in another case,” Gujjar argued. “The suspect was in the Jinnah Super area at the time of the incident.
 
 

“When [the suspect] demanded money back from Samiya Hijab, false receipts were given,” he added.
The influencer alleged in a first information report (FIR) that the suspect had stalked her for several days. She added that last Sunday at 6:30pm, an attempt was made to forcefully take her out of the house.
“Today’s incident further escalated when he attempted to forcibly abduct me from my house while I was returning his gifts. This amounts to abduction, harassment, and assault under the law. For evidence, I have CCTV footage,” she was quoted as saying in the FIR.</p><small>2025-09-07 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/071812509f225a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940262/japan-pm-ishiba-resigns-after-bruising-election-losses' target='_blank'><strong>Japan PM Ishiba resigns after bruising election losses</strong></a><br><p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba resigned on Sunday, ushering in a potentially lengthy period of policy uncertainty at a shaky moment for the world’s fourth-largest economy.
Having just ironed out final details of a trade deal with the United States to lower President Donald Trump’s punishing tariffs, Ishiba, 68, told a press conference he must take responsibility for a series of bruising election losses.
Since coming to power less than a year ago, the unlikely premier has overseen his ruling coalition lose its majorities in elections for both houses of parliament amid voter anger over rising living costs.
He instructed his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) — which has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war period — to hold an emergency leadership race, adding he would continue his duties until his successor was elected.
“With Japan having signed the trade agreement and the president having signed the executive order, we have passed a key hurdle,” Ishiba said, his voice seeming to catch with emotion. “I would like to pass the baton to the next generation.”
Ishiba has faced calls to resign since the latest of those losses in an election for the upper house in July. The LDP had been scheduled to hold a vote on whether to hold an extraordinary leadership election on Monday.
Koizumi, Takaichi among possible successors
Concern over political uncertainty prompted a sell-off in Japan’s yen currency and its government bonds last week, with the yield on the 30-year bond hitting a record high on Wednesday.
Investors are focusing on the chance of Ishiba being replaced by an advocate of looser fiscal and monetary policy, such as LDP veteran Sanae Takaichi, who has criticised the Bank of Japan’s interest rate hikes.
Ishiba narrowly defeated Takaichi in last year’s LDP leadership run-off. Shinjiro Koizumi, the telegenic political scion who has gained prominence as Ishiba’s farm minister tasked with trying to cap soaring prices, is another possible successor.
“Given the political pressure mounting on Ishiba after the LDP’s repeated election losses, his resignation was inevitable,” said Kazutaka Maeda, economist at Meiji Yasuda Research Institute.
“As for potential successors, Koizumi and Takaichi are seen as the most likely candidates. While Koizumi is not expected to bring major changes, Takaichi’s stance on expansionary fiscal policy and her cautious approach to interest rate hikes could draw scrutiny from financial markets,” Maeda said.
Since the ruling coalition has lost its parliamentary majority, the next LDP president is not guaranteed to become prime minister, although that is likely as the party remains by far the largest in the lower house.
Whoever becomes the next leader may choose to call a snap election to seek a mandate, analysts said. While Japan’s opposition remains fractured, the far-right, anti-immigration Sanseito party made big gains in July’s upper house election, bringing once-fringe ideas into the political mainstream.
Nearly 55pc of respondents to a poll by Kyodo news agency published on Sunday said there was no need to hold an early election.
Michael Brown, senior research strategist at financial markets brokerage Pepperstone, said there was likely to be further selling pressure on the yen and long-dated bonds on Monday.
“That selling pressure is likely to come first from the market now needing to price a greater degree of political risk, not only in terms of the LDP leadership contest, but also the potential for a general election to be held if the new leader seeks a mandate of their own,” Brown said.
‘No time to lose’
Ishiba, a party outsider who became leader on his fifth attempt last September, wrapped up his brief tenure by completing the trade deal with the United States, Japan’s biggest trading partner, pledging $550 billion of investments in return for lower tariffs.
US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, especially those targeted at Japan’s critical automotive sector, had forced Japan to downgrade its already weak growth outlook for the year.
Ishiba said he hoped his successor could ensure the deal is executed and Japan continues generating wage gains to assuage voter concerns over living costs.
He also expressed concern about the security environment his successor will inherit, pointing to an unprecedented gathering of Chinese, Russian and North Korean leaders in Beijing for a massive military parade last week.
Yoshinobu Tsutsui, chairman of Japan’s biggest business lobby, Keidanren, said there was “no time to lose” with mounting domestic and international challenges.
“We hope the new leader will foster unity within the party, establish stable political conditions, and move swiftly to implement necessary policies,” Tsutsui said.
Some voters, too, are hoping for a steady hand in uncertain times.
“With all the turmoil around tariffs right now, I hope the next prime minister will be someone who can properly manage the tariff issues and handle diplomacy more effectively,” Maki Utsuno, a 48-year-old chemistry researcher, told Reuters outside a busy train station in downtown Tokyo on Sunday.</p><small>2025-09-07 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07161336291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940279/swabi-tiktoker-held-for-making-videos-while-dressed-as-a-woman-police' target='_blank'><strong>Swabi TikToker held for making videos while dressed as a woman: police</strong></a><br><p>Swabi police have arrested a TikToker who was allegedly making videos while dressing as a girl and uploading them to his account to “mislead people, especially the youth”, senior police officials said on Sunday.
Swabi Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Ijaz Abazai and Saidul Amin, Station House Officer (SHO) at Swabi city police station, told Dawn.com that the TikToker was filming videos while dressing as a woman and “striking controversial poses”.
“There was severe resentment and anxiety among society,” SHO Amin said. “Aamir Khan, the in-charge of Bamkhel outpost, traced the TikToker, and police have taken immediate action and arrested the suspect, a resident of Bamkhel.”
A first information report (FIR) has been filed against the TikToker at the Swabi city police station — available with Dawn.com — stating that the police came to know that he was making videos performing obscene acts on social media, “which had a very bad impact on society”.
The FIR was registered under Section 294 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which “makes it an offence to commit any obscene act or sing, recite, or utter obscene songs, ballads, or words in or near a public place to the annoyance of others, punishable with imprisonment up to three months, a fine, or both.”
After being arrested, the suspect confessed to the crime and promised to refrain from such immoral activities in the future.
The TikToker said in a video recorded by police: “I belong to Jafarkhail, a Mohallah of Bamkhel village. I was making videos and uploading to my TikTok account. I will not make such videos in the future.”
SHO Amin said that the content creator had been presented in a local court and “would face the law of the land”.
DSP Abazai said that it was very sad that he was making videos in Swabi’s traditional chail, a chador proudly worn by women in the district. Aziz Manerwal, a renowned writer, told Dawn.com about the significance of the chail.
“No one can deny the importance of the Swabi chail. It has cultural and traditional significance,” he said.
“The women here wear it with great pride. It is said that a battle took place here in history, and when women placed their white shawls on the dead bodies of their husbands, they would create red dots, and since then, women here have been wearing white shawls with red dots.”</p><small>2025-09-07 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/071511276dc4f91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940274/in-a-first-pakistan-to-host-t20i-tri-series-afghanistan-and-sri-lanka-to-visit-in-november' target='_blank'><strong>In a first, Pakistan to host T20I tri-series; Afghanistan and Sri Lanka to visit in November</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is set to host a T20 International (T20I) tri-series for the first time from November 17 to 29, according to a press release issued by the country’s cricket board on Sunday.
Apart from Pakistan, the “three-nation tournament” would feature Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, the press release said.
 






It added that the series was organised to “provide all teams with valuable preparation” ahead of next year’s International Cricket Council Men’s T20 World Cup, which will take place in India and Sri Lanka.
Detailing its schedule, it further stated that the hosts would take on Afghanistan on November 17, marking the beginning of the series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. It also mentioned that “will be Afghanistan’s first-ever T20I in Pakistan”.
“On November 19, Sri Lanka will face Afghanistan at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, while the remaining five T20Is of the tri-series, including the final on November 29, will be played at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore,” the press release said.

In his statement included in the press release, Pakistan Cricket Board Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmed Syed said: “We look forward to hosting Sri Lanka and Afghanistan for Pakistan’s maiden T20I tri-series. This event will not only offer excellent preparation for next year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup but also present fans with exciting cricket across venues.
“Earlier this year, [the] PCB successfully delivered the ICC Champions Trophy and the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. These achievements underline our capacity and readiness to host back-to-back international events at the highest level.”
International cricket had dried up in Pakistan following a 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore. Consequently, the Green Shirts were forced to play international matches at neutral venues such as the United Arab Emirates.
In 2017, international cricket began gradually returning to Pakistan with the Green Shirts playing against the ICC World XI in a series of three T20 internationals.
Earlier this year, the country hosted the ICC Champions Trophy in February and March, though India played their matches in Dubai. It was the first time that the Pakistan hosted an ICC event after 1996.
A day ago, the PCB also announced that South Africa’s team would be visiting Pakistan in October and November for a series of Test, One-Day International and T20I matches.</p><small>2025-09-07 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622401-parts-of-karachi-receive-heavy-rain-amid-urban-flooding-risk' target='_blank'><strong>Parts of Karachi receive heavy rain amid urban flooding risk</strong></a><br><p>

He made the remarks while addressing the central Martyrs’ Day ceremony held at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, as the nation observes the Pakistan Air Force Day to honour PAF martyrs.
“He (ACM Sidhu) affirmed that Pakistan Air Force would remain committed to advancing its capabilities in space, electronic warfare, cyber technologies, niche domains and indigenous defence production to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation,” said a press release by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The PAF solemnly observed Martyrs’ Day across all its bases nationwide, ISPR noted.
The day commenced with special prayers and recitation of the Holy Quran, “dedicated to the martyrs of the 1965 and 1971 wars, as well as to all those who have rendered the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty since the creation of Pakistan”.
 






Addressing the ceremony as the chief guest, ACM Sidhu underscored the proud legacy of sacrifice, courage and professionalism that defines the PAF.
He emphasised that Martyrs’ Day “symbolises the extraordinary bravery, impeccable professionalism and unparalleled spirit of sacrifice demonstrated” by the armed forces.
The air chief stressed that well-cognisant of the fast-changing security dynamics, the PAF stood committed to its mission with singularity of purpose.
“The latest link in [the] chain of victories secured by PAF in Marka-i-Haq / Bunyanum Marsoos has once more proved our will and capability to guard the aerial frontiers of our motherland,” he was quoted as saying.
As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, PAF downed six Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The martyrs of Marka-i-Haq — the term used for the period of conflict with India — along with the country’s military and civilian leadership, were conferred with a total of 488 national awards on August 14. These included eight Sitara-i-Jurat, seven Sitara-i-Basalat, 23 Tamgha-i-Basalat and 79 Imtiazi Sanad for PAF personnel.
 
 

In his address today, the PAF chief reiterated his firm resolve to make “every possible effort for the progress and prosperity of Pakistan in the evolving global environment”, the ISPR statement said.
Paying “heartfelt tribute” to the fallen heroes of PAF, the air chief said, “We owe our heroes an eternal debt of gratitude for their supreme sacrifices, which serve as an enduring example for future generations.“
He further expressed unwavering solidarity with the people of India-occupied Kashmir in their “legitimate and indigenous struggle for the right to self-determination”, the press release added.
ACM Sidhu also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered fateha for the departed souls to pay homage to the martyrs.
To mark the Defence and Air Force Day, the PAF released a new song titled “Shaheen”.
 


President, PM hail PAF’s ‘decisive role’ during India conflict
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the PAF’s “decisive“ role during the military conflict with India in May, when the air force shot down six Indian jets.
“In recent history, the Pakistan Air Force, together with the armed forces, played a decisive role in Marka-i-Haq [and Bunyanum Marsoos] and the way it defeated the enemy on all fronts amazed the whole world,“ PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
“Undoubtedly, this high-level performance of the Pakistan Air Force was a manifestation of fearless leadership, the skill of the fighter sons, superior strategy, and effective implementation of multi-faceted combat capabilities,“ he added.
 






“The invincible multi-faceted combat capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force are a testament to its innovation in recent years.
“I am particularly proud that the Pakistan Air Force, while keeping its glorious historical tradition alive, defeated an enemy many times larger than itself,“ the premier emphasised.
“Our heroes of the Pakistan Air Force proved with their bravery that no matter how strong and well-armed the enemy is, it can never defeat passion and courage,” he observed.
The prime minister paid tribute to the PAF’s “unparalleled performance”, observing that the martyrs’ “immortal sacrifices are illuminated in history”.
PM Shehbaz said: “Undoubtedly, the founders of the Pakistan Air Force laid its foundation as a high-class and leading institution in accordance with the vision of the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
“Pakistan Air Force continues to perform well in all professional aspects and is no less than any other air force in the world in terms of professionalism,” the premier added.
“We are proud that the Pakistan Air Force has shown its professionalism and immense strength in [the] last decades during air combat.“
 






In his statement, President Zardari said: “Whether it was the 1965 war or the more recent Marka-i-Haq Bunyanum Marsus, our air warriors have always risen to the challenge, giving the enemy a decisive response and filling the nation with pride.”
The president highlighted that the world had “witnessed the remarkable skill and professionalism of PAF”, hailing its evolution into a “modern, capable, and highly professional institution”.
“My heart goes out in deep respect to our martyrs and ghazis whose courage and sacrifices continue to inspire the nation,” President Zardari said.
 
 

He recalled: “In 1965, our air warriors, against overwhelming odds, wrote a story of extraordinary bravery and determination. Their daring actions not only defended our skies but also lifted the morale of an entire nation.
“That spirit of sacrifice and excellence remains alive in every generation of the PAF,” he added. The president paid tribute to the martyrs’ families for bearing the “greatest sacrifice of all”, as well as the warriors for their resilience and dedication.
“I am confident that the Pakistan Air Force will continue to protect our skies and sovereignty with the same resolve and passion that has always defined it.”
