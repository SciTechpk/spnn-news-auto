Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had opened high-level policy talks in Islamabad on May 19 to discuss the FY2025-26 budget. As deliberations with the IMF remained inconclusive, the government has postponed the budget announcement till June 10.
While speaking at an event in Islamabad, the finance minister said they were working on a “strategic budget” instead of “just making the math work”.
He said that the “DNA” of the economy had to change.
“And therefore we are going to bring some bold measures during the budget because budget is not just about revenue and expenditure but has to be providing the strategic direction where the economy is and where it is heading,” he said.
“So it’s our full effort to make this document more strategic, rather than just making the math work,” he said. “Of course, we have to make the math work.”
On debt servicing cost, he noted that it had gone down “by a trillion rupees”.
“And next year, what we are going to do, god willing, is to restructure and reorganise our debt management office along modern lines in terms of international best practices,” he said.
He observed that the country was heavily dependent on imports, leading to a foreign exchange issue and a balance of payment crisis.
“We go running back to the lenders as the last resort, the reason why we are in the 24th IMF programme … let’s be very clear about this because all of us have had enough boom and bust cycles,” he added.
In terms of structural reforms, he reiterated the government’s resolve to “stay the course” on the taxation side; people, process, and technology framework; and digitalisation of  the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
On the public financing side, the finance minister said, “Its important that whatever we are doing — including the rightsizing of the federal government — we are taking it in waves rather than a big bang approach and we will continue on that journey.”
 
 

Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.
Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.
Pakistan’s total revenue for the current fiscal year was budgeted at Rs17,815bn. After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs7,438bn, the net revenue stood at Rs10,377bn, representing a significant 48.7pc increase from the fiscal year 2023-24.</p><small>2025-05-26 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606257-sunni-ittehad-council-not-entitled-to-reserved-seats-observes-sc-judge' target='_blank'><strong>Sunni Ittehad Council not entitled to reserved seats, observes SC judge</strong></a><br><p>

In its July 12, 2024 short order, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of 80 MNAs were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the single largest party in the National Assembly.
However, the ruling had not been implemented by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
An 11-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today after Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had dismissed the review petitions on the first day of hearings.
The proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel.
The other 10 members of the bench are Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.
During today’s hearing, Justice Mandokhail observed that it was not a political party that contested the elections but rather its candidates.
Senior counsel Makh­do­­om Ali Khan appeared on behalf of PML-N and PPP women candidates affected by the July 2024 ruling and concluded his arguments. The ECP and PML-N lawyers also informed the court that they had submitted their written responses. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow (Tuesday).
Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as inadmissible and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.
Justice Ayesha had formally complained to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC’s website.
 
 

In her judgement, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would “not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself”.
The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which allied with the PTI during the 2024 elections and was a party in the reserved seats case, had requested the bench to put off the hearing until challenges to the 26th Amendment were decided and to include judges who had heard the original case.
However, the CB dismissed those pleas, with Justice Aminuddin observing that review petitions could be heard even by a bench smaller than the original bench after the 26th Amendment.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Makhdoom began presenting his arguments, Justice Hilali wondered how the SIC could be eligible for reserved seats.
“How can independent lawmakers join a political party that is not in the parliament? Did SIC take part in the elections?” she asked, at which the PPP lawyer replied that the party had not participated in the polls and that even its chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza had contested as an independent candidate.
Tug-of-war over reserved seats
In its detailed verdict on the reserved seats case, which was authored by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC had observed that the ECP’s numerous “unlawful acts and omissions” had “caused confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates and the electorate who voted for PTI”.
 
 

It had also castigated the ECP for failing to fulfil its “role as a guarantor institution and impartial steward” of electoral processes.
On September 14, 2024 — the day the government was supposed to lay the 26th Amendment in both Houses of the parliament but could not — the Supreme Court, through a clarification, had reprimanded the ECP for not implementing its July 12 ruling in the reserved seats case.
Later on October 18, in yet another clarification, Justice Shah reiterated that the effect of an amendment made in the Elections Act 2017 in August last year could not undo the reserved seats case verdict.
 
 

The bill, titled “Elections (Second Amendment) Act, 2024”, was seen as aimed at circumventing the apex court’s verdict on the reserved seats case by barring independent lawmakers from joining a political party after a stipulated period.
A six-judge CB of the apex court was set to take up the PTI’s petition challenging those tweaks to the election laws in December 2024. A separate plea of the PTI against the Jan 13, 2024 ruling denying it its election symbol is also pending before the SC.

The benchmark KSE-100 index declined by 886.10, or 0.74 per cent, to stand at 118,216.57 from the last close of 119,102.67 at 1:13pm.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “delay in budget announcement”, in additional to “lack of clarity” on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions “related to budget pushing investors to trim their exposure”.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, said, “The market is consolidating ahead of the budget, with pressure on the oil sector following media reports of disagreements with the IMF over the circular debt resolution plan and the onset of rollover week.”
“We expect a rerating to the upside once there is clarity on key budgetary measures,” he added.
The government has delayed unveiling the federal budget from June 2 to June 10 due to inconclusive discussions with the IMF on taxation and fiscal measures.
Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “The market is concerned about delays in the release of circular debt payments to companies, as well as the potential rationalisation of tariffs in the upcoming budget.”
On a positive note, he highlighted the reduction in the primary surplus target to 1.6pc of GDP — down from last year’s 2.1pc.
He said that this was “expected to give the government some fiscal space to avoid imposing harsh new taxes, unlike the pattern seen over the past three years”.
“Although the room for significant relief is limited, we expect a relatively more people-centric budget, with emphasis on executing the comprehensive tax reforms initiated under the IMF programme over the last two years,” he said.
On Friday, the stock market had come under renewed selling pressure, forcing the index to close the outgoing in the red as jittery investors trimmed their positions amid fears of an unfriendly IMF-driven federal budget.
Contrary to the preceding week, when the benchmark KSE 100 index recovered a staggering 12,474 points thanks to a US-brokered ceasefire between two nuclear-armed neighbors, the PSX faltered due to lacklustre conditions as investors preferred to remain on the sidelines before the announcement of the budget 2025-26.

Karim was elected unopposed after the position fell vacant following the demise of former emir Professor Sajid Mir on May 3, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Hafiz Abdul Karim on his election and expressed his good wishes for the newly elected chief of the religio-political party.
The PML-N has nominated Hafiz Abdul Karim, who was earlier the secretary-general of JAH, as its candidate for the Senate seat which fell vacant after the demise of Prof Mir.
According to a PML-N press release, party president Nawaz Sharif offered the Senate seat to Prof Mir’s son, Ahmad Mir, but he declined the offer. The PML-N then nominated Karim for the vacant Senate seat.
Karim earlier served as a senator from March 2018 to March 2024 on a technocrat seat from Punjab. He was also a member of the National Assembly from June 2013 to 2018. Besides, he served as the minister for communication in the cabinet of then premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in 2017.
Notable religious and political leader Prof Mir passed away at the age of 86 earlier this month after a heart attack. He was laid to rest in his native Sialkot.
Mir was elected as a PML-N senator in 2021, which was his fifth time contesting the Senate election on the party’s ticket. He had also served as a senator from March 2009 to March 2015.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has announced the election for the vacant general seat from Punjab in the Senate on May 29.</p><small>2025-05-26 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606249-biek-delays-wednesday-exams-due-to-youm-e-takbeer' target='_blank'><strong>BIEK delays Wednesday exams due to Youm-e-Takbeer</strong></a><br><p>

On February 25, the finance ministry had announced it was considering “establishing a National Crypto Council” to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. It later appointed Saqib as chief executive officer of the PPC.
According to a press release issued today, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching Bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.
Additionally, he will also facilitate “licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)” and champion “investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth” in the country.
According to Forbes, Saqib — who is part of their ‘30 under 30’ list — is the cofounder of Tayaba, which the publication describes as “a social enterprise that aims to provide solutions to the water crisis in Pakistan”.
He also received his MBE in 2023 for contributions to the UK’s National Health Service, the statement added.
An MBE, which stands for “Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire”, is awarded for an outstanding achievement or service to the community which has had a long-term, significant impact.
According to the statement today, this appointment reflected the country’s  “commitment to aligning with global trends”.
“Just as the United States has brought leaders like David Sacks — appointed by Donald Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar — into its digital policy framework, Pakistan is taking a forward-thinking approach by empowering a youth leader to help steer national strategy in emerging technologies,” the statement read.
The press release also stated that the country stood at a “critical digital crossroads” — with it consistently ranking in the top 10 globally for crypto adoption, according to the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index.
It noted Pakistan currently had 40 million crypto users and an annual crypto trading volume exceeding $300 billion.
Additionally, it added that the “nation produces around 40,000 IT graduates annually and boasts the 4th largest freelancer market worldwide”.
According to Saqib, “Pakistan’s unique demographic and digital landscape offers an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog into the future of technology—where blockchain and crypto will drive economic growth, innovation, and global competitiveness.”</p><small>2025-05-26 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606229-travelling-to-mountains-make-sure-to-follow-these-safety-tips' target='_blank'><strong>Travelling to mountains?

The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection with the killing of six protesters on Aug 5 last year, the day Sheikh Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.
The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity. Four are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
“The formal trial has begun,” Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangla­desh’s domestic Internatio­nal Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters. “The prosecution believes that this prosecution will be able to prove the crimes done by the accused,” he said.
It is the first formal charge in any case related to the killings during last year’s student-led uprising, which ended Hasina’s iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
Up to 1,400 people were killed in July and August last year when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.
The list of those facing trial includes Dhaka’s former police commissioner, Habibur Rahman, who is among those being tried in absentia.
Hasina fled by helicopter to India, her old ally.
She remains in self-imposed exile, defying Dhaka’s extradition request to face charges of crimes against humanity.
Command responsibility
The launch of the trials of senior figures from Hasina’s government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power as the South Asian nation awaits elections that the interim government has vowed will take place before June next year.
Islam said the eight men were accused of “different responsibilities”, including the most senior for “superior command responsibility, some for direct orders.. (and) some for participation”.

This unsurprisingly results in Malaysia leading the Asia-focused categories of Trip.com’s global rankings.
Named the best in a total of 19 categories, ranging from accommodation to nightlife, the country boasts several establishments that received multiple recognitions.
The popular island of Langkawi earns repeat mentions for its hotels and villas, as well as its Underwater World attraction. Langkawi was also named one of “Asia’s best coastal destinations”.
The only other place in Malaysia crowned best coastal destination is Semporna, a scenic seaside town in Sabah’s east coast.
Meanwhile, the state’s capital city Kota Kinabalu joins Semporna, Langkawi, Melaka and Kuala Lumpur in the “best destinations” category.
Understandably, Kuala Lumpur draws many visits from local and foreign tourists alike. Many of its attractions and restaurants are highlighted in the rankings.
Some of the categories that the city appears in are “best family-friendly destinations” (the only Malaysian spot in this category), “best nightlife (bars)”, “best gourmet hotels”, and “best things to do”. The latter includes Petronas Twin Towers, which was also recognised under “Asia’s best night attractions”.
“It’s truly exciting to see Malaysian establishments being recognised across so many categories in this year’s Trip.Best Global Rankings,” Stephane Thong, general manager of Trip.com Malaysia, said in a press statement.
“From family-friendly hotels and scenic resorts to local culinary gems and iconic attractions, this recognition reflects the richness and diversity of our travel offerings.
“We hope this not only inspires Malaysians to rediscover local favourites but also encourages more international travellers to explore what Malaysia has to offer – especially as we gear up for Visit Malaysia 2026,” Thong added.
Updated annually, Trip.Best is a signature collection of curated travel rankings by the international one-stop travel service provider Trip.com.
The rankings are based on an AI-driven analysis that combines expert insights with user data, which includes verified user ratings, reviews and booking trends.
Aside from Asia, the rankings also focus on other parts of the world. Global highlights include luxury and experiential stays (Paris, Tokyo and New York lead the “global 100 luxury hotels” list) and dining as part of the journey. Paris, New York, Singapore and Bangkok top the fine dining lists.
Seasonal experiences, such as autumn foliage viewing and water-themed fun are now featured in the new categories Fall Views and Water Fun, due to travellers’ growing interest in them.
Family travel continues to thrive, with world-class resorts like Atlantis Sanya in China and Tokyo Disneyland in Japan being named among the best “global family-friendly destinations”.
Theme parks like Walt Disney World (US), Universal Studios Japan and Shanghai Disney Resort remain popular on the “global best things to do” list.
Another highlight is the “Destinations For The Months” feature, which helps travellers plan the best seasonal itineraries, such as heading for Kyoto in winter or Seoul in spring.

Trump on Friday said he was recommending a 50pc tariff go into place on June 1 because of frustration that talks with the EU were not moving quickly enough. The threat roiled global financial markets and intensified a trade war that has been punctuated by frequent changes in tariff policies toward US trading partners and allies.
Trump, who has repeatedly expressed disdain for the EU and its treatment of the US on trade, relented after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told him on Sunday that the EU needed more time to come to an agreement.
She asked him during a call to delay the tariffs until July, the deadline he had originally set when he announced new tariffs in April. Trump told reporters he had granted the request.
“We had a very nice call, and I agreed to move it,” Trump said before returning to Washington after a weekend in New Jersey.
“She said we will rapidly get together and see if we can work something out.” Von der Leyen said in a post on X that she had a “good call” with Trump and that the EU was ready to move quickly.
 






“Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,” she said.
“To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.”
The euro and US dollar rose against the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc after the deadline extension.
In early April, Trump set a 90-day window for trade talks between the EU and the US, which was to end on July 9. But on Friday he upended that timeframe and said he wasn’t interested in a deal at all.
“I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump said then. “We’ve set the deal it’s at 50pc.”
Major US stock indexes and European shares dropped and the dollar weakened as a result.
Trump has sought to upend the world economy with his trade policies, but after his announcement in April of tariffs on multiple countries sparked financial market upheaval, he dialed down his threats in favor of talks. Since then Washington has inked a pact with Britain and has held discussions with China.
But progress with the EU has been more limited, sparking Trump’s ire and adding to broader tensions between the two allies over Trump’s “America first” agenda and Europe’s longtime reliance on Washington for security and defense needs.</p><small>2025-05-26 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606226-18-lives-lost-as-unprecedented-beyond-expectations-rain-batter-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>18 lives lost as 'unprecedented, beyond expectations' rains batter Punjab</strong></a><br><p>

• Demands release of Yasin Malik, others detained in Indian jails
MUZAFFARABAD: A civil society alliance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) campaigning for public rights has given the regional government a deadline of June 8, though Eidul Azha is likely to fall on June 7, to implement its ‘Charter of Demands’, warning of further mass mobilisation in the event of dilly-dallying or inaction.
The announcement was made by Shaukat Nawaz Mir, a prominent leader of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), in his speech in the small hours of Sunday at a massive rally held at Muzaffarabad’s Lal Chowk.
Titled as “Conference of the Martyrs of Jammu and Kashmir and Public Rights”, the rally began on Saturday afternoon, with thousands of participants arriving in caravans from across the region till late evening.
The event continued until dawn on Sunday, during which more than two dozen speakers, including the JKJAAC’s core committee members, addressed the emotionally charged gathering.
 
 

Local hotel and trader associations facilitated the participants by offering free accommodation and meals. The event ended peacefully, much to the relief of the local administration.
The 13-point declaration read out by Mr Mir at the rally addressed internal governance issues, the Kashmir conflict, and the dangers of nuclear war in South Asia.
It stressed that lasting peace between Pakistan and India, as well as in the South Asian region, was impossible without a resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“The international community must ensure the peaceful and permanent settlement of the Kashmir issue as per the collective will of the people and their inalienable right to self-determination under the UN Charter,” the declaration said.
It also warned that if any decision was imposed against the will of Kashmiris, or if war was thrust upon the region, the people across all divided units of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir would reserve the right to peacefully dismantle the so-called “bloody” Line of Control (LoC).
The declaration raised grave concerns about the possibility of a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, and appealed to citizens of both countries as well as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives, Afghanistan and Iran to support Kashmiris’ call for self-determination to prevent becoming collateral in such a conflict.
Demanding the release of prominent Kashmiri resistance leader Yasin Malik and other political prisoners detained in Indian jails, the declaration also condemned “enforced disappearances” in the AJK and “arrests of political activists in Gilgit-Baltistan”.
New 16-point charter
The committee warned the AJK government to fulfil commitments made under a previous agreement regarding a 10-point charter of demands. If implementation was not ensured by June 8, the alliance said it would announce its next course of action during a representative meeting in the Mirpur division.
“We caution the rulers: if we are compelled to issue another protest call, they will not be able to escape its repercussions,” Mr Mir said.
The alliance also rejected the recent increase in perks and privileges for AJK’s elite, calling it a mockery of public sentiment. It reiterated its demand for complete reversal of these benefits.
In a strong rebuttal, Mr Mir dismissed Prime Minister Anwarul Haq’s allegations of “RAW funding” for the protest movement, terming them baseless and malicious.
“Our movement is being funded by donations from local residents and overseas Kashmiris, with complete transparency ensured through social media disclosures,” he said.
According to the JKJAAC, the newly introduced 16-point charter — formally adopted at a core committee meeting in Dhirkot (Bagh) on May 21 — would now be pursued alongside the earlier demands.
 
 

The new demands included free and equitable access to education and healthcare, employment opportunities, establishment of international airports in AJK, provision of clean drinking and irrigation water, construction of the Taobat-Bhimber Expressway, elimination of corruption, bribery and favouritism in government departments, interest-free loans for youth, regulation of exploitative cellular companies, quotas and financial support for persons with disabilities, and tax exemptions.
It also called for reform of judicial privileges and procedures, including transparent appointments, timely hearings and judicial accountability, to ensure the protection of public rights.
The declaration strongly criticised the continued violation of Article 52-C of the Interim Constitution and a 2019 AJK High Court ruling on hydropower resources, terming them detrimental to the rule of law.
Another key demand was the abolition of 12 legislative seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees living in Pakistan. The committee asserted that these seats had become instruments of exploitation and obstacles to local ownership and self-governance, and their immediate abolition was essential.
Instead, the refugees residing within AJK should be granted legislative representation and ownership rights, particularly those displaced after 1989, the JKJAAC stressed.
It further demanded an immediate halt to what it called the unconstitutional and unethical diversion of development funds from AJK to the so-called 12 constituencies in Pakistan, describing it as a form of open corruption.
It also opposed job quotas for refugees settled in Pakistan, calling them unjust to the residents of AJK. “The right to employment in the liberated territory must be restricted to those living within it,” it added.

Shockingly, the official vehicles in the use of top-ranked officers were spotted violating the traffic laws. They included inspector general of police, Lahore Commissioner and DC, DGs of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Pakistan Post, Agriculture, Excise and Taxation, Punjab Food Authority and Health Services, Lesco CEO and additional chief secretaries.
It was revealed in a report formed by the City Traffic Police (CTP) Lahore, carrying the record of total 3,896 official vehicles that were spotted ignoring traffic rules.
As per the report, the Punjab Police was at the top among other federal and provincial departments whose 496 official vehicles committed traffic violations in Lahore, followed by 358 vehicles of the Services & General Administration Dept and 328 of the Lahore Electricity Supply Company (Lesco).

Vehicles of IGP, commissioner, DC, FIA DG, other top officers found committing violations, not paying fines

About the departments, the traffic police said many vehicles belonged to the CM Monitoring Cell, Law, Parliamentary Affairs & Human Rights Department Punjab, the Pakistan Railways, Punjab Revenue Authority, Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd, National Highways Authority, Ministry of Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines, Punjab Home Department, the Environment Protection Department Punjab, the Lahore Development Authority.
A vehicle (LRZ 6076), in the use of an SP, violated the traffic laws 107 times (highest violations) in Lahore and fines imposed on this vehicle, amounting to Rs50,300, were still unpaid. Another vehicle (LZR 9872), which was under the use of the Punjab Agriculture DG, violated the traffic regulations 83 times and its Rs74,000 fine was not paid. An official vehicle (LWQ 1235) belonging to the additional chief secretary (S&GAD) Punjab committed 47 violations and its fine Rs21,300 was still unpaid. Seven other vehicles belonging to the same officer were spotted violating traffic laws 65 times.
The report further revealed that 300 vehicles which violated traffic laws belonged to Wapda, 184 to Livestock & Dairy Department, 181 PTCL, 130 SNGPL, 122 irrigation department, 117 of PFA Punjab, 107 DC office, 102 belonged to the Lahore Cantonment Board, 104 National Highways Authority, 99 of agriculture department, 89 LDA, 76 Pakistan Railways, 69 Punjab Revenue Authority, 68 of Punjab health department, 61 Punjab Horticulture Authority, 42 of Punjab Home Department, 41 of Ring Road Authority, 40 of Punjab Board of Revenue, 37 of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, 31 of FIA etc.
An official said the statistics came to the limelight when the Punjab Safe City cameras spotted the vehicles and issued them e-challan tickets. The city traffic police conducted detailed investigations and found out that these vehicles belonged to 73 departments.
Another irritating part of the development is that all officials in charge of these vehicles never bothered to pay fines, prompting the traffic police high-ups to write them letters to ‘identify the violators and pay fees’ besides initiating action against them.
Lahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Athar Waheed has brought the matter to the notice of Chief Secretary Zahid Akthar Zaman and IGP Dr Usman Anwar. He has requested the both higher officers of the province to intervene to stop violations being committed by those running the province.
On the other hand, the traffic police lodged 4,541 FIRs against the citizens for violating traffic rules in Lahore during the last 10 days. Many of them were arrested on the spot, the official said.

The latest victim, Sheema Ibrahim, was undergoing treatment at Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta, where she died of her injuries. She was the daughter of a Levies official and had been in critical condition since the explosion.
 
 

The fatalities now include eight APS students, seven girls and one boy, along with two adults. On the day of the attack, three students — Saniya Soomro (Grade 6), Hafza Kausar (Grade 7) and Ayesha Saleem (Grade 10) — died on the spot. In the days that followed, Haider, Mala­ika and Sehr Saleem succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment. The identity of one more student could not be ascertained.
Security officials have condemned the assault, alleging foreign involvement in the targeted attack on schoolchildren. “Eight innocent lives have fallen victim to India’s campaign of terrorism within Pakistan,” a senior security official said.

With feel-like temperature soaring past 40°C and humidity adding to the misery, frustration among the public reached boiling point.
The Sakhi Hassan hydrant is the only operational hydrant supplying water to the densely populated Central district.
The protesters, including women and children, blocked both sides of the road outside the hydrant, disrupting traffic for hours.
Many carried empty water containers, which is a symbol of the growing desperation in the city, already reeling under infrastructural challenges.

Many areas continue to face severe shortage

For over a month, large parts of Karachi, particularly in the Central district, have been experiencing a severe water shortage.
Areas like Buffer Zone, North Karachi, North Nazimabad, Federal B Area and Shadman Town have reported little to no water supply for weeks, forcing residents to rely on expensive private water tankers or travel long distances to fetch water.
“This is not the first protest,” said Shahid Ali, a resident of Shadman Town. “We protested here two weeks ago. The authorities made promises, but nothing changed. We’re still without water. How long can people survive like this?”
The city’s total daily water demand is estimated at over 1,200 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the supply falls drastically short, hovering around 550 to 600 MGD even under optimal conditions.
Both experts and officials agree that chronic infrastructure issues, rampant water theft, deep-rooted corruption within Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation and poor governance have further exacerbated the situation.
Electricity outage at Gharo pump
The fresh crisis got further deeper when the KWSC issued a statement attributing the latest disruption to a technical fault caused by a power outage at the Gharo Pumping Station — a critical component of the city’s water supply network.
According to the KWSC spokesman, a cable fault at 10:35am led to a complete shutdown of the pumping station.
“Due to a cable fault on KE’s network, the Gharo Pumping Station is non-operational at the moment,” the statement read. “We are in continuous coordination with KE to restore operations. However, the fault has not yet been resolved.”
The Gharo Pumping Station is responsible for supplying nearly 30 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to key areas of Karachi, including Port Qasim, Bin Qasim Town, Shah Faisal Town, PNS Mehran, PAF Base Faisal, and Karsaz. With its operations stalled, several districts face further strain on already stretched water resources.

Countries Israel had long counted on as allies have been adding their voices to growing international pressure after it expanded its operations against Hamas.
Madrid is hosting 20 cou­ntries as well as international organisations with the aim of “stopping this war, which no longer has any goal”, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Alb­a­res told France Info radio.
Humanitarian aid must enter Gaza “massively, unimpeded, neutrally, so that it is not Israel who decides who can eat and who cannot”, he said.
The meeting, which also includes representatives from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, will promote a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A previous such gathering in Madrid last year brought together countries  including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye as well as Euro­pean nations such as Ireland and Norway that have recognised a Palestinian state.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast that the city will continue to face hot and humid weather throughout the coming week, with conditions expected to worsen toward the end of the week.
According to a Met department official, the coming Thursday and Friday could be particularly intense, with daytime temperatures potentially exceeding 40 degrees Celsius.
The rising humidity levels, he said, are also expected to persist, which could result in higher “feels-like” temperatures, raising concerns for heat-related health risks.
“The weather pattern indicates a significant rise in temperatures, especially during the latter half of the week,” said the PMD official. “Karachiites should prepare themselves for extremely hot days and avoid unnecessary outdoor activities during peak hours.”

The mushroom growth of illegal cattle markets in densely populated localities of the city have also posed risks to safety for pedestrians and residents.
Several illegal cattle markets were found established in an organised manner by mounting large tents, provision of electricity, security guards and entry points in different parts of the city.
Illegal cattle markets were established underneath the Gizri flyover, at the backside of Dubai Palace in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Plot 39 and adjacent ground near Mosimiat in Block-6, in Scheme 33, Yousuf Goth and near Rais Goth at Hub River Road in district Keamari and near Kala Pul in district South.
Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, who had recently through a notification imposed a ban on illegal cattle markets and roadside sale of livestock, said that the city’s administration was taking strict measures to regulate market activities and ensure compliance with municipal regulations.

Commissioner has allowed markets for sacrificial animals only at 14 spots in seven districts

He said that any market operating without permission from the city administration was considered illegal and would face action.
The illegal cattle markets, which emerged mainly on roadsides and open spaces along the streets, not only cause traffic disruption in different localities, but also create sanitation issues.
Hundreds of thousands of sacrificial animals from various parts of the country are brought for sale in the city on the occasion of the religious festival and many small traders move the livestock to different areas and set up illegal cattle markets.
In many areas across the city, seasonal traders occupy open spaces along the streets and roads, establishing their trading hubs with a dozen or so animals.
Residents of several localities said that the traders brought their animals on the streets a little after dusk and continue their business late in the night, disrupting both vehicular and pedestrian flow.
A resident of Burns Road, Muhammad Shahid, said that the entire vicinity was stinking with the animal waste as several lanes had become trading hub of the sacrificial animals.
The city administration had imposed Section 144 of the criminal procedure code in the city for one month to ensure orderly arrangements for cattle markets.
As per the commissioner’s order, the sale of animals will be banned at the places, other than the permitted cattle markets.
Karachi’s seven district administrations have allowed animal markets at 14 spots in the city.
Officials said that the strict orders had been issued to the authorised market organisers regarding cleanliness, security, and noise prevention.
They said that an effective system for disposing of animal remains and waste had also been imposed in all markets and action would be taken against violators under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The officials said that the crackdown on illegal cattle market was in full swing and the action against illegal trading hubs was being taken on day to day basis.
They said that over 40 unauthorised cattle markets had so far been removed in different parts of the city.
They officials said that the 18 unauthorized markets were removed in district Malir, three in Korangi, four in Central, 12 in East, three in Keamari and two in South.
The illegal trading hubs have even emerged along with the major arteries of the city, including M.A Jinnah Road.

Lahore Qalandars were Pakistan Super League champions again, sealing their third title in four seasons after pulling off a remarkable chase.
Quetta Gladiators had been in the ascendancy in Sunday’s final, headed towards what they believed was their destiny — a second PSL crown — having clinched their first six long years ago. They had tightened the noose around the Qalandars, who, in their chase of 202, needed 57 runs to win off the last 20 deliveries when Raza joined Perera at the crease.
But the Qalandars found inspiration, as Gladiators lost theirs; Perera played a masterful knock of an unbeaten 31-ball 62 featuring four sixes and five fours, with Raza providing the ideal foil with 22 off seven balls to take their side home with a ball to spare. As their teammates ran onto the pitch in jubilation, the Gladiators sank to the ground, left wondering what could have been.
 


Raza, who had flown in from England after featuring for Zimbabwe in a four-day Test that only ended on Saturday and only arrived 10 minutes before the toss for the final, began the recovery when he deposited the first two balls he faced for a four and a six. The hits, both in the mid-wicket region, came immediately after Mohammad Amir had dismissed Bhanuka Rajapaksa to put the Gladiators on top.

Perera, Raza star in nerve-jangling last-over victory against Quetta Gladiators to seal third title in four seasons

Perera launched the offensive from the other end; the left-hander — who only came into the Qalandars’ side after the PSL was halted with eight games to go due to Pakistan-India skirmishes — hit Khurram Shahzad for two sixes and then punished Amir in the penultimate over for two fours and a slog-sweep for six.
That left Qalandars needing 13 off the final over and Raza came to the fore after Hasan Nawaz, who had earlier scored 76 for Gladiators, acrobatically saved a boundary. The Zimbabwean slashed an audacious six over point and then used his wrists to spark Qalandars’ celebrations in front of a partisan home crowd.
Qalandars skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi ran to lift Raza on his shoulders. The pacer — who was the pick of Lahore’s bowlers with 3-24 — had given his side the ideal start in the final when he dismissed his Gladiators counterpart Saud Shakeel early on. Saud’s opening partner Finn Allen departed in the third over, but Hasan checked Qalandar’s building momentum.
 
 

On the first six balls he faced, Hasan got two fours and a massive six over long-on. Rilee Roussow, at the other end, was also dealing in boundaries; his first three scoring shots being two fours and a pull off Haris Rauf for six. The left-hander then found joy on the off side, getting two fours in the sixth over by Salman, and the Gladiators ending the powerplay at 57-2. Rossouw, however, fell soon after, with Raza striking as the South African found Shaheen at short cover.
Losing his partner didn’t stop Hasan, though. Rishad Hossain was belted for two fours off the first three balls of the eighth over. Raza was then deposited for six in the next over before Hasan took Rishad to the cleaners in the 10th with 6, 4, 4 off the first three balls to raise his 50 off just 21 balls as Gladiators got to 100-3 at the midway point of their innings.
Avishka Fernando (29) hit five fours before becoming Rishad’s first victim, but Hasan — seemingly struggling with an injury — kept going on, using brute force to dispatch Raza over his head for six more and he got lucky when he was spilled by Fakhar Zaman two overs later.
Dinesh Chandimal chipped in with 22, hitting two sixes, before holing Shaheen to substitute Mohammad Azab on the second ball of the 18th over with Hasan’s 43-ball knock ending four deliveries later when he found Raza at wide long-on.
Haris returned to dismiss Amir and Abrar Ahmed as Gladiators seemed to crumble late on, but Faheem Ashraf (28 not out) pulled and flicked Salman for three sixes in the final over to take his side to 201-9.
 
 

Mohammad Naeem (46) got Qalandars off to a flier in their chase, bludgeoning Faheem for two sixes, but just when he was threatening to take it away from the Gladiators single-handedly, he saw his partner Fakhar trapped lbw by Abrar.
Naeem survived after Usman Tariq dropped a sitter and with Abdullah Shafique crunching a glorious late cut for four off Abrar, Qalandars reached 56-1 by the end of the powerplay. Naeem hit six sixes in his 27-ball innings, which ended when Faheem had him caught at deep square, bringing Perera to the crease.
Abdullah made 41 off 28 with four fours and a six, but after he top-edged Usman to be caught in the 13th over, the Gladiators seemed to have reined in the Qalandars, who needed 71 off the last five overs. Rajapaksa never got going, but his dismissal only paved the way for Qalandars’ stunning late charge.

• Both sides reaffirm principled support for ‘core concerns’, including Kashmir dispute; call for Gaza ceasefire
• Premier advocates investments in renewable energy, IT, defence production, agriculture
ISLAMABAD: In the first leg of his four-country tour, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday arrived in Turkiye, where he met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to not only thank Ankara for its support during recent tensions with India but also cement bilateral economic cooperation.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” said an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Sunday.
In his meeting with President Erdogan, the PM advocated joint ventures and enhanced bilateral investment, highlighting key sectors, including renewable energy, information technology, defence production, infrastructure development, and agriculture as potential areas of mutual interest.
The two leaders also conducted a comprehensive review of the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reiterated their resolve to elevate the strategic partnership. They also followed up on the implementation of key decisions taken during the 7th session of the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC), held in Islamabad on Feb 13 this year. Both sides agreed to take steps to achieve the $5 billion annual bilateral trade target agreed earlier by the two leaders.
 
 

In addition to bilateral issues, Prime Minister Shehbaz and President Erdogan discussed pressing regional and international developments. They also expressed concern over the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, urgently calling for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to the affected Palestinian population.
PM Shehbaz, who was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of Turkiye for their unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent developments in South Asia. He lauded Turkiye’s principled stance and the outpouring support of goodwill of the Turkish people for Pakistan and termed it as a source of great comfort and strength for Pakistan.
 






The premier highlighted the commitment, courage and the spirit of sacrifice of the armed forces of Pakistan and the resolute patriotism that was demonstrated in an unprecedented manner, which contributed to Pakistan’s victory in Marak-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.
According to state-run PTV News, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minis­ter Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also participated in the meeting.
Moreover, both leaders also presided over a delegation-level meeting between the two sides.
Earlier, on his arrival at the airport, the PM was received by Defence Minister Yashar Guler, Istanbul Deputy Governor Erdogan Turan Ermis, Pakistan’s ambassador in Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, and other diplomats.
After the two-day Turkiye visit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan during this week.
During the visits, he is expected to hold “wide-ranging discussions” with the nations while acknowledging their support during Pakistan’s recent escalation with India.
According to Dawn.com, in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Confe­rence on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dus­hanbe, on May 29 and 30.
 
 

The visit comes a fortnight after Pakistan and India reached a US-brokered ceasefire following a brief military confrontation. During the conflict, the Iranian foreign minister visited both nations to act as a mediator. According to the FO’s statement, the PM will have “wide-ranging discussions” with the leaders of the four countries on issues including bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance.
Pakistan, Uzbekistan ties
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Mini­ster Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich discussed bilateral relations and the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project in a phone call on Sunday, the Foreign Office said in a press release.
During the conversation, the two leaders expressed optimism about the early finalisation of the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project.
The ministers also exchanged views on the regional situation, according to the statement.

Ukraine’s emergency services described a night of  “terror” as Russia launched a second straight night of massive air strikes, including on the capital Kyiv.
The renewed strikes came after Russia launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 drones overnight Friday to Saturday, which wounded 15.

Kyiv seeks more global pressure on Moscow

Ukraine’s military said on Sunday it had shot down a total of 45 Russian missiles and 266 attack drones overnight. Air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said a total of 298 drones were launched, adding that this was “the highest number ever”.
 
 

Four people were reported dead in Ukraine’s western Khmelnytskyi region, four in the Kyiv region, and one in Mykolaiv in the south. Emer­gency services said 16 people were also injured in the Kyiv region, including three children.
“Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. “The silence of America, the silence of others around the world only encourages Putin,” he said, adding:  “Sanctions will certainly help.”
EU’s diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called for  “the strongest internatio­nal pre­ssure on Russia to stop this war.”
Russia, meanwhile, said its strikes were aimed at Ukraine’s  “military-industrial complex” and said it had brought down 110 Ukrainian drones.

• Man whose nine children killed battling for life in ICU
CAIRO: Israeli military strikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, including a journalist and a rescue service official, health authorities said.
The latest deaths resulted from Israeli strikes in Khan Yunis, Jabalia and Nuseirat areas, medics said.
In Jabalia, local journalist Hassan Majdi Abu Warda and several family members died when an air strike hit his house.
The air strike in Nuseirat killed Ashraf Abu Nar, a senior official in the territory’s civil emergency service, and his wife in their house, medics added.
There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military.
The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said Abu Warda’s death raised the number of Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, to 220.
 


In a separate statement, the media office said Israeli forces were in control of 77 per cent of the Gaza Strip, either through ground forces or evacuation orders and bombardment that keeps residents away from their homes.
Islamic Jihad, a wing of Hamas, said that fighters had carried out ambushes and attacks using bombs and anti-tank rockets against Israeli forces in several areas across Gaza.
Meanwhile, the father of nine children killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza over the weekend remains in intensive care, said a doctor at the hospital treating him.
Hamdi Al-Najjar, himself a doctor, was at home in Khan Yunis with his 10 children when an Israeli air strike occurred, killing all but one of them. He was rushed to the nearby Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza where he is being treated for his injuries.
Abdul Aziz Al-Farra, a thoracic surgeon, said Najjar had undergone two operations to stop bleeding in his abdomen and chest and that he sustained other wounds including to his head.
“May God heal him and help him,” Farra said, speaking by the bedside of an intubated and heavily bandaged Najjar.

The Israeli military confirmed it conducted an air strike on Khan Yunis on Friday. The military is looking into claims that “uninvolved civilians” were killed, it said, adding that the forces had evacuated civilians from the area before the strike began.
According to medical officials in Gaza, the nine children were aged between one and 12 years. The child that survived, a boy, is in a serious but stable condition, the hospital said.
Najjar’s wife, Alaa, also a doctor, was not at home at the time of the strike. She was treating Palestinians injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza in the same hospital where her husband and son are receiving care.
“She went to her house and saw her children burned, may God help her,” said Tahani Yahya Al-Najjar of her sister-in-law.
“With everything we are going through only God gives us strength.”
Tahani visited her brother in hospital on Sunday, whispering to him that she was there: “You are okay, this will pass.”

The Resettlement Programme in Pakistan has been active since the 1980s and more than 20,000 vulnerable refugees have now departed for resettlement to third countries to find safety and rebuild their lives, UNHCR says in its latest resettlement factsheet on Pakistan Operation.
In 2021, following the changed situation in Afghanistan, there was a renewed interest by the international community in the resettlement of Afghan refugees, leading to an increase in resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
 
 

The US topped the list of nine countries that accepted Afghan refugees for resettlement. The US accepted 10,823 Afghan refugees, followed by Australia (4,362), Canada (2,253), the United Kingdom (954), New Zealand (817), Norway (248), Sweden (182), Finland (116), and Italy (72).

Over 300,000 Afghans returned, deported by Pakistan, Iran in a month, says IFRC

Since 2021, several diplomatic missions in Pakistan established their own “Safe Passage” programmes to facilitate the evacuation and relocation of Afghan nationals affiliated with their foreign missions in Afgha­nistan, they are outside the framework of UNHCR’s Resettle­ment Programme, the agency clarified.
“Resettlement is unique in that it is the only durable solution that involves the relocation of refugees from an asylum country to a third country,” the UNHCR said. Those prioritised include survivors of violence, vulnerable women and girls, at-risk children, and individuals with serious medical conditions.
Worsening crisis
Meanwhile, the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) warned that Afghanistan’s humanitarian crisis — marked by extreme poverty, food insecurity, and a strained health system — is worsening due to a mass influx of returnees, largely triggered by Pakistan’s Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“This influx of Afghan nationals has put further strain on an already fragile infrastructure, complicating efforts to provide essential services to those in need,” the IFRC said.
 
 

Last month, the IFRC launched a Federation-wide Emergency Appeal in response to escalating humanitarian needs, seeking 25 million Swiss francs to scale up multi-sectoral immediate and longer-term assistance.
In April, over 144,500 people returned from Pakistan, with more than 29,900 deported. “During the month of April, between 4,000 and 6,000 people were arriving in Afgha­nistan each day,” the IFRC reported.
The influx of returnees, amidst persistent drought, pre-existing internal displacements, and deteriorating economic conditions, is placing immense pressure on already overstretched services.
Adding to the pressure, returns from Iran are also increasing due to policy shifts hindering access to legal protection. Between March 20 and April 30, 170,200 Afghans arrived from Iran. The combined returns from Pakistan and Iran, exceeding 300,000 in April alone, are placing “extreme pressure” on Afghanistan’s border regions and urban areas ill-equipped for such large movements, the IFRC concluded.

Warsaw’s pro-EU mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who is backed by Poland’s centrist government, will square off against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki.
As they marched, Nawrocki’s supporters sang patriotic and religious songs and held up signs calling for an end to immigration.
“Change is coming. We will win!”, Nawrocki told the crowd.
“I am Polish and so I am voting for a candidate who will guarantee our future and act as a counterbalance to the current government,” said Piotr Slaby, a financial sector worker from the city of Przemysl, in southeastern Poland.
Piotr Nowak, a technician from Warsaw, 41, said: “We have a cosmopolitan government. They want to introduce the euro and we will lose our sovereignty.” Organisers estimated there were around 200,000 people at the Nawrocki rally while Prime Minister Donald Tusk said 500,000 people had attended the pro-Trzaskowski rally.
But an analysis by the Onet media outlet estimated the size of the Nawrocki rally at 70,000 and the Trzaskowski one at up to 160,000.
Opinion polls are predicting a dead heat, with both candidates on 46.3 per cent.
Trzaskowski, 53, won the first round of the election on May 18 by a razor-thin margin, getting 31 per cent against 30 percent for 42-year-old Nawrocki.

Beijing and Jakarta are key economic allies, with Chinese companies pouring capital into extracting Indonesian natural resources in recent years, particularly in the nickel sector.
But the two countries’ disputed claims into the strategic waterways of the South China Sea and its nearby territories have weighed on their relationship in recent years.
In a meeting with Indonesian Presi­dent Prabowo Subianto on Sunday, Li said Beijing was keen to advance cooperation with Indonesia. “China is willing to work together with Indonesia... to carry forward our tradition of friendship, and to strengthen solidarity and cooperation,” Li said.
Prabowo also echoed Indonesia’s “close and good” friendship with China.
“Indonesia is ready to create a safe and prosperous region. Indonesia is ready to strengthen cooperation with China for us to create a peaceful region, which is safe for all,” Prabowo said.
Prabowo and Li oversaw the signings of several agreements, pledging closer cooperation in areas including economic development and finance. 
The presidential palace later announced that eight other agreements were signed in sectors covering tourism, health, investment and media.

Inflation is on the decline, the rupee has remained relatively stable, and remittances have picked up. The government’s fiscal discipline, supported by timely decisions around interest rate management, energy pricing, and the International Monetary Fund-programme compliance has helped rebuild confidence among international partners and investors. Business sentiment, while still cautious, is improving, and the groundwork for a more stable financial environment is being laid. 
These are significant achievements. Steering the economy out of crisis mode and back onto a path of growth is no small feat. But as the country looks to deepen these gains and build a more resilient system, attention must now shift toward long-term structural fairness, particularly in the tax regime for individual contributors, of which the salaried class is the biggest component.
Studies indicate that real income for Pakistanis has declined by an estimated 15 per cent over the past few years. This has been a result of inflation, currency devaluation, taxation, and wages that have not kept pace with rising costs. Essential expenses like housing and education surged, further straining household budgets. These factors collectively eroded real income, making financial stability increasingly difficult for many Pakistanis. 
Of all these factors, perhaps taxation is the easiest lever to provide relief to the salaried, tax-paying middle class — who pay significantly more in taxes compared to other groups, in fact, the Federal Board of Revenue’s own statistics indicate that the middle income group pays around 200pc more in taxes than the Association of Persons (AOPs) and nearly three times more than the business sector. This is true even though businesses and AOPs collectively account for a far larger portion of Pakistan’s economic activity.  

Studies indicate that real income for Pakistanis has declined by an estimated 15pc over the past few years

This unfairly heavy taxation reduces take-home pay, limiting the ability of salaried individuals to save, invest, or spend on non-essential goods and services. This can stifle domestic demand and dampen economic activity, lower living standards and push skilled professionals to seek opportunities abroad as they struggle to move up economically. The disparity also discourages productivity and encourages tax evasion or underreporting.  
Beyond that, studies by the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority and the International Labour Organisation indicate that more than 40pc of Pakistan’s economy operates informally. That means a large portion of businesses, whether they are in wholesale trade, real estate, retail, or agriculture, function without properly recording income, paying taxes, or even registering with authorities. In effect, this creates two parallel economies: one visible, over-regulated, and overtaxed, and the other under the radar. 
The lack of enforcement against non-filers and informal businesses makes tax evasion relatively risk-free on the one hand while on the other, salaried individuals face an automatic deduction of tax and strict penalties for even minor delays in filing. This incentivises employers to offer deferred payments and even outsource jobs into the informal sector, weakening labour protections and reducing long-term tax revenue. 
Frequent audits and tax evaluations create financial and psychological stress for individuals. Many salaried professionals and business owners face lengthy scrutiny, often leading to unexpected tax demands. The lack of transparency in audit selection raises concerns about fairness, and increased audits also discourage compliance, as taxpayers fear harassment rather than facilitation.
This imbalance has long-term consequences, not just for individuals, but also for the overall economy. If formal and transparent taxpayers continue to account for an exponential share, whilst others operate outside the system with little consequence, then the incentive to remain compliant erodes. It is important to provide relief to the salaried class while encouraging formalisation. One quick fix for this is by raising the taxable income threshold to Rs1.2m and abolishing the 10pc surcharge on individuals earning over Rs10m. 
It’s important for all sectors to contribute in proportion to their size in the economy. Measures such as digitising tax records, using data analytics to identify non-filers, and removing discretionary exemptions are imperative. 
However, unless such measures are part of a larger, consistent reform effort, they risk being short-term fixes to a structural problem. The goal should be to reward formalization, not just reduce the penalties of being in the system. Much like the reduction in sales tax for digital payments made through cards at restaurants, there should be a real incentive to file taxes. The government can also consider restoring the tax credits on investments, insurance, education, and housing that can ease cost pressures for the salaried class.
These proposed measures are not novel; they have been part of Pakistan’s tax system in the past and can be reintroduced through policy consistency and technology integration. Actively using existing data sets like electricity bills, property records, vehicle registration, and travel histories to identify non-filers, and ensuring enforcement mechanisms are applied uniformly, is an easy solution for the narrow base problem. Exemptions and tax holidays that are no longer economically justified should be phased out, and compliance should be made simpler through streamlined digital filing systems. 
People are more likely to comply when they have an answer to where their taxes are being used. An annual Taxpayer Report showing how revenues were used for infrastructure, education, healthcare, and other services, can help rebuild trust in the system and make the tax-paying process more transparent.

The event featured opening remarks by Muhammad Aurangzeb, Federal Finance Minister, Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Chairperson of the PSX, and Irfan Siddiqui, Founding CEO & President of Meezan Bank. Their message was loud and clear, a powerful signal to the market underscoring the importance of Islamic climate finance and the issuance of Green Sukuk rooted in ethical values and environmental sustainability. 
The market reacted positively, with the maiden issue oversubscribed by 5.4 times within just two hours, receiving bids exceeding Rs161bn.
The Debt Office at the Ministry of Finance, along with the Joint Financial Advisors for the Sukuk — led by Meezan Bank and the PSX, played a pivotal role in addressing the major challenges of the inaugural issuance. 

By tapping into the green Islamic finance market, the government not only diversifies its funding sources but also aligns with its international climate commitments

These included the development of Pakistan’s first sovereign Sustainable Investment Sukuk Framework and its approval by the federal cabinet, fostering market development and awareness for the new concept of Green Sukuk, and conducting sessions and online webinars for the general public and Non-Resident Pakistanis (NRPs) and motivating local financial institutions, asset management companies and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) sensitive investors to bid in the auction. 
Pakistan’s entry into the market aligns with the growing international focus on climate-sensitive finance. As of September 2024, the global green bond market has exceeded $3.4 trillion. S&P Global estimates green bond issuance in 2024 will reach a record $622bn, while the London Stock Exchange Group reports that the outstanding ESG Sukuk market has surpassed $50bn this year.
Green Sukuk is a convenient and ethical way to generate liquidity and are widely used by governments to generate local and international funding under a Shariah-compliant mechanism while avoiding interest. These Sukuk are innovations in green and social finance in which proceeds from Sukuk issuance are used to finance environmentally and socially sustainable projects like renewable energy, infrastructure development, or social welfare.
The country’s first sovereign Green Sukuk issuance has positively highlighted Pakistan’s image and role in sustainability and environmental protection efforts, and going forward, this initiative will pave the way for solving various climate-linked problems and generate much-needed funds.
The emergence of Pakistan as a new player in the Green Sukuk market, following the footsteps of Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Turkey, represents a pivotal moment in the nation’s economic and environmental strategy and its alignment to the conversion strategy toward an interest-free financial system.
The inaugural statutory liquidity requirement eligible Ijarah Green Sukuk (GIGS) was launched under the government’s Sustainable Investment (SI) Sukuk Framework, approved by the cabinet in April this year. This framework is designed with the international best practices in view and is aimed at promoting projects in line with Maqasid-e-Shariah (objectives of Shariah) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). 
The Sukuk was floated via PSX and issued through the Pakistan Domestic Sukuk Company Limited (PDSCL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Ministry of Finance, using a competitive auction mechanism. This financial product blends Islamic finance principles with modern sustainable investment strategies, offering local and foreign investors an opportunity to contribute to Pakistan’s green development.
This Green Sukuk is a three-year variable rental rate instrument based on the concept of ownership of underlying assets by Sukuk investors and subsequent semi-annual rental income with a minimum investment ticket of Rs5,000 to attract small retail investors. 
The auction attracted robust interest from a broad spectrum of investors, including individuals, corporations, financial institutions, and Roshan Digital Account (RDA) holders. Against the initial target of Rs30bn, the bid of over Rs161bn was received at PSX. Given the high demand, the total issue size was increased to Rs31.98 bn The Sukuk was designed to be fully tradable on the PSX, and the transaction was structured in accordance with the Shariah principles approved by the Joint Financial Advisors and Shariah Advisors, including Meezan Bank Limited, Dubai Islamic Bank (Pakistan) Limited, Bank Islami Pakistan Limited, and Bank Alfalah Islamic. 
The proceeds from the Sukuk will be used to develop pre-identified green projects with a focus on clean energy and water conservation, in line with the Sustainable Investment Sukuk Framework. These projects include the Garuk Storage Dam (District Kharan), the Naigaj Dam Project (Dadu, Sindh), and the 26MW Shagarthang Hydropower Project in Skardu. 
In line with the Madasid-e-Shariah, these projects are expected to improve water resource management, increase renewable energy generation, and bolster climate resilience in underdeveloped regions. The Sukuk is also targeted to meet five UN SDG Goals.
The Ministry of Finance will publish an annual Green Sukuk Report to reinforce transparency and further track environmental impact. The report will provide a) details of allocated proceeds and the projects financed, b) unutilised proceeds and their placements, c) project-specific performance indicators, and d) environmental impacts.
The launch of this Green Sukuk comes at a time when Pakistan faces mounting climate-related challenges and growing public debt. By tapping into the green Islamic finance market, the government not only diversifies its funding sources but also aligns with its international climate commitments, including those under the Paris Agreement.
Pakistan’s first Green Sukuk represents a fusion of Islamic finance and sustainable development. With strong investor participation, rigorous oversight mechanisms, and a clear focus on environmental impact, the Green Sukuk issuance marks the beginning of a new chapter in Pakistan’s capital markets.n

By that, I don’t necessarily mean aggregate numbers but rather the complete absence of large businesses, ie companies that do at least a few billion dollars of revenue every year. In fact, outside commercial banks and the oil & gas value chain — the two sectors where the state’s direct and indirect involvement helps — you’d be hard-pressed to find entities that can boast a top line of 10 digits.
While the problem is broad-based, it certainly seems more amplified in technology. Over the last decade, the sector has brought in exports of more than $18 billion and is already among the biggest components of the services industry. Not only that, it is now the single largest driver of corporate activity, accounting for 15 per cent of all new company registrations in FY24.
Yet, for all this growth, there are too few large organisations in technology. Forget the pipedream of a billion dollars; even $50 million is a target too steep for the most part. According to firm-wise data analysis from SBP, “More than 80pc of firms in Pakistan export less than $0.1m, and more than 90pc export less than $0.5m per year.”
The problem is not limited to just export-orientated firms. Those selling to the domestic market, be it consumer or enterprise, struggle to scale beyond a certain point, no matter what the sector. From fashion retail to food chains, there is a visible cap that companies struggle to break through. Of course, part of the reason relates to the purchasing power problems in Pakistan, which have only worsened in the last few years.

The motivation behind M&As has shifted, becoming less about expansion and more about consolidation

But it’s not the whole story. Pakistani organisations have struggled to scale in part because of their unwillingness to seek inorganic growth, ie mergers and acquisitions (M&A). How many big transactions can you think of in the last few years? While there’s no exact data on this, we recently tried to map all activity for Data Darbar’s Tech and Venture Capital Landscape report 2024.
In the last five years, we found that there have been at least 38 M&A transactions in Pakistan’s broader technology sector, including both product and service businesses. These range from Alibaba’s buyout of Daraz in 2018 to the less-publicised sale of Rider to Truck It In.
The market activity peaked in 2022, in line with overall funding, with 15 transactions, many of them driven by aggressive expansion amid abundant venture capital. That same year, Cloudways, a managed cloud hosting startup, was acquired by US-based DigitalOcean in a $350m deal, comfortably the largest exit ever for a Pakistani-founded company. Similarly, e-commerce platform Bagallery acquired emerce.pk, and fintech firm Tez was bought by Switzerland’s ZoodPay. While many of these deals were purely stock-based, these were confident moves made in an environment where funds were still plentiful, valuations high, and exit conversations aspirational.
However, the motivations behind the­se deals seem to have shifted drastically over time. By 2024, disclosed equity funding for startups in Pakistan had fallen to just $22.5m, its lowest since 2018, down from $75m a year earlier and a far cry from close to $350m around the boom. In this climate, the nature of M&A has become less about expansion and more about consolidation, or even just a face-saving exit.

By 2024, disclosed equity funding for startups in Pakistan had fallen to just $22.5m — its lowest since 2018 — down from $75m a year earlier

Anyway, sticking to the data, we find that most of the transactions, ie 25, have been cross-border in nature. Historically, cross-border M&As dominated, with foreign firms acquiring local assets or, in the case of services firms, Pakistani companies buying small shops abroad. However, of the five M&A deals recorded in 2024, four were domestic, indicating a sharp rise in local consolidation. With global investors more risk-averse, local players have increasingly turned inward, seeking survival through partnership rather than acquisition by international partners.
For the most part, the activity was dominated by service firms, not products, accounting for both the parties in 18 of the 38 deals, while 14 took place between product-driven entities. The remaining six transactions had one of the parties being product-focused. However, the aggregate numbers seem to give a wrong impression because much of the M&A in services was thanks to the acquisition spree undertaken by one single company.
10 Pearls emerges from the data as perhaps the most ambitious example of this new Pakistani archetype. With over a dozen acquisitions spanning multiple continents, the company has effectively used Pakistan as a launchpad for building a global technology services giant. In contrast, product startups remain harder to sell, especially at meaningful valuations, partly because of the high funding amounts they had obtained during good times.
However, Pakistan’s M&A story still has the key missing character: institutional buyers. In the US, Europe, and increasingly India, large corporations, from banks and telcos to private equity acquire small and medium enterprises to fast-track distribution or buy into disruptive business models.
Local conglomerates and financial institutions, despite having the balance sheets, have shown little appetite for acquiring startups, often citing regulatory uncertainty, risk aversion, or lack of internal capacity to integrate young tech companies. The result is a bottleneck: founders cannot exit, investors cannot recycle capital, and early-stage deal flow suffers.

According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), nine “Indian-sponsored khawarij” were killed in three separate engagements.
“An intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in Dera Ismail Khan district, on [the] reported presence of Indian sponsored khwarij,” the military’s media wing said, using the term designating terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
During the engagement, security forces “effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell”.
According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in Tank District and two more Indian-sponsored khawarij were “sent to hell” by the security forces.
In the third operation in Khyber district’s Bagh area, “own troops successfully neutralised three more Indian-sponsored khawarij”, the ISPR said.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari both expressed appreciation for the security forces following the operations, The Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Due to [the] professional expertise of Pakistan’s armed forces, [the] eradication of terrorists and terrorism was underway at great pace,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
Vowing to foil the designs of terrorists, he said, “Justice will be meted out to the terrorists patronised by India for causing damage to the life and property of the citizens.”
The PM added that the government and security forces were “determined to completely wipe out terrorism from the country”.
Meanwhile, President Zardari praised security forces for killing the nine terrorists and said that operations against will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism.
“The successful operations of the security forces against the Indian-supported terrorists was commendable,” the president was quoted as saying. “Our determination to root out terrorist elements and defend the country is unwavering.”
Last week, 12 terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the ISPR had said on Monday.
It added that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the TTP in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.
An IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent “five Indian sponsored” terrorists to “hell”, it said. In a second IBO in the Bannu district, two “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were “successfully neutralised” by the security forces.
It further said that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district’s general area of Mir Ali, adding that two “Indian sponsored” terrorists were “sent to hell” after the effective response of troops.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of the soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.”
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitnah-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
