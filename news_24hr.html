According to news reports, several senior PTI leaders, who have now been in jail for close to two years, have written to their incarcerated chief to consider a dialogue with other political parties instead of insisting on one only with the military establishment.
Their letter, sent from Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore, proposes that the PTI resolve matters with the political leadership first and then approach the powers that be. Though there are some questions regarding the letter, such as who wrote it and whether it was really signed by the jailed leaders, who are being held in separate barracks, its contents do not seem unreasonable or outside the realm of political possibility.
The signatories reportedly include PTI vice-chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, all of whom have made a significant personal sacrifice for the party.
The PTI cadres may have good cause to resent the current regime, but the party should remember that its experience is not unique. Every national political entity has faced similar humiliation, oppression and/or forced capitulation at some stage of its career. During the height of the last overt dictatorship, some parties realised they could not continue to allow themselves to be used against each other for the establishment’s long vendetta against civilian rule.
The Charter of Democracy was born of that realisation. But when the PTI emerged as a major political force, rather than embracing the Charter’s spirit, it aligned itself with those historically opposed to civilian supremacy. Since its ouster, there has merely been a turning of the tables. Therefore, for its own sake and for the sake of Pakistan’s besieged democracy, it needs to first re-establish the rules of engagement with other political parties.
The jailed PTI leaders’ perspective should matter, especially to those who are out among the people and struggling to keep the party together due to their inability to establish clear lines of communication with the top leadership.
But, as always, much depends on what party chief Imran Khan thinks of the proposal. The jailed leaders have requested to be included in the dialogue process and to have regular access to the former prime minister at Adiala Jail. Given the interest this letter has generated, it appears that the space for dialogue may not have closed yet.
The initiative, tentative as it may be, deserves encouragement, including from the government. If space for reconciliation remains, both the government and PTI must seize it before the country’s democratic prospects are buried even deeper under the weight of their endless confrontation.

• Minister says govt committed to protecting human rights; insists commission must follow SOPs
LAHORE: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), the country’s leading human rights watchdog, has expressed deep concern over the steadily shrinking space for human rights advocacy in the country.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the HRCP said it had faced a series of arbitrary, illegal, and unjustified actions over the past few months, which have impeded the organisation’s ability to carry out its mandate.
 






It added that HRCP’s work is based on the rights of all citizens and persons, as enshrined in the Constitution and Pakistan’s international commitments and obligations.
“We note with disappointment that persons claiming to represent the security apparatus have obstructed the organisation of HRCP events by informing either the venue or our staff that a no-objection certificate (NOC) was required for indoor meetings, although this is not a legal requirement.
“Two recent examples include a high-level consultation in Islamabad on regions facing militancy and terrorism and their impact on human rights, and a roundtable in Gilgit on local communities’ right to natural resources. Ironically, both the relevant legislators and officials from government departments had confirmed their participation on both occasions,” it added.
The statement said: “There have also been incidents across the country where our members and staff faced harassment and intimidation. For the first time in HRCP’s decades-long history, its chairperson was taken in for questioning by the police in Karachi. We have reason to believe that other actions are not merely coincidental.
 
 

“These include an attempt to seal our office premises in Lahore in 2024, the removal of the office’s electricity meter, and a bank’s refusal to release our funds, citing a State Bank of Pakistan directive — the existence of which was categorically denied by the latter in writing when asked by a court.”
The HRCP urged the authorities to respect the fundamental freedoms of association, assembly, and expression, and to ensure that human rights defenders can operate without fear of reprisal or undue interference.
“Civil society organisations such as HRCP are essential if Pakistan wishes to develop into a state that upholds the rights of all its citizens and remains responsible for their well-being. More broadly, human rights work helps create a more tolerant and inclusive society — something that Pakistan is in dire need of at present,” the statement concluded.
HRCP Chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt told Dawn that some months ago, a police contingent, including lady police officers, arrived at his residence and took him to the local police station. He said he was threatened and asked irrelevant questions about his family. A large number of lawyers and journalists gathered outside the police station, and he was released after being held for a few hours.
HRCP Secretary General Harris Khalique said the organisation’s credibility comes from its independence, responsible behaviour, courage, and impartiality. “Muzzling our voice will be as big a loss for the country as ours,” he added.
Founding member Hina Jillani told Dawn that the state’s actions against the commission were short-sighted and could not silence the voice of civil society. “We constructively gave recommendations to the state about rule of law, democracy, and the situation of human rights in the country, and it was their right to do so.”
She said the state had made some matters sensitive on its own due to its short-sightedness and urged the authorities to widen their perspective and listen attentively to the voices raised in HRCP’s consultative meetings.
Former chairperson and current council member Zohra Yusuf pointed to the broader issue of democratic backsliding in the country and the disregard for the rule of law by the very institutions meant to uphold it. She expressed dismay over the lodging of various FIRs as well as threats and intimidation faced by HRCP members and office bearers.
SOPs for holding events
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry told Dawn that the government is pursuing legislation in support of human rights and would ensure the rights of all citizens.
He said that HRCP must also adhere to standard operating procedures (SOPs) set for holding any event. “Everyone has to intimate the administration and seek an NOC for holding any religious event, human rights consultation, or any other gathering to ensure security,” he said.
Mr Chaudhry maintained that obtaining an NOC from the administration is a legal requirement for holding events and HRCP should comply with it. “National and foreign delegates were invited to HRCP events, and the state needs to be informed to provide better security,” he added.
He further stated that the government is committed to upholding the human rights of all citizens and, if other departments are approaching the HRCP, the organisation must fulfil all legal requirements.

GILGIT: Three European mountaineers have made history by ascending the formidable Nanga Parbat via its Rupal Face in alpine style, and descending in spectacular fashion.
German alpinist David Göttler made his way down via paraglider, while the French duo of Tiphaine Duperier and Boris Langenstein etched themselves into the history books by skiing down the peak, nicknamed ‘The Killer Mountain’.
 
 

CEO of Adventure Tours Pakistan Naiknaam Karim told Dawn that the three foreign climbers began their summit attempt on Nanga Parbat, via the Schell route.
The trio climbed from the approximately 3,600-metre-high base camp to the summit between June 21 and 24.
Göttler, 47, had planned to descend from the top by paraglider.
However, upon reaching the summit, strong winds forced him to launch his paraglider from 7,700 metres instead. He successfully flew from that altitude and landed at base camp in 30 minutes, according to the organisers.
Michael Beek, a German tour operator, mountain guide, and paragliding instructor, congratulated Göttler in a Facebook post, writing that Göttler had made a historic first.
“Summiting Nanga Parbat in alpine style with Tiphaine Duperier and Boris Langenstein was incredible; but to be able to fly down from 7,700m all the way back to base camp on the same day has brought my joy to the next level,” he said.
Meanwhile, his French companions, Duperier and Langenstein, camped the night at 7,625m, and later skied and trekked down the massive Rupal Face, which rises 4,600 meters from base camp, arriving three days later.
Theirs is considered the first ski descent of the Rupal Face, and a first from the summit of Nanga Parbat.

This development has firmly established the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) as the dominant force in the provincial legislature.
As a direct consequence of the ECP’s ruling, the total number of PML-N members in the Punjab Assembly has surged from 206 to 229. This increase is primarily attributed to a substantial rise in their representation on reserved seats for women, which climbed from 36 to 57. Similarly, the party’s presence on minority seats has also seen an uptick, increasing from five to seven.
 
 

Other political parties have also seen changes in their numerical strength. The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has gained one minority and one women’s reserved seat, boosting its total membership from 14 to 16. The Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) now holds three women’s reserved seats, up from two, bringing their total members to 11. The Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) also saw an increase in its representation, gaining one women’s reserved seat, which raised its total members from six to seven.
Despite these changes, the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) strength in the Punjab Assembly remains at 76 members, while the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) continues to have 27 members. Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) and Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) each retain their single seats.
Overall, in the 371-member Punjab Assembly, 369 are currently present. One independent member, Mian Aslam Iqbal elected from PP-171 (Lahore-27) in the 2024 vote, is yet to take the oath, and a by-election for one seat is still pending.
The Election Commission’s recent decision has effectively reshaped the political dynamics within the Punjab Assembly, solidifying the PML-N’s numerical majority in the house.

• Officials targeted en route from Nawagai to Khar after conducting anti-encroachment drive
BAJAUR: An assistant commissioner and a tehsildar were among five people martyred, while 17 others, including several police personnel, sustained injuries when a roadside bomb explosion struck an official vehicle in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area on Wednesday afternoon.
District Police Officer Waqas Rafique said it was an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion and said the bomb was planted on a motorcycle parked alongside the road.
Four people, including Nawagi subdivision assistant commissioner (AC) Faisal Ismail, Nawagi tehsildar Abdul Wakeel Khan, policeman Zahid Khan and a passerby, Fazal Manan, died at the scene, while 18 others were injured when the IED went off, District Police PRO Israr Khan told Dawn.
One of the wounded policemen, identified as ASI Noor Hake­em, passed away while being shifted to hospital in Peshawar.
Sources told Dawn that AC Ismail and his team were returning to the Civil Colony Khar after conducting an anti-encroachment drive in Nawagai bazaar, when their official vehicle was targeted.
Residents, police and rescue officials told Dawn that the incident occurred on the Bajaur-Pesh­awar highway in Sadiqabad market, about 5km from district headquarters Khar, around 1:45pm.
Rescue 1122 workers alongside locals from nearby areas rushed to the scene and began efforts to transport the injured to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar where emergency was already declared.
The DPO along with a team of senior police officials visited the spot and collected evidence to be used for investigation.
News of the blast spread quickly across the district, especially in Khar tehsil, prompting scores of people from all walks of life to rush to the Khar DHQ Hospital to donate blood for the injured.
According to the updated data shared by Rescue 1122 and the medical superintendent of the Khar DHQ hospital, four policemen identified as constable Ayaz Khan, constable Muhammad Zameen, constable Saidur Rehman and Fazal Haq were among 17 people wounded in the blast.
 
 

The reports stated that five injured individuals, including three policemen, were referred to various hospitals in Peshawar due to their critical condition, while the others remained under treatment at the DHQ hospital.
The bodies of all five victims were dispatched to their native areas after their combined official funeral prayers held at the police line late on Wednesday evening.
The body of assistant commissioner Faisal Ismail was sent to his native Wadigram area of Swat district.
Both the outlawed TTP and the IS-Khorasan militant group claimed responsibility for the attack on social media.
The incident also drew condemnation from President Asif Ali Zardari, PM Shehbaz Sharif, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur, and Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, among several others.

US District Judge Randolph Moss said in a 128-page opinion that Trump’s Jan 20 proclamation blocking all migrants  “engaged in the invasion across the southern border” from claiming asylum or other humanitarian protections went beyond his executive power.
The American Civil Liberties Union brought the challenge to Trump’s asylum ban in February on behalf of three advocacy groups and migrants denied access to asylum, arguing the broad ban violated US laws and international treaties. Moss said he would stay the effective date of a related order for 14 days to allow the Trump administration to appeal.
 
 

The decision applies to migrants who were subject to Trump’s ban or could be in the future, part of a certified class in the litigation. Such class certifications remain unaffected by last week’s Supreme Court decision reining in nationwide injunctions.
Moss ruled that neither federal immigration law nor the US Constitution gave Trump the authority to disregard existing laws and regulations governing the asylum process even if stopping illegal immigration presented  “enormous challenges.”
“Nothing in the [Immig­ration and Nationality Act] or the Constitution grants the President or his delegees the sweeping authority asserted in the Proclamation and implementing guidance,” wrote Moss, an appointee of former President Barack Obama.  “An appeal to necessity cannot fill that void.”

Meanwhile, the National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority has also issued multiple impact-based weather alerts for various regions of Pakistan in light of forecasted severe weather conditions expected from July 2 till July 8.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, with water levels in major rivers and hill torrents expected to rise sharply, flash floods are likely in Dera Ghazi Khan and urban flooding is anticipated in major cities of the province, including Lahore.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia issued the alert and directed all deputy commissioners (DCs) and disaster response teams to remain alert.

NEOC issues alert for severe weather conditions till July 8 as monsoon system pairs with westerly wave

The Provincial Control Room is operating round-the-clock, and emergency services like Rescue 1122 have been put on high alert, he added.
Farmers have been advised to manage their activities accordingly, while tourists and travelers have been urged to avoid risky routes, especially in landslide-prone areas such as Murree and Galliyat.
 
 

The disaster authority has warned people against staying in weak structures, venturing near floodwaters, or ignoring weather advisories.
Lightning strikes and roof collapse pose additional risks, it warns, saying children are particularly vulnerable near accumulated rainwater or floodwater.
It also issued a weather alert warning of intensified monsoon rains across the province from July 5, forecasting heavy-to-very heavy rainfall in most districts until July 10.
The advisory highlights risks of flash floods, urban flooding and landslides, particularly in vulnerable areas like Murree, Galliyat, and DG Khan mountains.
According to the Met Office, strong monsoon currents, coupled with a westerly wave, will trigger widespread rains, windstorms and thunderstorms, with the heaviest downpours expected in Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and Sargodha.
It warns that the low-lying areas in major cities, including Lahore and Rawalpindi, may face urban flooding, while hill torrents in DG Khan and northeastern Punjab could overflow.
Severe weather conditions
Meanwhile, the NEOC said in a statement that these alerts highlight the growing risk of flash floods, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and urban flooding in different parts of the country.
 
 

Low to moderate rainfall was likely to continue until July 5, after which an active southwest monsoon system, coupled with a westerly wave, was expected to enter the country triggering moderate to heavy rainfall and localised thunderstorms.
The most affected regions include upper catchments of major rivers including central and lower Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Due to this forecast, increased river flows were expected across the country.
In particular, Kabul River Nowshera is likely to swell due to rising tributaries such as Swat, Panjkora, Bara, and Kalpani Nullah.
Inflows into Tarbela Dam may reach the low flood limit. Flash floods in riverine areas, especially where nullahs and local streams converge, may pose threats to nearby settlements.
Simultaneously, the risk of glacial lake outburst floods and landslides had increased in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where ongoing high temperatures had accelerated glacier and snow melt.
The situation was further worsened by incoming moist currents and rainfall. Vulnerable glacial valleys and narrow mountain passes may face sudden glacial lake outburst floods, flash floods, road blockages, and disruptions to infrastructure and tourism.
The National Disaster Management Authority has has urged the public to take precautionary measures.
It asked residents in at-risk areas to avoid unnecessary travel, secure important belongings, and prepare for potential evacuation.

• Firing, strikes by Israeli forces claim lives of 139 Palestinians in 24 hours
CAIRO: After US President Donald Trump announced that Israel had agreed to the “necessary conditions” to finalise a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas said on Wednesday it was studying the so-called “final ceasefire proposal”.
But while the group wants Israel to completely pull out of the enclave, Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu has set his sights on the elimination of Hamas.
A day earlier, Trump had said that after a “long and productive” meeting between his representatives and Israeli officials, Tel Aviv had agreed to the conditions needed to finalise a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza.
 
 

In its statement, Hamas said it was studying new ceasefire offers it received from the mediators Egypt and Qatar, but stressed it aimed to reach an agreement that would ensure an end to the war and an Israeli pullout from Gaza.
In a statement, Hamas said it was “conducting national consultations to discuss what we received from the proposals of the… mediators.”
It added that it sought “to reach an agreement that guarantees ending the aggression, achieving the withdrawal (of Israel from Gaza) and urgently aiding our people in the Gaza Strip”.
Qatar and Egypt have been mediating efforts to end the conflict.
A Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations said, “There are no fundamental changes in the new proposal” under discussion compared to previous terms presented by the United States.
The source said the new proposal “includes a 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release half of the (22) living” Israeli prisoners in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for Israel releasing a number of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
“There will not be a Hamas. There will not be a Hamastan. We’re not going back to that. It’s over,” Netanyahu claimed at a meeting hosted by the Trans-Israel pipeline.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said a majority within the coalition government would back an agreement that would see the release of the remaining Israeli prisoners held by Hamas in Gaza.
Of the 50 Israeli prisoners yet to be released, at least 20 are believed to be still alive.
Deaths in Gaza
Meanwhile, Gaza health authorities said Israeli gunfire and military strikes killed at least 139 Palestinians in separate attacks in north and southern areas over the past 24 hours.
 
 

Among those killed on Wednesday was Marwan Al-Sultan, director of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, who perished in an airstrike that also claimed the lives of his wife and five children, medics say.
For Palestinians, who have fled multiple times and face daily struggles to find food 21 months into Israel’s military campaign, there was a glimmer of hope but many worried that any ceasefire would only be temporary.
“We want a complete end to the war on Gaza, not like every time — a partial agreement and ceasefire that lasts a month or two, then the war returns,” said Samir Al-Masri in Khan Yunis.
At the end of May, Hamas had said it was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, which Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff said was “totally unacceptable”.
That proposal had involved a 60-day ceasefire and the release of half the Israeli prisoners held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the remains of other Palestinians; Hamas would release the remaining Israeli prisoners as part of a deal that guarantees the end of the war.
A source close to Hamas said that Hamas leaders were expected to debate the proposal and seek clarifications from mediators before giving an official response.
Meanwhile, the Hamas-run interior ministry has accused Yasser Abu Shabab, a Bedouin clan leader, of treason and ordered him to surrender and face trial.
Shabab, who does not recognise the authority of Hamas and accuses the group of hurting the interests of Gaza, had 10 days to surrender, the ministry said.
The Abu Shabab group described the Hamas order as a “sitcom that doesn’t frighten us, nor does it frighten any free man who loves his homeland and its dignity”, in a post on the Facebook page that usually carried the group’s announcements.
Israel also claimed to back some of Gaza’s clans against Hamas, but has not said which.

• Ruling coalition’s strength in NA jumps to 235, opposition shrinks to 98
• Four independents also added to govt tally
ISLAMABAD: The ruling coalition formally gained a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly on Wednesday after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) distributed the disputed reserved seats among the PML-N, PPP and JUI-F, in light of last week’s Supreme Court verdict.
The ECP issued victory notifications for 74 of 77 lawmakers, including 19 members of the National Assembly, 27 of the Punjab Assembly, 25 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and three of the Sindh Assembly.
 
 

These reserved seats for women and non-Muslims were originally designated for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the electoral front of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
The ECP’s decision follows a landmark 7-3 majority decision by a 10-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, which last week overturned a previous 8-5 verdict delivered by a 13-member bench on July 12, 2024. The earlier judgement had ruled in favour of PTI’s eligibility for reserved seats.
The PML-N secured the most, bagging 43 out of the 74 seats across the national and provincial legislatures.
The PPP has benefited by the addition of 14 seats, while the JUI-F saw its tally rise by 13. One seat each has gone to the PML-Q, MQM-Pakistan, Awami National Party, PTI-Parliamentarians and the Iste­h­kam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP).
Among the 19 restored National Assembly seats, 13 were awarded to PML-N, four to PPP, and two to JUI-F.
Three National Assembly notifications were withheld — JUI-F’s Sadaf Khan, due to a Supreme Court order dated April 22, 2024; and PML-N’s Sobia Shahid and Shehla Bano, who have already taken oath as members of the KP Assembly.
Although the Supreme Court bench did not clarify how the reserved seats would be redistributed, the ECP had already allocated them among various parties following the Peshawar High Court’s decision.
However, a week after the apex court suspended the PHC verdict last year, the ECP had halted notifications for 77 lawmakers elected on these reserved seats across the National and provincial assemblies.
Updated party position
The National Assembly has now updated the party position. According to an official document issued by the NA Secretariat, the PML-N now leads with 123 members, the PPP has increased its strength to 74, the MQM-P holds 22 seats, PML-Q five, and IPP four. The Balochistan Awami Party, National Party, and PML-Z each retain one seat.
The total now stands at 231, but the document cites the ruling coalition’s strength as 235, also counting four independent lawmakers.
Sources told Dawn these include Chaudhry Usman Ali (NA-142 Sahiwal), Mubarak Zeb (NA-8 Bajaur), Aurangzeb Kitchi (NA-159 Vehari) and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146 Khanewal) — all of whom were PTI-backed independents who have since switched allegiances.
According to the document, the opposition’s strength in the 333-member house has shrunk to 98, comprising 80 SIC members, 10 from JUI-F, five PTI-backed independents, and one each from Balochistan National Party, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party.
In the Punjab Assembly, PML-N’s tally has risen to 229 from 206 with the addition of 23 seats (21 for women and two for non-Muslims). PPP now holds 16 seats compared to 14 previously, as it gained one seat each reserved for women and minorities. PML-Q and IPP have 11 and seven seats, respectively, after gaining one reserved seat each for women.
In the Sindh Assembly, PPP’s numbers rose to 120, with one additional seat each for women and non-Muslims. Its rival MQM-P now holds 38 seats after securing one more reserved seat for women.
In KP, JUI-F saw the biggest gain, adding 10 seats (eight for women, two for non-Muslims) to reach a total of 29.
PML-N added seven (six for women, one for minorities), reaching 26. PPP’s representation doubled to 12 with the addition of five reserved seats for women and one for non-Muslims. PTI-Parliamentarians and ANP each added one seat, bringing their totals to five each.

ISLAMABAD: Amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a ‘regime change’ in Khyber Pakht­un­khwa (KP), Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday met two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation.
The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events had further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan called on the PM, where they discussed the prevailing political scenario.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Ameer Maqam,  Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashar Iqbal, Prime Minister’s  Adviser Rana Sanaullah, Minister of State for Power Abdul Rehman Kanju  and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Talha Barki were also  present on the occasion.
A source close to Governor Kundi told Dawn that the issue of possible change of KP government was thoroughly discussed.
 
 

“Yes, we discussed the matter,” the source quoted Mr Kundi as saying. A press release issued by the governor’s spokesperson said the PM  tasked Mr Kundi to start a campaign for forming a new government in KP and hold consultation with opposition members of the provincial assembly.
Mr Kundi and federal minister Ameer Muqam have also been tasked to meet JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for further consultation.
But others offered different counsel. When contacted, ANP chief Aimal Wali Khan told Dawn that the issue was discussed during his meeting with the PM. However, he said he had advised the premier against dissolving the KP government through  ‘external means’.
“I told the PM that let the KP government die its own death. If you (PM) remove the provincial government, you will give an easy escape to the PTI-led regime, which has completely failed to deliver,” Mr Aimal said.
He said KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has no other way but to leave the government and if the Centre made any attempt to topple the PTI-led regime in KP, it would be a welcome move for the CM. “I told PM that Ali Amin Gandapur has taken maximum benefits after becoming CM and it will be a blessing for him if he is removed and sent home,” he added.
 
 

He further said the prime minister was ultimately convinced that forcefully removing the provincial government would be a mistake. “We are already suffering due to the trend of toppling governments and now how can we do it by ourselves,” he said.
Saudi peace efforts
PM Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday appreciated the efforts by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for peace in the Middle East as well as its significant role in the ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India.
The prime minister said this in a meeting with the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Islamabad Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, while fondly recalling his warm and cordial telephone conversation with the Saudi Crown Prince on June 24.
The PM told the ambassador that as Pakistan had assumed the rotating Presidency of the UN Security Council for the month of July, and it would count on Saudi Arabia’s support to ensure that its tenure was conducted smoothly and successfully.
PM to visit Baku
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office announced the PM would attend the 17th summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Baku, Azerbaijan, starting on July 3.
In a statement, it said the PM will “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.
He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.

Last month, Field Marshal Asim Munir became the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president when he met Donald Trump for talks at the White House. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law. The two had discussed joint counter-terrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their “cordial” meeting in Washington.
Today, PAF’s Directorate General of Public Relations (DGPR) said that in a “significant development” aimed at strengthening bilateral defence cooperation and advancing mutual interests, the air chief undertook an official visit to the US, adding that it was the “first by a serving PAF air chief in over a decade”.
It said the high-profile visit marked a “strategic milestone” in Pakistan-US defence cooperation and “proved instrumental in deepening institutional ties” in addition to addressing key regional and global security issues.
 






The DGPR said that at the Pentagon, the air chief called on US Air Force (International Affairs) Secretary Kelli L Seybolt and  Chief of Staff of the US Air Force General David W Allvin.
“The discussions centred around advancing bilateral military cooperation, enhancing interoperability and exploring avenues of joint training and technology exchange. Chief of the air staff highlighted the historic and multifaceted relationship between Pakistan and US, particularly in the domains of defence and security cooperation.
“He reiterated his resolve to further enhance the existing ties in the realms of military-to-military cooperation and training between the air forces of the two countries. The two sides also agreed upon the continuation of high-level military engagements in future through senior-level interactions,” the DGPR said.
It said these interactions were deemed crucial for maintaining momentum in ongoing cooperative endeavours in the areas of joint training, operational exercises and military exchange programmes between the two nations.
At the US State Department, the air chief met Brown L Stanley from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and Eric Meyer from the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs. The DGPR said the meetings served as a forum to “underscore Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting regional stability, its firm commitment to counter-terrorism efforts and its nuanced perspective on the evolving geopolitical dynamics of South and Central Asia”.
As part of his engagements at Capitol Hill, the air chief held “substantive dialogues with prominent members” of the US Congress, including Mike Turner, Rich McCormick and Bill Huizenga.
“These interactions reinforced the importance of robust engagement in strengthening bilateral relations and provided a valuable opportunity to share Pakistan’s views on strategic challenges, regional security frameworks and the impact of emerging technologies on defence cooperation.
“Emphasising Pakistan’s status as a peace-loving nation, the air chief reaffirmed the country’s enduring sacrifices and notable operational achievements in the global war on terror, while also outlining Pakistan’s evolving security calculus in response to the rapidly shifting regional geopolitical landscape.”
The DGPR said the “landmark visit” not only reaffirmed PAF’s commitment to promoting regional and global peace, but also laid the groundwork for renewed institutional collaboration, strategic dialogue and enhanced interoperability between it and the US Air Force.</p><small>2025-07-02 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0223155694a36f5.jpg?r=231611' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921678/sbps-foreign-exchange-reserves-climb-to-1451bn' target='_blank'><strong>SBP’s foreign exchange reserves climb to $14.51bn</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Wednesday that its foreign exchange reserves rose to $14.51 billion by June 30.
Last month, the central bank’s reserves increased by $167 million to $11.675bn during the week ending June 6, though it failed to reach its target of $14bn by the end of the 2024-25 fiscal year.
A press release issued by the SBP today said its reserves rose by $5.12bn to reach $14.51bn, as compared to $9.39bn on June 30 last year.
“This reflects a noticeable improvement in the country’s current account balance and realisation of planned inflows during the year,” the SBP said.
Earlier this week, China rolled over $3.4bn in loans, two senior Pakistani government officials told Reuters, in a move that was expected to help boost the country’s foreign exchange reserves, a requirement of the International Monetary Fund.
Beijing rolled over $2.1bn, which has been in the SBP’s reserves for the last three years, and refinanced another $1.3bn commercial loan, which Islamabad had paid back two months ago, the sources said.
Another $1bn from Middle Eastern commercial banks and $500m from multilateral financing have also been received, one of the officials had said.</p><small>2025-07-02 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02221847e447b8c.jpg?r=221852' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921673/pakistan-defeat-indonesia-2-0-in-afc-womens-asian-cup-qualifier-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan defeat Indonesia 2-0 in AFC Women’s Asian Cup qualifier clash</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday beat hosts Indonesia 2-0 in their second group match in the qualifiers for the 2026 Asian Football Confederation’s (AFC) Women’s Asian Cup, making a comeback from their defeat in the first group match last week.
The national squad was drawn in Group ‘D’ of the qualifiers in Jakarta alongside Chinese Taipei, Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan. Pakistan lost their first match of the campaign to Chinese Taipei 8-0 on June 29.
Hailing today’s victory as a “milestone in women’s football”, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) wrote in an X post, “Pakistan defeats 95th-ranked Indonesia 2-0. Power, passion, and purpose on full display.”

Spanish officials said a wildfire in Catalonia had killed two people a day earlier, and authorities reported heatwave-linked deaths also in Extremadura and Cordoba. France’s energy minister reported two deaths linked to the heat, with 300 others taken to the hospital.
Italy issued red alerts for 18 cities, while in Germany, temperatures were forecast to peak at 40 degrees Celsius in some areas, making it the hottest day of the year.
Two men over the age of 60 died in separate incidents on the beach in Sardinia from the heat, ANSA news agency reported.
Weather forecaster Meteo France said red alerts remained for several areas of central France.
The risks were greatest for vulnerable members of the population, and Catherine Vautrin, France’s health and families minister, said authorities should remain vigilant.
“In the coming days, we’ll see the consequences, particularly on the most vulnerable, and I’m thinking particularly of the elderly,” she said.
Turkiye, which battled blazes on several fronts, forcing the temporary evacuation of about 50,000 people earlier in the week, said its fires were largely contained.
Tuesday’s fire in the Catalonia region of Spain destroyed several farms and affected an area stretching about 40 kilometres before being contained, officials said.

Storms ahead, reactors shut
Italy, France and Germany warned of the risk of heavy storms due to excessive warming in unstable atmospheres. Violent storms in the French Alps late on Monday triggered mudslides, disrupting rail traffic between Paris and Milan.
Swiss utility Axpo shut down one reactor unit at the Beznau nuclear power plant and halved output at another on Tuesday because of the high temperature of river water.
Water is used for cooling and other purposes at nuclear power plants, and restrictions were expected to continue as temperatures are monitored.
The extreme heat would likely impact the region’s economic growth, which was expected to slow by half a percentage point in 2025, Allianz Research said in a report, likening the financial toll of one day with temperatures exceeding 32°C to half a day of strikes.
Scientists say heatwaves have arrived earlier this year, spiking temperatures by up to 10°C in some regions as warming seas encouraged the formation of a heat dome over much of Europe, trapping hot air masses.
‘Testing our resilience’
Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels are a cause of climate change, they say, with deforestation and industrial practices being other contributing factors. Last year was the planet’s hottest on record.
 
 

“Extreme heat is testing our resilience and putting the health and lives of millions at risk,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme.
“Our new climate reality means we can no longer be surprised when temperatures reach record highs each year.”
Allianz Research’s warning of a dent in economic activity due to the heat rang true for some businesses. British baker Greggs warned on Wednesday its annual profit could dip below last year’s levels as the unusually hot UK temperatures discourage customers from eating out.
In Germany, people flocked to open-air swimming pools and lakes to cool off, with many schools across the country closed.
The fire brigade was tackling several forest fires in the eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony.
The upper floor of the Eiffel Tower in Paris was shut to visitors on Tuesday, while the iconic Atomium in Brussels, an atom-like structure made of stainless steel, closed early on Wednesday as a precaution, its third early closure this week.
Spain experienced its hottest June on record this year, and France had its hottest June since 2003.</p><small>2025-07-02 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612097-shehbaz-led-hybrid-system-functioning-successfully-says-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Shehbaz-led hybrid system functioning successfully, says Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>

Combs was convicted of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking, a partial win for the former billionaire known for elevating hip-hop in American culture.
The verdict followed a criminal trial in which two of the music mogul’s former girlfriends testified that he physically and sexually abused them.
Combs faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence on each of the two prostitution counts. US District Judge Arun Subramanian will determine Combs’ sentence at a later date.
The acquittals on the sex trafficking counts mean he will avoid a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. He could have faced life in prison if he were convicted of sex trafficking or racketeering conspiracy.
After the jury read its verdict, defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo asked Subramanian to release Combs on bail. “He has been acquitted of very, very serious charges. He has been convicted of a far less serious charge,” Agnifilo said.
Prosecutor Maurene Comey urged Subramanian to keep Combs behind bars pending sentencing, citing testimony about Combs’ alleged physical abuse. She said prosecutors would still be seeking a “substantial period of incarceration” at sentencing.
“It is clear that the defendant does pose a danger,” Comey said.
Prosecutors say Combs, for two decades, used his business empire to force two of his romantic partners to take part in drug-fuelled, days-long sexual performances sometimes known as “Freak Offs” with male sex workers in hotel rooms while Combs watched, masturbated and occasionally filmed.
During raids of Combs’ homes, authorities found drugs and 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant that he would use in the performances, prosecutors said.
Combs, 55, had pleaded not guilty to all five counts.
His lawyers acknowledged that the Bad Boy Records founder, once famed for hosting lavish parties for the cultural elite in luxurious locales such as the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez, was at times violent in his domestic relationships. But they said the sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual.
The seven-week trial in Manhattan federal court exposed the inner workings of Combs’ business empire and gave the 12-member jury an intimate look into his volatile romantic relationships with the rhythm and blues singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and a woman known in court by the pseudonym Jane.
Ventura sued Combs in November 2023 for sex trafficking, the first of dozens of civil lawsuits accusing him of abuse. Combs, also known throughout his career as ‘Puff Daddy’ and ‘P Diddy’ and once feted for turning artists such as Notorious BIG and Usher into stars, settled with Ventura for $20 million.
He has denied all wrongdoing. At the trial, jurors saw surveillance footage from 2016 showing Combs kicking and dragging Ventura in the hallway of an InterContinental hotel in Los Angeles, where she said she was trying to leave a “Freak Off”.
Jane later testified that Combs, in June 2024, attacked her and directed her to perform oral sex on a male entertainer, even though she told him she did not want to.
That alleged attack took place a month after Combs apologised on social media for his 2016 attack on Ventura, footage of which had been broadcast on CNN.
According to prosecutors, physical violence was just one way Combs compelled Ventura and Jane to take part in the performances — an act of coercion they say amounts to sex trafficking because the male escorts were paid.
Both women testified that he threatened to withhold financial support and to leak sexually explicit images of them if they refused to comply.
“The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,” prosecutor Christy Slavik said in her closing argument on June 26. “He doesn’t take no for an answer.”
Combs’ defence lawyers argued that while Combs may have committed domestic violence in the context of volatile romantic partnerships, his conduct did not amount to sex trafficking.
They argued that Ventura and Jane were strong, independent women who voluntarily took part in the sexual performances because they wanted to please Combs.
Both women testified they spent time with Combs and took part in sexual performances after he beat them. Defence lawyers argued that Ventura and Jane were retrospectively accusing Combs of forcing their participation in the performances because they were jealous he was seeing other women.
“If he was charged with domestic violence, we wouldn’t all be here,” Combs’ defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in his closing argument on June 27. “He did not do the things he’s charged with.”
Racketeering conspiracy
Besides Ventura and Jane, jurors also heard testimony from Combs’ former personal assistants who said their jobs included setting up hotel rooms for “Freak Offs” and buying their boss drugs.
An InterContinental security guard testified that Combs, in the presence of his chief of staff, paid him $100,000 to hand over what he thought was the only copy of the surveillance tape of his attack on Ventura.
And Scott Mescudi, the rapper known as Kid Cudi, told jurors that Combs was likely involved in an arson on his car after Combs found out he was romantically involved with Ventura.
According to prosecutors, those were all acts Combs and his associates undertook in furtherance of a racketeering conspiracy whose aim was, in part, to facilitate his abuse and keep evidence of his wrongdoing under wraps.
The defence argued Combs was a successful entrepreneur who used drugs recreationally, but kept his professional and personal lives separate.
Combs has been held in federal lockup in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest.</p><small>2025-07-02 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612093-paf-chief-sidhu-holds-strategic-talks-with-us-congress-pentagon-officials' target='_blank'><strong>PAF Chief Sidhu holds strategic talks with US Congress, Pentagon officials</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, the Constit­utional Bench overturned the Supreme Court’s earlier judgement in the reserved seats case — effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures. The decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, supersedes the July 12, 2024 majority judgement by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.
The Constitutional Bench’s decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.
Acting on the court’s verdict, the ECP issued an order today withdrawing its July 24 and 29 notifications from last year that had declared returned candidates against general seats of the National Assembly and the Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies as returned candidates of the PTI.
In another order today, the ECP notified the names of the returned candidates under various categories of reserved seats with immediate effect, distributing 13 seats to the PML-N in the National Assembly, four to the PPP and two to the opposition JUI-F.
After this process, the ruling coalition ach­ieves a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag­ic number required to at­­tain a two-thirds majority is 224.
 


The National Assembly Secretariat’s Legislation Branch later issued the National Assembly composition reflecting the actual party position after the apex court’s verdict and ECP’s distribution. It showed the treasury benches as now having 235 seats to the opposition’s 98 seats, for a total of 333 seats with one MNA suspended and two reserved seats being vacant.
The ECP also distributed reserved seats in the provincial assemblies. In the KP Assembly, 10 seats were given to the JUI-F, seven to the PML-N, six to the PPP and one each to the PTI-Parliamentarians and Awami National Party.
The PML-N was given 23 seats in the Punjab Assembly, two for the PPP and one each to the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid and Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party.
In the Sindh Assembly, two seats were given to the PPP and one to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan.
Reserved seats case
Through its March 25, 2024 order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024, polls — of reserved seats.
In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law”.
The SIC — joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol — had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.
The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP becoming major beneficiaries. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.
On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority verdict, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.
However, the ruling was not implemented by the National Assembly, while the ECP had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had rejected outright the review petitions filed by the PML-N, ECP and PPP.
Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of the Constitutional Bench, even though they were considered part of the bench.
Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.
In his July 12 dissenting order, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.
The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgment.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.
However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all 80 returned candidates, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.</p><small>2025-07-02 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02191328aa72dd0.jpg?r=205702' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921665/ukraine-left-scrambling-after-us-says-halting-some-arms-shipments' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine left scrambling after US says halting some arms shipments</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine appealed to the United States for clarity on Wednesday after it was caught off guard by a White House announcement that Washington was halting some arms shipments to the war-battered country.
The Ukrainian defence ministry, which is deeply dependent on US arms, said it had not been notified about the reduction in aid announced one day earlier.
Moscow revelled in the decision, saying it could bring the end of the war closer. Any slowdown in US support could harm Kyiv’s ability to fend off escalating Russian aerial bombardments or frontline gains.
Kyiv has long feared halts to US aid after Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, having criticised the tens of billions of dollars in support and weapons sent by his predecessor, Joe Biden.
“It will [be] even more scary, even more painful, and even more civilians will suffer,” Kyiv resident Yevgenia Prysiazhna told AFP, referring to an uptick in overnight drone and missile attacks on Ukraine.
 
 

“I really hope that this is a temporary decision,” the communications manager said.
John Ginkel, the deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Kyiv, was summoned by the foreign ministry — a rare diplomatic move usually reserved for foes and rivals, not vital allies — given uncertainty about what the cuts would mean for Kyiv.
“The Ukrainian side stressed that any delay or procrastination in supporting Ukraine’s defence capabilities would only encourage the aggressor to continue the war,” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said.
The White House had said it was halting some key weapons shipments promised by the previous US administration, without elaborating.
Under Biden, Washington spearheaded Western support for Ukraine, with Congress having approved more than $100 billion in aid, including $43bn in weaponry.
Trump instead has pushed the two sides into peace talks, including in phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin — who rejected calls for a ceasefire and demanded Ukraine cede more territory if it wants Moscow to halt its invasion, launched in 2022.
‘Consistent pressure’
The US president refused to announce new packages and Kyiv has been corralling Washington’s European allies to step up support.
Kyiv remains “seriously dependent” on US arms supplies, a high-ranking source in the Ukrainian military told AFP.
“Europe is doing its best, but it will be difficult for us without American ammunition,” the source added.
A May report by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said Europe “had only made limited progress” in strengthening its defence industries.
 
 

But it said that “continued US aid remains extremely important for Ukraine’s long-term effectiveness on the battlefield”.
In Moscow, the Kremlin said reducing weapons deliveries to Kyiv would help end the conflict.
“The fewer the number of weapons that are delivered to Ukraine, the closer the end of the special military operation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in response to a question by AFP, using Russia’s term for its more than three-year offensive.
The White House told AFP in an email that the decision to reduce shipments was taken following a “review of our nation’s military support and assistance to other countries”.
Kyiv said it was caught off guard by the move. The defence ministry said the country had “not received any official notifications” on the issue.
“The path to ending the war lies through consistent and joint pressure on the aggressor, as well as through continued support for Ukraine,” it added.
Escalating drone attacks
Politico and other US media reported that missiles for Patriot air defence systems, precision artillery and Hellfire missiles are among the items being held back.

Russia has ramped up attacks on Ukraine in June, launching nearly twice as many missiles and over 30 per cent more drones than in May, according to an AFP analysis of Ukrainian air force data.
Kyiv was in June subjected to at least four fatal attacks that left over 40 dead — and its residents worried that a cessation of US aid would leave the capital even more vulnerable.
“We had gotten used to seeing America as a country of values, a country that defends democracy,” Igor Stambol, a Kyiv resident, told AFP.
“But there is hope that they will remember their values,” the 36-year-old added.</p><small>2025-07-02 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/021525372d285a9.jpg?r=154430' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921636/assistant-commissioner-among-5-killed-in-bajaur-blast' target='_blank'><strong>Assistant commissioner among 5 killed in Bajaur blast</strong></a><br><p>At least five people, including an assistant commissioner, were killed and 11 others injured on Wednesday as a government vehicle was targeted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafique told Dawn.com that five people, including two policemen and a civilian, were killed in an explosion targeting the vehicle on Nawagai Road in Khar tehsil’s Sadiqabad area.
The deceased include Nawagai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Faisal Ismail, Tehsildar Abdul Wakil, Subedar Noor Hakim, and police constable Rashid, according to the DPO.
“The blast was so intense that the vehicle targeted was completely destroyed,” he said, adding that 11 people were injured in the blast and immediately transported to Khar District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital for treatment.
DPO Rafique said security was heightened in the area and relief activities were underway.
The TTP claimed responsibility for the attack.
 
 

The incident report from the hospital’s medical superintendent to provincial health authorities said the bomb blast occurred at 2pm, adding that four bodies and 18 injured were brought to the facility.
KP Health Adviser Ihtisham Ali contacted Khar DHQ’s district health officer and the medical superintendent to enquire about the well-being of those injured in the attack.
“An emergency has been imposed in Bajaur hospitals and health department staff have been alerted for first aid,” he said in a statement.
The health adviser strongly condemned the blast and expressed grief over the demise of AC Ismail and others in the incident. He assured the public that medical assistance would be provided to the injured.
KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed sought a report on the blast from the Malakand regional police officer (RPO).
He also ordered to speed up intelligence-based operations against the TTP and directed the Counter-Terrorism Department’s additional inspector general of police to send a special team to Bajaur.
“A special branch is obtaining intelligence related to the incident,” Hameed said, adding that according to initial information, the TTP targeted the assistant commissioner’s vehicle.
Hameed said that teams were formed “to arrest the elements involved in the incident while all necessary evidence is being collected from the spot”, adding that bomb disposal teams were present on site.
Those elements disturbing the country and province’s peace will be strictly dealt with, the KP police chief said.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed that medical facilities be provided to the injured, according to KP government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif.
Saif, in a statement, strongly condemned the incident and said the loss of lives was regrettable.
“Those who are hostile elements to the country will not be allowed to succeed in their nefarious purposes and will be brought to justice.”
KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah also condemned the incident. He directed the district administration and health department to remain on full alert, provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and utilise all available resources to deal with the emergency situation.
The funeral prayers for the deceased were offered with full official honours at the Police Lines in Bajaur.
The bodies were later sent to their respective home towns under escort by the police special squad. The burials would be conducted with full state honours in their ancestral graveyards.
Condemnations
President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the bomb blast and expressed his grief over the deaths.
The president also extended his condolences and sympathies to the victims’ families and offered prayers for the deceased.
“Terrorists are the enemies of humanity who target people,” Zardari asserted, reiterating Pakistan’s resolve to take “all possible measures to complete [the] eradication of the scourge of terrorism”.
 






In his condemnation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said terrorists were targeting innocent people and they would be given exemplary punishment.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari strongly condemned the attack on X.
“I am deeply saddened by the martyrdom of Nawagai assistant commissioner, tehsildar and other officials in this blast,” he said in a statement.
“Terrorists are staunch enemies of the nation and country [and] do not want peace and tranquillity.”
Extending his prayers to the families of the deceased, Bilawal wrote, “Every individual in Pakistan is united in the war against terrorism.”
 






National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq also strongly condemned the incident.
He expressed deep sorrow and regret over the loss of lives and expressed solidarity with the affected families.
He denounced the targeting of AC Ismail’s vehicle as a “cowardly and shameful act”, urging that those responsible be brought to justice.

Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding messages from party founder Imran Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad and flanked by senior PTI leaders, the party chairman outlined the issues discussed in a high-level meeting and maintained that the PTI would continue efforts to try and free Imran.
 
 

“We discussed the aftermath of the reserved seat ruling, which was the first time that the party formed a strategy together,” Gohar said. “It is our decision that we will stand up together for Imran Khan. We have no personal conflict, we are and will remain united and a message of unity needed to be sent in today’s meeting.”
Gohar added that the meeting discussed Imran’s plan for the party to launch a protest movement, stating: “Whatever Khan sahib decides, we will execute it.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Gohar said that PTI MNAs, MPAs and senators all attended today’s meeting, which discussed a wide range of issues from the reserved seats verdict and the party’s direction to addressing dialogue with the government.
“Whatever direction will be announced, you will see it in due course.”
Discussing the letter from jailed PTI leaders suggesting dialogue with the government, Gohar noted that the media would often infer that the government extended offers for talks, which were rejected by the PTI.
“This is incorrect, from the beginning, Khan sahib said that there should be dialogue,” Gohar said. “Even after our mandate was stolen, he said that. You have taken our seats, but you have registered cases against three of our MNAs, yet Khan sahib says that dialogue needs to be meaningful,” the party chairman added.
Gohar said that there was no delay on the PTI’s part, but said that the government was “not sincere” since it refused to grant the party access to Imran.
Talking about the reserved seats, he noted that there were 25 seats from KP. “Even if these seats go to the opposition … then they are 35 members short. We will protect the KP government at all costs,” Gohar stated. “Those who want to bring a no-confidence motion do not have the required numbers to move even a resolution.”
PTI KP President Junaid Akbar said that all of the provincial political leadership was also present at the meeting and stressed that within the party, decisions by the founder were respected by all members, with “discord set to one side”.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur challenged other parties and institutions to topple the PTI’s government in KP.
“If you have it in you, I challenge your strength and I challenge the state … if you are able to topple our government, then I will leave politics,” he stated.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He criticised the government, saying that it was a “disgraceful stain on the state and its institutions” within the country’s political history, but “they are not ashamed”.
“We are time-tested people who have given sacrifices … So this is a challenge to your powers to try anything only without any conspiracies or unconstitutional ways. But you cannot do it. You cannot topple Khan’s people.”
 


Speaking on the Feb 8 elections, PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja said that they would always be remembered as the most “democratic day” in history, along with the “attack on Pakistani people”, referring to the election results.
“We will continue to struggle for the public. We will succeed. Do not think that by stealing seats, suppressing the judiciary, the people will step back. We are with the people.”
He further said, “We stand with Imran’s struggle for the public. We will continue to struggle for the public.”
Meanwhile, party spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the assembled leadership passed a unanimous resolution against the Constitutional Bench’s verdict on reserved seats and stated that the party would work to ensure the release of Imran and other jailed PTI leaders.
“Legal action, peaceful protest and negotiation are steps we are willing to take,” Akram said, quoting the resolution. He too said the party was united under Imran’s leadership and would remain so.</p><small>2025-07-02 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612082-no-lawful-way-to-oust-ptis-kp-govt-says-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>No lawful way to oust PTI's KP govt, says CM Gandapur</strong></a><br><p>

Footage of the incident, making the rounds on social media since July 1, showed a Lesco guard dragging an elderly woman along the ground by her arm while removing her from the premises.
According to a Power Division statement issued today, the incident of misbehaviour took place on June 30. “The security guard was suspended immediately [and] a first information report was filed. The security guard is now in police custody,” the statement added.
“Breaking the law and humiliating the public will not be tolerated,” the Power Division warned, highlighting that it took strict action against the guard’s misconduct.
The statement added that action was being taken to dismiss the security guard from his job and that the Power Division ordered an inquiry report to be furnished within three days.
Orders were also forwarded to other power supply and distribution companies to “take immediate steps and issue instructions to all offices”.
“The Power Division apologises to the elderly woman and other consumers for this individual’s act,” the statement read. “We highly respect our consumers.”
The Sheikhupura Police also confirmed the man’s arrest in a post on Facebook, detailing that the viral footage prompted District Police Officer (DPO) Bilal Zafar Sheikh to take notice of the incident.
“Police arrested the suspect and registered a case,” DPO Sheikh was quoted as saying. “No one is allowed to take the law into their own hands.”</p><small>2025-07-02 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/021848027e1778c.jpg?r=184945' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921657/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-17th-eco-summit-in-baku-on-july-3' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend 17th ECO summit in Baku on July 3</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) said on Wednesday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will attend the 17th summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Baku, Azerbaijan from July 3-4.
In a statement today, the FO said the prime minister will “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.
He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.
The theme of the summit is ‘New ECO Vision for a Sustainable and Climate Resilient Future’.
 






The 16th ECO summit was held from November 9, 2023, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and attended by then-caretaker prime minister Anwarul Haq Kakar.
According to a statement by ECO, the summit will convene ECO heads of states/governments, ministers, observers, special guests from non-ECO countries and heads of international organisations to achieve development and prosperity through fragile economic integration.
The summit will feature a “dynamic and inclusive ECO Week”, held from July 1–4 across multiple cities in Azerbaijan. The ECO week will include a series of thematic forums aimed at advancing youth engagement, gender inclusion and economic connectivity within the region.
In December, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had signed a charter for research into clean and renewable energy sources at the ECO’s 28th Meeting of the Council of Ministers.
The ECO Clean Energy Centre charter focused on research and development for innovative renewable clean energy sources to combat climate change.
The charter also contributed to the Global Network of Regional Sustainable Energy Centres in the framework of the UN Sustainable Energy for All Initiative.
The foreign minister had also urged member states to ensure the effective implementation of the ECO Trade Agreement to help strengthen regional security and economic prosperity through intra-regional trade.</p><small>2025-07-02 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612075-alert-issued-as-monsoon-activity-likely-to-intensify-in-most-parts-of-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Alert issued as monsoon activity likely to intensify in most parts of Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

“Pakistan is ready to forge a historic, phenomenal partnership with India to jointly combat terror,” he said while addressing an international conference on ‘Pakistan Fighting War for the World against Terrorism’ at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute.
“Not as adversaries playing a zero sum game but as neighbours who share a moral and civilisational obligation to save a billion souls from the plague of extremism.
“All it requires is from India’s leadership is to step down from the high horse heading in the abyss and pursue peace with Pakistan.”
Bilawal also called on the Indian leadership to resolve all outstanding dispute including the Kashmir and the water crisis.
“Let us resolve Kashmir in accordance with the aspirations of the people. Let us end the weaponisation of water. And instead, build peace as mighty as the Himalayas.
“Let us return to our shared traditions grounded not in hatred but in the ancient soil of the Indus Valley civilisation. It is not a weakness to extend a hand. It is wisdom.”
The PPP chairman has been repeatedly calling for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace.
Talking today, the former foreign minister said terrorism is a global crisis that needs to be defeated for a sustainable future. He also highlighted the threat of “digital propaganda” in counter extremism.
“Pakistan is not drifting through the storm of terrorism. We are steering the vessel,” he said, adding that the country has rendered tremendous human and economic loss in this war on terror.
“We are still fighting because the alternate is surrender. And surrender is not a word in Pakistan’s dictionary,” he exclaimed.
 






He also highlighted the rise in militant violence over the past year, saying “2024 was the deadliest year in a decade in which 685 service members embraced martyrdom in 444 separate attacks”.
Bilawal also noted the efforts made by the armed forces and security personnel in combatting terrorism.
“Over the past two decades, Pakistan’s armed forces backed by iron-willed citizens have broken the backs of Al Qaeda networks, dismantled so-called caliphates such as Daesh, and driven the TTP [Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan] from the fortress to the fox hills.”
“Operation Zarb-e-Azab drained the northern swamp, Raddul Fassad uprooted the sleeper cells in our cities and elsewhere. Today, operations in Balochistan sever the connection between separatism and foreign-funded terror.”
‘We saved Kabul’
The former foreign minister said Pakistan supported the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, but instead faced a surge in cross-border terror attacks.
“Taliban regime was greeted as an inevitable fact. They promised the world stability, they delivered a 40 per cent surge in militant attacks on Pakistani soil, and a sanctuary for the TTP, BLA, Etim, and others.
“We saved Kabul. Sovereignty confers duty. Stop the exodus of fighters, choke the traffic of arms, and honour the blood price of the Doha accord or be judged by the company you keep.”
Bilawal said the world should learn lessons from Pakistan’s experience and achievements as the country requires development as an “antidote” against counterinsurgency.
“We need equitable burden sharing. We asked for structured investment in counter terrorism and counter violent extremism, modern technology and weaponry,” he said. “No counterinsurgency has achieved victory without first winning hearts and minds.”
He also delivered a message to the “merchant of hate” within the country, saying “there is no constitutional right to weaponise religion”.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“If the world demands we outlaw militias, it must also demand that all people live free from collective punishment.
“From the Kashmir valley to olive orchards of Palestine, the world must deliver a just peace.”
He said the world has changed drastically since India and Pakistan sat across the table in 2012.
“We have fought and won the most expensive counter terrorism campaign in modern history.  After our removal from FATF grey list, Pakistan stands among the most serious counter terrorism states.
“It is time India recognises this transformation, not as a concession but as an opportunity. Terrorism is a collective menace. No border fence, no nationalist rhetoric, no regional hegemony can shield one nation from a fire it may have helped light on the other side.”
He stressed that terrorists have no nationality, religion, caste, or creed, and this menace respects no law. He called for collective global efforts to eliminate terrorism.</p><small>2025-07-02 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612077-assistant-commissioner-among-five-martyred-in-bajaur-blast' target='_blank'><strong>Assistant commissioner among five martyred in Bajaur blast</strong></a><br><p>

The highest toll was in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 23 dead, including 10 children, the authority said.
Fourteen of the victims were swept away in a flash flood in the Swat Valley last week.
Flash floods and homes collapsing in heavy rain killed 21 others in Punjab, including 11 children, the authority said. In Sindh, 15 people were killed, while five people died in Balochistan.
Separately, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast a significant intensification of monsoon activity across the country beginning from the evening of July 5, with widespread rain, thunderstorms and the possibility of flash floods and urban flooding in several regions.
 
 

According to the Met Office, moist monsoon currents were continuously penetrating the country and would likely strengthen over the weekend.
A westerly wave was also expected to approach the upper parts of the country on July 6, further enhancing the rainfall.
As per the regional forecast highlights, rain-wind/thunderstorms with scattered heavy to very heavy rainfall are expected from July 5-10 in multiple areas, including Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, Rawalakot, Swat, Dir, Malakand, Kohistan, Chitral and others.
Gilgit-Baltistan’s areas, including Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit and Astore, may also experience similar conditions from July 6 to 10.
In Punjab and Islamabad, widespread rain and thunderstorms with heavy falls are expected from July 5-10 in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Faisalabad and several other districts. Southern Punjab regions, including Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan, will receive rain between July 6-8.
About Balochistan, the PMD forecast that rain-thunderstorms are likely in Loralai, Khuzdar and Lasbella from July 3-4 and again from July 6-8.
Sindh’s regions, such as Karachi, Hyderabad, Tharparkar and Sukkur, may experience moderate rainfall during July 3-4, with chances of isolated heavy falls in southeastern parts.
As per possible impacts and public advisory, heavy to very heavy rains may generate flash floods in local nullahs and streams of Murree, Galliyat, Manshera, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan, northeast Punjab, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and parts of Balochistan from the night of July 5-8.
Heavy downpours may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar from July 6-8.
Landslides and mudslides may lead to road closures in vulnerable hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat, AJK and GB during the wet spell.
Heavy rainfall, strong winds and lightning may damage weak structures such as roofs and walls of mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels during the forecast period.
The PMD advised farmers to manage their agricultural activities keeping in view the weather forecast.
The public, travellers and tourists were strongly advised to avoid unnecessary exposure in vulnerable areas and stay updated on weather developments to prevent any untoward situations.
All authorities were also instructed to remain on high alert and take precautionary measures to mitigate any potential risks.
 






In May, at least 32 people were killed in severe storms as the country experienced several extreme weather events in the spring, including strong hailstorms.
Pakistan is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change and its 255 million residents are facing extreme weather events with increasing frequency.
In 2022, monsoon floods submerged a third of the country and killed 1,700 people.</p><small>2025-07-02 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02161859f239de9.jpg?r=162036' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921637/iran-suspends-cooperation-with-un-nuclear-watchdog' target='_blank'><strong>Iran suspends cooperation with UN nuclear watchdog</strong></a><br><p>Iran on Wednesday formally suspended its cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, a measure drawn up in the wake of unprecedented Israeli and US strikes on the Islamic republic’s nuclear sites.
The war between Iran and Israel, which broke out on June 13 and lasted for 12 days, has intensified tensions between Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
On June 25, a day after a ceasefire took hold, Iranian lawmakers overwhelmingly voted in favour of the bill to suspend cooperation with the agency.
State media said today that the legislation had cleared the final hurdle and was in effect.
The text, published by Iranian media, states that the legislation aims to “ensure full support for the inherent rights of the Islamic Republic of Iran” under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and “especially uranium enrichment”.
The issue of enrichment was at the core of disagreements between Washington and Tehran in nuclear negotiations that had been derailed by the war.
Israel and some Western countries had for long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons — an ambition Tehran has consistently denied.
The text of the law did not specify concrete moves linked to the suspension of cooperation with the IAEA, whose inspectors have had access to declared nuclear facilities.
Following the parliament vote, the bill was approved by the Guardian Council, a body tasked with vetting legislation, before a final ratification from the presidency.
 
 

Iranian President “Masoud Pezeshkian promulgated the law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency”, state TV said today.
Iranian officials have sharply criticised the IAEA for what they described as the agency’s “silence” in the face of the Israeli and US attacks on Iranian nuclear sites.
Germany said on Wednesday that Iran’s decision to suspend cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog sends a “disastrous signal”.
“For a diplomatic solution, it is essential for Iran to work with the IAEA,” foreign ministry spokesman Martin Giese told reporters after Tehran formally enacted the suspension.
‘Deceptive and fraudulent’
Tehran has also lambasted the UN agency for a resolution adopted on June 12 that accuses Iran of non-compliance with its nuclear obligations.
Iranian officials said the resolution was among the “excuses” for the Israeli attacks.
 
 

Senior judiciary official Ali Mozaffari said today that IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi should “be held accountable” for what he called “preparing the groundwork for the crime” against Iran, referring to Israel’s air raids.
Mozaffari accused Grossi of “deceptive actions and fraudulent reporting”, according to Iranian news agency Tasnim.
Iran has rejected a request from Grossi to visit nuclear facilities bombed during the war, and earlier this week Pezeshkian decried his “destructive” conduct.
Iran has said Grossi’s request to visit the bombarded sites signalled “malign intent” but insisted there were no threats against him or against inspectors from his agency.
France, Germany and Britain have condemned unspecified “threats” against the IAEA chief.
Iran’s ultra-conservative Kayhan newspaper has recently claimed that documents showed Grossi was an Israeli spy and should be executed.
‘Serious’ damage
On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said the parliament vote to halt cooperation with the IAEA reflected the “concern and anger of the Iranian public opinion”.
The 12-day war began when Israel launched a major bombing campaign on Iran and killed top military commanders, nuclear scientists, and hundreds of civilians, with Tehran responding with waves of missiles and drones launched at Israel.
On June 22, Israel’s ally the United States launched unprecedented strikes of its own on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz.
 
 

More than 900 people were killed in Iran, according to the judiciary.
Iran’s retaliatory attacks killed 28 people in Israel, according to authorities.
US President Donald Trump said the US attacks had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme, though the extent of the damage was not clear.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has admitted “serious” damage to nuclear sites.

The benchmark KSE-100 index opened on a positive note, rising by 1,430.07 points (1.12 per cent) to reach 129,629.49 points at 10:07am, from the previous close of 128,199.42 points.
Shares then rose further to reach 130,344.03 points at close, gaining 2,144.61 points (1.67pc) from yesterday.
The PSX extended its record-breaking rally for the fourth consecutive session today, which analysts attributed to easing inflation and signs of macroeconomic stability.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said the increase in tax rate on income from debt securities, along with a change in the taxation structure for mutual funds to proportionate holdings of equities and fixed income, has resulted in inflows to equities from fixed income.
“Significant reduction in inflation rate — fell to a low of nine years — with improved outlook has increased the odds for further reduction in policy rate, which will help in continuation of flows towards equities,” he said.
The annual inflation rate has dropped sharply to a nine-year low of 4.49pc during the fiscal year 2024-25 from 23.41pc in the previous year. Pakistan is currently experiencing disinflation, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels.
Optimism around fiscal reforms announced in the federal budget also contributed to the rally.
“Continuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in the limelight,” Ashraf said a day ago.
In a recent statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted the KSE-100’s record close reflected growing confidence in the government’s economic policies. He described the index’s performance as a testament to the strengthening and stabilising sentiment surrounding the national economy.</p><small>2025-07-02 11:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0215282404f6ab1.jpg?r=152829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921635/bangladeshs-fugitive-ex-leader-hasina-sentenced-to-six-months' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s fugitive ex-leader Hasina sentenced to six months</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh on Wednesday convicted fugitive ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina of contempt of court and issued a six-month prison sentence in absentia, the first verdict since she was ousted last year.
Hasina, 77, fled to neighbouring India at the culmination of the student-led uprising in August 2024, and has defied orders to return to Dhaka.
“She will serve the sentence the day she arrives in Bangladesh or surrenders to the court,” chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told reporters after the court decision.
The case centred around comments that prosecutors said she had made after she was ousted from power, which they said threatened witnesses in ongoing court hearings.
“The prosecution team believes her comment created an aura of fear among those who filed the cases and among the witnesses,” Islam said.
Shakil Akanda Bulbul, a fugitive leader of her now-banned Awami League, was sentenced to two months in prison in the same case.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August last year, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government ordered a crackdown on protesters in a failed bid to cling to power.
In a separate ongoing trial that began on June 1, prosecutors say that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence.
Her state-appointed defence lawyer said she has denied the multiple charges that amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.</p><small>2025-07-02 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612040-pakistan-ready-to-forge-phenomenal-partnership-with-india-to-combat-terror-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ready to forge 'phenomenal partnership' with India to combat terror: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

Taobao, China’s e-commerce champion launched by Alibaba in 2003, said in a WeChat statement that the 50bn yuan ($6.97bn) would “directly subsidise consumers and merchants” over a 12-month period starting Wednesday.
The spending incentives on Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature will take the form of “red envelopes” — a digital form of traditional cash gifts — as well as discounts on products, deliveries and commissions, the statement said.
Taobao said that the subsidies will “provide consumers with preferential and convenient services and experiences, further stimulating consumption vitality”.
Beijing is battling to stave off deflationary pressure, which has threatened to dampen economic growth even as challenges elsewhere mount.
A lengthy property sector crisis and a fierce trade war with the United States this year have exacerbated concerns among Chinese households about making major purchases.
 
 

Chinese authorities have sought to allay fears, unleashing a series of aggressive policy measures aimed at boosting spending, including key interest rate cuts and various consumer goods trade-in schemes.
Results have been mixed, with retail sales in May growing at the fastest clip year-on-year since December 2023, according to official statistics, even as commercial property prices in a group of 70 key cities fell from April.
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday urged efforts to “advance the building of a unified national market” during a high-level meeting on economic policy, state news agency Xinhua said.
Leaders at the meeting also called for better management of “low-price disorderly competition” among companies.
“As China’s economy faces deflation pressures and a weak labour market, the government aims to address these challenges from the supply side,” Zhiwei Zhang, President and Chief Economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in response to Tuesday’s meeting.
“The top priority seems to be preventing over-competition,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-02 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02135838db26e41.jpg?r=135845' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921620/pakistan-and-india-likely-to-clash-on-sept-7-in-asia-cup-2025-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and India likely to clash on Sept 7 in Asia Cup 2025: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and India are expected to play against each other “likely” on September 7 in the Asia Cup 2025 — set to begin on September 4 or 5 in the UAE, according to a report by The Times of India on Wednesday.
The T-20 tournament will mark the 17th edition of the Asia Cup, beginning with a group stage and then a super-four round. The participating teams include India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and the UAE.
According to Asia Cup’s website, recent political tensions between India and Pakistan have made UAE the frontrunner to host the tournament or serve as part of a hybrid hosting model. The multi-nation tournament was initially going to be hosted solely by India.
According to the Indian media report, a 17-day window has been almost finalised by the Asian Cricket Council, where India and Pakistan are to clash on September 7. The two teams could also see a second match on September 14, depending on how the teams progress.
The report said that all the participating teams are currently in the process of getting approvals from their respective governments, adding that promotional activities for the tournament are already underway.
The recent India-Pakistan tensions briefly cast a shadow on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. The BCCI later termed the report as “speculative and imaginary”, according to the Press Trust of India.
India will host the women’s 50-overs World Cup this year, but Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement made by the International Cricket Council.
India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy this year and played all their matches, including the March 9 final, in Dubai.
Bilateral cricket has been suspended since 2013 between the Asian neighbours, who play each other only in multi-team events.</p><small>2025-07-02 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612037-hrcp-expresses-concern-over-shrinking-space-for-human-rights-work' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP expresses concern over 'shrinking space' for human rights work</strong></a><br><p>

The April 22 attack in held Kashmir’s Pahalgam sparked heavy fighting between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry as India blamed it on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
The US State Department issued a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the grouping, who met in Washington, but stopped short of naming Pakistan or blaming Islamabad.
“The Quad unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism,” the ministers said in the statement.
 
 

They called on all members of the United Nations to cooperate actively with “all relevant authorities” in delivering justice to the “perpetrators, organisers, and financiers of this reprehensible act”, without any delay.
India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington’s effort to counter China’s rising influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a strong partner in counterterrorism efforts.
On May 7, Pakistan shot down six Indian jets after they bombed sites across the border that New Delhi alleged were “terrorist infrastructure”, setting off an exchange of attacks between the two countries by fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery that killed dozens until a ceasefire on May 10.
The ceasefire was first announced by US President Donald Trump on social media after Washington held talks with both sides, but India has differed with Trump’s claims that it resulted from his intervention and threats to sever trade talks.
 
 

India’s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.
On Monday, India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, restated its position that trade was not a factor in the ceasefire.
“Relationships will never be free of issues,” he said, referring to the United States, adding, “What matters is the ability to deal with it and to keep that trend going in the positive direction.”
Last week, defence ministers attending a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting failed to adopt a joint communiqué as New Delhi refused to sign the statement over the exclusion of language referring to the Pahalgam attack.
The discord was a rare outcome for the 10-member Eurasian bloc that prides itself on consensus-based decision-making.</p><small>2025-07-02 08:47</small></div><hr>
