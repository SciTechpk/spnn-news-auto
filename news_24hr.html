Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20 per cent the mass of our Sun.
It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets. But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy.
This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant. The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.

With a slightly larger radius than Saturn, planet is only half its mass

The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by Nasa’s TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile’s Very Large Telescope.
“The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,” study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK’s Warwick University said.
Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an “intriguing discovery”.
“We don’t really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!” he said. “This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.”
The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze towards the planet next year to help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.

Here is some of what we know thus far. They are likely to announce an FBR revenue target around Rs14 trillion (maybe slightly higher).
Current expenditures are supposed to stay just below Rs23tr, of which around Rs16tr are federal and the rest from the provinces. The underlying primary balance (deficit plus interest expenditures) must remain somewhere near Rs1.17tr.
These numbers will be more or less fixed since they are part of the medium-term framework already worked out with the IMF and released in the last staff report. Whatever space will need to be made for shifting tax and expenditure priorities must be created in a way that does not change these numbers by too much.
Now consider what they will have to do in the budget. First up, defence spending is supposed to increase by around 13.7 per cent, as per the same medium-term framework, which was drawn up before the recent conflict. We will see how much of an increase actually comes now that the resource requirements of the security forces have undoubtedly increased following the war.
Usually the first place to see cuts is development spending. In the current year, for example, development spending was supposed to be less than Rs1tr as per the understanding with the IMF, but the government still announced a federal development programme spending target of Rs1.4tr in its budget last year. But until March, barely Rs309 billion had been spent, while the provinces raced ahead and have spent more than Rs1.2tr already. For next year they are trying to keep the federal development programme down to Rs1tr again. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has implored the provinces to cooperate with the centre and announce smaller development programmes for the next fiscal year. It is unlikely the provinces will oblige. And the federal government will have to starve its own plans, and its MNAs, in order to keep the fiscal equation more or less in control.

Rarely have conditions been so favourable for a government to do something big and transformative.

Along with demands for heightened defence spending will come demands for ‘relief’ from the citizenry, especially salaried individuals and businesses crushed under a Nordic tax burden. Probably the single largest growth in tax contribution this year has come from salaried individuals, as per figures reported in reputable news dailies.
Consider a few numbers. One reported figure shows that by the time this fiscal year ends, the salaried class would have paid an additional Rs182bn in taxes compared to what it paid last year. Mind you, this is incremental tax, over and above what it paid last year. This would make for a growth rate of almost 50pc in collections from salaried people. Nobody else in the country has borne an incremental burden of this magnitude while seeing their income stagnate and its value be obliterated by the most ferocious inflationary fire this country has ever seen. This burden came right as that fire died down. Salaried people have seen predatory taxation and must be the first in line for relief in this budget.
The rising burden on compliant taxpayers has turned into a very serious issue. It was always serious, but now it is probably one of the most important drags on the economy, along with rising energy costs, a poor trade regime, policy inconsistency and lack of sanctity of contracts and all the traditional items we place on this list. How can they expect growth to reach 4.2pc next fiscal year without wider burden-sharing in revenue collection?
If there is any ‘relief’ for real estate speculators in the budget, we will know that this government is standing on legs of jelly. If there are no credible efforts to increase the base of taxation, we will know this government has surrendered without a fight. From what we hear, they are planning far-reaching trade liberalisation. If this step is not accompanied with credible fiscal measures to arrest the growth of the tax burden on compliant payers, we will know the government is not serious about any trade reform or promoting exports, as they claim. They are merely ticking boxes and fulfilling formalities and hiding behind pious-sounding invocations of change and reform.
We have a moment of opportunity here. The economy has stabilised. The inflationary fire has been doused, the deficits bridged, the exchange rate is on an even keel and foreign exchange reserves are on an upward path. Beyond this, the government enjoys the backing of the powerful establishment and there is no opposition to speak of. Rarely have conditions been this favourable to do something big and transformative.
A lot of sacrifices have been made to bring this about. Let’s not mince words here. Our freedoms, our rights and even our votes have been trampled upon so that the government can enjoy calmer waters to operate in. Our incomes have been burned, and of what is left, a massive share has been appropriated in the name of bridging the yawning deficits that were taking us perilously close to total unviability. This is a lot of sacrifice for a common citizen to have to make.
Now that it has all been done, the least we are owed in return is that something good should come out of it. Give us some sort of a breakthrough, somewhere. Currently, we have a revenue base so narrow that only a ballet dancer could pirouette on it. We have a power sector that generates circular debt more effectively than electricity. We have SOEs whose accumulated losses are comparable to the cost of a large infrastructure project. We are blessed with so many monuments to failed governance that this list gets truly impressive. Those ruling us should make at least one breakthrough against this list to vindicate themselves, and they can start with the upcoming budget.

Over 200 inmates escaped from the facility after the city experienced slight tremors late Monday and early Tuesday.
Prisoners were allowed into the jail’s courtyard after the minor quakes and from there all hell broke loose, as the inmates overpowered the guards and made for the exits. As per news agencies, there were only 28 guards on duty to watch over 2,000 prisoners, while the jail’s security cameras were also reportedly not functioning. At the time of writing, a significant number of escapees remained at large.
 
 

As the Sindh chief minister said, the jailbreak represented a “complete breakdown in communication and preparedness”. The Sindh government says the escaped prisoners were involved in “minor offences”. The threat to public safety would have been considerably higher had these escapees included hard-core militants, or those involved in heinous crimes.
The episode reveals that our penitentiaries are woefully underprepared for emergency situations. The jail staff should have been trained to safely evacuate prisoners in case of natural disasters or other emergencies, while also ensuring they remained under the watch of law enforcers. Instead, what was witnessed was panic and a state of total unpreparedness. The incident again underscores the need to speed up jail reforms countrywide.
In many instances, our jails are still run under colonial frameworks. Overcrowding is common, while facilities contain under-trial prisoners as well as convicts. When jails have far more inmates than they can safely accommodate, mismanagement and chaos are natural corollaries. Speeding up trials and keeping probation options open for those involved in minor crimes should be considered. It is a fact that a broken legal and criminal justice system results in overcrowded and poorly managed jails.
 
 

Jail security also needs to be beefed up. The episode in Malir has shown that there are major lacunae concerning prison security. The Sindh authorities need to ensure that all the escaped prisoners are recaptured soon. In the past, the massive Bannu jailbreak showed that when the state lets its guard down, violent elements exploit loopholes — with terrifying consequences.
The chief justice of Pakistan is leading efforts to reform penitentiaries. These efforts must examine all proposals designed to ensure prisoners’ welfare and rehabilitation, as well as address loopholes in the security of prisons. Once these recommendations have been finalised, the chief justice should ensure that the federal and provincial governments implement them without delay.
The Malir jailbreak cannot be ignored, and should lead to visible changes in jail security and management.

• Israeli army designates roads leading to Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s aid centres ‘combat zones’
• UK minister seeks ‘independent’ probe into deadly incidents
UNITED NATIONS: The United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access in Gaza, which Washington claimed undermined ongoing diplomacy to resolve the conflict.
“This resolution would undermine diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire that reflects the realities on the ground and emboldens Hamas. This resolution also draws false equivalence between Israel and Hamas,” said Washington’s United Nations envoy Dorothy Shea.
The result of the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, one vote against (by the US), and zero abstentions. It was the 15-member UNSC’s first vote on the subject since November, when the US blocked a move calling for an end to fighting.
In her remarks before the votes, the US ambassador said she would not back the resolution. “United States opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise.
“The United States has taken the very clear position since this conflict began that Israel has the right to defend itself, which includes defeating Hamas and ensuring they are never again in a position to threaten Israel. In this regard, any product that undermines our close ally Israel’s security is a non-starter.”
The new resolution, seen by AFP, “demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza respected by all parties.”
It also calls for the “immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all [prisoners] held by Hamas and other groups.” Underlining a “catastrophic humanitarian situation” in the Palestinian territory, the resolution additionally demands the lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Israel’s war on Gaza since October 2023 has killed at least 54,607 Palestinians and wounded 125,341, according to the health ministry.
16 more killed in Gaza
On Wednesday, Israeli bombardment killed at least 16 people in Gaza, including 12 in a single strike on a tent sheltering displaced people, the civil defence agency said. A day earlier, 27 people were killed when Israeli troops opened fire near a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s site in southern Gaza. The US- and Israeli-backed group operating aid sites in Gaza later shut its facilities, as the Israeli army warned that roads leading to distribution centres were “considered combat zones”.
At least 95 Palestinians were killed and 440 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours, the enclave’s health ministry said on Wednesday.
The wave of deadly incidents at the aid distribution sites in the Gaza Strip drew condemnation from the United Nations, as the UN aid chief said the recent ‘horrifying scenes’ of Gazans being killed while trying to access food aid were the result of ‘a series of deliberate choices that have systematically deprived two million people of the essentials they need to survive’.
“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement.
UK protests
On the other hand, pro-Palestinian protesters staged demonstrations outside the House of Parliament in London, calling for sanctions on Israel over ongoing hunger among Gaza’s war-struck population. The demonstrations were organised by several campaign groups, including Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Avaaz and Parents for Palestine.
Amid the protests, the UK government called for an “immediate and independent investigation” into the deaths. UK’s Minister for Middle East Hamish Falconer said the deaths of Palestinians as they sought food were “deeply disturbing” as he called Israel’s new measures for aid delivery “inhumane”.
Also, the BBC defended its Gaza coverage after White House criticism of its reporting of an incident in which Palestinians were killed near a Gaza aid centre, after the White House accused the broadcaster of taking “the word of Hamas”.

The provincial cabinet had decided to cut the power tariffs of these two plants by 30-40 per cent to reduce electricity bills. This move is similar to the federal government’s, which recently renegotiated contracts with independent power plants (IPPs) to reduce tariffs.
The provincial government said that both power companies would not make a profit or withdraw savings, and the amount would be diverted towards public relief. The two state-owned entities had been making between Rs12 to Rs13 billion in profit, which they would now forgo.
Likewise, both companies had savings of about Rs12 billion and it was decided they would not withdraw it to make room for tariff cuts. The amount saved on these heads is expected to translate into a 30 to 40 per cent reduction in electricity rates. This relief would then be conveyed to the federal government to help it overall reduce national tariffs.

Provincial govt says two state-owned companies will forgo profits, give up savings; CM Maryam asks authorities to curb vaping

Welcoming the step, power sector experts believe that Punjab still has more margin, which can be exploited. For example, local banks, which financed these projects, can be requested to reduce the mark-up rate, and a shift away from payments in dollars can also create further space, besides any insurance rate cuts.
Ideally, the government should have shifted loans and their servicing to its accounts; however, what it has already done is commendable and should help reduce national tariff, they added.
In February this year,  the government claimed to have secured about Rs1.571 trillion in savings in future payments to a total of 27 independent power producers (IPPs) through re-negotiations.
This was the key takeaway from a presentation made by the power division officials before the Senate Standing Committee on Power.
“The above savings will be passed on to the consumers through changes in agreements and tariffs over the contracting period,” read one of the slides that had been shared with the panel. It explained that Rs411 billion in savings had been secured through the termination of contracts with five IPPs, Rs238bn through the revision of tariff contracts with eight bagasse-based IPPs, and Rs922bn in tariff revisions with 14 thermal IPPs.
Meanwhile, the provincial cabinet has also approved the ’Chief Minister Wheat Program 2025’.
The establishment of Punjab’s first ‘Air Punjab Private Limited Company’ was also approved. CM Maryam Nawaz decided to start the airline within one year. She directed to ensure “safety gear” for labourers and workers and assigned the labour department a target of implementing safety SOPs within one month.
About the cabinet’s decision to shut down vaping stores, Dr Imran Aslam, the CM’s PRO confirmed that she had instructed the departments concerned to impose a ban on vaping as well.
Punjab Energy Secretary Dr Naeem Rauf told Dawn that in light of the recent decision, they would approach Nepra for a reduction in power tariffs for these two plants and would likely revise their power purchasing agreements so that these price reductions get permanence and are reflected in the new tariff.

• Met Office warns of above-normal rate of snow melting in GB, raising risk of Glof events
ISLAMABAD: India’s ‘water aggression’, higher-than-normal estimated rainfall and temperatures have reduced the response time for floods expected in the upcoming monsoon season, raising the risk of greater natural and man-made devastation unless improved vigilance and coordination is ensured, particularly in the country’s eastern parts.
This was the central theme of the annual flood preparation meeting of the federal and provincial governments on Wednesday, presided by Fed­e­ral Minister for Water Resources Muhammad Mueen Wattoo.
Participants of the meeting agreed to enhanced inter-agency and inter-provincial coordination and round-the-clock vigilance to manage flood risks during the upcoming monsoon season, set to begin on July 1.
The Pakistan Meteorological Depar­tment (PMD) officials told participants that temperatures were already abo­ve normal in Gilgit-Baltistan and forecast to remain so in the days ahead, resulting in above-normal snow-melting.
As a consequence, there could be higher and repeated chances of Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (Glofs) in the monsoon season.
The rainfalls were also projected to be higher than normal across the country, particularly in the northern parts — Azad Jammu and Kashmir, GB, Potohar and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — and there could be greater frequency of all-weather events, including excessive thunderstorms and hailstorms.
Adding risks to the challenge was the unpredictability of water events from across the eastern borders as India is not sharing data relating to weather and river flows. Therefore, it was decided to be extra vigilant in relevant areas, particularly more than extra vigilance would need to be kept at Sialkot flood warning station because that would not provide more than 5-6 hours of response time.
In this regard, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) expressed serious apprehensions over unpredictable and volatile Chenab flows which had already started affecting the Mangla dam filling. India has been reducing Chenab flows, forcing irrigation authorities to discharge around 40,000 cusecs of water from Mangla Dam instead of normal 10,000 cusecs a few days ago. Chenab flows reached just 6,000 cusecs about three days ago instead of 35,000-40,000 cusecs. The Mangla dam releases had to be increased to compensate for Chenab loss. With some improvements for subsequent two days, India against reduced flows to 21,000 cusecs on Monday.
An official statement said the PMD has “forecasted normal to slightly above-normal rainfall across central and southern Pakistan for the July to September period. Enhanced precipitation is expected in northeastern Punjab and Kashmir, while northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan may experience normal to below-normal rainfall”.
The forecast also warned of higher-than-normal temperatures nationwide, increasing the likelihood of extreme hydrological events such as riverine floods, flash floods, urban flooding, and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs), the statement said.
Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), on the other hand, reported that enough storage was available both in Tarbela and Mangla dams and even at Chashma barrage. Therefore, there would not be a big challenge to cater for floods, whether on the Indus or Jhelum side as standard operating procedures were in place for controlled discharges downstream reservoirs in case of peak floods. However, localities around catchment areas in the northern part could be at risk in case of unusual floods.
In view of these inputs, the meeting agreed to have enhanced inter-agency coordination and round-the-clock vigilance to manage flood risks during the upcoming monsoon season. The crucial meeting, an annual ritual, was held to assess national preparedness for Monsoon Season 2025 and brought together representatives from federal agencies and provincial governments, to review flood mitigation strategies and pre-emptive measures for the safe passage of potential floodwaters.
Minister Mueen Wattoo directed to ensure immediate clearance of storm water drains in major urban centers and removal of encroachments and debris around waterways, particularly near barrages and key infrastructure such as National Highway Authority and Pakistan Railways bridges, to prevent floodwater blockages. Special attention was given to the de-silting and encroachment removal from urban nullahs in flood-prone cities including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi, the statement said.
The chairman of the Federal Flood Commission briefed the meeting on pre-monsoon initiatives undertaken by the Commission, including readiness assessments and coordination plans. Stakeholders reported on ongoing monitoring of river flows, infrastructure readiness, and the functionality of meteorological and telemetry systems.
The minister also called for special attention to ensure the safety of vulnerable communities and public infrastructure.

This is a good decision and should help prevent future controversies, especially where friction among the federating units over certain water storage projects in the past is concerned. Speaking at a jirga at the Corps Headquarters Peshawar on Tuesday, Mr Sharif also directed the authorities to speed up the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha hydropower project.
 
 

However, it is doubtful whether new water storage schemes are the answer to India’s threat of throttling the flows from the rivers allotted to Pakistan under the IWT or to the shortages in our rivers resulting from the impact of rapid climate change. So far as the Indian threat to Pakistan’s water security is concerned, this battle will have to be fought and won at the multiple dispute-resolution forums provided under the treaty if New Delhi tries to implement its illegal plan — at its own peril.
Meanwhile, a number of experts are of the view that the construction of new dams will not solve the problem of increasing water scarcity, especially when it becomes difficult to fill existing dams to capacity due to the increase in the number of dry and snowless days.
Rather, they say that dams would only worsen the impact of climate change by reducing flows into the rivers. Some even argue that such schemes are mostly pushed by lobbies that stand to financially benefit from them. Likewise, the plan to spend billions of dollars on expensive hydropower is hardly justified when the country has yet to harvest abundant solar and wind power at a fraction of its price. Such expensive projects are debatable amid a huge resource crunch.
 
 

As pointed out by the Planning Commission, the falling output of both industrial and food crops, owing to bad policies — as well as climate impact and higher input cost — is quite alarming.
If anything, Pakistan needs constantly flowing rivers regenerating hundreds of kilometres of adjacent aquifers for sustainable and affordable water harvesting for economic growth, food security and renewable energy, and not large dams or costly hydropower projects at the expense of other essential socioeconomic infrastructure.

ISLAMABAD: Amid final consultations on the budget, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) wants strict compliance with programme requirements, including the coverage of agriculture income tax in provincial budgets to ensure effective collection starting no later than September 2025.
The Fund also does not agree with a plan for incentivising enhanced power consumption desired by the federal government to absorb surplus capacity. Informed sources said the IMF wanted a strong commitment from the provinces for expenditure control, notwithstanding expansionary development plans presented by the provinces and approved by the National Economic Council (NEC). The four provinces have already exceeded their development allocations for next year by almost Rs850 billion than the IMF’s estimates.
The provinces, on the other hand, might not be able to provide a committed budget surplus this year, given the Centre’s revenue shortfall, and were maximising their next year allocations to ensure they did not lose their financial rights guaranteed by the National Finance Commission (NFC) before its next meeting.
The IMF also wants full implementation of the agriculture income tax and related services that the federal government and the provinces have not been able to settle, as the Centre believed corporate agriculture fell within its domain.
The sources said the authorities had tried their best getting a waiver for the sale of 7000mw of surplus power capacity at marginal cost — meaning no subsidy involved — but the Fund believed similar distortions in the economy, including taxation, incentives and allowances, had landed the country in a difficult state of affairs.
The government believed that surplus power could help boost economic activity if provided to new consumer sectors and industrial sectors even at breakeven rates, but the IMF believed it to be unfair to existing consumers paying a heavy price.
It was also considered unjustified to force old industries running at higher input costs to compete with new setups running on cheaper energy. The government was advised to continue cost-cutting efforts to stabilise the power sector and provide a level playing field to all. In this context, it was yet unclear if a section of the government trying to allocate 2000MW electricity to crypto farming would succeed in providing 3-4 cents per unit (Rs8-9 per unit) against Rs24-25 per unit base rate.
The IMF has also opposed provincial subsidies on electricity and gas as provided during the current year by Punjab, which intends to repeat it next year. In addition, it wants joint strategies to fight electricity and gas theft and smuggling to minimise financial leakage and tax loss. In this regard, the provinces would also have to right-size their departments in the next year to support a similar federal exercise during the current year.
The FBR tax target for next year would remain around Rs14.2tr or so as agreed during the first review of the extended fund programme a couple of months ago. Most of the other estimates shared at the time would also remain unchanged. There would be minor relaxation in tax rates for the salaried class but greater focus on recoveries from the retail sector. The cross-cutting theme of the next year’s budget would be digitisation and differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital means.

The draft of the bill was moved by Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) MPA Mir Sadiq Sanjrani.
JUI-F MPA Ms Shahida Rauf, while speaking on the floor of the House, said that the bill is being bro­ught to the assembly with good intentions and her party would support it.
She, however, suggested to the Leader of the House that every clause of the bill should be discussed in the House again so that there remained no ambiguity about it.
“If only one party opposes it, that will cause great loss to the province,” Ms Rauf said, adding that the bill should not be passed in haste.
Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, while taking up the issue of missing persons, said the matter must be resolved.
Commenting on the draft of the amendment, he said the anti-terrorism bill might be correct, but it needs to be clear who it actually benefits.
 
 

“Who will be held accountable for those being killed?” Maulana Rehman said, adding that the Counter Terrorism Department’s actions are visible to everyone and the House should be taken into confidence on the bill and it should be passed only after taking the opinion of every member of the House.
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed the issue of missing persons has been used to discredit state institutions, and legislation was the solution to the problem.
“We must now prevent this issue from being misused. Now, anyone arrested will be presented before a magistrate.”
Six-year sunset clause
The bill, seen by Dawn, proposes that anyone suspected of offences enshrined in the anti-terrorism law may be held in preventive detention for up to three months for the purpose of inquiry.
The inquiry will be held by a police officer not below the rank of Superintendent or through a Joint Interrogation Team (JIT). If the detention order is issued by the armed forces or intelligence agencies, the inquiry shall be conducted by a JIT consisting of members of the concerned agency.
During the course of inquiry, the concerned law enforcement officer heading it shall be vested with all powers relating to search, arrest, and seizure of property and other materials relevant to the offence.
The amended law also allows for detainees to be confined in a detention / rehabilitation / de-radicalisation centre who, upon a written request by the investigating agency or investigating officer, can be handed over to any law enforcement agency for the purpose of investigation.
The provincial government shall notify Oversight Board(s), comprising two civilians, two military officers, a psychiatrist, and a criminologist, under the chairmanship of the additional chief secretary (Home) or any other nominated officer to assess the case of each detainee and their ideological disposition and mental, physical, and psychological condition during detention, and recommend, where necessary, their transfer to a rehabilitation / de-radicalisation centre.
Explaining the bill’s salient features, CM Bugti told the House that if any institution picks someone up, it can keep them in custody for up to three months, after which they must be presented before a court and informed of the charges filed against him/her.
The detained person will be kept in a centre where he/she can meet their family members and the lawyer of the detained person will also be informed about it.
“If anyone disappears beyond this system, then he/she will be considered a truly missing person,” Mr Bugti said, adding that the new law would be valid for six years. The legislation also includes a provision to extend its operation by two years through a notification by the provincial government.

• Centre to finance projects worth Rs1 trillion amid 29pc PSDP cut, provincial allocations to fund the rest
• Sindh, KP ‘unhappy’ with exclusion of projects from federal budget
• Premier, all CMs to meet today on Indian moves against Pakistan’s water
ISLAMABAD: Fuelled by a 22pc increase in provincial allocations, the National Economic Council (NEC) on Wednesday approved with consensus a record Rs4.22 trillion national development outlay for the next fiscal year to upgrade growth rate to 4.2pc from 2.7 this year, despite an IMF-decreed 29pc cut in the public sector development programme (PSDP) compared to the current year.
The provincial expansionary stance is expected to come under the International Monetary Fund’s watch, which has been pushing for greater provincial cash surpluses to support the federal government in delivering a healthy amount for debt servicing, besides effective taxation of the agriculture income under a new national fiscal pact.
The meeting of the NEC — the country’s highest economic decision-making forum — was moved up by a day so that the prime minister, who chaired the meeting, could travel abroad. All provincial chief ministers, the deputy prime minister, and federal ministers for planning, finance and information were present. PM’s adviser Rana Sanaullah also attended the meeting.
The meeting also decided that the PM and all CMs would meet on Thursday morning for a special meeting in light of India’s move to disrupt Pakistan’s water share. They will ponder a strategy to safeguard Pakistan’s water resources.
The development portfolio includes Rs1tr from PSDP, Rs2.869 trillion from the provincial annual development plans (ADPs), and Rs355bn for separate projects by the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through their resources.
Technically speaking, the Centre has allocated Rs880bn for the PSDP, down 20pc when compared to the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr and 37pc lower than the original allocation of Rs1.4tr. Yet, the government pitched the PSDP at Rs1tr after including Rs120bn to be generated through a petroleum levy imposed by the prime minister last month to finance projects in Balochistan.
The provincial share for next year has gone up by 22pc from Rs2.358tr. The provinces had pitched Rs2.795tr ADPs two days ago at the meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), but revised it to Rs2.869tr for the next year.
Punjab leads charge
The next year’s development plan is led by Punjab with a record Rs1.204tr, 20pc higher than the Centre, up 10.6pc compared to the current year’s Rs1.089tr. This is the first time a federating unit has exceeded the federal allocation, showing enhanced financial muscle of the provinces. Sindh trailed just behind the Centre with Rs967bn allocation, a healthy 27pc increase from its current year’s Rs705bn development fund. Punjab and Sindh enhanced their allocations by Rs16bn and Rs80bn respectively over what they had reported to the APCC on Monday.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa announced to invest Rs417bn in development next year, showing a massive 33pc increase over the current year’s allocation of Rs313bn. It had reported Rs440bn ADP in APCC but scaled down by Rs23bn. Balochistan, mostly dependent on the federal support, would announce Rs281bn development plan, up 12pc over the current year’s Rs252bn. Likewise, estimates for SOE’s projects were also jacked up to Rs355bn from Rs288bn two days ago.
Sources said despite their own heavy allocations, the Sindh and KP chief ministers complained over exclusion of their projects from the federal budget, while the Balochistan chief minister thanked the Centre for giving special attention to the restive province. KP chief minister’s adviser on finance Muzammil Aslam, however, appreciated the centre’s limitations in the given circumstances.
The cash-strapped government, however, did not forget protecting allocations for coalition partners’ parliamentarians scheme at Rs50bn and also enhanced funds for PML-N’s trademark road-building projects.
All other sectors, including special areas like Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, would be handicapped by lower allocations, as all sectors, including energy, food, and water, faced funding constraints.
Based on these spending plans, the government set next year’s growth target at 4.2pc, supported by 4.4pc target in agriculture output, 4.3pc in industry and 4pc in the services sector, and an inflation rate at 7.5pc.
It set the target for national savings at 14.3pc of GDP in FY 2025-26, slightly higher than the current year’s 14.1pc and total investment of 14.7pc of GDP, up from 13.8pc in FY 2024-25. This reflects a narrowing saving investment gap to be financed through modest external inflows.
Public investment is projected to increase from 2.9pc to 3.2p; similarly, private investment is also projected to rise from 9.1pc of GDP to 9.8pc. Fiscal and monetary policies will aim for consolidation and stability, with an expected inflation of 7.5pc due to the low base effect and risk of ongoing trade tensions and domestic tariff rationalisation measures.
The agriculture growth will be supported by a recovery in important crops (6.7pc) and cotton ginning (7pc), as well as robust performance in livestock.  The industrial sector is expected to benefit from a significant revival in LSM with 3.5pc growth, the planning ministry said, with 3pc growth in mining and quarrying, “alongside sustained growth momentum in construction and energy, gas and water supply”.
The services sector, which forms the largest share of GDP, is set to grow by 4pc, underpinned by stronger performance in wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage & communications, financial services and real estate.

• Bilawal says New Delhi can’t be ‘net security provider’ in the region if it can’t even defend its own skies
• Dar blames political rhetoric from Indian leaders for keeping South Asia tensions high
WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have praised US President Donald Trump for his role in helping de-escalate the latest India-Pakistan military confrontation, and urged Washington to facilitate a comprehensive dialogue between the two nuclear neighbours.
Speaking at an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, PM Shehbaz said the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam incident was a false-flag operation”, and credited President Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a ceasefire.
The premier said that the US president had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.
He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan downed six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.
“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”
He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.
PM Shehbaz also extended heartfelt felicitations to the US president and people of the United States, on his behalf and on behalf of the Pakistani nation, on celebrating their Independence Day.
He said the bilateral ties between the US and Pakistan were entering into renewed friendship, and the close contacts were being revived.
Facilitate dialogue
Meanwhile, speaking to US-based Pakistani journalists in Washington, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said President Trump “deserves credit” for helping facilitate the ceasefire between Pakistan and India last month.
“We should also pay attention to what the US president is saying. On 10 different occasions, he has taken credit for facilitating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan — and rightly so. He deserves that credit, because it was his efforts that helped make the ceasefire possible,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari, the leader of the Pakistani delegation that began a three-day visit to Washington on Wednesday.
“So, if the US is willing to help Pakistan in maintaining this ceasefire, it is reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us,” he added.
While India publicly denies that President Trump played any role in the ceasefire agreement and consistently rejects third-party mediation on bilateral issues, Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks appear aimed at drawing the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.
“Yes, America has an establishment, a thought pattern,” he acknowledged, “but knowing the ground realities, we are not delusional. We know what the realities of this city (Washington) are, what its geopolitics are, but we are here because we believe that our message is the message of truth. It aligns with international laws and relevant UN Security Council resolutions.”
His comments also targeted what he described as a failed US strategy of building up India as a regional security anchor. Referring to New Delhi’s recent troubles, he said: “What security will that net security provider provide to others when it cannot do that for itself? They were supposed to protect others, but couldn’t protect their own planes.”
“The concept of India as a counterweight to China now seems hollow. It’s not even a paperweight anymore. This approach, I believe, must now be re-evaluated,” he said.
India has long pitched itself as a “net security provider” in the Indo-Pacific region — a concept US policymakers have also endorsed. But Mr Bhutto-Zardari said this strategy had outlived its utility.
“I believe that this strategy of building up India as the net security provider has failed,” he said. “I believe what can really provide security to this region, and to the rest of the world, is peace bet­ween India and Pakistan.”
Rhetoric sustaining tensions
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday expressed readiness for a comprehensive dialogue with India, but warned that rising political rhetoric from Indian leaders is sustaining high tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals following last month’s military confrontation.
“Whenever they (Indians) want a dialogue, at any level, they will find us ready, but we are not desperate,” Mr Dar said during a press briefing in Islamabad.
Mr Dar said that although the ceasefire has held, political tensions remain inflamed by statements from Indian leaders, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently described the military exchange as “just a trailer” ahead of upcoming elections in Bihar.
“Political rhetoric is still on, possibly for internal reasons,” Mr Dar said. “I wish sense prevails. We are peace lovers, focused on economic revival, but dignity, sovereignty and territorial integrity come first.”
Mr Dar insisted that any future dialogue between Pakistan and India must be comprehensive, addressing terrorism, water rights under the Indus Waters Treaty, and broader bilateral issues. “When India is ready for talks, it will find us ready for talks on all issues.”
He also rejected Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar’s assertion that the talks should only cover the issue of terrorism, saying it wouldn’t work.

Trump said that there was no “immediate peace” on the horizon in Ukraine — which Russia invaded in 2022 — following what he described as a one-hour and 15-minute call with the Russian president.
On Iran, Trump said that Putin had offered to “participate” in talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, as Trump accused the Islamic republic of “slow walking” its response to Washington’s offer of a deal.
The call came three days after Ukraine conducted a massive, daring drone attack against Russian military airbases, saying it had destroyed several Russian nuclear-capable bombers worth billions of dollars.
Trump said that he and Putin had “discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides”.
“It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,” Trump said in his post.
Trump did not say whether he had warned Putin off any such retaliation against Ukraine, which Washington has supported to the tune of billions of dollars in its fight against Russia.
‘Definitive answer’
The Republican has repeatedly alarmed Kyiv and Western allies by appearing to side with Putin over the war, and had a blazing Oval Office row with visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
But Trump has also shown growing frustration with Putin as Russia has so far derailed the US president’s efforts to honour a campaign pledge to end the war within 24 hours, even if he never explained how this could be achieved.
The call between Trump and Putin did, however, show that Washington and Moscow may be eying cooperation on another key global issue — Iran.
Trump said he believed they were both “in agreement” that Iran could not have a nuclear weapon, and that time was running out for Tehran to respond to US offers of a deal.
“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,” Trump said.
The US president added: “It is my opinion that Iran has been slow walking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!”
Putin told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian that Moscow was ready to help advance talks on a nuclear deal, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.
But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said earlier today that Washington’s proposal was against Tehran’s national interest, amid sharp differences over whether Tehran can continue to enrich uranium.</p><small>2025-06-04 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607793-us-diplomat-underscores-enduring-pakistan-us-ties-at-independence-day-celebration' target='_blank'><strong>US diplomat underscores enduring Pakistan-US ties at Independence Day celebration</strong></a><br><p>

The committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.
Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.
In a press release, the Pakistan Mission to the UN called the appointments a “significant diplomatic development”.
 






It added that Pakistan was also appointed as the co-chair of the UNSC’s Informal Working Group (IWG) on documentation (working methods) and the newly established IWG on Sanctions.
The IWG on documentation focuses on improving the UNSC’s working methods, transparency, efficiency and inclusiveness.
The IWG on Sanctions issues aims to review and enhance the design, implementation, and effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes.
“These appointments represent an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s active engagement with the United Nations system, including its constructive role as an elected member of the Security Council,” the press release said, adding, “They are also an international recognition of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts”.
Pakistan, it said, remained committed to working with the UN and fellow member states in advancing the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as playing its part in the global fight against terrorism in collaboration with its international partners.
Pakistan began a two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member on the first day of the new year.
This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the council, providing an opportunity to shape discussions on pivotal international issues, but also posing significant challenges.
Elected in June to replace Japan, Pakistan occupies one of the two Asia-Pacific seats on the UNSC. It will preside over the council in July, a key opportunity to set the agenda and foster dialogue.
While only permanent members hold veto power in the council, non-permanent members wield significant influence in terrorism-related sanctions committees, as decisions are made by consensus under established norms.
Pakistan’s term coincides with heightened tensions in conflict zones such as Gaza, held Kashmir and Syria.</p><small>2025-06-04 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607782-pakistan-elected-vice-chair-of-unscs-counter-terrorism-committee' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan elected vice chair of UNSC's Counter-Terrorism Committee</strong></a><br><p>

Two boys were found dead in a metal trunk of a house after both went missing in Kassoki village of Hafizabad district. Two uncles of one of the deceased boys, and their three accomplices, were among the suspects and police had arrested two of them.
Police had registered a case against four nominated and two unidentified suspects and started an investigation.
Hafizabad Crime Control Department (CCD) Deputy Superintendent of Police Ijaz Ahmed told Dawn.com today that one of the uncles was in CCD custody when the incident occurred. “The suspect drowned and his dead body was later recovered from the canal,” he added.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Hafizabad’s Kasoki Police Station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Ali Kamran under Section 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“During an interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime, saying that he had physically tortured the victims with a wooden bat,” the FIR said, adding that he hid the bat in his living room.
It added that the police were on their way with the suspect to recover the bat when the vehicle slowed down near a canal near Kariala village after approaching a pothole, where the suspect removed the handcuffs from his right hand. The FIR said the police tried to stop the suspect but he jumped out of the vehicle and ran towards the bushes.
As the police were chasing after the suspect, they heard a splashing sound, the FIR said and added that the police called on him, but the suspect kept moving forward in the water and disappeared.
Last month, Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Sahil’s report revealed that 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country in 2024. The children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 11-15 years, in which more boys than girls were reported.
The Punjab Home Department recently launched a campaign to raise awareness about the safety of children. The campaign, called ‘Safe Children, Safe Punjab’, was created “to prevent incidents of sexual abuse of minors”.</p><small>2025-06-04 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041819343e0efdb.jpg?r=195830' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915401/pm-shehbaz-invites-opposition-leader-to-consult-on-new-chief-election-commissioner' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz invites opposition leader to consult on new chief election commissioner</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the opposition leader for consultations on appointing the next chief election commissioner (CEC), months after the incumbent’s term expired in January, it emerged on Wednesday.
The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis­sioner and two members of the Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP)  exp­ired on March 12, with no action from the government.
The 26th Amendment allowed the CEC and the members to continue till their successors come in. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution, the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.
In a letter dated May 16 and addressed to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub — seen by Dawn.com — the prime minister noted that the term of the incumbent CEC, Sikandar Sultan Raja, expired on January 27 this year, adding that he was holding office in accordance with the second proviso to clause 1 of Article 215 of the Constitution (term of office of the Commissioner [and members]).
“In term of clause (2A) of Article 213 and sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of Article 218 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, three names each for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and two Members (i.e. for Sindh and Balochistan) are to be forwarded to the Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person against each position,” the letter read.
“In view of the aforesaid, you are invited for a meeting for consultation, in terms of clause (2A) of Article 213 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, in order to finalize three names each for appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and Members from Sindh and Balochistan.”
No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs.
Disqualification reference
Separately, a hearing on the disqualification reference against Ayub was adjourned until July 1 as he was obligated to attend the upcoming federal budget session in parliament.
Last week, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Sadiq forwarded a reference seeking Ayub’s disqualification to the ECP.
The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Ayub in the 2024 general election in NA-18 (Haripur) by a margin of 82,000 votes.
A five-member committee chaired by the CEC presided over the hearing, with Ayub stating that he had yet to appoint counsel.
“The budget session will start soon and I am a member of the Finance Committee. The budget meeting will be held for two weeks,” he said, requesting time to attend the budget session and appoint a leader.
Sindh Election Commission member Nisar Durrani said that there is a 90-day time limit to act on the speaker’s reference. The commission granted Ayub’s request and adjourned the hearing until June 24.
In a separate case in which the opposition leader was accused of rigging by Babar Nawaz, the opposition leader’s lawyer sought time to submit a reply and arguments. The commission adjourned the hearing until July 1.
 






Speaking to reporters following the hearing, Ayub assailed the National Assembly for sending the reference “without using their brains”.
“The speaker did not consult me about this reference,” he said. “In the 2018 elections, I beat my opponent by 40,000 votes. He previously approached the Abbottabad High Court, but the case was dismissed.”</p><small>2025-06-04 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/04205154edd0112.jpg?r=221611' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915413/saudi-arabia-using-ai-and-real-time-translation-to-open-haj-to-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia using AI and real-time translation to open Haj to the world</strong></a><br><p>The world’s largest gathering of people, and perhaps it’s the world’s largest test of communication, takes place in holy sites in Saudi Arabia, where more than two million pilgrims from 180 nations converge for Haj.
With those pilgrims come hundreds of languages, dialects, and customs, making effective communication profoundly challenging.
According to a press release from the Saudi Ministry for Haj and Umrah, the kingdom is “rewriting the rules of communication at Haj”, making broad use of AI translation tools at the core of a pilgrimage built on clarity, access, and spiritual depth.
“One of the most powerful examples came during the Arafat sermon, a central and emotionally resonant moment of Haj,” the press release read. “This year, the sermon was translated in real-time into 35 languages, allowing millions around the world — and every pilgrim on the ground — to hear the message of unity, compassion, and faith in their own tongue”.
According to the ministry, the broadcast was enabled by advanced AI systems under the General Authority for the Care of the Two Holy Mosques, exemplifying “how technology and tradition can harmonise to elevate spiritual experience”.
“Translation is not simply a technical feature—it is a spiritual bridge,” the ministry said.

Initiatives like ‘Smart Haj’ and the ‘In their languages’ programmes have allowed Saudi Arabia to ensure multilingual support at nearly every point of the pilgrimage.
Pilgrims use the Nusuk App to navigate along their journey in multiple languages. Its AI-powered Personal Assistant delivers real-time voice translation, allowing pilgrims to ask for help, understand procedures and communicate with worshippers and service teams seamlessly, according to the press release.
“Manara, a voice-activated robot, offers religious guidance in 11 languages, answering common questions with clarity and cultural sensitivity,” the ministry added.
“On the ground, field teams use AI-powered devices that understand both speech and images, enabling quick, precise communication in each pilgrim’s native language. These tools don’t just make things easier, they help every pilgrim feel understood, included, and supported in real-time.”
The ministry said Saudi Arabia’s commitment to inclusive communication also extends to the Holy Quran.
“Translated copies are widely distributed across the Grand Mosque, allowing pilgrims to reflect on sacred verses in their own languages. In these most sacred spaces, worship becomes deeply personal and universally accessible,” it stated.
The ministry added that in terms of medical emergencies or crowd management, AI-powered translation is proving to be life-saving.
“Instant, accurate communication across dozens of languages is essential to maintaining safety and order during one of the world’s most densely populated religious gatherings,” it said.

“By placing real-time translation at the core of the Hajj experience, Saudi Arabia is creating a global case study for how technology can enhance, not replace, faith,” the press release said.
“What was once a logistical challenge is now an opportunity to deepen spiritual connection. In bridging languages, the kingdom is also bridging hearts. Through thoughtful innovation, Haj is not only more accessible, but it’s more connected, more human, and more spiritually alive than ever before.”
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
Last month, the Saudi Health Ministry launched a health awareness kit, to promote the health and well-being of Haj pilgrims and last month, the Saudi government announced that its 937 Health Call Centre was offering multilingual support to Haj pilgrims around the clock. Both of these services can be availed in Urdu.

Troops and tanks forcibly cleared peaceful protesters from Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, after weeks-long demonstrations demanding greater political freedoms. The exact toll is unknown, but hundreds died, with some estimates exceeding 1,000.
China’s communist rulers have since sought to erase any public mention of the crackdown, with censors scrubbing all online references.
Police were seen by AFP on Wednesday at the entrance to Wan’an Cemetery, a site in west Beijing where victims of the crackdown are known to be buried. Officers were also posted at several intersections leading into Tiananmen Square.
On Wednesday evening, a line of buses and a cherry picker partially blocked screens at the German and Canadian embassies showing images of candles, a symbol commonly used to pay tribute to Tiananmen victims.
‘Never forget’
Rubio said in a statement that the “world will never forget” what happened on June 4, even as Beijing “actively tries to censor the facts”.
“Today we commemorate the bravery of the Chinese people who were killed as they tried to exercise their fundamental freedoms, as well as those who continue to suffer persecution as they seek accountability and justice for the events of June 4, 1989,” Rubio said.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian hit back during a briefing in the capital, saying Beijing had “lodged a solemn protest” over the American politician’s comments, which “maliciously distort historical facts … and seriously interfere in China’s internal affairs”.
Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te echoed Rubio’s remarks, vowing to preserve the memory of victims of the bloody crackdown.
“Authoritarian governments often choose to be silent and forget history; democratic societies choose to preserve the truth and refuse to forget those who have contributed to the ideal of human rights and their dreams,” Lai said on Facebook.
China claims Taiwan is part of its territory and has threatened to seize the democratically run island by force.
‘Reaffirm our commitment’
In Hong Kong, jailed activist Chow Hang-tung began a 36-hour hunger strike on Wednesday, a dogged attempt to individually commemorate the anniversary in a city that once hosted huge public remembrances.
The former lawyer used to help organise an annual vigil that drew tens of thousands to the city’s Victoria Park.
Hong Kong had been the only place under Chinese rule where commemoration of the crackdown was tolerated. Slogans at the candlelight vigil sometimes called for democracy in China and an end to one-party rule.

But after huge and sometimes violent protests roiled the city in 2019, Beijing brought in a wide-ranging national security law that has quashed political dissent.
The public memorial has effectively been banned and Chow imprisoned, facing a potential life sentence on subversion charges.
On Wednesday, AFP journalists saw at least seven people taken away by police around Victoria Park, including two schoolgirls holding white flowers — which often signify mourning in Chinese culture — and a man standing in silent tribute. Some people were stopped and searched by police.
“It’s a shame that there’s no more [vigils] … In fact, no one will ever forget [the vigils],” a man named Yuen, 49, who did not give his first name, told AFP.
Over the last few years, activists have been detained for “offences in connection with seditious intention” around the anniversary.
In a social media post, Chow said her hunger strike would “commemorate this day and reaffirm our commitment” and urged authorities to apologise over her “wrongful” imprisonment.
“History tells us that [the apology] will likely take a very long time — the Tiananmen Mothers have been waiting for 36 years and still have not received an apology,” she said, referring to an activist group made up of families of victims of the crackdown.

A video featuring 87-year-old Zhang Xianling, whose 19-year-old son was killed in 1989, circulated online last week.
China’s authorities have never addressed the group’s plea for dialogue around the issue — instead, they have used all means to monitor and wiretap members of the Tiananmen Mothers, Zhang said.
“The lights in Victoria Park may have been blown out by the gales, but the sparks of justice will glow in the hearts of every conscientious person,” she added.
At a vigil on Wednesday in Taipei’s Liberty Square, 20-year-old American student Lara Waldron told AFP: “I feel like this June 4 is very close to me right now.
“As a college student, I’m of the age of many organisers and participants — people [who] lost their lives in Tiananmen. “</p><small>2025-06-04 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/042154074d8c18e.jpg?r=215533' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915397/at-least-11-die-in-crowd-chaos-outside-indian-cricket-stadium' target='_blank'><strong>At least 11 die in crowd chaos outside Indian cricket stadium</strong></a><br><p>At least 11 people died on Wednesday in a crowd surge outside a cricket stadium in the Indian city of Bengaluru, where fans were celebrating Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s first Indian Premier League title win, authorities said.
Thousands of people, some waving the home team’s red flag, lined the streets around the Chinnaswamy Stadium as the team arrived in a bus in the evening, TV channels showed, with some climbing trees and the stadium wall for a better view.
As the celebration proceeded, some people outside without passes tried to push through gates and there was further trouble between the perimeter and main arena, police said. Images from the scene showed people climbing over others.
At least 11 people were killed and 47 were injured in the incident, Karnataka state chief minister Siddaramaiah, who uses only one name, told reporters.
“At a time of celebration, this unfortunate event should not have happened. We are saddened by this. The fans that showed up were beyond our expectations,” he said.
One policeman carried an injured spectator to an ambulance, while people gathered around another lying seemingly unconscious on the ground. Visuals also showed some people receiving CPR.
Uncontrollable crowd
Police started caning people at one gate, leading to more chaos, said Mithun Singh, a software engineer among the crowd.
Naseer Ahmed, political secretary for the Karnataka chief minister, told broadcaster NDTV the crowd became uncontrollable and authorities were unable to make proper arrangements.
The team had given away free passes for the event through its website, but also warned that numbers would be limited.
Bengaluru Metro stopped services near the stadium, where the ceremony continued despite the turmoil outside.
Stampedes and other accidents are not uncommon when large crowds gather in India, including during religious events.
At least 30 people were killed in a stampede at the Maha Kumbh Hindu festival in January, as tens of millions gathered to take a dip in sacred waters on its most auspicious day.</p><small>2025-06-04 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/04200315d8f46b0.jpg?r=200330' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915408/murder-of-three-children-in-nowshera-solved-suspect-arrested-say-police' target='_blank'><strong>Murder of three children in Nowshera solved, suspect arrested, say police</strong></a><br><p>Nowshera police on Wednesday arrested the prime suspect in the murder of three children last month, with the alleged killer revealed to be the victims’ grandmother, according to a statement issued by Nowshera police.
In May, a family suffered from health problems after consuming food believed to be contaminated, resulting in the death of three children in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district.
Nowshera police spokesperson Turk Ali Shah told Dawn.com, “The family had consumed Mithai [sweets] with tea at night, after which their condition deteriorated. Three siblings died after consuming poisonous food. Their mother was in critical condition.”
According to Wednesday’s statement, police formed an investigation team to probe the case, which was registered on May 19 upon the complaint of the victim’s father. An inquiry was launched under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) (police to inquire and report on suicide, etc).
“District Police Chief Abdul Rashid formed an investigative team led by SP (Superintendent of Police) Alamzaib Khan and assigned them the task of ascertaining the facts of the case,” the statement read.
The team comprised Nowshera Cantt Circle Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Muqaddam Khan, Azakhel Station House Officer (SHO) Adil Syed and Investigation Officer Naik Zaman Khan.
“The complainant and his wife, while recording their statements under Section 164 of the CrPC (power to record statements and confessions), filed a formal claim against his mother, claiming that due to [a] domestic dispute, she had given his wife and children a poisonous substance, which caused their death,” the statement read.
Nowshera police said that the suspect had been arrested and that further investigation was underway.
Last week, a woman turned out to be the killer of her two minor children in the Rangpur locality of Gujrat, Punjab as A-Division police claimed to have resolved a mysterious double murder case.
The suspect confessed to strangling her five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter to enter into a second marriage with a man.</p><small>2025-06-04 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0420111955d01c5.jpg?r=202503' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915407/200000-afghans-left-pakistan-since-deportations-renewed' target='_blank'><strong>200,000 Afghans left Pakistan since deportations renewed</strong></a><br><p>More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since the government renewed a deportation drive in April, with Iran also stepping up expulsions of Afghans.
Generations of Afghans have fled to Pakistan and Iran during decades of successive wars, seeking safety and better economic opportunities.
Both governments have grown weary of large migrant populations and ordered millions to leave under the threat of arrest.
Pakistan has launched a strict campaign to evict more than 800,000 Afghans who have had their residence permits cancelled, including some who were born in the country or lived there for decades.
According to the interior ministry, more than 135,000 Afghans left Pakistan in April, while around 67,000 departed in May and more than 3,000 were sent back in the first two days of June.
The number of returnees has slowed ahead of the Eidul Azha holiday later this week, but some Afghans were still crossing the main border points from Pakistan today.
“We left behind our orchards” and livelihoods, 21-year-old farmer Mohammad Wali told AFP near the Spin Boldak crossing.
“But we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity,’ so it’s better to return to our homeland now.”
 
 

The UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) on Tuesday voiced concern over a surge in Afghan families being deported from Iran, recording 15,675 crossing in May, a more than two-fold increase from the previous month.
Iranian officials have ordered Afghans without documentation to leave by July 6.
Nader Yarahmadi, from the Iranian interior ministry, said on state television that it would affect around four million of the more than 6m Afghans who Iran says are in the country.
The IOM said the influx across both borders threatens to strain Afghanistan’s already “fragile reception and reintegration systems”.
It again called for “all countries to immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans, regardless of their immigration status, until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place”.
Rise in border violence
Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Taliban government in 2021.
A campaign to evict them began in 2023, prompting hundreds of thousands to cross the border in a matter of weeks, fearing harassment or arrest. In total, more than one million Afghans have left Pakistan.
Islamabad has labelled Afghans “terrorists and criminals”, but analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to control militancy in the border regions.
Last year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade.
Pakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afghanistan, confronting rising attacks by terrorists in Balochistan and the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
 
 

The government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks and blames Kabul for allowing militants to take refuge on its soil, a charge Taliban leaders deny.
Some Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, and the deportation campaign has widespread support.
Pakistan is now threatening to lift the protection granted to the 1.3m Afghans holding refugee cards issued by the UN high commissioner for refugees at the end of June.</p><small>2025-06-04 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607764-karachi-to-experience-low-intensity-tremors-this-week' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to 'experience low-intensity tremors this week'</strong></a><br><p>

According to District West Police spokesperson Nabeel Ahmed Rajput, “A tanker driver attempted to kidnap a traffic official near the Malik Chandio Chowk area of ​​Manghopir Police Station.
“Instead of stopping at the checkpoint, the tanker driver tried to kidnap the traffic policeman,” he said, adding that the noise prompted a nearby police mobile to chase the tanker to stop it.
The statement also said, “An angry group of people, accompanying the driver, launched an attack, injuring three police officers by assaulting them with sticks and stones.”
The injured have been shifted to the hospital for immediate medical attention, the spokesperson said. He added that the police were present at the scene and the situation was under control.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Last week, three people lost their lives in separate road accidents in Karachi, according to the police.
In May, the police said that a woman was killed and her husband injured when a water tanker hit their motorcycle and ran them over in Korangi, prompting an angry mob to set the water tanker on fire.</p><small>2025-06-04 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0411080945477bc.png?r=111140' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915359/bilawal-led-delegation-reaches-washington-after-wrapping-up-ny-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal-led delegation reaches Washington after wrapping up NY visit</strong></a><br><p>The high-powered delegation, led by former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, has reached Washington after concluding its two-day visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday.
Pakis­tan had launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence here.
The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
In New York, the delegation “drew attention to India’s illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children”, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.
 






It added that the delegation rejected India’s allegations regarding the April 22 attack in India-occupied Kashmir “without a shred of evidence, and warned against India’s weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations”.
According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council’s permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.
 






Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country’s role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also “drawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign”.
“Cooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,” the statement said.
The delegation also emphasised the country’s responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan “seeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve”.
It warned that Indian attempts to create a “new normal” that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia’s nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“The international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,” the statement read.
Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope­ration between Pakistan and India’s intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.
“I am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,” he added.
He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.
“With the intervention of the international community — and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio — we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,” said Bilawal. “This is a welcome first step, but it’s only a first step.”
Pakistan praised globally for our kinetic actions: FM DAR
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, detailing PM Shehbaz’s recent multi-state visit, said the international community was lauding Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts.
“We are being praised for our kinetic actions”, he said, adding that Pakistan’s narrative was clear to the international community from the beginning and remained so until the resolution of the conflict.
While addressing a press conference, FM Dar said the delegation led by PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for the support of countries to Pakistan throughout the period of tension, particularly Turkiye and Azerbaijan.
“People in Turkiye and Azerbaijan took to the streets to celebrate the resolution,” he said, noting that Pakistan’s victory was a victory for the entire Muslim community.
 


Appreciating Turkiye’s role in de-escalation efforts, he recalled that on the night of May 6, when India attacked, his Turkish counterpart was “the first one to call and ask if there is anything they can do for Pakistan”.
He further said that in the wake of the recent events, India’s “hegemony has been destroyed” and its supremacy “blown in the air”, adding that Indians were now blaming each other while Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts were being globally acknowledged.
SAPM Fatemi meets Putin’s foreign policy senior aide
Separately, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Syed Tariq Fatemi called on Yury Ushakov, senior aide to the Russian president on foreign policy issues, and briefed him on the recent escalation in South Asia, outlining Pakistan’s position vis-à-vis India’s aggressive actions, especially unilaterally holding the IWT in abeyance.
“Besides these meetings, the SAPM gave two interviews to the leading Russian TV networks, expressing his candid views on the increasingly positive trends in Pakistan-Russia relations and recent escalation between Pakistan and India. He also had an extensive exchange of views with a group of academics and journalists from prominent print and electronic media. Furthermore, the SAPM was hosted by Valdai Discussion Club, a prestigious think-tank in Moscow, for a talk on June 4, on the recent developments in South Asia and Pakistan-Russia relations.
“Overall, the visit of the SAPM was highly successful, with several important official engagements and candid exchanges with parliamentarians, a think tank, several academics and journalists. It paved the way to explicitly share Pakistan’s perspective on the recent situation and other important issues, such as IWT to the Russian side.
“There was widespread appreciation for the manner in which Pakistan was enhancing its relations with Russia, in important areas of trade, investment, energy and connectivity routes,” the FO said.

The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman, which has mediated talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.
After five rounds of talks, several hard-to-bridge issues remain, including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and Tehran’s refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium — possible raw material for nuclear bombs.
Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters of state, said nothing about halting the talks, but said the US proposal “contradicts our nation’s belief in self-reliance and the principle of ‘We Can’”.
“Uranium enrichment is the key to our nuclear programme and the enemies have focused on the enrichment,” Khamenei said during a televised speech marking the anniversary of the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
“The proposal that the Americans have presented is 100pc against our interests … The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear programme. Who are you to decide whether Iran should have enrichment?” he added.
“Independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America.”
Khamenei said, “If we have 100 nuclear power plants but don’t have enrichment, they will be of no use to us,” because “nuclear power plants need fuel” to operate. “If we cannot produce this fuel domestically, we have to reach out to the United States, which may have dozens of conditions.”
Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
‘Maximum pressure’
Reuters reported on Monday that Tehran was poised to reject the US proposal as a “non-starter” that failed to soften Washington’s stance on uranium enrichment or to address Tehran’s interests.
 
 

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the US proposal includes “an arrangement that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels” as the US and other countries “work out a more detailed plan intended to block Iran’s path to a nuclear weapon”.
It said the proposal would see the United States facilitating “the building of nuclear power plants for Iran and negotiate the construction of enrichment facilities managed by a consortium of regional countries”.
Iran has previously said it is open to temporary limits on its enrichment of uranium and is willing to consider the establishment of a regional nuclear fuel consortium. But it has stressed that such a consortium is “in no way intended to replace Iran’s own uranium enrichment programme”.
Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since his return to the White House in January, which included tightening sanctions and threatening to bomb Iran if the negotiations yield no deal.
Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel. Iran’s clerical establishment, for its part, wants to be rid of devastating sanctions.
During his first term, Trump ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the pact’s limits.
Iran’s clerical establishment is grappling with multiple crises — energy and water shortages, a plunging currency, losses among regional militia proxies in conflicts with Israel, and rising fears of an Israeli strike on its nuclear sites — all intensified by Trump’s hardline stance.
Iran’s arch-foe Israel, which sees Tehran’s nuclear programme as an existential threat, has repeatedly threatened to bomb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
Tehran has vowed a harsh response.
‘Less than satisfactory’
In its latest quarterly report last week, the IAEA said Iran had further stepped up its production of highly enriched uranium.
In a separate report, it also criticised “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60pc, far above the 3.67pc limit set in the 2015 deal but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.
The reports came ahead of a planned IAEA Board of Governors meeting in Vienna later this month which will review Iran’s nuclear activities.
Britain, France and Germany, the three European countries who were party to the 2015 deal, are currently weighing whether to trigger the sanctions “snapback” mechanism in the accord.
The mechanism would reinstate UN sanctions in response to Iranian non-compliance — an option that expires in October.

The KSE-100 index climbed 923.71, or 0.77 per cent, to stand at 121,374.58 from the last close of 120,450.87 at 1:31pm. The index closed at 121,798.86, with a gain of 1347.99 points or 1.12pc.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, attributed the bullish momentum to the news of the approval of a new financial package between Pakistan and Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The ADB approved an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan, according to a statement issued by the Philippines-based lender.
The statement read that subprogramme 2 of the “Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme” includes a policy-based loan of $300m, and ADB’s “first ever policy-based guarantee” of up to $500m, which is expected to mobilise financing of up to $1 billion from commercial banks.
Additionally, Tawfik noted that stock valuations were trading at an “attractive level” due to the correction phase witnessed at the stock market earlier this week.
“Lastly, there is also some institutional buying which has increased liquidity,” she added.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, said, “The market has hit an all-time high as participants brush off any negative budget-related news flow.”
He explained that expectations were building that economic stability would persist and interest rates will gradually trend downward, allowing stock market price-to-earning (PE)  ratios to rerate upwards.
“We believe the market is gradually entering the second phase of the bull run — transitioning from the accumulation phase to the public participation or momentum phase — marked by increasing public involvement, rising stock market volumes, gradual PE multiple expansion, and clearer signs of economic recovery,” he stated, adding that investor confidence, media attention, and new IPO activity were expected to grow.
“Measures such as reduced taxation that boost corporate earnings, along with adherence to IMF guidelines, will further reinforce confidence,” Farooq highlighted, noting that steps towards mass digitisation would also propel stock market sentiment.</p><small>2025-06-04 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0415330429e449c.jpg?r=161421' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915384/modi-to-visit-occupied-kashmir-to-unveil-strategic-railway' target='_blank'><strong>Modi to visit occupied Kashmir to unveil ‘strategic railway’</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to make his first visit to occupied Kashmir since the conflict between the country and Pakistan began last month, inaugurating a ‘strategic railway’ service to the mountainous region, his office said on Wednesday.
 






Modi will visit the valley on Friday to open the Chenab Bridge, a 1,315-metre-long steel and concrete span that connects two mountains with an arch 359m above the river below.
“The project establishes all-weather, seamless rail connectivity between the Kashmir Valley and the rest of the country,” the Indian Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.
Modi is expected to flag off a special train.
 
 

Last month, nuclear-armed India and Pakistan fought an intense four-day conflict, their worst standoff since 1999, before a US-brokered ceasefire was agreed on May 10.
This military confrontation took place after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for backing terrorists who killed 26 tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam and launched a series of airstrikes on different Pakistani cities.
Anti-India groups have been fighting for decades for held Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan, and enjoy broad popular support.
The 272-kilometre Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway — with 36 tunnels and 943 bridges — has been constructed “aiming to transform regional mobility and driving socio-economic integration”, the statement added.
Its dramatic centrepiece is the Chenab Bridge, which India calls the “world’s highest railway arch bridge”.
While several road and pipeline bridges are higher, Guinness World Records confirmed that Chenab trumps the previous highest railway bridge, the Najiehe in China.
Indian Railways calls the $24-million bridge “arguably the biggest civil engineering challenge faced by any railway project in India in recent history”.
The bridge will facilitate the movement of people and goods, as well as troops, that was previously possible only via treacherous mountain roads and air.
The train line could slash travel time between the town of Katra and Srinagar, the region’s key city, by half, taking around three hours.
The bridge will also revolutionise logistics in Ladakh, the icy region in India bordering China.
India and China, the world’s two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.
Their troops clashed in 2020, killing at least 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers, and forces from both sides today face off across contested high-altitude borderlands.
The railway begins in the garrison city of Udhampur, the headquarters of the Indian army’s northern command, and runs north to Srinagar.</p><small>2025-06-04 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607728-pakistan-ready-for-dialogue-with-india-but-not-desperate-dpm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ready for dialogue with India but not desperate: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

According to Kech Deputy Commissioner Bashir Ahmed Barich, unidentified militants kidnapped the AC, who was posted at Tump, near the Iranian border.
He said Noorzai was on his way from Quetta to Tump on Wednesday morning, but did not provide further details.
Noorzai is from Quetta and has previously served as AC in different areas of the province.
In September 2016, Asad Khan Tareen, son of then-Balochistan’s Minister for Local Government Sardar Mustafa Tareen — who had been kidnapped in May that year — was recovered from an area of Qila Abdulla district close to the Pak-Afghan border.
Armed men kidnapped Asad Tareen in Pishin town on May 21 when he was returning from Cadet College Pishin, where he worked as a warden. He was reportedly taken across the border in Afghanistan.
This is a developing story</p><small>2025-06-04 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041417529713575.png?r=141823' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915377/karachi-to-face-low-intensity-quakes-for-next-2-3-days-pmd-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to face low-intensity quakes for next 2-3 days: PMD chief</strong></a><br><p>The meteorological chief has said  tremors will continue to be felt in Karachi for the next two to three days and the situation will improve as the intensity of the quakes will reduce, adding that residents of the city should not panic.
Parts of Karachi experienced three more tremors on Tuesday morning, as the city has been shaken by 19 mild earthquakes over the past three days, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) officials said.
The tremors, all classified as low to moderate in intensity, ranged from 2.1 magnitude to 3.6 on the Richter scale. The strongest tremor, measuring 3.6, was recorded on Sunday, while the weakest was of 2.1 magnitude.
PMD Director General Mahr Sahibzad Khan, while speaking during Dawn News TV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, said Karachi will face low-intensity quakes for the next couple of days.
The Met chief claimed earthquakes are occurring in Karachi due to lack of ground water and illegal pumping by the so-called ‘tanker mafia’.
“Karachi has small fault lines in areas of Korangi and Malir that are causing minor earthquakes,” he said, adding that tremors were being felt in the areas close to the fault line.
“The main problem in Karachi is that there is no ground water. If you remove the hard rocks, there is only sand,” he added.  “There is a strong tanker mafia in Karachi. They take out water through pumping or other illegal means.”
He said the pumping of ground water is being done over the fault line which causes “induced earthquakes.”
He observed that the intensity of the quakes in Karachi has reduced over the past few days. He said the first quake measured 3.6 on Richter Scale but the one that struck today (June 3) recorded a magnitude of 2.6.
When asked about the collapse of the wall in Malir prison that led to a massive jailbreak, he said the prison’s wall collapsed because it was located close to the epicentre.
“It (Malir jail) was located near the epicentre. The intensity is greater in the areas near the epicentre,” he elaborated.
When asked if the tremors will continue in the upcoming days, the Met chief said the aftershocks will remain for the next few days until the seismic activity settles.
“The tremors will continue but not with high intensity. The fault line is not very active. They will end after two to three days,” he added.
When asked if the residents of the city should panic, he said there is “nothing to worry about for people of Karachi.”</p><small>2025-06-04 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041317192b6e450.jpg?r=134733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915372/million-plus-pilgrims-begin-haj-under-blazing-sun' target='_blank'><strong>Million-plus pilgrims begin Haj under blazing sun</strong></a><br><p>More than a million pilgrims joined Islam’s most important rite under a beating sun on Wednesday, as the Haj kicked off with the Saudi hosts scrambling to avoid last year’s 1,000-plus deaths in sweltering heat.
With the temperature expected to top 40 degrees Celsius, robed pilgrims slowly circled the Kaaba at the heart of Makkah’s Grand Mosque.
State media reported that others had begun arriving in the tent city of Mina on Makkah’s outskirts where they will stay overnight before the Haj’s high-point on Thursday — prayers on Mount Arafat, where the Holy Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him) delivered his final sermon.
About 1.4 million pilgrims arrived in Saudi Arabia ahead of the Haj.
Authorities have ratcheted up heat protection measures such as extra shade to avoid a repeat of last year, when 1,301 people died as temperatures hit 51.8C.
On Wednesday, pilgrims will perform the tawaf — walking seven times around the Kaaba.
Pilgrims arriving on buses had begun already trickling into Mina on Tuesday afternoon, greeted by staff offering them coffee and dates.
“I am so happy, it’s such an amazing feeling,” said Reem al-Shogre, a 35-year-old Saudi performing the pilgrimage for the first time.
Following last year’s lethal heatwave, authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials to improve protection.
Shaded areas have been enlarged by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands of additional medics will be on standby and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, Haj Minister Tawfiq al Rabiah told AFP last week.
Artificial intelligence technology will help process the deluge of data, including video from a new fleet of drones, to better manage the massive crowds.
Authorities said most of the deaths last year were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to air-conditioned tents and buses.
This year, they have cracked down on the unregistered, using frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota basis and distributed to individuals by lottery. But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt the Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.
Large crowds at Haj have proved hazardous in the past, most notably in 2015 when a stampede during the “stoning the devil” ritual in Mina killed up to 2,300 people in the deadliest Haj disaster.</p><small>2025-06-04 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607687-from-adiala-to-times-square-pti-escalates-rhetoric-jeopardises-peace-with-establishment' target='_blank'><strong>From Adiala jail to Times Square: PTI escalates rhetoric, jeopardises peace with establishment</strong></a><br><p>
