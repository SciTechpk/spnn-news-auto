Meanwhile, two teenagers lost their lives due to electrocution during the downpour.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said that a deep depression system that was to cause rain in the city had weakened into a depression that was now lying over central Sindh. It would continue to move nearly west/ southwest-ward and gradually further weaken into a well-marked low pressure area during next 12 hours, the PMD added.
“Due to this system strong monsoon currents are continually penetrating in the province. Under its influence, widespread rain-wind/ thundershower with strong gusty winds along with scattered heavy to very heavy/ isolated exceptional
heavy falls are expected in … Karachi division till tomorrow with occasional gaps.”
The Met Office warned that “torrential rains” could cause urban flooding and water logging in low-lying areas of Karachi.
A day earlier, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham said that “heavy to very heavy” rain was expected in the city today in four to six spells from the morning till night.
Electrocution deaths
On Tuesday, officials also reported two deaths due to electrocution.
Sohrab Goth Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Marwat told Dawn.com that  that “a 17-year-old boy died due to electric shocks at a water filter plant in the Ayub Goth area.”
Separately, Khawaja Ajmer Nagri SHO Sarfraz Commando told Dawn.com that “an 18-year-old also died because of electric shocks inside his home in Rasheedabad.”
Tariq Road declared no-parking zone
Earlier, the city’s traffic police took the pre-emptive measure of declaring both sides of Tariq Road “no-parking zone”.
The traffic police posted on X that the Met Office had predicted heavy rain and urban flooding for September 9 (today), in view of which “citizens,  as well as all market associations, their members, and administrations are informed that both sides of Tariq Road have been declared no-parking zone”.
 






The police said the step was taken so that Tariq Road could be used as an alternative route in case Sharea Faisal, one of the city’s main arteries, “is affected”.
“Citizens, especially market associations and members, are requested to avoid parking on both sides of Tariq Road so that traffic flow is not hampered.”
 






Earlier in the morning, the traffic police reported drizzle in parts of the city.
It advised commuters to exercise caution and warned them of slippery roads.
 






The traffic police also advised people against travelling to low-lying areas.
Meanwhile, Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho instructed zonal deputy inspector generals and district senior superintendent of police to brief their subordinates and relevant officials about assistance that was to provide in case of rain. He also directed them to coordinate with all relevant departments.
According to a statement issued by the police, he further asked them to inform the residents of low-lying areas, especially those living alongside rivers and nullahs, about the weather situation so that precautionary measures could be taken.
“All possible cooperation with the traffic police should be ensured,” he said, adding that routes alternatives to the ones affected by rain should be checked.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s (CM) House said the city administration was put on alert on the directives of CM Murad Ali Shah.
It quoted Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah as saying that district administrations and local body departments should “go out in the field” to assist citizens and stay prepared for the rain spell.
He directed assistant commissioners and municipal commissioners to check the drainage of nullahs, adding that arrangements should be made for  having equipment required for rainwater drainage.
“Machines provided by the PDMA (provincial disaster management authority) should be ready for drainage.”
Mayor details preparatory measures
On Monday, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab addressed a  press confernece, where he detailed precautionary measures taken in view of the rain forecast.
He said that despite precautionary measures, it was inevitable the city would take “a few hours” to recover after each downpour .
Outlining the city’s preparedness, limitations and political landscape amid the ongoing monsoon spell predicted to continue through Sept 8-10.
“The sea level is high — it might not take the water,” he explained, adding that this natural phenomenon was among the city’s biggest challenges during heavy rainfall.
Highlighting the city’s preparedness, the mayor claimed that all 46 major drains (nullahs) under Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) leading to the sea had been “cleaned”, including the Gujjar, Orangi and Mehmoodabad nullahs.
“Additional pumps have been installed, machinery deployed, and 120 water and sewerage vehicles are active across the city,” he said.
Relief camps have been set up at key choke points to provide stranded citizens with water and biscuits, and municipal staff leave has been cancelled to ensure 24/7 field presence.
The mayor urged residents to remain calm and patient, advising them not to rush out during the rain.

The report, titled “Shadows of Control: Censorship and Mass Surveillance in Pakistan“, in its findings, reported that Pakistani authorities have continued to unlawfully surveil the country’s citizens, including regular citizens, journalists, as well as prominent politicians.
In its findings, the rights watchdog stated that, “the Armed Forces and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) use the Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS) to surveil a significant portion of the population’s digital activity through Pakistani telecommunications providers.”
The number of phones under surveillance could be higher as all four major mobile operators have been ordered to connect to LIMS, Amnesty technologist Jurre van Berge told Reuters.
Per the report, telecommunications providers are “under an obligation to ensure that up to 2 per cent of their entire consumer base can be surveilled,“ according to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).
Authorities also employ a firewall known as WMS 2.0 that inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at a time, Amnesty said, further enhancing the system of surveillance.
LIMS is a product sold by a German company called Ultimaco, which “allows for the classification of internet traffic and mobile communications such as text messaging and voice and [stores] this data for authorities to go through.”
The technology has been in use in Pakistan since 2007.
According to its findings, “Utimaco’s LIMS allows the authorities to sift through the telecommunications provider subscriber data.”
Using the LIMS system, the authorities only need a person’s phone number, the report said.
The report went on to explain that this data is then “made accessible through a Monitoring Centre Next Generation (McNG).”
According to the report, “McNG is a product by Datafusion, formerly Trovicor, which allows authorities to sift through the material collected by LIMS.” Using the McNG system, “operators can see [who has] been calling whom, when this happened, what websites were browsed, if someone might’ve used WhatsApp or a VPN and their location.”
The report attributed the unchecked deployment of mass surveillance to a lack of technical and legal safeguards.
Amnesty recalled that the workings of the LIMS system came to light in the case of Bushra Imran Khan vs Federation of Pakistan, filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), after “a series of prominent cases of interception and leaking of audio recordings of calls between
politicians and public figures became public in the period between 2022 and 2023.”
The case was filed to “investigate these recordings and the legality of interception of telecoms.”

Well-placed sources told Dawn that the present flood situation in the riverine areas was one of the key factors behind the dacoits’ willingness to surrender.
They said that the development was discussed during the inaugural meeting of the Katcha Areas Monitoring Committee (KAMC), which reviewed the ongoing anti-bandit operations, the security situation and the provincial government’s broader strategy.
The sources said that the Larkana police have informed their high-ups that more than 260 dacoits in the Katcha area have expressed their willingness to surrender in view of the impending flood threat.

Over 260 dacoits contacted Larkana police, sought reintegration support from govt, meeting told

 
 

Talking to Dawn, Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar, who chaired the KAMC meeting, said that the surrender process would be handled strictly according to the law. “The law is already there empowering the government to deal with those who are willing to surrender,” he added.
He also said that the Sindh government was “extremely” sincere and determined to eliminate the bandits in the Katcha area. “However, any bandit or group of bandits surrendering peacefully and presenting themselves before the law will strictly be subject to rules and regulations, as the law is clear on matters of surrender,” he added.
Plan underway to ensure dacoits’ surrender
Informed sources said that the authorities were working on a plan to provide an exit route for those willing to surrender, while hardened criminals involved in serious crimes like murder and kidnapping for ransom may face strict action.
They said that a plan was also under deliberation to encourage dacoits and their abettors in the riverine areas to surrender, provided they give up their sophisticated weapons unconditionally.
A report on this development has been submitted to the provincial government, which is currently examining the legal framework for handling hardened criminals in the Katcha area involved in serious offences like murder and kidnapping for ransom, said the sources.
They said that the provincial government was exploring possible legal provisions that could offer a way out for these outlaws if they choose to surrender.
They also said that some law enforcement agencies were considering offering a general amnesty to dacoits who agree to surrender. However, the provincial government was reportedly hesitant to extend leniency to hardened criminals involved in serious crimes like multiple murders and kidnapping for ransom.
Police seek equipment, weapons to combat bandits
During the KAMC meeting, Additional Inspector General of Police Zubair Nazir Sheikh provided a briefing on the law and order situation and ongoing operations in the Katcha areas. He emphasised the urgent requirement for modern equipment, advanced weapons, and secure vehicles to effectively combat the bandits.
Additionally, he highlighted the need to enhance facilities at existing checkpoints in the riverine areas and outlined plans to equip police with cutting-edge technology and professional training to boost their capabilities.
The home minister directed that detailed and practical recommendations for providing necessary resources to the police be submitted promptly.
 
 

He stated that after the construction of bridges at Dadu, Moro, Larkana and Khairpur, crimes had decreased, but it is vital to accelerate work on the Ghotki and Kashmore bridge projects so they are completed at the earliest. The construction of these bridges on this route will also significantly reduce crime.
Mr Lanjar also asked the schools & education and health departments about the number of schools, educational institutions, hospitals, and dispensaries in the Katcha areas.
He said the purpose of this inquiry was to establish temporary campuses during operations to ensure that the provision of education and health facilities does not get interrupted.
He acknowledged that delays in the past had prevented the operation from being completed but emphasised that the anti-bandit operation must be brought to a successful conclusion under all circumstances.
He appealed to all stakeholders to demonstrate collective determination and stand as strong partners.
The meeting was attended, among others, by the IGP Sindh, senior members Board of Revenue, education and law secretaries, representatives of the health and forest departments, Additional IG of CTD and Special Branch, and representatives of Sindh Rangers and other security agencies.

However, flood victims have alleged discriminatory behaviour in relief efforts. They claim that Ganda Singh Talwar post has received undue attention due to visits by ministers and prominent political figures, while other severely affected areas like Kanganpur, Mandi Usmanwala, and Balloki, where relief camps were officially set up are being neglected.
During a provincial assembly session on Saturday, PML-N MPA Ahsan Raza openly criticised his own government for the allegedly biased distribution of aid. He accused the administration of favouritism in distributing food and fodder, particularly at politically significant points.
Flood victims across multiple areas continue to face severe hardships due to a shortage of boats. This shortage has not only hampered evacuation efforts but also delayed the supply of essential food, fodder, and medicines. Welfare organisations and stranded villagers seeking transport have reported waiting for hours, as boats were allegedly diverted for VIP movement and political visits.

DC denies charges of discrimination in distribution

An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, lamented the scene at Ganda Singh Talwar, describing it as a recreational park for some people while it was a ray of hope for the stranded people waiting for food, fodder and medicines.At Kothi Fateh Muhammad, downstream from Sutlej, the water level has reached 15 feet, damaging dozens of villages.
The Ravi at Head Baloki is also experiencing a high flood, with 125,000 cusecs of water discharge, slightly reduced from a peak of 148,000 cusecs over the past 24 hours.
At Ganda Singh Headworks, the flood situation remains critical, with a discharge of 319,295 cusecs recorded on Monday. The region has been grappling with this emergency for nearly a week. Over 70 villages have been submerged and thousands of acres of crops have been destroyed.
 
 

Local residents reported that only five boats were available in the Mandi Usmanwala area on Monday. One boat broke down, and the remaining four were preoccupied with searching for the body of a youth who drowned while filming a TikTok video. As a result, no aid official or private could reach around a dozen villages due to the unavailability of boats.
In Kanganpur and Kothi Fateh Muhammad, a similar shortage persists. In case of medical emergencies, residents of villages like Doana, Shahbazkay, Rukanpura, Muradkay, Khanay Peer, and Sher Kot reportedly have to wait several hours for a boat.
In Phoolnagar’s Kamogil village, the revenue department declined to repair a broken embankment, citing the lack of machinery. Villagers later restored the dyke through self-help efforts.
Private welfare organisations remain active in delivering aid to remote villages, including Kamogil, Nathay Jageer, Jaja Kalan, Chatri, Wazirpur, Thama Kamyana, and Dalu Multani. Residents say official relief from the district or provincial government in these areas is rare.
Tensions also arose earlier when the district administration reportedly dismantled a relief camp run by a political party merely because it had banners displaying the party leader’s picture even though it was operating during a medium flood phase.
Speaking to Dawn, Deputy Commissioner Imran Ali said the administration had deployed 85 boats across the district.He said the boats had been distributed as per the population proportion so that all could be helped.He denied allegations of discrimination and claimed that on Monday alone, 2,000 food boxes and ration bags were delivered.
The DC added that 250,000 people from 72 villages and hamlets have been displaced by the floods. So far, 95,000 people have been transported to safer areas, while 113,000 remain stranded in submerged zones. He emphasised that food and fodder are being provided without bias, in accordance with the vision of the Punjab chief minister.

The couple, identified as Shahroz Muhammad Ali and Kanwal, were arrested on Sunday by the Ferozabad police, which registered a case against them under Sections 328-A (cruelty to a child) and 337-A (i) (shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 14-(1) of the Sindh Prohibition of Employment of Children Act, 2017.
The said section of the child law states: “Whoever employs any child shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with a fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees, or with both.”
On Monday, the investigating officer produced the couple before Judicial Magistrate (East) Hameedullah and sought their physical remand for further interrogation.
Meanwhile, the defence counsel requested the court to grant them bail, arguing that the offences mentioned in the FIR were bailable.
 
 

After hearing both sides, the court granted bail to the couple against a surety bond of Rs30,000 each along with a personal bond. Subsequently, the couple was released and their handcuffs were removed after the surety amount was submitted before the court.
Speaking to Dawn, Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that a 13-year-old girl from Ferozabad police station was brought to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) on Sunday night with “multiple burn marks in different stages of healing, all over the body.” She was “stable” but referred for treatment, the police surgeon added.
According to the FIR, complainant Aasiya informed the police that around three months ago, she had sent her 13 to 14-year-old daughter to work as a house help at the residence of Shahroz and his wife Kanwal in PECHS Block 2, where the girl used to stay day and night.
However, on Aug 31, Kanwal called the complainant and told her that her daughter was unwell and asked her to take the girl back.
When Aasiya reached the flat, the girl told her that she had been burnt with an electric iron on different parts of her body and showed the marks.
The girl further stated to her mother that two days earlier, on Aug 29, while she was ironing Kanwal’s clothes, her dupatta had burnt. In reaction, Kanwal allegedly burnt her with the same iron, despite the girl begging her for forgiveness. She added that her husband had also physically assaulted her.

A press release stated that the CHRI, the Commonwealth Journalists Association (CJA) and the Commonwealth Lawyers Association (CLA) called on member states to urgently repeal “laws that criminalise legitimate public speech” and take decisive action to protect media workers and watchdogs from violence and intimidation.
“The report Who Controls the Narrative? Legal Restrictions on Freedom of Expression in the Commonwealth finds that criminal provisions for speech offences, including defamation and sedition, as well as violations of national security laws, are arbitrarily applied to intimidate and silence journalists, human rights defenders, and government critics,” the press release read.
“A key objective, the authors argue, must be to decriminalise defamation laws in 41 Commonwealth countries — many of which permit long prison sentences.”
 






According to the press release, the report is based on analyses of national legal frameworks and draws on testimonies from over 30 senior journalists and 35 lawyers across Africa, Asia, the Americas and the Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific regions.
The report concludes that the Commonwealth’s past inaction has “contributed to the serious and persistent challenges to the protection of freedom of expression and the rule of law in some member countries”.
The report urges the secretariat and member states to act resolutely, together with non-governmental organisations, to ensure observance of the 11-point Commonwealth Principles on Freedom of Expression and the Role of the Media in Good Governance adopted by Heads of Government in Samoa.
 
 

“These media principles call on governments to create a safe and enabling environment for media workers, and to review and consider amending unduly restrictive domestic laws that inhibit free speech both online and offline,” the press release read.
According to the press release, the report found that 213 journalists were killed in 19 Commonwealth countries between 2006 and 2023, and in 96 per cent of cases, the perpetrators were not brought to justice, according to Unesco figures.
It also found that 41 Commonwealth countries maintain criminal penalties for defamation; 48 retain laws related to sedition; and 37 have legislation regarding blasphemy, the press release stated.
“The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) is urged to fulfil its mandate to address systematic constraints on civil society and the media,” the press release read. “The CMAG should be reformed and supported by a Commonwealth Envoy on Freedom of Expression.”
The CHRI, CJA and CLA urged member states to develop action plans with state and non-state actors to accelerate the repeal of criminal legislation for speech and anti-state offences in line with international best practice.
“Collaborate with civil society and international human rights organisations, including UNESCO, to monitor and support the implementation of the Commonwealth Media Principles,” the three bodies urged, requesting that members prioritise the protection of civil and political rights.
As part of its recommendations, the report urged the following:
Strengthen legal frameworks

Align national legal frameworks with international human rights standards. Any restrictions on freedom of expression should comply with international human rights law
Ratify and implement international treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
Enact robust right to information legislation
Enact appropriate defences to defamation laws.

Promote judicial independence, due process guarantees, and access to justice

Strengthen judicial independence
Combat impunity
Ensure access to effective remedies and that due process and fair trial guarantees are clearly set out in law and respected in practice
Adopt anti-Slapp (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) measures

Ensure media pluralism and protect digital rights

Establish and maintain independent media regulatory and oversight bodies
Promote media pluralism
Refrain from imposing internet or communications shutdowns or censorship of critical voices
Support digital literacy
Ensure online platforms abide with their human rights responsibilities

Protect journalists and foster a vibrant civil society

Protect journalists by strengthening national legal frameworks to address journalists’ safety and access to justice
Create an enabling environment for journalists and for civil society organisations

Take special measures to protect disproportionately targeted groups, including women journalists
Support global and regional civil society initiatives
Protect freedom of association

Establish and strengthen accountability mechanisms

Strengthen the CMAG
Strengthen and adequately resource the Commonwealth Secretariat
Establish a Commonwealth Special Envoy on Freedom of Expression
Engage with international and regional human rights institutions and mechanisms
Join and engage with the Media Freedom Coalition

“Too many Commonwealth countries continue to enforce colonial-era laws that criminalise speech and silence dissent, in clear violation of their international obligations,“ Sneh Aurora, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative director, was quoted as saying.
“The media principles adopted by [the] heads of government in Samoa provide a timely opportunity for member states to take concrete steps — through law reform and institutional safeguards — to protect freedom of expression and align national laws with international human rights standards.”
William Horsley of the CJA said: “The almost complete failure of Commonwealth countries to prosecute and punish those responsible for the killings of over 200 journalists in 20 years is shameful.
“This culture of impunity must be swept away. A genuine Commonwealth engagement to protect the truth-tellers from threats and reprisals would give the organisation a vital new sense of purpose at a time when the concept of truth is under fierce attack.”</p><small>2025-09-09 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68bf7db5495e0.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940637/understanding-wild-behaviour' target='_blank'><strong>Understanding wild behaviour</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Wild animals don’t normally hurt human beings intentionally, says wildlife expert Vaqar Zakaria.
Yet, one swipe of the arm from a brown bear can inflict serious damage, even if their intent is not to harm.
Following a brown bear atta­­ck on singer Quratulain Baloch (QB) while she was filming in Deosai, Mr Zakaria told Dawn that although the local brown bear isn’t as big as its Alaskan cousin, its claws — typically around two inches long — are razor-sharp and capable of tearing flesh with ease.
“Maybe the bear thought there was food nearby, and the singer’s first reaction — screams for help — triggered the aggression,” he speculated, calling it a “rare and isolated incident”.
Dr Shafqat Hussain, Profes­sor of Anthropology at Trinity College in Hartford, Connec­ti­cut, was not too surprised by the bear attack. “Though unfo­rtunate, it was bound to happen sooner or later,” he said.

In wake of singer QB’s close call with a brown bear in Deosai, experts stress that people should never feed wild animals; blame human intervention for wildlife losing its ‘natural shyness’

Known for his work on snow leopard conservation in Gilgit-Baltistan, he warned that since bears are attracted to food which is available in human camps “more is to come if we continue glamping at Deosai”.
 
 

When QB was approached for comment, she requested “pri­­vacy for the healing process”.
“To ask a traumatised person to stay still, upon seeing a grizzly visitor inside the tent, is not very realistic — but that’s the best thing to do,” Zakaria noted.
According to him, TikTok videos, selfies, and a taste for human food are some of the reasons why wild animals lose their natural shyness and start venturing closer to human settlements.
Above all, he blames the people for encroaching into territories that have historically been the habitat of wild animals.
There are fundamental differences between humans and wildlife, he says. “Animals attack or kill for a reason; humans often do so for none. Bears, almost never.”
Yet one key similarity rem­ains — unpredictability.
“You never really know what might happen, or what could trigger ‘wild’ behaviour. We simply don’t know them well enough to anticipate it,” he said.
Human encroachment
The Deosai Plains, spanning about 3,600 sq km between Skardu and Astore in the Karakoram range, were declared a national park by the government in 1993. It is home to brown bears, marmots (squirrels), foxes, wolves, over two dozen species of birds and a vibrant variety of alpine flowers.
“If you cast a line in the streams, you will catch a fish within five minutes, and the water is clean enough for drinking,” Zakaria says.
To manage this unique ecosystem, the Islamabad-based Hi­­malayan Wildlife Founda­ti­­on (IWF) was asked to develop a management plan by the Gil­git-Baltistan Wildlife Depart­ment, marking core zones, grazing areas, camping sites and more.
As its co-founder, Zakaria has spent over three decades studying brown bears, tracking their movements, population, diet and behaviour — not just in Deosai but around the world — and continues to collaborate with international bear experts.
 
 

“In 1993, around 20 jeeps would visit the park every day in summers,” he recalled. By the year 2000, traffic had picked up. Today, up to 500 vehicles enter the park daily during peak season, he added.
“We need to accept that humans are occupying their territory, not the other way around,” he said.
He also blames people, tourists and locals alike, for altering and even degrading habitats — cutting forests, increasing livestock and then leaving them unattended in open grazing areas, providing easy prey for hungry wild predators.
Emphasising the dangers of habituation, Zakaria said Deosai marmots were routinely being fed by visitors. “You never, never, feed wild animals; that’s the cardinal rule!”
The HWF had originally advised that no permanent roads or permanent structures be built inside the park, to avoid the kind of irreversible environmental damage seen in Naran, Kaghan and more recently in Nathia Gali.
“But now with traffic hundred times higher, we may need hard top roads to reduce dust, noise and vehicles getting stuck in snow and for them not to go astray and remain in the designated area.
He also stressed the need for better campsite management, garbage disposal and upgraded restaurants, adding that education will have a key role to play in any betterment.

In Karachi, tandoor operators have raised the price of various roti varieties by an average of Rs2 per piece, which will mainly impact low- and middle-income groups, particularly daily wage earners and the labour class, who typically rely on eating their meals at local eateries.
The sharp rise in prices is evident in branded flour, with some millers raising the cost of a five-kilogram bag of fine flour to Rs700, up from Rs500 on Aug 1 and Rs600 on Sept 1, despite the arrival of the new wheat crop earlier this year. Retailers report that large-scale traders are likely profiting from the rise in prices, taking advantage of the higher demand for old flour stocks.
Some market analysts believe the ongoing wheat crisis is unrelated to the recent floods in Punjab and other regions, as the new wheat crop was harvested in March/April. However, hoarders, stockists, and investors are reportedly holding substantial wheat stocks, waiting for further price hikes driven by supply and demand dynamics.
Salman Mian Araieen, a member of the All Sindh Sheermal Tandoor Roti Association, stated that tandoor operators who were previously selling naan at Rs22 and Rs23 per piece (weighing 180 grams) have now raised prices to Rs25. Additionally, the price of chapati has increased by Rs2 per piece, reaching Rs14-15, up from Rs11-12. Some tandoor owners have refrained from passing on the full impact of rising flour prices, waiting for a potential reversal in flour rates.
According to Araieen, the price of 50 kg of fine atta has risen by Rs1,900 in just a month, now costing Rs5,700 per bag, up from Rs3,800. Despite the rise in flour costs, the prices of sheermal and taftan have remained unchanged, even as sugar prices climbed to Rs200 per kg from Rs180, and the cost of a 16kg tin of ghee surged to Rs7,900 from Rs6,500 in recent months. Currently, sheermal and taftan are priced at Rs70-90 per piece, depending on weight and quality. If flour prices continue to rise, an additional Rs10 per piece may be added to these items.
Some tandoor owners are reportedly considering discontinuing the sale of Rs20 naan (weighing 140-145 grams), as the price no longer covers their costs. Araieen noted that the price of a 40kg wheat bag, which has now reached Rs3,943 (Rs9,857 per 100kg), is the highest recorded in 72 weeks, last seen in April 2024.

“We have no shelter, not even a tent,” said 67-year-old farmer Adam Khan, leaning on a stick outside his ruined home in the village of Masud in Afgha­nistan’s eastern province of Kunar, devastated last week by earthquakes and subsequent aftershocks.
“It rained last night, we had no place to take cover,” he added. “Our biggest fear is the big rocks that could come down at any moment.”
Aid groups sped in food and supplies by helicopter, but survivors say help is patchy and slow.
Families cluster in makeshift camps dotting the area. In the village of Shaheedan, farmer Shams-ur-Rahman, 40, said he lost six relatives and fled with his family of nine. Now they sit in the open beside a road, flanked by their few possessions.
“The tents they gave us cannot even accommodate our children,” he said. “On the way down from the mountain, I had no shoes for my son, so I shared mine with him in turns as we walked down.”
For some, the displacement looks set to be permanent. In the harsh glare of the sun Gul Ahmad, 51, stood beside his relatives, the women of his family crouched in the shade of a wall as their pop-up tents flapped in the dust nearby.
“Even if there is no earthquake, a simple rainfall could bring rocks crashing down on us,” he said. “We will not go back. The government must provide us a place.”
Without sufficient shelter, sanitation and food, the trauma will spread disease and poverty in one of the world’s poorest and most quake-prone nations, international aid agencies say.
Some of the worst affected are children. Twelve-year-old Sadiq was pulled out alive after being trapped for 11 hours under rubble, in which his grandmother and a cousin were killed beside him.
“I thought I would die,” he said, sitting quietly on a rope bed as cousins and uncles milled around the family’s shelter. “It felt like doomsday.”
Female aid workers
The World Health Organisation has asked Taliban authorities to lift restrictions on Afghan female aid workers, allowing them to travel without male guardians and help women struggling to access care after a powerful earthquake killed 2,200 people in eastern Afghanistan.

• Floodwaters not receding as ‘backwater effect’ prevents Chenab from flowing into Indus; high-level alert for Sutlej after advisory from India
• PM Shehbaz forms committee to assess flood damage; official says over 4m people affected by floods
LAHORE: The southern districts of Punjab, particularly Multan, are at risk of severe flooding due to the swollen Chenab River, with the authorities preparing for a breach at the Sher Shah dyke to save the urban centres from inundation.
Although no decision had been taken to breach the Shershah bund at the time of going to press, officials were clear that the dyke would have to be breached if the water level crossed the critical threshold of 393.5 feet. As of Monday night, the water level was steady at 393 feet.
Officials said the flood would approach Multan in the next 48 hours, which would make the situation very critical for the city, which is already at risk of flooding.
Against this backdrop, it seemed that the decision to breach the embankment had already been made anticipating a massive surge heading towards Multan from Trimmu Headworks.
Multan MNA and ex-PM Yousaf Raza Gilani, in a Facebook post, asked people living in settlements along the embankment to relocate immediately. The PPP leader said water would be diverted towards Sher Shah, Gagra Kachhor, Mouza Hamar and other adjacent areas to break the flood force and avoid further damage.
Meanwhile, floodwaters that had entered Jalalpur Pirwala on Sunday submerged more localities in the district, including Alipur tehsil. Due to a backwater effect that was preventing the Chenab from falling into the Indus, the water had started flowing upstream of Panjnad.
The water first entered Panjnad Headworks’ downstream settlements Makhan Bela, Azmatpur, Bait Mullanwali, Bait Nabi Shah, Paka Naich, Bazwala, Lati Marri, Bait Burraha, Kundrala, and Bait Channa, and later flooded upstream areas of Ghalwan-I and Dammar Wala Janobi. The authorities relocated thousands of people to save them from flooding.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif constituted a committee led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal for the completion of the damage and need assessment report of the ongoing floods within two weeks.
Flood threat
Addressing a press conference in Multan, Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Jalalpur Pirwala was still facing the flood threat. He said that the first flood was moving out slowly and the water was not receding, while another surge from Head Trimmu was on its way towards Multan.
He said that the pressure would increase on Head Muhammadwala and the Sher Shah dyke in the next 24 hours. He said 63 people lost their lives and rescue boats had made 27,000 trips in Multan, adding that 4300 villages in 26 districts were affected due to the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab floods.
 
 

Multan Commissioner Aamir Kareem Khan said 4,000 people were evacuated and shifted to safer places in Jalalpur Pirwala.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said 4.199 million people from 4,300 villages were affected due to the flooding in the eastern rivers. He said that 2.147 million people, who were trapped in the floods, had been relocated to safer locations and 412 relief and 492 medical camps were established in the flood-affected districts.
The commissioner further shared the water situation of different dams, including Mangla Dam was 88 per cent full while Tarbela Dam was 100pc full. According to the commissioner, India’s Bhakra Dam on the River Sutlej was 90pc full, Pong Dam was 99pc full, while Thein Dam was 97pc full.
Earlier, the PDMA released a high-level flood alert for the Sutlej River, following an official advisory from the Indian High Commission regarding the rising water flow.
According to the alert, the river was experiencing a high flood level at the Harike and Ferozepur downstream points in India, indicating that water levels were expected to rise further within Pakistan.
Ganda Singh Wala Headworks on the Sutlej would continue to be in an “exceptionally high” flood. Besides riverine floods, Punjab’s urban centres also faced urban flooding.
Lahore recorded a heavy rainfall in several of its areas, with some localities, including Jail Road, receiving more than 100mm of rain on Monday. Meanwhile, torrential downpour in Faisalabad broke a 30-year record for the city.
Flowing backwards
As of Monday night, the floodwaters were not receding as the Indus River was pushing back the water from the Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi rivers. Due to this backwater effect, the operational capacity of the Panjnad Headworks had also reduced, according to a PDMA official.
Despite a steady flow of over 524,000 cusecs at Panjnad, the water was flowing upstream. Panjnad had recorded a flow of 609,664 cusecs till 12:30am and the water receded to 524,762 cusecs by 3:30 pm.
Just like the Indus, the Chenab is pushing back Ravi waters, a phenomenon that has previously led to a perilous rise in pressure at the Sidhnai Barrage on the Ravi River.
For the past few days, flows had remained dangerously steady at over 135,000 cusecs despite falling inflows from the upstream Balloki. To avert a catastrophic breach at Sidhnai, the government had to make a breach at the Mai Sufara embankment to save the barrage.
In a second major emergency operation, a controlled breach was made on the Sutlej River near Jalalpur Pirwala on Sunday night to divert water towards the Vehari district.
RYK capsize
Three people were killed while at least 8-10 people, mostly children, were missing after a boat capsized in the Chenab floodwater in the Noorwala area of tehsil Liaqatpur.
Reports said that a boat carrying almost 28 people capsized in Mouza Noorwala located in the riverbed area of the Chenab.

• Audit had flagged over Rs375tr in financial irregularities, loss of public money, ineffective public investments
ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) on Monday rejected media reports alleging errors and miscalculations in its audit reports released last month, which had highlighted more than Rs375 trillion in financial irregularities, loss of public money and lack of intended impact of public investments.
“AGP rejects allegations of errors in audit reports,” said a statement issued by the Department of the Auditor General of Pakistan (DAGP). It added that the office “strongly rejected recent media reports alleging miscalculations in the federal audit reports, terming them entirely unfounded and misleading.”
The DAGP also denied that the reports had been released bypassing the constitutional process, which requires their submission to the president and then laying before parliament.
According to the statement, the audit reports, appropriation accounts and financial statements for the fiscal year 2023-24 were duly submitted to the president and routed through the prime minister, strictly in line with constitutional provisions and the Rules of Business 1973. “The president approved the submission, and the reports were subsequently transmitted to both houses of parliament,” it said.
The DAGP explained that as the supreme audit institution of the country, it functions under a constitutional mandate laid down in Articles 168 to 171 of the Constitution.
Article 171 states: “The reports of the Auditor General relating to the accounts of the Federation shall be submitted to the President, who shall cause them to be laid before both Houses of Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament). The reports relating to the accounts of a Province shall be submitted to the Governor of the Province, who shall cause them to be laid before the Provincial Assembly.”
The statement further said that the app­r­oval of the reports from the president was duly communicated through the President’s Secretariat on April 12, 2025. Following this, the required number of federal audit reports were printed for laying before both houses of parliament.
On the AGP’s request, the motions were included in the National Assembly’s Orders of the Day issued on August 13, 2025. However, the National Assembly Secretariat, through its deputy secretary (legislation), informed the same day that the assembly session had been prorogued. As a result, the motion for laying the reports could not be included in the Orders of the Day.
The secretariat further asked that the reports be collected from the legislation branch, with due observance of confidentiality until they are formally laid before the house. “It is further clarified that the audit reports transmitted to the Senate remain in the custody of the Senate Secretariat,” it added.
Based on this record, the DAGP said: “The news currently circulating in different sections of print media alleging miscalculations in the audit reports and claiming that these reports were returned to the Department of the Auditor-General of Pakistan by the National Assembly Secretariat are entirely unfounded and misleading.”
It stressed that the audit reports, appropriation accounts and financial statements were sent to the NA Secretariat after the president’s approval on the prime minister’s advice to lay them before both houses of parliament.
Defending the integrity of its audit findings, the AGP asserted that the reports were prepared after proper quality assurance and “did not contain any errors”. It explained that the figures cited in the media came only from the executive summary of the consolidated federal audit report for 2024-25, which is prepared as a reference document to help stakeholders access and review sector-wise findings.

WHILE one cannot say for sure what was in the minds of those who approved the new National Tariff Policy 2025-2030, they were definitely not looking at the prevalent global trade scene. The new policy seems to draw its inspiration from the ‘neoliberal orthodoxy’ fast becoming redundant in these challenging times, which columnist Gillian Tett describes as “a new era of ‘geo-economics’ where state-driven industrial policies — tariffs, export controls — are reshaping global trade.”
In the 1980s, leaders such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan supported the free-market ideas espoused by politicians such as Jack Kemp and economists such as Eugene Fama and Milton Friedman. They assumed that “markets and money were shaped by laws of supply and demand so consistent and universal that they could be modelled using tools from physics and math”. The myth did not survive even in the best of the times when global free trade policy in the World Trade Organisation was led initially by the US or later by China.
 
 

Even before the world saw the US-China trade war heat up, using tariffs and subsidies to influence flow of trade, globalisation and market access had been restricted through customs unions/ trade blocs such as Asean, the EU, EAEU, GCC and many others. The countries have been engaging with each other and these trade blocs, to gain market access through free or preferential trade agreements (FTAs/ PTAs). One of the main reasons for Pakistan facing difficulty in expanding its exports is that it has only few FTAs/ PTAs as compared to its competitors. That is to say, it has limited market access.
This is not the first time that we went down the path of old-fashioned romanticism with the ideas of free trade and tariff liberalisation. The rationale was always the same: global integration, competitiveness and efficiency. The outcomes, however, tell a different story.

The new tariff policy poses a risk to external sector stability and the current account surplus.

We should have kept in mind the lessons from the liberalisation era of the 1990s under the IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programmes. It was said that tariff rationalisation would modernise trade and integrate the economy into the global market. Between 1996 and 2005, Pakistan’s average tariff was steeply brought down from 46.6 per cent to just 14.3pc. Instead of expanding exports, Pakistan entered into an unending spiral of high trade deficits eating away workers’ remittances and leaving behind large current account deficits. The trade deficit which was just $3.1 billion in 1995-96 grew four times to $12.1bn in 2005-06 and 16 times to $48.3bn in 2021-22.
 
 

In three decades (1995-2025), Pakistan’s exports increased only 3.7 times from $8.7bn to $32bn. In these 30 years, the export of regional peers, ie, Bangladesh and India, grew by 12.6 and 14.3 times, respectively. In contrast, our imports jumped almost eight times, from $11.8bn in 1995-96 to $80.3bn, its highest in 2021-22.
The unilateral opening of our markets to foreign goods, without an accompanying industrial policy which would have allowed our industry to grow from producers of low-value goods to high-value ones, left our industries facing their worst downward spiral into an era of premature de-industrialisation. In these three decades, Pakistan’s industrial sector recorded only a six-fold increase, compared with 30-fold in Vietnam, 17-fold in Bangladesh, and nine-fold in India.
The National Tariff Policy 2025-30 seeks to reduce the average tariff from 10.4pc to below 6pc by 2030, far below the average tariff of around 16pc in India and 14pc in Bangladesh. The new structure reduces five slabs to four (0pc, 5pc, 10pc, 15pc), reducing from the current highest slab of 20pc. Bangladesh and India continue to retain their maximum slabs of 25pc and 70pc respectively, despite enjoying a much larger market access. Both our competitors continue to impose additional duties and surcharges, whereas Pakistan has committed to phase these out in four to five years under the new policy.
The previous National Tariff Policy 2019-24 distinguished between inputs essential for industrial development and luxury consumption goods, lowering duties on raw material, intermediate inputs and machinery while retaining higher tariffs on finished and non-essential imports. It helped reduce production costs without exposing domestic firms to undue competition. If accompanied by the right policy mix, it could have provided the foundation for sustainable industrial growth.
 
 

Any attempt to trade liberalisation must be accompanied by a reasonably sound industrial base and enabling global environment. The new tariff policy puts the hard-earned stability in the external sector and the current account surplus achieved only last year, at immense risk. The knee-jerk tariff policy shift has shown the future trend in the first two months of its partial implementation. The trade deficit in the months of July and August jumped 29pc at $6bn, up from $4.6bn last year for the corresponding period against a 12.5pc decline in exports in the month of August.
As a market of 250 million consumers, Pakistan can attract many investors and traders if it can offer a profitable proposition through preferential tariff concessions to economies which make reciprocal concessions to our exporters and investors. If we open our market unilaterally for the entire world, giving away tariffs as a bargaining chip, why would anyone bother to discuss FTAs/ PTAs with us and open their markets for our exports?
“The world has changed, globalisation is over and we are now in a new era,” said Keir Starmer, the British prime minister. We no longer live in the Reagan-Thatcher era of neoliberalism or globalisation. Let us put aside outdated editions of a redundant policy mix. Let us wake up to the new real world of smart trade deals, using tariff policy as a tool for negotiations and for exchanging market access, instead of allowing unilateral access. It must be accompanied by a reliable security environment, enabling policies and their continuity; and efficient protection for those industrial sectors that are critical for our economic security.

Speaking at a news conference, Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to China, the two sides had agreed to constitute a consortium of financiers, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), China and Pakistan, for the 1,700-km Karachi-Peshawar railway line.
He said China had assured financing not only for ML-1 but also for the Karakoram Highway. Negotiations with multiple financiers would be concluded within a month. He added that ML-1 and the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway would already have been completed, had it not been for the 2018 political change, alleging that the subsequent PTI government “destroyed the process”.
The minister said Pakistan and China had agreed to develop and implement a four-year action plan to build, between 2025 and 2029, a “China-Pakistan community with a shared future” with stronger political trust, closer trade ties, deeper security cooperation and stronger people-to-people links. Agriculture modernisation and industrial development would be prioritised under CPEC’s second phase, with space for third-party participation.

Minister says Beijing also assured funding for Karakoram Highway

The next meeting of the Joint Cooperation Council (JCC) of CPEC will be held on Sept 26 in Beijing. Both sides also agreed to advance industrial park development in line with local needs, support enterprise investment in special economic zones (SEZs) — particularly in Karachi and Islamabad — and offer preferential policies and a supportive business environment.
Mr Iqbal said the action plan was a “solid development” of leadership-level meetings aimed at deepening strategic cooperation and advancing the shared vision of an even closer partnership in the new era between two “time-tested, friendly countries.”
The two sides agreed to make full use of the Framework Agreement on Industrial Cooperation to accelerate industrialisation, support exports and encourage Chinese firms to invest in Pakistan, including in the mining sector and building mining industrial parks.
They also agreed to promote cooperation in crop cultivation, animal husbandry, epidemic control for plants and animals, aquaculture, agro-processing, agricultural mechanisation and capacity building in seed technology and drip irrigation.
The plan includes aligning the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Pakistan’s 5Es Framework, implementing both large-scale landmark projects and “small and beautiful” livelihood projects, while ensuring both high-quality development and robust security.

Al Jazeera quoted paramedics as saying that at least 12 people were inju­red and six were in “serious condition” after the shooting on Monday morning at Ramot Junction.
Israeli police described the shooting as a suspec­ted “terror attack”, Al Jaz­e­era reported, adding that a security officer and an armed civilian shot and killed the perpetrators soon after the shooting began.
The police said the perpetrators arrived in a vehicle and opened fire at a bus station.
Four of the dead were ultra-Orthodox Israeli men, according to local me­d­ia, while another was a recent immigrant from Spain.
Israeli forces closed all checkpoints between East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank after the attack, sources told Al Jazeera.
After police said the perpetrators had come from the occupied West Bank, Israeli Army Radio reported Israeli forces imposed a military cordon on four villages in the Jerusalem governorate in the territory — Qatana, Biddu, Beit Inan and Beit Duqu — and conducted raids there.
The Israeli military said it had reinforced its forces in the wider Jerusalem area and was conducting a wide-ranging search for what it described as “accomplices” in the shooting.
Palestinians in the West Bank are preparing themselves to face collective punishment from Israel in retaliation for the attack, a Palestinian journalist said.
According to an Al Jazeera journalist, Israeli authorities said the two perpetrators came from an area in the occupied West Bank that is just west of East Jerusalem.
They claimed the two worked in tandem; both gunmen boarded a bus —  witnesses say one of them was dressed as a ticket inspector —  and opened fire.
Israeli officials are now trying to wrap their heads around how exactly this happened, saying that they haven’t seen something like this happen in years, saying that the last shooting like this in greater Jerusalem was back in November 2023, Al Jazeera reported.
Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich blamed the attack on the Palestinian Authority, which he claimed “raises and educates its children to murder Jews”.
But the Palestinian presidency in Ramallah said it “firmly rejected and condemned any targeting of Palestinian and Israeli civilians,” the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported.
The PA is a civilian ruling authority in areas of the West Bank, where about three million Palestinians live — as well as around half a million Israelis occupying settlements considered illegal under international law.

• Police fire tear gas to disperse protesters in various localities; dozens rounded up across the province
• Markets stay shut; trade with Iran, Afghanistan suspended due to roadblocks; only airport, railway station operational
QUETTA: Opposition leaders vowed to continue holding protests across Baloc­histan after police arrested 260 people on Monday for alleged violent demo­n­s­trations and violation of Section 144.
The arrests came as Quetta and other parts of the province were brought to a virtual standstill as a result of a strike — announced by opposition parties to protest a recent suicide bombing, which claimed over a dozen lives.
Life across the province was also disrupted and due to road blocks, Balochistan remained cut off from the rest of the country, barring rail and aerial routes.
Clashes were also reported between protesters and the police. A senior police official was also taken to hospital with bullet injuries, officials said.
Workers and supporters of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan alliance blocked all national highways at different entry points, putting up barricades and big boulders in the morning to block all types of traffic. Transporters’ associations had already announced support for their protest.
Likewise, trade activities between Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran were suspended due to the strike. Not a single truck or other vehicle crossed into the border towns of Chaman and Taftan due to the blockade on highways linking Balochistan with Afghanistan and Iran.
The airport and rail services, however, remained operational under the watchful eye of security personnel.
Besides roads and trade, businesses also remained shut and the supporters of the opposition parties patrolled the business hubs of the provincial capital, seemingly to enforce the strike.
Clashes erupted in the areas of Sariab, Airport Road, Pashtunabad, Nawa Killi, and Jinnah Road when police attempted to remove blockades from main roads.
Police removed the hurdles and did not allow the alliance workers to block intra-city roads.
The protesters, however, managed to block the Western and Eastern bypasses for a brief period, but police dispersed them by firing tear gas.
On Airport Road too, police fired in the air to disperse protesters who were blocking the road, while clashes were also reported from Sariab Road.
SSP Mohammad Baloch told Dawn that those detained had been sent to the district jail.
PkMAP Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, ex-MNA Abdul Qahar Wadan, BNP-Mengal leader Mir Naseer Ahmed Shahwani and others were also arrested by the police.
Private educational institutions, including schools and colleges, remained closed due to the protest.
However, government-run educational institutions and offices remained open, but very few employees could reach the secretariat and other offices due to low traffic.
60 arrested across province
In other parts of the province, over 60 people were arrested for violating Section 144, blocking the highways, and clashing with the security forces. The wheel-jam and shutter-down strike was also observed in Loralai, Zhob, Sibi. Nasirabad, Khuzdar, Kalat, Harnai, Mastung, Hub Bela, Kharan, Noshki, Qila Saifullah, Turbat, Panjgur, Gwadar, Dera Murad Jamali and other towns and cities. “Around 60 people were arrested in these towns,” said officials.
In KP, the opposition parties, as well as the ruling PTI, also organised demonstrations across the province.
The strike call was given by PkMAP, BNP, the PTI, the ANP, the National Party, and the MWM at a joint presser last week to protest the Sept 2 suicide bombing.
Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the attack as they had left just a few minutes before.
Press conference
Addressing the media at the Quetta Press Club on Monday evening, PkMAP’s Lala Abdul Rauf, BNP’s Sajid Tareen Advocate, ANP’s Asghar Achakzai, National Party’s Aslam Baloch, Jamaat-e-Islami’s Zahid Akhtar, and PTI’s Dawood Shah Achakzai condemned what they called the government’s attempts to sabotage their strike. They decried baton charge, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests of peaceful protesters and announced a plan to hold more protest rallies.
The leaders announced that protests will be held on Sept 11 in front of press clubs across Balochistan, while a meeting of senior leaders has been scheduled for Sept 13 to finalise the alliance’s future course of action. They warned that if political workers and leaders detained across the province were not released, a tougher line of action would be announced at the Sept 13 meeting.

Bayrou, who has been in the job for just nine months, had blindsided even his allies by calling a confidence vote to end a lengthy standoff over his austerity budget, which foresees almost 44 billion euros ($52 billion) of cost savings to reduce France’s debt pile.
Bayrou, the first premier in the history of modern France to be ousted in a confidence vote rather than a no-confidence vote, will submit his resignation on Tuesday morning, according to a person close to him who asked not to be named.

President Macron left scrambling to find a successor; country plunged into another political crisis

In the vote in the National Assembly, 364 deputies voted that they had no confidence in the government while just 194 gave it their confidence. “In line with article 50 of the constitution, the prime minister must submit the resignation of his government,” said speaker Yael Braun-Pivet.
Bayrou is the sixth prime minister under Macron since his 2017 election but the fifth since 2022. Bayrou’s ousting leaves the French head of state with a new domestic headache at a time when he is leading diplomatic efforts on the Ukraine war.
But defending his decision to call the high-risk confidence vote, Bayrou told the National Assembly: “The biggest risk was not to take one, to let things continue without anything changing… and have business as usual.”

• Israel’s defence minister asks Hamas to ‘lay down arms’ or ‘face annihilation’
• Netanyahu tells residents of Gaza City to evacuate;  four Israeli soldiers killed
WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM: US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was issuing a “last warning” to Hamas, saying the Palestinian group must accept a deal to release Israeli prisoners.
“The Israelis have accepted my terms. It is time for Hamas to accept as well. I have warned Hamas about the consequences of not accepting. This is my last warning,” Donald Trump said on social media.
“We had some very good discussions. Good things could happen,” he told reporters. “I think we’re going to have a deal on Gaza very soon.”
 


Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told residents of Gaza City on Monday to evacuate, and the military said four soldiers were killed in the Gaza Strip when an unidentified person “lobbed an explosive device into their tank”.
In response to Trump’s comments, Hamas said it was ready to “immediately sit at the negotiating table” following “some ideas received from the American side aimed at reaching a ceasefire agreement”.
In exchange for a truce, Hamas said it wanted “a clear declaration of the end of the war, a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the formation of a committee of independent Palestinians to manage the Gaza Strip, which would begin its duties immediately”.
Hamas agreed last month to a ceasefire proposal that involved a 60-day truce and staggered prisoner releases.
Israel, however, has demanded that Hamas release all the prisoners at once, disarm itself and relinquish control of Gaza, among other conditions.
In Geneva, United Nations rights chief Volker Turk said he was “horrified by the open use of genocidal rhetoric by senior Israeli officials”.
‘Face annihilation’
Israel’s defence minister warned Hamas on Monday to “lay down your arms” or “face annihilation”.
“This is a final warning to Hamas: release the hostages (prisoners) and put down your weapons or Gaza will be destroyed and you will be annihilated,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said on X
The Israeli minister threatened that “today, a massive hurricane will hit the skies of Gaza City”, where he said the military was “preparing to expand” operations.
 


Israel has stepped up operations, levelling high-rise buildings in Gaza City which it has vowed to capture, despite mounting international pressure to stop the bombardment.
‘Genocidal rhetoric’
The UN rights chief accused Israeli officials of using overt “genocidal rhetoric” about Gaza and called for decisive international action to “end the carnage”.
In a speech to the UN Human Rights Council that was criticised by Israel, Volker Turk said the occupied Palestinian territory was already “a graveyard”.
He stressed that “the region is crying out for peace”.
Turk accused Israel of inflicting indescribable suffering and wholesale destruction.
“I am horrified by the open use of genocidal rhetoric and the disgraceful dehumanisation of Palestinians by senior Israeli officials.”
“Further militarisation, occupation, annexation and oppression will only feed more violence, retribution and terror,” Volker Turk warned.
He insisted Israel had “a legal obligation to take the steps ordered by the International Court of Justice to prevent acts of genocide, punish incitement to genocide and ensure enough aid reaches Palestinians in Gaza”.
The UN rights chief said the international community was “failing the people of Gaza”.
“Where are the decisive steps to prevent genocide,” he wondered.
Ravina Shamdasani, the spokeswoman for Volker Turk, said “shocking and dehumanising language” has been used by a number of high-level officials, stressing that “this is not a case of one senior official mouthing off”.
Two teens killed in Jenin
The Palestinian health ministry said that the Israeli military killed two teenagers at a refugee camp in Jenin on Monday.
The two victims were named by the ministry as Islam Abdel Aziz Nouh Majarmeh and Muhammad Sari Omar Masqala, both aged 14.
Palestinian official news agency Wafa reported that the two boys were killed after Israeli soldiers “opened fire at a group of civilians who attempted to inspect their houses in the camp and retrieve some of their belongings”.

Floods have displaced two million people, submerged 2,000 villages, and led to the relocation of 760,000 residents and 516,000 heads of cattle from the affected areas.
The satellite imagery of 24 Punjab districts in the command areas of the Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab rivers shows that arou­nd 3,661 square kilometres, or 4.7 per cent of the total area, remained under floodwaters.
The floods have devastated key crops, including rice, sugarcane, corn, vegetables, and cotton. According to the Pakistan Business Forum, approximately 35pc of the cotton crop in central and southern Punjab has been destroyed, with losses reaching as high as 40-50pc in Bahawalnagar, the province’s largest cotton-producing district.

Kissan Board leader claims losses to tune of Rs500bn; over 1.3m acres of farmland submerged

Akhtar Farooq Meo of the Kissan Board Pakistan claimed that farmers sustained losses to the tune of Rs536 billion due to damage to the cotton, rice, sesame, maize, and fodder crops. Mr Meo claimed that many towns were facing shortages of perishable items and the situation could transform into a food crisis.
Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports about damage to the rice crop. The Pakistan Business Forum claimed that 60pc of the rice crop in central and southern Punjab had been destroyed — a claim contested by the exporters.
They said the Basmati crop region, with the exception of Pasrur in Sialkot, remained largely undamaged, adding that the non-Basmati crop, particularly along the Sutlej River, had already been harvested in late July and early August, with only hybrid varieties in some areas sustaining damage.
 
 

However, floods created a severe shortage of fodder, threatening the livestock industry, which was a major contributor to the national GDP.
Meanwhile, experts feared a sharp rise in domestic grain prices that could make Pakistani rice uncompetitive on the global market. Similarly, the loss of the cotton crop was also alarming for the textile industry, accounting for over half of Pakistan’s export revenues.
Ihsanul Haq, the chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, said the crop was under severe stress.
Major cotton-producing regions in Punjab and Sindh, including Bahawalnagar, Multan, Bahawalpur, and Rahim Yar Khan, were either currently submerged or were bracing for more heavy rainfall. The reduced supply of raw cotton reportedly forced several ginning factories and mills to cease operations. Furthermore, there were early reports of a virus affecting various cotton varieties, which could further reduce per-acre yields.

This is despite the fact that Pakistan officially suffers a severe natural gas and LNG supply glut, compelling the government to seek postponement of more than 170 LNG import cargos and SNGPL forcing local gas producers to shut down their fields or scale down production.
This causes substantial losses, not only to local producers like state-owned OGDCL, listed at the London Stock Exchange, but also erodes the country’s foreign exchange and forces consumers to pay high fixed charges for gas they receive for only a few hours a day.
And yet, while the political leadership remains engaged in firefighting, officials in the Centre and SNGPL —  along with its board of directors, businessmen and other stakeholders concerned with investment facilitation — try to navigate their interests and arguments .

Move aimed at providing ‘level playing field’ for public and private sector gas suppliers

None of the parties involved Dawn contacted — the petroleum division, the SNGPL management and the private entities — chose to speak on the record, rather passed the buck onto other parties.
At the same time, SNGPL has instructed local gas fields which produce cheaper gas, to shut down or reduce output to absorb expensive LNG purchased under binding international contracts. More than 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of local gas production has been curtailed.
Unannounced rationing
While producers are forced to limit supply, SNGPL has begun unannounced rationing for residential and commercial customers, providing gas for only two to three hours during breakfast, lunch and dinner.
This follows a government decision to double fixed monthly charges effective July 1, 2025. Consequently, gas consumption of around Rs450 now results in a total bill near Rs 2,500, after fixed charges and taxes are added.
The production cuts have created cash flow problems for local producers like OGDCL, GHPL and others including a few in the private sector, hampering their domestic and international exploration activities.
The country’s largest producer, OGDCL, has publicly deplored the situation.
“The less gas intake by SNGPL from Qadirpur, Nashpa, Chanda, Dhok Hussain, Mela, Bettani, Pirkoh, Togh and Loti fields and TAL owing to SNGPL system constraints and by UPL from Uch fields due to less demand from power purchaser adversely impacted daily net production by 1,148 barrels of crude oil, 76 MMcf of gas and 55 tons of LPG,” the company stated in a report to its board of directors a few months ago.
“During the nine months ending March 31, 2025, OGDCL registered Sales Revenue of Rs 310.907 billion (against Rs348.164 billion of same period of previous year),” the report added. “The Company’s Sales declined primarily due to forced production curtailment accompanied with reduction in average basket price of crude oil.”
With the energy sector’s circular debt exceeding Rs4.6 trillion, the government had allowed local producers to sell some of their gas to third parties to improve their cash flow.
Under such arrangement, some producers like MOL-Pakistan and Petroleum Exploration Limited were allowed by petroleum division to sell their output from Razgir and Zahra North field and some others to third parties.
However, SNGPL resisted an arrangement for the Razgir field, arguing it created “a market distortion”.
The company noted that a Rs791 per unit captive levy, imposed on its industrial customers under IMF instru­ctions, did not apply to third-party suppliers, prompting its customers to switch to cheaper private gas.
Despite this resistance, SNGPL’s board of directors approved the pipeline capacity allocation for the Razgir gas to a third party. While SNGPL management later denied any such approval, records seen by Dawn indicate that at least nine of the 11 board members signed the decision.
In response to the infighting, the Ministry of Law has now ruled the captive power levy applies to all consumers of LNG or local gas, whether supplied by public or private entities.
To resolve the issue, the ministry ruled that while the sale of gas from producers to suppliers is deregulated, the subsequent sale from suppliers to CPPs is not.
The ministry determined that the price has to be determined by Ogra under section 8(6), read with sections 43A and 43B of the Ogra Ordinance for the purpose of collection of levy under the Levy Act of 2025.

According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), remittance inflows in the first two months of FY26 rose by 7pc, dispelling fears that a reduction in incentives would lead to a decline in remittances.
In August, remittances totalled $3.137 billion, showing a 6.6pc year-on-year increase. However, the monthly inflows saw a slight decline of 2.4pc compared to July, when they were $3.214bn.
While the growth in the first two months of FY26 is positive, it pales in comparison to the remarkable growth witnessed during the same period last fiscal year. Remittances surged by 44pc in 2MFY25 compared to FY24. This extraordinary growth contributed to a record annual total of $38.3bn, which helped maintain exchange rate stability and allowed the SBP to increase its foreign reserves by $7.8bn, reaching $14.5bn.
The government does not expect remittance growth to match the record levels of FY25 but remains hopeful that total inflows will reach around $40bn in FY26.

Inflows rose 6.6pc to $3.13bn in Aug

Despite these expectations, remittances from regions outside the Middle East have shown a decline. Inflows from major destinations like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and GCC countries accounted for about 55pc of total remittance inflows during July-August FY26.
The inflows from Saudi Arabia amounted to $1.56bn, reflecting a modest growth of just 6pc, compared to a 50.7pc increase during the same period last year. Remittances from the UAE grew by 13.8pc, down significantly from the 84.3pc growth recorded in the first two months of FY25, totalling $1.308bn.
 
 

In contrast, inflows from other GCC countries reached $600 million, showing a growth of 5.3pc.
Meanwhile, remittances from the UK and USA showed a decline, with the former down by 0.5pc to $913.7 million, and the latter down by 13.7pc to $537 million. On a positive note, remittances from the European Union (EU) continued to grow, increasing by 18pc to reach $857 million in the first two months of FY26.Financial experts emphasise the need for remittances to remain strong throughout FY26 to maintain a current account surplus and preserve the stability of the exchange rate.

Speaking at an open kachehry in the Bhekar area of Dera Bugti district, he urged political stakeholders to move beyond “non-issues” and focus on the real challenges hindering development.
The event drew a large turnout of citizens and members of the provincial assembly, offering a rare platform for direct public engagement.
CM Bugti listened attentively to public grievances and issued immediate directives to officials, reaffirming his administration’s commitment to swift and practical solutions.

Urges political stakeholders to move beyond ‘non-issues’ and focus on real development challenges

The chief minister described terrorism as a “cancer” that has deeply affected all segments of society. He commended the sacrifices made by the people of Dera Bugti in their pursuit of peace and national unity, emphasising that the integrity of the state must be upheld at all costs.
He warned against the practice of linking everyday societal issues with state responsibilities, stressing that such narratives undermine national cohesion.
“The government’s doors are open to all,” he assured, highlighting his commitment to inclusive and responsive governance.
While affirming the public’s right to peaceful protest, the chief minister condemned disruptive actions such as road blockades, warning that coercion and violence will not be tolerated. He called for responsible civic engagement that respects public convenience and national dignity.
To enhance service delivery at the grassroots level, CM Bugti directed local government representatives to adopt a more proactive approach. He reiterated the provincial government’s commitment to providing development funds to local bodies, contingent upon transparency and alignment with national values.

CJP Afridi shared council’s performa­n­­ce during the last judicial year while add­r­e­­ssing a conference marking the new judicial year here at the  Supreme Court auditorium on Monday. All the 24 judges of the Su­­preme Court were present at the ceremony.
Comparing the previous years’ SJC performance, the chief justice said the council did not dispose of a single complaint in 2021-22. It decided 21 cases in 2022–23, 53 in 2023–24 and nearly 70 cases in 2024-25, he said, claiming that the institutional strengthening was also prioritised during the past one year.
He said the Supreme Court had plans to use artificial intelligence to categorise cases for fixation, but the judiciary would have to prepare itself for technology use. Under a project, which would be completed within six months, 61,000 files would be digitally screened, he explained.
“It is only when you have them digitally scanned that you can utilise the tools of AI for categorisation. It will be easy to categorise cases and to fix before one bench one issue,” he added, according to a Dawn.com report.

Justice Afridi says judiciary needs to get ready as SC plans to use AI to categorise cases for listing

Referring to the contentious issue of leave on part of judges, the CJP said he had made it very clear that during vacation, any judge could opt for holidays, but during the court work, the discretion to approve a request for leave of absence or reject it vests with CJP.
During the past year, he said, the SJC secretariat was relocated to a newly established office within the SC building, equipped with modern facilities and designed for future expansion. As the finance division approved its budget, its financial independence was secured, he said, adding that its secretary was designated as principal accounting officer.
In a year, the overall pendency of cases was brought down from 60,635 to 56,943 cases, he said. The backlog could have been reduced further, if several judges had not been engaged in larger constitutional benches, which demanded extended hearings, he added. This decline is not only statistically significant but also a meaningful step towards improving efficiency of the system, he said.
 
 

However, at the same time, data revealed that the number of adjournments sought by advocates rose sharply in 2024–25 to 56,449 compared to 22,425 in the previous year.
“I must remind you all that the Bar play an important role in advancing justice, and I urge them to help curb the growing tendency of adjournments, so that the hard-won reduction in pendency may not only be sustained but further strengthened,” the CJP said.
The conference also featured three symbolic inaugurations reflecting the judiciary’s commitment to accessibility, inclusivity, and shared responsibility, with public facilitation centre being inaugurated by litigant Basharat Javed, SC media platform by SC press association president Zulqarnain Iqbal, and Supreme Court bar cafeteria by SCBA president Mian Muhammad Rauf Atta.
The conference was also addressed by Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, who emphasised that the SC should refrain from political cases since it makes the top court controversial, whereas Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) vice chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nas­rullah Warriach cautioned the judges to stay away from what he called a mob mentality and never yield to popular opinions.
SCBA President Rauf Atta had earlier ex­­pressed concern that despite increase in the strength of judges after the 26th Amen­d­ment, the pendency of cases did not reduce.

A first information report (FIR) was filed at the Saddar Bairooni Police Station today on the complaint of Supreme Court Press Association President Tayyab Baloch under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 382 (theft after preparation made causing death, hurt or restraint in order to committing of the theft), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Baloch said that he was present outside Adiala Jail at around 3:55pm for reporting with other journalists when Aleema and other people began a media talk after a hearing for the Toshakhana case.
“During this time, a person named Naeem Panjutha called out: ‘Teach him a lesson for questioning Aleema about properties,’” Baloch said, adding that 35-40 people there grabbed him at that, laid him down and began beating him.
“During this time, some unknown person snatched my mobile phone from me and also broke my microphone,” he said, adding that other reporters there who tried to rescue him were also beaten up.
“We barely escaped them after much pleading. The reason is that I had previously asked Aleema Khan about purchasing properties in America as a journalist, which made her uncomfortable. On which, Aleema Khan, through his workers, first posted pictures of me … [and others] on social media and spread rumours against us. Today, as per the pre-arranged plan, they attacked me, beat me up, forcibly snatched my mobile and threatened to kill me, along with breaking my microphone.”
He requested legal proceedings against Aleema, Panjutha and the other suspects.
In reponse, Panjutha termed the FIR a “fake case” against him and Aleema.
 






Slamming the incident, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Baloch was targeted with violence “solely and only because of a difference of opinion, which is unacceptable”.
He said strict action would be taken and vowed to give his full support.
 






PPP leaders such as Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab also condemned the incident.
Karachi Press Club President Fazil Jamili said the incident was both “unfortunate and condemnable”. He added that “this new trend will not end unless political parties actively discourage it. We must remember that politics and journalism rise & fall together.”

They dubbed the full court meeting, which was called for this purpose today, a mere “stamp of approval” for the rules, which they said were already decided and unilaterally approved.
The letter addressed to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was sent by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Athar Minallah. The four judges also skipped the full court meeting held later today.
They pointed out that “if the full court was not deemed necessary for the adoption of the rules themselves, how can it now be summoned to deliberate upon their amendment?”
The judges said the working paper for the meeting’s agenda stated that under Rule 1(4) of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, the CJP may “remove any difficulty in giving effect to the said rules” on the recommendations of a committee that was constituted by him and had already been formed.
Moreover, “the chief justice, through a letter dated August 12, 2025, informed the judges that the rules had already been approved through circulation and duly notified in the Gazette on August 9, 2025,” the judges highlighted.
Yet, they further stated, the CJP had sought suggestions “for further amendments” to the rules.
Calling into question the legality of the rules themselves, the judges noted that the “present Supreme Court rules were never placed before, nor approved by, the full court.”
Citing Article 191 of the Constitution, they said the SC had the “power to make rules regulating its practice and procedure, but this power is exercised collectively by the court as an institution”.
The judges concluded that any rules established “without deliberation and approval of the full court” lacked its approval and could not acquire “binding legal status”.
They were of the opinion that the rules, in their present form, “suffer from both substantive and procedural illegality”. In this connection, they expressed reservations that rules were processed through circulation.
“Circulation is an administrative convenience to deal with routine or minor procedural matters; it is not, and cannot be, the vehicle for laying down the constitutional architecture of this court’s governance.
“Unless the full court had itself had expressly resolved to adopt circulation for this purpose, the chief justice alone could not unilaterally resort to it.”
Further highlighting confusion around the matter, the judges said that the working paper for the meeting invoked “Rule 1(R) regarding removal of difficulties” during the process, despite there being no need to invoke the provision.
The judges deliberated that the provision was invoked only “to defend or justify the unilateral process already undertaken”.
“Instead of clarifying the legitimacy of the rules, this only exposes their infirmity: if no difficulty exists, why place such a point before the full court?” they asked.
The four SC judges termed the purpose behind the move “puzzling and fallacious”. The judges, in their letter, questioned why a full court was convened if the rules had already been notified as “approved” on August 9.
Within three days, on August 12, CJP “sought suggestions for amendment [to] the same rules”, the judges said.
They went on to add that “this sequence tacitly acknowledges that the full court is the correct forum for such deliberation,” but noted that it was only undertaken after the “fait accompli of unilateral approval”.
“This amounts to putting the cart before the horse-first declaring the Rules valid, and then calling the full court merely to consider patchwork amendments,” they added.
On that note, the judges regretted that the “meeting is being used to give a veneer of legitimacy to an otherwise invalid process,” and aimed to reduce the role of a full court to only “cosmetic”.
The forum was being used to ratify “what has already been done rather than discharging its true constitutional function under Article 191,” the judges claimed.
The judges recommended that the constitutional course of action would have been to “place the rules in their entirety, before the full court, permit genuine discussion and deliberation, and only thereafter seek formal approval.”
Calling for the abandonment of the meeting, the judges said that it was “designed to merely serve as a stamp of approval” and to proceed with it would be equal to reducing the “full court to an afterthought — convened not for decision-making but for damage control.”
The judges noted that such a move “undermines the collective authority of this court”.
Citing the above reservations, the four judges refused to attend the full court, unless a constitutional course of action is adopted, stating that, “we see no point in attending a meeting that is premised on amending rules which, in our respectful view, already suffer from illegality both in substance and in process.”
The letter further called for the objection to be presented in the minutes of the full court meeting and for the meeting to be made public.
“People are entitled to know how rules governing the internal life of the court came to be notified without discussion or deliberation amongst its judges,” the letter added, calling the meeting a ploy to “cloak” the whole process in a “semblance of legitimacy”.
“By opening our deliberations to the gaze of the people we serve, we reinforce the trust without which no constitutional court can function,” the letter concluded.
Last week, Justice Shah, in a separate letter to the CJP, had questioned why the historic revision of the 1980 rules was “approved by circulation”, rather than after a thorough discussion in the full court.
In March, a committee constituted by CJP Afridi was tasked to conduct a thorough review of the Supreme Court Rules of 1980, and formulated a comprehensive draft of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
The aim was to enhance transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness in judicial proceedings.
However, when the draft of the new rules was circulated among the judges for consideration, some senior judges opposed the idea of approving them without a full court meeting, while the legal fraternity also expressed reservations about certain provisions.
Subsequently, CJP Afridi convened a full court meeting on Sept 8 (today) to finalise the rules and reconstituted the four-judge committee under Rule 1(4) of the proposed rules to recommend solutions for any difficulties in implementation.
Full court meeting
Later in the day, the full court meeting was held without the participation of the four judges.
A press release from the Supreme Court said CJP Afridi welcomed the participants and commended the efforts of the committee constituted to review the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. He appreciated the committee’s “exhaustive work”, undertaken with input from fellow judges and the legal fraternity, resulting in a comprehensive draft of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
The chief justice briefed the full court on the rules, the press release said, adding that after detailed deliberations on various provisions, the meeting’s participants unanimously agreed that the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, were a “living document” and should be subject to ongoing review and amendment as required from time to time.
“The full court, after considering various aspects and deliberating upon some of the critical provisions, unanimously decided to postpone the implementation of amendments to the extent of enhancement of court fees and securities for the time being. The committee shall consider the suggestions from honourable judges, the bar representatives or other stakeholders in this regard for placement before the full court for decision in light of the committee’s recommendations.
“The honourable chief justice termed this development a significant milestone, reflecting the judiciary’s commitment to strengthening institutional frameworks and ensuring that the Supreme Court Rules remain dynamic, responsive and in line with contemporary needs,” the press release said.

The USSM, based in the state of Missouri, is focused on producing and recycling critical minerals, which the United States Department of Energy has defined as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.
The USSM is a company that specialises in extracting critical metals from old lithium-ion batteries and mining cobalt, nickel and copper, according to its website. According to the American embassy, the US Department of Energy has defined critical minerals as essential in a variety of technologies related to advanced manufacturing and energy production.
A press release from the US Embassy, published on Sunday, stated that Acting Deputy Chief of Mission Zach Harkenrider accompanied a USSM-led delegation to sign an MoU with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) at the Prime Minister’s House.
Speaking about the MoU signing, US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker said, “This signing is yet another example of the strength of the US-Pakistan bilateral relationship that will benefit both countries.”
 






Speaking about the importance of such bilateral agreements, Baker said that US President Donald Trump’s administration has made forging such deals a key priority, based on the importance of critical mineral resources to American security and prosperity.
“We look forward to seeing future agreements between US companies and their counterparts in the critical minerals and mining sector in Pakistan.”
A statement from the PM House said that the USSM delegation is visiting  Pakistan to explore opportunities for expanding the country’s mining operations and assessing the potential for value addition in mineral resources and the development of supporting infrastructure.
“[The] delegation held high-level meetings with [the] prime minister of Pakistan, chief of army staff, minister of petroleum and minister of commerce and were briefed on Pakistan’s vast mineral reserves, including copper, gold, and rare earth elements,” the statement read.
“In this context, two Memoranda of Understanding, focusing on [the] development and processing of critical minerals, including rare earth elements (REEs), and logistics services, were signed.”
The second MoU was signed between the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan and Mota-Engil Group, a global leader in engineering and construction.
“The current survey of opportunities in Pakistan aims to identify priority markets where Mota-Engil can align with government visions and private sector initiatives. The group seeks to build long-term partnerships that leverage its global know-how while creating value locally through job creation, technology transfer, and sustainable development.”
According to the statement, the partnership will begin immediately with the export of readily available minerals from Pakistan, including antimony, copper, gold, tungsten and REEs.
“The first phase of this deal is envisaged at approximately $500m of investments into Pakistans critical minerals sector,” the statement read.
 






Pakistan’s relations with the US have been improving, with both nations recently signing trade deals. Islamabad successfully negotiated a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29 per cent to 19pc — after the two nations concluded a trade deal in July.
This was after Trump announced that the US had concluded a deal with Islamabad that would allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
In April this year, a senior US official had underscored Washington’s strategic interest in Pakistan’s mineral sector, signalling a push for long-term cooperation in the development of critical mineral resources key to American advanced technologies.
“Critical minerals are the raw materials necessary for our most advanced technologies,” Eric Meyer, senior bureau official for the Department of State’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, was quoted in a statement issued by the US embassy in Islamabad on his visit.</p><small>2025-09-08 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622643-four-sc-judges-boycott-cosmetic-full-court-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Four SC judges boycott 'cosmetic' full court meeting</strong></a><br><p>
