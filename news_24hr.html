A high-level team — consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister — arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations, the FO said in a statement today.
The delegation will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.
Ex-FMs PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua are members of the first delegation.
The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General António Gute­rres, the president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It will also address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.
In a post on X, Bilawal said he was carrying a “clear message” with him.
“Pakistan seeks peace with dignity, dialogue with purpose, and partnerships built on justice. The unresolved issue of Kashmir continues to threaten regional peace. Any aggression over shared water resources challenges not just Pakistan’s sovereignty, but global stability. We reject terrorism in all forms, yet oppose its misuse as a political tool to target Pakistan. Trade must become a bridge, not a battleground. It’s time for the world to engage, not ignore.”
 






The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.
Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will visit Moscow from June 2 to June 4, according to the FO.
During the visit, Fatemi is scheduled to hold meetings with senior Russian officials and also engage with the media and think tanks.
“The visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan’s perspective on the recent Indian aggression,” the FO statement read.
“The delegations will highlight Pakistan’s responsible and restrained conduct — seeking peace with responsibility — in the face of India’s reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.”
The delegations will also highlight that “dialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation”.
The statement read that the delegations will underscore the importance of the international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in the region, including the immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty.
“The delegations will engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora,” the FO said.
‘Strategic importance and not mere photo opportunities’
Separately, Senator Sherry Rehman said that the delegation led by the PPP chairman has already begun its US visit with a “packed schedule of high-level multilateral meetings in New York”.
 
 

In a statement, Rehman emphasised that the meetings will have strategic importance and not be “mere photo opportunities”.
She added that the country’s status as “a responsible and stable middle power” is being highlighted during the engagements, and that the country had a clear interest in “regional peace and security”.
“Adherence to international laws is part of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” Rehman said, adding that the “fabricated” Indian narrative against the country “will not be allowed to take the form of truth this time”.
“India has started using false terrorism allegations as justification for war. This trend cannot be allowed to become the norm,” she said, adding that the country would not be part of any Indian “film script”.
The PPP leader said, “Chairman Bilawal Bhutto has successfully presented Pakistan’s solid position on water, Kashmir and violations of international laws of war and peace.
“Pakistan, as a responsible nuclear state, believes in a broad and fair dialogue based on peace,” she added.</p><small>2025-06-02 14:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02190353cc73b48.jpg?r=190445' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915005/pakistan-to-play-matches-in-sri-lanka-as-icc-announces-dates-venues-for-2025-womens-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to play matches in Sri Lanka as ICC announces dates, venues for 2025 Women’s World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday announced dates and venues for the 2025 Women’s Cricket World Cup, with Pakistan set to play its matches in Sri Lanka.
A press release issued today said the 13th edition of the eight-member tournament would run from September 30 to November 2.
The five stadiums being used include India’s Chinnaswamy Stadium (Bengaluru), ACA Stadium (Guwahati), Holkar Stadium (Indore) and ACA-VDCA Stadium (Visakhapatnam), and Sri Lanka’s R Premadasa Stadium (Colombo).

India will host the World Cup after 12 years and play against Bangladesh in the opening match in Bengaluru.
The venues for the knockouts are dependent on Pakistan qualifying, as two alternative venues have been identified for one semifinal and the final, the ICC said.
The final will be held either in Bengaluru or Colombo on Nov 2, the first semifinal in either Guwahati or Colombo on Oct 29 and the second semifinal in Bengaluru on Oct 30.
Colombo will be the venue for the first semifinal and the final only if Pakistan qualify for those stages.
Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India would play all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
As per the compromise, Pakistan will play at a neutral venue in any ICC tournament hosted by India until 2027.
The eight teams that will feature in the World Cup are India, Australia, England, South Africa, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
Australia will enter the event as the reigning champions, having defeated England in the final of the most recent Women’s World Cup in New Zealand in 2022.
They are also the most successful team in tournament history, having been crowned champions on seven occasions.
ICC Chairman Jay Shah reiterated the governing body’s commitment to the women’s game.
“Fans have shown great support for the women’s game in recent years, and I am sure they will start planning for these showpiece events now that they have key dates and venues,” he said.
“Women’s cricket stands at the forefront of our vision, and we are confident that these two upcoming tournaments will not only sustain the incredible momentum we’ve built in recent years but lift it to greater heights.”
Pakistan qualified for the World Cup when they beat Thailand by 87 runs during the ICC Women’s World Cup 2025 Qualifiers in Lahore in April.</p><small>2025-06-02 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02162751957536b.jpg?r=163224' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914985/russia-ukraine-swap-peace-roadmaps-at-istanbul-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Russia, Ukraine swap peace roadmaps at Istanbul talks</strong></a><br><p>Russia and Ukraine on Monday swapped plans for ending their three-year war during talks in Istanbul aiming to find a way out of Europe’s largest conflict since World War II.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said any deal must not “reward” Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but said Kyiv was willing to take the “necessary steps for peace”.
Urged on by US President Donald Trump, Moscow and Kyiv have opened direct negotiations for the first time since the early weeks of Russia’s invasion, but have yet to make progress towards an agreement.
Monday’s talks come a day after Ukraine carried out one of its most brazen and successful attacks ever on Russian soil — using drones to hit dozens of strategic bombers parked at airbases thousands of kilometres behind the front line.
A first round of meetings in Istanbul last month yielded a large-scale prisoner exchange but no pause in the fighting, which has raged since Russia invaded in February 2022.
On Monday, the delegations “exchanged documents through the Turkish side, and we are preparing a new release of prisoners of the war,” Zelensky said at a press conference in Vilnius just after the talks in Istanbul concluded.
“The key to lasting peace is clear, the aggressor must not receive any reward for war. Putin must get nothing that would justify his aggression,” he added.
Opening the talks at the Ciragan Palace in Istanbul — an Ottoman imperial house on the banks of the Bosphorus that is now a luxury five-star hotel — Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the “eyes of the entire world” were watching.
Zelensky had said Kyiv was “ready to take the necessary steps for peace”, though the Russian and Ukrainian negotiating positions have long appeared irreconcilable.
‘Immediate ceasefire’
“If they are ready to move forward, not just repeat the same previous ultimatums, then there may be good and big news today,” a source in the Ukrainian delegation said ahead of the talks.
Ukraine wants a “full and unconditional ceasefire” to allow space to then discuss a long-term settlement. Russia has repeatedly rejected those calls.
Moscow says it wants to address the “root causes” of the conflict — language typically used to refer to a mix of sweeping demands including limiting Ukraine’s military, banning the country from joining Nato and massive territorial concessions.
Kyiv and the West say those concerns are baseless and that Russia’s assault is nothing but an imperialist land grab.
Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia invaded, with swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine destroyed and millions forced to flee their homes, in Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II.
‘No home’
In the frontline town of Dobropillya in eastern Ukraine, 53-year-old Volodymyr told AFP that he believes the talks in Istanbul would amount to very little.
“We thought that everything would stop. And now there is nothing to wait for.
We have no home, nothing. We were almost killed by drones,” he said.
In Kramatorsk, a garrison city near the front with trenches and rolls of barbed wire on its outskirts, a Ukrainian serviceman also said the talks in Turkiye would not likely bring out about any results.
“I have no faith in them. But it would be great if they could agree to stop, to have some kind of respite, so that we could take our guys, those who died, and so that guys would just stop dying,” he told AFP, sipping a coffee.
After months of setbacks for Kyiv’s military, Ukraine said it had carried out an audacious attack on Sunday, damaging some 40 strategic Russian bombers worth $7 billion in a major special operation.
Kyiv’s security service said the plan — 18 months in the making — had involved smuggling drones into Russia, then launching them from near the airbases, thousands of kilometres away from the front lines.
On the ground, Russia’s territorial advance gained pace in May, according to AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
Ahead of the talks, Russian officials have called for Ukraine to be cut off from Western military support and cede territory still controlled by its army.
Kyiv has previously accepted it may only be able to get territory taken by Russia through diplomacy, not fighting.
Ukraine also wants concrete Western-backed security guarantees — like Nato protections or troops on the ground — that have been ruled out by Russia.</p><small>2025-06-02 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02122044793f02b.png?r=122300' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914954/karachi-residents-feel-more-low-intensity-tremors' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi residents feel more low-intensity tremors</strong></a><br><p>Another low-intensity earthquake was felt by Karachi residents on Monday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The tremor was the third within 24 hours.
The most recent quake measured 3.2 on the Richter scale with the city’s densely populated Quaidabad area as its epicentre. The area’s residents had also experienced a similar 3.6-magnitude tremor at 5:33pm yesterday.
Both earthquakes originated at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres beneath the surface.

A separate tremor originating near the city’s Gadap Town was recorded at 1:05am earlier today. It measured 3.2 on the Richter scale and had a depth of 12km.
Ameer Hyder, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office in Karachi, told Dawn.com that the tremors were caused by an active fault line in Landhi.
He noted that the quakes’ intensity was not high and was “gradually declining”. While stating that no formal prediction could be made yet, Hyder expected the tremors to end within a week.

Experts have previously pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
The country had witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
 
 

In April, jolts were felt in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — twice that month.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.

Images showed a massive grey cloud billow forth from the volcano on the island of Sicily, beginning about 11:24am local time (0924 GMT), according to the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV).
Surveillance cameras showed “a pyroclastic flow probably produced by a collapse of material from the northern flank of the Southeast Crater”, the agency said.
A pyroclastic flow occurs when volcanic rock, ash and hot gasses surge from volcanos. They are extremely dangerous.
The explosive activity “had transitioned to a lava fountain”, INGV said, with the plume of ash expected to dissipate towards the southwest.
A red alert issued for aviation authorities said the height of the volcanic cloud was estimated at 6.5 kilometres.

The government has adopted austerity measures for the upcoming budget — set to be announced on June 10 — in line with the demands of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to implement stricter spending policies and raise revenues to reduce the budget deficit and improve debt sustainability, as part of its $7 billion loan programme. The global money lender also expects Pakistan to achieve a 3.6 per cent economic growth with 7.7pc inflation next year.
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad after a meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee, the planning minister noted that since 2023, the development budget had decreased, stating that Pakistan was observing “tight financial discipline in order to balance spending and income” — a process he said had been agreed upon with the IMF.
“Pakistan has faced such severe inflation that the federal government would end up spending the money it collected from the provincial governments to pay off loans,” he explained.
“The reason we have these debts is because the govt in power between 2018 and 2022 took multiple loans and the policy rate rose to 23pc due to heavy inflation,” Iqbal added. “Repaying those loans became 55pc of our spending. As a result, this has affected our development budget.”
“Since resources are limited, we need to focus on high-priority projects for national development.  We need to ensure ‘value for money’ in selecting projects.
“Efficiency and prioritisation of investment are two important pillars to fulfil lack of resources,” the federal minister said earlier while addressing the committee meeting.
He said that fiscal space will be provided in the next PSDP for projects of strategic importance. He said efforts have been made to align the development budget with national priorities while staying within limited resources.
The minister recalled that when the PML-N was voted out of government in 2018, the defence and development budgets were Rs1 trillion each.
Breaking down the development budget, Iqbal said that Rs664bn would be allocated to infrastructure projects including energy, water, transport and planning.
“The energy, water and highway sectors will be prioritised,” he noted.
He added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered that Rs120bn of the Rs1 trillion development budget be allocated to upgrade the N-25 Highway in Balochistan, which runs from Chaman to Karachi through Quetta.
“The road will be upgraded to an expressway,” he said. “Excepting this project, we have Rs880bn with which we have to balance the PSDP (Public Sector Development Programme).”
Iqbal further said that special areas such as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan would receive Rs63bn, while the merged districts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa would receive Rs70bn.
“Science and IT (Information Technology) will receive Rs53bn, bodies performing institutional reform will get Rs9bn, while the production sector will receive Rs11bn. Altogether, this makes Rs1tr,” he outlined.
“Our guiding principle was to make sure that we prioritise projects for which we have rupee cover and foreign funding available,” Iqbal explained. “Those projects of national importance are protected. At the same time, projects in their advanced stages will also receive funding to achieve completion.
“We will move away from token allocation as it renders projects unhealthy,” he added, further stating that the government will try and ensure transparency through a comprehensive monitoring system where projects will be observed by satellite.
Outlining the government’s annual plan, Iqbal expected Pakistan’s GDP to grow by 4.2 per cent.
He added, “4.5pc of that will be agriculture, 4.3pc from industry and 4pc from services.”
The planning minister said that the country set a target of $35bn for its exports and $39bn for foreign remittances.
“Remittances reached $27bn in 2022-23 and can reach $37bn in 2024-25 — an increase of $10bn,” he said. “I want to thank overseas Pakistanis for ignoring negative calls and claims that ‘overseas Pakistanis are upset’ and calls for boycotts and continuing to send remittances.
“It is a very big contribution and it is like oxygen to us,” he added, stating that there is scope for remittance figures to climb to $50bn in the future.
Iqbal mentioned that Pakistan had among the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. “We are ranked among the lowest tax collectors in the world. The rate is hardly 10pc whereas developing countries ahead of us collect 16-18pc,” he said.
“If we are serious about the nation’s development, then tax collection, tax evasion, and tax reforms will have to be considered as an aspect of national security as the top most priority,” the minister asserted.
“Every citizen should be watchman against tax evasion,” adding that the government is taking action against those earning millions but not paying taxes. He urged tax paying citizens to cooperate with the government against evaders.
Iqbal mentioned that within the next five years, the government needs to raised large amount of resources to fulfill the development budget.
“Last fiscal year, we started with Rs1400 billion, but it was reduced to Rs1100 bn. This year it has further reduced to Rs1000 bn. I think this raises a huge question mark about our future and is a sign for concern,” the minister cautioned.
“To reverse this situation, we need to increase the tax collection by huge proportions.”
He said the federal government will hand over development projects by provinces to the provincial governments and focus on projects by the Centre, adding that such projects are a huge strain on resources.
He mentioned that the federal budget has projects devolved to provinces but still a responsibility of the federal government, adding such projects have “reduced the space” of the Centre.
“Till 2018, PSDP hardly had 12-14 pct provincial projects. Between 2012-2013, the federal government moved forward with record development projects.
“After 2018, provincial projects began to creep in. By 2022, when we came back (to power), they were around 40 pct.”
Iqbal said while selecting PSDP for the upcoming year, the government ensured that international projects or those linked with multi-lateral organisations should be provided rupee cover as the top most priority.
He said the government ensured that allocations of resources for regions such a Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir, and merged areas are protected and there is no deduction so their requirements are fulfilled.
He said the third priority was that projects 70-80 pct in completion phase are allocated huge sums so they are completed and “moved from the books and improve our portfolio” and do not incur further costs.
Furthermore, he said under Uraan Pakistan initiative, the government needs to ensure that projects of “strategic importance” are allocated sufficient funds. This includes funds for Diamer Basha dam which is vital to address the water crisis that the government will have to complete with speed.
For connectivity, he said projects like Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway, Quetta-Chaman road, and second phase of Karakoram highway need to be prioritised.
Iqbal called for allocating funds to incomplete projects of Higher Education Commission so that the youth are not affected.
“We need to increase tertiary education by three times. Pakistan already have the lowest ratio in the region. Our ratio is 13 pct, India has 30 pct, Bangladesh has 25 pct, and China has 60 pct. We need to increase it in the future,” he asserted.
Regarding projects on low priority that could be frozen or shut down, the minister said the government has identified 118 projects worth Rs1000bn that need to be placed on low priority or capped to save resources.</p><small>2025-06-02 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0217570709e810a.jpg?r=175856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914996/eight-injured-in-flamethrower-attack-on-israeli-hostage-protest-in-us' target='_blank'><strong>Eight injured in ‘flamethrower’ attack on Israeli hostage protest in US</strong></a><br><p>In the face of rising criticism of Israeli atrocities on Gaza, which has killed nearly 54,000 Palestinians, a man in the United States yelling “free Palestine” used incendiary devices to torch protesters rallying in support of Israeli hostages, injuring at least eight people in the US state of Colorado on Sunday.
The FBI said it was investigating the incident as a “targeted terror attack” and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.
He was booked into the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to county records. His bond has been set at $10 million.
The incident comes as pressure on Israel rises to cease what has been called a “genocide” in Gaza by the United Nations and Amnesty International among other international human rights organisations.
Police in the city of Boulder said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which took place shortly before 1:30pm (12:30am PKT) at a demonstration outside a mall.
The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said the “violent anti-Semitic attack” occurred at Sunday’s “Run for Their Lives” event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community in solidarity with hostages seized during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the onslaught in Gaza.
FBI agent Mark Michalek told reporters the attack happened at a “regularly scheduled weekly peaceful event”.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,” he said, adding that “the suspect was heard to yell: ‘Free Palestine!’”
Boulder Police said that eight victims, four men and four women aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals.
Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that “at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition.”
The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.
Molotov cocktails
In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.
He can be heard screaming “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.
Other images showed billowing black smoke.
Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt “very, very scared” after hearing about the attack near his workplace.
Sunday’s attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted “Free Palestine,” was arrested.
Boulder Police Chief Redfearn insisted it was “way too early to speculate motive,” but FBI chief Kash Patel described the incident as “a targeted terror attack”.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser labelled it “a hate crime”.
“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” Weiser said.
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that the suspect was a foreign national who “illegally overstayed [his] visa”.
Fox News and CBS both cited US officials as saying Soliman was an Egyptian national.
The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident.
‘Burning the streets’
Israel’s top diplomat Gideon Saar condemned Sunday’s “terrible anti-Semitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder”.
Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also described the Boulder incident as a “targeted terror attack,” while Attorney General Pam Bondi termed it “a horrific anti-Semitic attack”. Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle expressed revulsion.
“Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.”
Several organisations also decried the violence.
“This is an attack on all of us — and we will not stay silent,” the Israeli-American Council said in a statement.</p><small>2025-06-02 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021727529b6563d.png?r=172808' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914994/govt-announces-four-day-eidul-azha-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Govt announces four-day Eidul Azha holidays</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Monday announced a four-day public holiday on the festive occasion of Eidul Azha.
According to a notification issued by the Cabinet Division, the government has declared a public holiday from June 6-9, 2025 (Friday to Monday).
“The prime minister has been pleased to declare the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th (Friday to Monday) as public holidays on the occasion of Eidul Azha,” the statement said.
Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7, the moon sighting Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) announced last month after the crescent for the month of Zilhaj was not sighted.
The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its office.
Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”
He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.
Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to see the moon. Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.
Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-06-02 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021605225736bd3.jpg?r=160711' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914964/main-suspect-held-after-video-of-citizen-being-assaulted-in-karachis-dha-goes-viral' target='_blank'><strong>Main suspect held after video of citizen being assaulted in Karachi’s DHA goes viral</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi police on Monday arrested a main suspect along with his two employees over charges of beating a citizen in the city’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The development came after a video of the incident went viral on social media earlier today, prompting authorities to take notice of it.
The man, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said in a statement.
The man, travelling in a luxury car, allegedly subjected a bike rider, who was accompanied by a woman, to torture on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad road after a minor accident.
Earlier today, the police had arrested the suspect’s driver and guard during late-night raids on his home and office in DHA. DIG Raza clarified that the held suspect was not a government employee.
Stating that the citizen who was subjected to violence had not approached the police to file a complaint, the DIG said the police were trying to contact his family.
Meanwhile, the Gizri police registered a first information report (FIR) against the suspect, his armed guard and driver on complaint of a citizen named Mohammad Saleem under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506-B (threat to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Other PPC sections invoked included 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).
According to the FIR, Saleem identified himself as a cell manager of a cellular company. The complainant said he had gone to Ittehad Commercial for recovery at around 8:35pm on Sunday when a minor accident took place between the bike rider and a Land Cruiser.
 
 

The complainant said Farooqi put the bike rider hostage at gunpoint inside his vehicle, after which he beat him, used abusive language and threatened him.
He added that the woman pleaded with the vehicle owner but he pushed her back with contempt.
DIG Raza said the police were taking the issue “extremely seriously” and that an investigation has been launched. He asserted that no one was above the law and vowed to promise “complete justice” to the aggrieved citizen.
“The suspects involved in the torture would be brought to justice and all requirements of justice would be fulfilled. The law is equal for all, and there is no exception,” he said.
Meanwhile, both Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar and Karachi Additional IG Javed Alam Odho directed the South senior superintendent of police to submit a detailed report on the incident.
They further ordered him to take action against the culprits, as no one was above the law.
In another road rage incident in Lahore in March, armed guards of a private security company reportedly fired shots at a car rider at Dharampura Underpass, thrashed him and fled the scene, leaving a vehicle and some weapons on the spot.
In October last year, three men were held for their alleged involvement in assaulting women during a quarrel at a restaurant in DHA.

On a month-on-month basis, it decreased by 0.2pc in May as compared to a decrease of 0.8pc in the previous month, according to data.
This was higher than the finance ministry’s expectations, which had anticipated inflationary outlook to “remain between 1.5-2.0pc in May, with a possible rise to 3.0-4.0pc by June”.
The finance ministry had depicted a cautious outlook towards growth in Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), presenting a rising trajectory for inflation during May and June.
Topline Securities, in a note, said that inflation during 11MFY25 had averaged at 4.61pc compared to 24.52pc in 11MFY24.

“Iran is drafting a negative response to the US proposal, which could be interpreted as a rejection of the US offer,” the senior diplomat, who is close to Iran’s negotiating team, told Reuters.
The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who was on a short visit to Tehran and has been mediating nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington.
But after five rounds of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to resolve the nuclear standoff, many issues remain unresolved.
Among clashing red lines is Iran’s rejection of a US demand that Tehran commit to scrapping uranium enrichment, viewed as a potential pathway to developing nuclear bombs.
Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
“In this proposal, the US stance on enrichment on Iranian soil remains unchanged, and there is no clear explanation regarding the lifting of sanctions,” said the diplomat, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Tehran demands the immediate removal of all US-imposed curbs that impair its oil-based economy. But for the US, the removal of nuclear-related sanctions should be done in phases.
Dozens of Iranian institutions vital to Iran’s economy, including its central bank and national oil company, have been sanctioned since 2018 for, according to Washington, “supporting terrorism or weapons proliferation”.
Trump’s revival of a “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since his return to the White House in January has included tightened sanctions and threats to bomb Iran if current negotiations yield no deal.
During his first term, Trump in 2018 ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. In return, Tehran has rapidly violated the 2015 nuclear pact’s curbs on its nuclear programme.
The 2015 deal required Iran to take steps to restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from US, EU and UN economic sanctions.
The diplomat said the assessment of “Iran’s nuclear negotiations committee”, under the supervision of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was that the US proposal is “completely one-sided” and cannot serve Tehran’s interests.
Therefore, the diplomat said, Tehran considers this proposal a “non-starter” and believes it unilaterally attempts to impose a “bad deal” on Iran through excessive demands.
Two Iranian officials told Reuters last week that Iran may pause uranium enrichment if the US releases frozen Iranian funds and recognises Tehran’s right to refine uranium for civilian use under a “political deal” that could lead to a broader nuclear accord.</p><small>2025-06-02 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607369-man-poisons-children-takes-own-life-after-failing-to-afford-eid-clothes' target='_blank'><strong>Man poisons children, takes own life after failing to afford Eid clothes</strong></a><br><p>

DAWN has taken up the matter of the impersonated images with the relevant authorities. All news stories by DAWN will appear on its website or can be checked on its official social media accounts:

Instagram: @dawn.today

Facebook: Dawn.com

X: @dawn_com


Doctored images
The earliest known such image spotted this year was of former caretaker foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani with the following headline in upper case: “THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST JALIL ABBAS JILANI HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED!”
 


Immediately, the image presents stark differences when compared with articles on DAWN.com.
 



The doctored image’s headline is centred, whereas DAWN’s headlines are left-aligned

The doctored image’s headline is in uppercase, whereas DAWN’s headlines follow sentence case

DAWN does not use different colours to highlight parts of its headlines, unlike the doctored image
Viewed on a desktop, the headline is followed by the author byline, dateline and social media plugins before the picture, whereas these elements are missing in the doctored image
There is no attribution or detail in the headline of the doctored image as to whose allegations or what types of allegations were confirmed by whom

The former foreign minister was the subject of another similar hoax article that was also shared as a sponsored ad with the following title: “Pakistan central bank sues Jalil Abbas Jilani for his remarks on live TV show”.
 


This doctored image also presents several discrepancies that can tip readers off to the fact that it’s not a genuine article on DAWN.

The author byline, dateline and social media plugins remain missing
DAWN does not overlay text over images in its articles
A Pakistani publication does not need to tell its readers that the central bank is Pakistan’s. It will either use the State Bank of Pakistan or central bank to refer to it. This may be verified in DAWN’s print and web stories.
The intro for a typical DAWN article does not begin how the intro in the doctored story does; it is crucially missing key information related to the what, when and how of the scenario
The text does not build on itself to deliver new information as a typical news story does, but repeats the same information in rephrased ways

The Ministry of Information had fact-checked both alleged reports in a post on X on March 13, denouncing them as fake.
 






More recently on May 1, an alleged screenshot of DAWN.com was shared by an Indian account on X with the following title: “Fears Mount Over F-16 Security After Aircraft Theft Linked to TTP”, claiming that the news outlet had reported that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group had stolen an F-16 fighter jet of the Pakistan Air Force.
Among others, doctored screenshots of alleged stories on PTI founder Imran Khan and the army chief were also widely shared.
 


Comparing the screenshot with an image of a report from DAWN’s official website showed the same glaring error as mentioned above, of the headline written in uppercase, unlike the outlet’s normal style.
The spacing between the headline and byline is also noticeably larger than the consistent format seen on DAWN.com.
 


The viral screenshot was also fact-checked by iVerify Pakistan.
More tips to spot fakes
Apart from the format issues identified above through comparing doctored screenshots with genuine articles, here are more tips that can help you determine fake or doctored DAWN articles.
1. Perform a keyword search
If in doubt, perform a keyword search using the main elements from a headline. If true, the results will either bring up the authentic DAWN article or similar reports from other publications on the same development.
If the search yields nothing, then that viral image or story you saw is more likely to be fake.
2. Specific DAWN website keyword search
For a more specific keyword search, showing only results from DAWN’s website, perform the following:

Enter the following format on your search engine: “Name of article site:Dawn.com”
The results will only yield relevant articles and reports from the DAWN website
If the story is authentic, it will likely pop up in the first hit

3. Check archives
Depending on whether or not the doctored images and stories have datelines to go with them, as in the fake F-16 story above, you can corroborate whether DAWN actually published such a story. Here’s how:

Go to the Dawn.com homepage

Click on the ARCHIVE section in the top bar
Select the date on the calendar for which you want to see all stories published

Performing the above for the F-16 story yielded no such report on the news outlet’s website for May 1, 2025.
Pattern of repetition
These were not the first attempts to mislead the public by circulating fake news using the DAWN brand.
In April 2020, a fake social media post doctored to pose as DAWN.com surfaced on Facebook and Instagram, attempting to mislead the public by suggesting that then-army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa had been “possibly infected” with Covid-19 and falsely claimed that he was under self-quarantine.
In October 2018, another fake screenshot of a news story attempted to mislead the public by suggesting that PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz was expecting and falsely claimed that “DAWN news” had obtained her medical reports.
Earlier in August that year, yet another screenshot of a fake news story falsified to look like an article on DAWN.com had surfaced on social media, in an attempt to mislead the public by implying that then-PTI leader Faisal Vawda had withdrawn a petition against the alleged corruption of Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar.
In a similar occurrence, in June 2018, a fake Facebook post screenshot doctored to pose as DAWN.com was shared on social media. It attempted to misinform the public and stakeholders by suggesting that Afghanistan had accepted the Durand Line as an official border.
The doctored image led the Afghan National Security Council to issue a press release that mistakenly assumed the post was legitimate.</p><small>2025-06-02 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02132416a4f29e1.png?r=132538' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914953/pml-ns-hina-arshad-secures-punjab-assembly-seat-in-sialkot-polls-marred-by-rigging-claims' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N’s Hina Arshad secures Punjab Assembly seat in Sialkot polls marred by rigging claims</strong></a><br><p>PML-N’s Hina Arshad Warraich secured a Punjab Assembly seat (PP-52) in Sialkot by a wide margin amid rigging allegations by the PTI, according to preliminary results issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday.
The by-election for PP-52 (Sambrial) took place yesterday, two months after the seat had fallen vacant following the demise of PML-N MPA Arshad Javed Warraich — father of the winning candidate.
Analysts had expected a tough one-on-one contest between the ruling PML-N and the PTI-backed aspirants, whereas the PPP had also been running an aggressive campaign in Sambrial to perform better in the race.
According to Form-47 issued by the ECP today and signed by Returning Officer Muhammad Iqbal, Warraich clinched the seat by winning 78,702 votes.
Warraich’s main opponent, Fakhir Nashat Ghumman, who was an independent candidate backed by the PTI, was the runner-up with 39,018 votes.
PPP’s Raheel Kamran Cheema ranked third with 6,832 ballots cast in his favour, followed by Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s Muhammad Shafaqat with 4,851 votes.
The balloting had remained peaceful throughout yesterday, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram accused the Punjab government and the police of interfering in the by-election, alleging that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.
 






However, Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.
The local administration, apparently for security reasons, had placed containers in front of the RO office — a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the office in Sambrial.
PPP leader and ex-premier Raja Pervaiz Ashraf also added to the PTI’s rigging allegations.
Speaking to the media in Sambrial yesterday, flanked by PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza, Ashraf claimed polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.
The ex-premier said it would be unfortunate if the results were changed, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said it was not tolerable that rigging took place during the by-election.
 






The ECP had set up 185 polling stations, categorising 11 as highly sensitive, 38 as sensitive, and 136 as normal. A total of 1,696 officers and staff had been deployed to perform election duties across these stations.
The total number of registered voters in PP-52 was 297,185, including 157,725 male voters and 139,460 female voters.
The voter turnout was recorded as 44.79 per cent, with a total of 133,096 ballots cast, out of which 130,837 were counted as submitted in the right manner.
Elected to serve, says  Hina Warraich
After her victory, Warraich told Dawn.com: “This is not just my victory — it is the victory of the people of Sambrial. They did not elect me for politics but for service, and I will do my utmost to live up to their expectations.”
The PML-N leader went on to thank Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, adding that her support helped her. Warraich had served as chairperson of the Sialkot district council from 2016 to 2020.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the victory, congratulating Warraich.
“Thanks to the unbreakable bond between the leadership and the workers, PML-N continues to reflect the will of the people,” the premier asserted in a post on X.
He credited the victory to the unwavering leadership of PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam, as well as the dedication of his party workers.
 






In a statement, CM Maryam also felicitated Warraich on her success. “Thanks to the people of Sambrial for once again placing their trust in PML-N,” she said.
“This victory is a validation of our policies. The public has sent a clear message that they want progress, service, and stability,” she said.
The chief minister stressed her government was actively working for public welfare in every constituency, pledging that those efforts would now be further accelerated.
“We will live up to the trust the people of Sambrial have shown in us,” CM Maryam was quoted as saying by her party.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to a first information report (FIR) registered at the local police station, the incident occurred on Sunday when unknown armed men opened fire on a polio team in the village of Sheikho in Tangir Valley, the constituency of GB’s Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan.
However, the polio team remained safe.
According to the FIR, as soon as the polio vaccination team returned to Sheikho village after completing their duties, two unknown armed men stopped the team’s vehicle at the RCC bridge.
“You all are ruining the environment here by bringing [unveiled] women from Gilgit in the name of the polio campaign.
“If you do this again, you won’t be able to escape,” they said before shooting at the polio team vehicle, which sustained a punctured tire. The armed men then fled towards a nearby hill.
The incident occurred at 1:45pm, according to the FIR.
According to GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, the chief minister  has taken notice of the incident and has directed strict action.
The polio monitoring team had been shifted to a safe place immediately after the incident, Faraq said.
He said the polio team went to the area “without informing the police”, leading to the “unfortunate” incident.
First polio case reported in GB
The first case of wild poliovirus has been reported in GB, bringing the national total to 11 this year, as the country continues to battle the debilitating disease.
The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health in Islamabad confirmed the new case of wild poliovirus in GB’s Diamer district.
While providing details on the case, GB Health Secretary Asifullah Khan said a 23-month-old child was diagnosed with poliovirus in Diamer’s Tangir area.
He said that the child has not travelled outside the area, however, the virus strain has been confirmed to originate from Karachi’s Liaquatabad area.
Asifullah observed that there was a record of administering polio drops to the child. However, he added that the child was not provided with the vaccines to be given immediately after birth.
To a question, the health secretary said that the department has not announced the detection of poliovirus to the public, but the case has been confirmed.
This is the first case of wild poliovirus reported from GB and the 11th confirmed case in Pakistan this year, said a statement by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme.
The third nationwide polio vaccination campaign of 2025, which began on 26 May, concluded yesterday, successfully reaching over 45 million children under five years of age across 159 districts, including high-risk areas of the country.
The programme called on all parents to ensure their children do not miss out on any opportunity to receive polio drops.
Before the latest case, there had been no reported cases of poliovirus in GB and the region was declared a polio-free zone.
Polio is a highly infectious and debilitating disease with no cure. The only way to protect children is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for all children under five, as well as the timely completion of all vaccines offered as part of the essential immunisation schedule.
Last year, the country reported more than 70 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
This year’s first nationwide polio vaccination campaign was held in February, followed by a fractional IPV-OPV Polio (injectable polio vaccine) campaign in Quetta and Karachi on Feb 20 and 22, respectively. Around one million children were targeted for vaccination in this campaign.</p><small>2025-06-02 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02140000d3b6cd1.png?r=140115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914967/australias-glenn-maxwell-quits-odis-to-focus-on-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Australia’s Glenn Maxwell quits ODIs to focus on T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has retired from one-day internationals to focus on next year’s T20 World Cup, the country’s cricket board said on Monday.
Maxwell took the decision to prioritise his preparation for the T20 World Cup, to be held in India and Sri Lanka, and his commitment to franchise leagues, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement.
“I think back to right at the start I was picked ahead of my time and out of the blue. I was just proud just to be playing a couple of games for Australia. I thought I was just going to have that,” the two-time World Cup winner said in the statement.
“Since then, I have been able to go through the up and downs of being dropped, being brought back, playing in a few World Cups and being a part of some great teams.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The 36-year-old has played 149 ODIs for Australia, scoring 3,990 runs at a strike rate of 126.7 — second only to Andre Russell’s 130.22.
Maxwell’s 201 not out from 128 balls while battling cramps in a 2023 World Cup match against Afghanistan is considered the greatest knock in this format.
Maxwell, who played the last of his seven tests in 2017, told the Final Word Podcast that the toll of 50-overs cricket, especially after a leg injury he suffered in 2022, affected his fielding ability during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.
“I felt like I was letting the team down a little bit with how (the) body was reacting to the conditions,” he said.
“I had a good chat with (chairman of selectors) George Bailey and I asked him what his thoughts were going forward,” he told the Final Word Podcast.
“We talked about the 2027 World Cup and I said to him ‘I dont think I am going to make that, its time to start planning for people in my position to have a crack at it and make the position their own’.”
CA chief executive Todd Greenberg congratulated Maxwell for “one of the most exciting and influential one day international careers in the format’s history”.
“Glenns ballistic batting has lit up the cricket world and been one of the cornerstones of Australias continued success in the 50 over game, including his heroic role in the 2023 World Cup triumph,” Greenberg said.
 






South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen announces immediate retirement from cricket
South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen on Monday announced his immediate retirement from international cricket, bringing an end to a distinguished seven-year career with the Proteas Men, the national cricket team said in a statement on X.
The 33-year-old announced on Monday that he would be stepping away from the white-ball formats, which follows his retirement from red-ball cricket in 2024.
Klaasen made his ODI and T20I debuts in the summer of 2018, and went on to establish himself as one of the most destructive white-ball players of his generation.
“He has played 60 ODIs and amassed over 2 000 runs at an average of just under 44 in the middle order,” Proteas Men said.
“His power-hitting prowess was on full display during a blistering career-best 174 against Australia at his home ground, SuperSport Park, in 2023 — the second highest score ever recorded by a number five.
Renowned for his dominance against spin, Klaasen also represented South Africa in 58 T20Is, striking at a rate of 141.84, Proteas Men said.
“His ability to take on bowling attacks with calculated aggression made him a mainstay in South Africa’s limited-overs setup.”</p><small>2025-06-02 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02134542ef9ebdf.jpg?r=142231' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914963/french-police-detain-dozens-more-in-wake-of-psg-celebrations' target='_blank'><strong>French police detain dozens more in wake of PSG celebrations</strong></a><br><p>French authorities detained 79 people in the second such wave of arrests during celebrations following Paris Saint-Germain’s Champions League win, a police chief said on Monday.
The PSG thrashed Inter Milan by a record 5-0 in Saturday evening’s final in Munich, flying back to Paris on Sunday for a triumphal parade along the Champs-Élysées, then celebrations in a packed Parc des Princes stadium on the edge of the French capital.
The PSG winning the biggest prize in European club football for the first time sparked delirious festivities in France, but was marred by violence.
On Sunday, “we saw a resurgence of individuals driven by malicious intent who were not really PSG supporters”, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told RTL radio.
“We arrested 79 people, some of them in the night,” he said, adding that order had been restored before dawn.
 


Some were detained for taking barriers and briefly blocking the ring road around Paris, while others had tried to vandalise businesses or light fireworks on the Champs-Élysées, he said.
On Saturday night, police had made more than 500 arrests across France, the interior ministry said, after more than 200 cars were torched and police clashed with youths.

The 42-year-old, an admirer of US President Donald Trump, scored 50.89 per cent of votes in Sunday’s runoff, the national election commission said.
His 53-year-old rival Rafal Trzaskowski, Warsaw’s pro-EU mayor and an ally of the country’s centrist government, won 49.11pc in the highly polarised Nato and EU nation.
“Congratulations to the winner!” outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda said on X.
Duda, who had endorsed Nawrocki, thanked Poles for “carrying out your civic duty” and for the turnout, which was 71.63pc.
The results followed a tense evening as both candidates had claimed victory when an exit poll indicated they were neck and neck.
“We will win and we will save Poland,” Nawrocki told a crowd of supporters at his election night rally in Warsaw soon after polling stations closed.
Nawrocki’s win will block the government’s progressive agenda for abortion and LGBTQ rights and could revive tensions with Brussels over rule of law issues.
It could also undermine strong ties with neighbouring Ukraine as he is critical of Kyiv’s EU and Nato accession plans and wants to cut benefits for Ukrainian refugees.
Nawrocki visited the White House during his campaign and said he had been told by Trump: “You will win.”
US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem also endorsed Nawrocki when she attended a conservative conference in Poland last week, saying: “He needs to be the next president.”
‘Catholic values’
Polish presidents have some influence over foreign and defence policy and wield veto power over legislation, which can only be overturned by a three-fifths majority in parliament, which the government does not have.
Reforms planned by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a former European Council president who came to power in 2023, have been held up by a deadlock with the current president.
Many Nawrocki supporters said they want stricter curbs on immigration and advocate conservative social values and more sovereignty for the country within the European Union.
“Catholic values are important to me. I know he shares them,” Warsaw pensioner Lila Chojecka, 60, told AFP as she came to cast her ballot for Nawrocki.
Trzaskowski voters tend to back greater integration within the EU and an acceleration of social reforms.
Trzaskowski supports introducing civil partnerships for same-sex couples and easing Poland’s near-total ban on abortion.
Malgorzata Wojciechowska, a tour guide and teacher in her fifties, said Polish women “unfortunately do not have the same rights as our European friends”.
Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at the University of Warsaw, called the election “a real clash of civilisations”.
Campaign controversies
Nawrocki’s victory is likely to embolden the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023.
Some analysts have predicted it could lead to fresh parliamentary elections if political deadlock with the government persists.
Nawrocki’s campaign was overshadowed at times by controversies over the circumstances in which he bought an apartment from an elderly man and his football hooligan past.
A former amateur boxer, Nawrocki also strongly denied media reports in the last days of the campaign that he had procured sex workers while working as a security guard at a hotel.
His opposition to Ukraine’s Nato membership also brought heavy criticism from Ukrainian officials.
Nawrocki used his last campaign hours on Friday to leave flowers at a monument to Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II.
“It was a genocide against the Polish people,” he said.
Poland is an EU and Nato member and a fast-growing economy of 38 million people with a leading role in international diplomacy surrounding Ukraine.
It is also a key supply route for Western arms and aid going into Ukraine.</p><small>2025-06-02 09:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021345262ba1acf.jpg?r=134946' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914966/death-toll-after-heavy-floods-rises-to-34-in-indias-northeast' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll after heavy floods rises to 34 in India’s northeast</strong></a><br><p>At least 34 people have died in India’s northeastern region after heavy floods caused landslides over the last four days, authorities and media said on Monday, while the weather department has predicted more heavy rain.

India’s northeast and Bangladesh are prone to torrential rains that set off deadly landslides and flash floods, affecting millions of people every year.
Roads and houses in Assam’s Silchar city were flooded, visuals from news agency ANI showed, and fallen trees littered the roads.
“We are facing a lot of challenges. I have a child, their bed is submerged in water. What will we do in such a situation? We keep ourselves awake throughout the night,” Sonu Devi, a resident of Silchar, told ANI.

The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait, where migrants represent a sizable share of the workforce, lie in one of the planet’s hottest regions where summer temperatures often edge towards 50 degrees Celsius.
“Every summer reveals that the climate crisis aggravates the occupational health and safety catastrophe for the millions of migrant workers dangerously exposed to extreme heat,” said Michael Page, HRW’s deputy Middle East director.
“Because Gulf states are dragging their feet on evidence-based labour protections, migrant workers are unnecessarily dying, experiencing kidney failure, and suffering from other chronic illnesses,” he added.
The wealthy Gulf states rely heavily on millions of migrant workers, particularly in construction, the majority of whom hail from India and Pakistan. Last month, the UAE breached its May temperature record for the second day in a row, hitting 51.6 degrees Celsius.
 
 

To protect labourers, the states ban work under direct sunlight and in open-air areas at peak heat hours from mid-June until mid-September as part of a longstanding “midday break” policy.
But with the Gulf particularly vulnerable to climate change, HRW said  “these extreme heat conditions are now more frequent and earlier, in May”, before the midday break comes into effect.
A electrician in Kuwait interviewed by the New York-based rights group said he would feel  “dizziness, vomiting, head pain, and blurry vision many times,” working during the summer months and  “many people fall down because of heat”.
HRW urged authorities and businesses to move away from  “calendar-based midday bans,” to risk-based measures to gauge occupational heat stress.
Scientists have shown that recurring heatwaves are a clear marker of global warming and that these heatwaves are set to become more frequent, longer and more intense.
The number of extremely hot days has nearly doubled globally in the past three decades.
According to a 2024 report from the International Labour Organisation, a United Nations agency, outdoor workers in Arab states face some of the highest exposure to heat stress in the world, with 83.6 percent suffering from excessive heat exposure on the job.

The Foreign Office issued a statement today after a flurry of antagonistic statements made by Indian leaders, including one made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson on May 29 where he stated that talks on the Kashmir dispute will only be held “when Pakistan hands over [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] to us”.
 






Responding to the antagonistic remarks, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Any attempt to portray Pakistan as the source of regional instability is divorced from reality.
“The international community is well aware of India’s record of aggressive behavior, including documented support for terrorist activities within Pakistan,” he stated, adding that those facts could not be “obscured by hollow narratives or diversionary tactics”.
 
 

He reiterated that the Kashmir dispute remained a “core issue threatening peace and stability in the region” and the country will continue to advocate for a “just and lasting resolution to the Kashmir dispute in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.
He noted that the remarks made on the Indian side “underscored the utter futility of jingoism and coercion”, and that India will not be able to achieve its objectives through threats.
“Pakistan remains committed to peace and constructive engagement, but it is equally resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression,” he stated.
The spokesperson emphasised that peace in the region demanded “maturity, restraint, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflict”.</p><small>2025-06-02 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021109393c34de4.jpg?r=111234' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914813/rising-electricity-rates-tax-burden-still-concerns-citizens-report' target='_blank'><strong>Rising electricity rates, tax burden still concerns citizens: report</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: While economic concerns continue to ease, rising electricity prices and the tax burden remain worrying for more Pakistanis.
This was the crux of the Consumer Confidence Index for the second quarter of the current year conducted by research company Ipsos. The survey was carried out across the country with over 1,000 people interviewed via telephone.
When asked about the most worrying issues, the respondents cited electricity bills and continuously increasing taxes.
However, the findings showed that two in five Pakistanis believed the country was on the right track. Optimism was at its peak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa followed by Punjab - higher among rural population and middle-income groups.
The report claimed that optimism had increased sharply in last couple of years, now breaking all records, reaching the ever highest in six years. Moreover, three in 10 Pakistanis believed that the country’s economic condition was strong. Current perceptions of economy being strong are ever highest since August 2019.
It claimed that one in five Pakistanis now feels more comfortable while meeting household expenses than a year ago. There is even better feeling in rural citizens.
The survey report added that one in five Pakistanis was now comfortable in making daily household purchases and this ratio nearly doubled in the last one year.
Replying to a question about the future, two in five Pakistanis expected that the economy will get stronger in next six months, with Punjab (41pc) and lower-middle class (43pc) being most optimistic. It is the first time in the last six years that optimism about local economic conditions has just overtaken pessimism.
 
 

More than one in three Pakistanis also expected their personal financial conditions would get stronger in the next six months. Women and young citizens were more optimistic. While one-fourth Pakistanis feel confident to invest in future, reaching ever highest in six years, confidence in the ability to make major purchases jumped to 17pc from mere 1pc a couple of years ago.
According to the report, three in 10 Pakistanis felt secure about jobs with rural people and middle-income groups and youth being more secure. Confidence in job security has attained its best level since 2019.
Comparison with other countries
Over the last one quarter, Pakistan observed a positive change (4 pts) in Global Consumer Confidence Index.
With constant improvements in the last quarter, Pakistan maintains its position above Türkiye in rankings, but well below other similar countries such as China, India, Brazil, South Africa and the global average.

LAHORE: President Asif Ali Zardari greets PM Shehbaz Sharif ahead of their meeting at Governor’s House.—White Star

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari met on Sunday to discuss the political climate and security challenges facing the country, and vowed to cement the coalition bond in the ‘national interest’.
PM Shehbaz met President Zardari at Governor House in Lahore, where both leaders also discussed the upcoming federal budget along with political situation in the country.
 






“Political allies need to move forward together in the national interest,” an official release quoted PM Shehbaz as saying.
He emphasised the need for unity among all coalition partners, including PML-N and PPP.
During the meeting, the leaders held wide-ranging discussions on national affairs, including the prevailing political and security situation in the country.

Army chief vows to crush enemy’s nefarious designs in Balochistan

The participants also reviewed the outcome of the prime minister’s recent visit to friendly nations and their significance for Pakistan’s foreign relations.
The meeting was also attended by National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
People-friendly budget
President Zardari, while highlighting the importance of public welfare, urged the government to take practical and impactful steps in the upcoming budget to provide relief to the common man.
“The government must take measures in the upcoming budget to provide relief to the common man,” he added.
A source in the PMO said the premier also apprised President Zardari about his visit to Quetta along with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and their meeting with a grand jirga of the elders of Balochistan’s different tribes and clans.
PM Shehbaz expressed the hope that the meeting with jirga will bear fruit and help restore peace in the province.
Earlier, Field Marshal Munir, in his address at the jirga, vowed to “crush” terrorists in Balochistan, stating that India’s involvement in terrorist activities in the province was “no longer hidden”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
The grand jirga was organised in Quetta a day earlier to interact with tribal leadership and discuss the evolving security situation in Balochistan, with focus on terrorists receiving support from India.
Reaffirming that the enemy’s “nefarious designs will fail”, the field marshal said Pakistan has concrete evidence of India’s involvement with terrorist networks in Balochistan.

• All fuel stations may be legally required to offer digital payment modes
• Manufacturers, importers may charge extra 2pc GST on cash sales
• Emphasis will be on low-cost digital options instead of costlier POS systems
• Minor tax rate cut expected for salaried class
ISLAMABAD: As part of its strategic direction to declare ‘war on cash’, the federal government is likely to introduce differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital payments across various sectors, including fuel pricing, in the upcoming budget.
This is going to be the most crucial step among many other things that Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has been hinting at in recent days and may unveil during his budget speech on June 10.
According to sources, the next year’s budget would also be envisaging lower tax rate on the salaried class — though by a tiny margin of 1 to 1.5 percentage points — under strict directions of the prime minister to give a message that the government is at least beginning to ease burden where tax rates are too high, even if it is unable to reduce them significantly.
Sources also said that policymakers had already been working on the technical and administrative aspects of the move to support the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), which has failed miserably so far to document retail businesses in a manner that could yield revenue outcomes over the past two decades, despite repeated attempts and models.
 
 

The finance minister is believed to have held at least three successive consultative sessions with the FBR, the Ministry of Petroleum, banks, financial institutions, and a few hired or co-opted consultancy firms to explore technical solutions.
The campaign against the cash-based economy would work both ways — from top-down and bottom-up — to encourage and compel both consumers and businesses to reduce costs for documented transactions and increase expenses for cash. It aims to gradually shift the economy from low-cash to eventually cashless, where technically feasible.
An official said that all petrol pumps across the country — from Chaman to Khyber and Karachi to Azad Kashmir — would be required by law to provide digital options, including QR codes, debit and credit cards, and mobile payment services, in addition to cash.
The government-notified petroleum prices would apply only to digital transactions, while cash sales would involve an additional cost of about Rs2-3 per litre.
Consumers would be free to conduct cash transactions at a higher rate, but would be encouraged to opt for digital payments instead.
“This is a regulated environment and implementable at the outset,” the official said, adding that this would also help track petroleum supplies from borders and ports to refineries and depots.
On the other hand, importers and manufacturers would have to charge a standard 18 per cent general sales tax on digital payments from their suppliers or retailers, with an additional 2pc GST applicable on sales settled in cash.
Extra cost
“If wholesalers, distributors and retailers are ready to pay higher tax and their customers are willing to absorb the additional cost, it’s their choice, but it will involve substantial finances,” an official said.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial, when approached for comment, said only: “We must move towards a cashless economy,” but declined to elaborate ahead of the budget announcement.
Sources said the new initiative might appear synonymous with the filer and non-filer categories for banking transactions — a policy that did not yield desired results given its limited scope. However, the new policy is likely to have far greater outreach, capturing even small and informal business transactions through a carrot-and-stick approach.
The Finance Bill 2025-26 would provide a piece of legislation under which every business — big or small — would be required to offer cash and digital options. The cash transaction would carry an additional tax or fee compared to digital payments.
Unlike digital options like point-of-sale systems, which involve additional expenditure in the form of POS machines, payments under the upcoming scheme will also be available through simple QR codes and other digital solutions. Countries like India, Indonesia, and Bangla­desh have reportedly achieved landmark successes in this regard.
Another official said the FBR has been unable to persuade major businesses — including event managers, jewellers, marriage halls, and many professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and beauty salons — to shift away from cash to digital solutions.
At a pre-budget meeting last week, Finance Minister Aurangzeb promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and the documented sector to others through digitisation. He hinted at significant steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
At a public event the same week, he also announced that the upcoming federal budget would introduce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction.
Earlier, he announced the government’s “war on cash” as part of a strategy to tap into over Rs9.3 trillion in circulation and maximise revenue potential. He has been talking about maximum utilisation of technology, end-to-end digitisation and auditing towards this end besides simplifying processes.
The finance minister also put on record some time ago that non-filers and under-filers were evading taxes of around Rs1.3tr at the individual level. “We must declare war on cash if we aspire to join the G20 (a group of major economies),” he said, adding that it was only possible when transactions are documented.
According to the minister, Pakistan’s economy was potentially valued at more than $700 billion — significantly higher than the current estimate of $410bn — leading to over Rs7tr in annual tax evasion. “We will ensure this documentation,” he promised.
On the petroleum side, the government introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly last month to digitally track petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration. The practice causes massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually, besides affecting the environment and vehicle engines.
The dual-pricing mechanism in the upcoming budget is expected to complement that legislative move and provide end-to-end traceability across the fuel supply chain.

Local importers and exporters have been protesting against what they call the exploitative policies of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
A local PML-N leader said the federal government — led by his party — was not serious in addressing the protesters’ demand.
 
 

The sit-in against the revenue body entered its third day at Gulmat Nagar on Sunday.
The protesters have vowed the road connecting Pakistan with China will remain closed to traffic till the acceptance of their demands.
Thousands of passengers and tourists remained stranded on both sides of the road for many hours, with long queues of vehicles seen on both sides on Sunday.
‘Economic murder’
The call for protest was issued by the Pak-China Traders Action Comm­it­tee, an alliance comprising the Gilgit-Baltistan Impor­ters and Exporters Asso­ciation; Gilgit-Nagar Cham­ber of Commerce; and small trade associations from Nagar, Hunza, and Gilgit.
On Sunday, people from all walks of life participated in the sit-in.
Meanwhile, various delegations of traders, scholars, civil society members from Hunza, Nagar, Gilgit and other areas joined the protesters. The protest leaders, Abbas Mir, Ebad Nagari, Muhammad Ismail and others, said thousands of protesters had been sitting on the road for the past three days but the authorities were reluctant to listen to their genuine grievances.
They lamented GB has “no industry” or employment opportunities in the private sector. The trade activity between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass was the biggest source of income for locals, they added.
They added people affiliated with this trade — transporters, shopkeepers, labourers, customs clearance agents, hotel owners, small businessmen — have been jobless for the last seven months due to the suspension of trade at Khunjerab Pass.
They said protesters have been demanding the clearance of over 240 consignments stuck at Sost Dry port for the past last seven months under a one-time amnesty scheme, as traders cannot afford billions of rupees in losses.
They said the policies of FBR and Customs at Sost Dry Port “economically murdered” locals.
They claimed that locals with border passes were not allowed to import items from China and the barter trade between Gilgit-Baltistan and Xinjiang province of China has been suspended.
The traders called for the facilitation of barter trade between GB and Xinjiang under the 1985 border agreement.
Additionally, seized counterfeit items at Sost Dry Port should be destroyed or auctioned within GB, the protest leaders demanded.
GB has a disputed status, yet local traders are paying all taxes and customs duties on imported goods.
Failed talks
Addressing the protesters, the president of PML-N Nagar chapter, Javed Hussain, said the federal government was “not serious in settling the issue”.
Mr Hussain, also a former member of GB Assembly, said trade policies at other ports of the country have been relaxed beca­use “people of those areas have representation in parliament”.
“GB people have been paying all taxes, yet the FBR is reluctant to clear their consignments.
He said no taxation without representation was a universal law and the people of GB were neither given representation in parliament nor exemption from taxes.
“The government of Pakistan even gave amnesty to high-profile terrorists. So, giving a one-time amnesty to clear 250 consignments after paying taxes was not a big demand,” he said
GB Home Minister Shams Lone, assembly member Ayub Waziri and other officials met the protesters and tried to convince them to end the protest. However, the talks failed to produce results.
The government delegations told the protesters that their demands were “genuine” and supported by the GB government.
They added that the issues were related to the federal government, and the chief minister has already sent recommendations to Islamabad.
Muhammad Ali Quaid, special assistant to chief minister, told the media that the GB government has no power to solve the demands of the protesters.
He said the issue will be discussed in the upcoming meeting of the apex committee, including civil and military leaders.

• Punjab minister plays down claims, says PP-52 constituents ‘expressed full confidence’ in CM Maryam
NAROWAL/GUJRAT: As the PML-N candidate seemed poised to clinch the by-election on a provincial assembly seat (PP-52) in Sialkot by a wide margin, rival candidates alleged interference by the ruling party to manipulate results with the help of the administration and police on Sunday.
The balloting remained peaceful throughout the day, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
By the time this report went to press, unofficial results indicated that PML-N candidate Hina Arshad Warraich had clinched the seat with 78,702 votes against PTI-backed independent candidate Fakhir Nashat Ghumman’s 39,018 votes.

In a statement, PM Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Ms Warraich on her victory and thanked the people of Sialkot for reposing trust in the party.
The PP-52 seat had fallen vacant after the demise of PML-N MPA Arshad Javed Warraich about two months ago.
Apparently for security reasons, the local administration had placed containers in front of the returning officer’s (RO) office – a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the RO’s office in Sambrial.
The local administration said the containers had been present outside the office since the start of the voting process and that the office wasn’t sealed after the polling.
PPP leader and former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, while speaking to media persons in Sambrial, said that polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.
He said if results were changed, that would be unfortunate, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said he wanted to bring the matter to the notice of the chief election commissioner, saying it was not tolerable that alleged rigging took place during the by-election.
Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.
On the other hand, PTI leader Usman Dar alleged that the PTI voters, supporters and polling agents were expelled from different polling stations by the police to favour the ruling party’s candidate. Responding to the PTI and PPP allegations, Punjab Infor­mation Minister Azma Bukhari said that the people of Punjab had expressed full confidence in Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in the Sialkot by-poll held on Sunday.
In an apparent reference to the PPP, she said even the party that got 400 votes was complaining abo­ut rigging. In a jibe at the PTI, she said that those who use words like ‘deals and NRO as weapons’ were now seeking deals themselves.
In a presser in Islamabad, the PTI accused the Punjab government and police of interfering in the by-poll, claiming that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.
PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that the by-election was rigged because the Punjab government was aware that it would not be able to win without manipulating the polling. He claimed that there were a large number of people in rallies and public meetings, due to which the Punjab government was sure that it stood no chance in the by-election.
“To win the election, PTI polling agents were forcefully removed from the polling stations, and then ballot papers were stamped and polled. Workers of the PML-N were allowed to remain in the polling stations, while our polling agents were told to leave. We have video evidence of all that,” he claimed.
Sheikh Waqqas alleged that pol­ice officials were openly supporting the PML-N workers and threatening the PTI workers. He alleged that workers of PTI, who refused to leave, were beaten and thrown out of polling stations. He clai­med that the helpline of the Elect­ion Comm­ission of Pakistan had become inaccessible during the polling.
