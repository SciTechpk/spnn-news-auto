Millions of people came out onto the streets in defiance of dictators and monarchs who had ruled with an iron fist for decades.
The people had their victory, deposing hated figures like Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Hosni Mubarak. But ultimately, the Arab Spring left a bitter taste. Authoritarian regimes and an even more exploitative capitalist order were restored in almost all of the Middle East and North Africa. Countries like Syria and Libya were ravaged by imperialist-sponsored proxy wars. Almost 15 years on, the status quo has not only been restored but appears even more entrenched.
The spontaneous mass protests which shook Nepal in early September generated a great deal of commentary in Pakistan, with some making comparisons to the Arab Spring. By joining the dots and linking the Nepali case with Sri Lanka’s mass uprisings of 2022 and the student-led movement which deposed Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh in 2024, some suggested that South Asia is the new Middle East.
A new normal has indeed emerged in how young, alienated masses articulate their politics. The question, however, is what lies at the end of this new modality of political assertion.
To answer that, it helps to trace the commonalities and differences among uprisings across South Asia in recent years, and to situate them alongside similar movements in other parts of the world, from the Middle East to beyond. Whether Pakistan and its neighbours reinforce these global trends or chart their own path remains to be seen. What is certain, though, is that the politics of the (youth) bulge is here to stay.
It’s the economy, stupid
As in much of the Arab world, economic hardship lies at the heart of recent popular upsurges across our region. In Nepal, young people poured onto the streets after the government banned social media platforms — tools they rely on not only to vent anger against the prevailing order but also as a means of securing highly precarious gig work. Successive left-leaning governments have failed to create adequate livelihood opportunities, with un- and underemployment rates estimated to be over 20 per cent.. Little wonder, then, that vast numbers of Nepalis seek work abroad, with remittances now accounting for an astonishing 33pc of the country’s GDP.
 
 

The situation across the region is similar; Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh have even younger populations with foreign migrant workers numbering in the tens of millions. A significant number give themselves over to human smugglers and face dire consequences as a result, including death. At the root of this crisis is the absence of any durable programme of industrialisation and/ or job creation capable of absorbing a rapidly expanding labour force that is steadily being displaced from the agrarian sector. Those who cannot migrate abroad are overwhelmingly pushed into the informal economy, where they face super-exploitation and a perpetual uncertainty about their futures. As the Nepal case demonstrates, even relatively well-educated youth rely on temporary, low-wage gig work — a telling marker of both their aspirations and their precarity.
Marx prophesised that the economic strangulation of wage labour by capital
would create both the material conditions and alienation to trigger
revolutionary upheaval if working masses were armed with an ideological
programme. South Asian youth do not even have access to regular waged work,
and rather than any coherent ideological unity and attendant political
organisations, their political consciousness and action is mediated by digital
technologies.
The digital lifeworld
One need not look beyond Pakistani shores to understand the profound impact of digitalisation on politics. Whether the focus is on mainstream political parties such as the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), religio-political organisations like the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), feminist assertion through the Aurat March, or popular movements in the ethnic peripheries like the Baloch Yekjehti Committee (BYC) and the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), the youth are largely inspired by — and mobilise through — digital platforms.
In parallel, the state delimits the ideological terrain of the digital lifeworld, using both its own power and colluding with Big Tech platforms to delegitimise and even criminalise the demands of popular movements; of the four examples cited above, only the TLP has been spared such attacks in recent times.
 
 

As more and more young people become active on social media, online content increasingly takes on political overtones, including satire. The vast majority of young people who vent against the system online are generally unaware that their data is being used by Big Tech to facilitate surveillance by the state or that the business model of what critical scholars call ‘platform capitalism’ is based on the selling of users’ data to advertisers.
Understood thus, youth perceive these digital platforms to be the only space to express their democratic aspirations. Mainstream political parties are captured by the establishment and propertied classes while the mainstream media operates within official limits. This is why so many popular movements gestate in digital spaces.
Yet their limits are clear. The Arab Spring’s initially celebrated horizontalism and leader-less characteristics ultimately gave way to fragmentation and the restoration of class and state power. In Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and now in Nepal, it is the established institutions of state like the army that have ultimately stepped into breach.
In Nepal’s case, pro-royalists seeking to restore the monarchy that was deposed in 2005 have made a comeback. As such, the historic gains of the communist left — which came to power through elections after successfully leading armed struggle against the monarchy — have largely been squandered. Neither could the left build a viable political organisation at the grassroots nor could it operationalise a transformative economic programme through state power. The result is a disenfranchised mass of young people who are left to deploy digital mobilisation strategies to generate spontaneous outbursts of popular assertion.
In Pakistan’s case, the PTI rose to prominence largely by mobilising millions of young people online. During the infamous period when the party leadership and the military establishment were on the ‘same page’, this online support base even functioned as the state’s frontline against so-called ‘fifth generation warriors’. But when Imran Khan’s government was quite literally booted out of power in April 2022, online sentiment underwent an about-turn. More than three years on, however, it is clear that for all of PTI’s formidable digital reach, its on-ground organisation remains too shallow to withstand sustained repression by the coercive state apparatus.
Beware coloured ‘revolutions’
The motif of ‘coloured revolutions’ is most closely associated with the collapse of actually existing socialism in Eastern Europe. From Ukraine to the former Yugoslavia, a wave of upheavals unfolded from the late 1980s onwards, ushering in a new era of liberal democracy and so-called ‘free market’ economics. In practice, the coloured ‘revolutions’ brought pro-western despots to power, who then presided over firesale privatisation of public assets and the establishment of a new repressive oligarchic regime.
 
 

In retrospect, the Arab Spring was similarly co-opted by US imperialism and its various lackeys. The Western media even branded the Tunisian uprising the ‘Jasmine Revolution’ — a label fiercely rejected by many within the country who recognised how external agendas were being imposed upon their struggle.
One does not have to believe in clumsy conspiracy theories to recognise that the 2024 student-led uprising in Bangladesh has had significant implications for the balance of forces both within the country and vis-à-vis its relations with neighbours. The emergence of the dubious figure of Muhammad Younus, along with the reinvigoration of the army top brass and religious right make clear that youth aspirations are being mediated by the ancien regime. Meanwhile, where the Sheikh Hasina regime counted New Delhi as its closest regional ally, the current Bangaldeshi dispensation has realigned itself to give more space to Rawalpindi-Islamabad.
In Nepal, even as the protests played out, there was suspicion about the especially violent elements who deployed arson as a clear strategy, with Ravilaxmi Chitrakar, wife of a former prime minister, still in critical care after suffering high-grade burns. Some Gen Z student leaders have since suggested that their entire movement was hijacked; when the dust settles, the army is now well-placed to single out anyone as a troublemaker who must be eliminated to enforce the ‘reform’ agenda.
Where’s the ideological unity?
One need not subscribe to a nihilistic worldview — whereby all popular forms of political assertion will inevitably be co-opted by the forces of reaction — to recognise a fundamental truth: that the people’s will can only endure if channelled through a robust, grassroots political vehicle, one not beholden to the ancien regime.
The politics of the bulge is a reflection of the systemic rot produced by a postcolonial capitalism increasingly shorn of any pretence of consent, alienating even well-educated youthful segments. As class war intensifies, the state and foreign patrons rely more on repression and/or co-option. Mainstream parties are unwilling or unable to articulate an alternative economic programme. This is why the youthful mass of working people is resorting to digital outrage.
But this is not sufficient to transform the conditions of their existence. Indeed, in the absence of a substantial revolutionary horizon and organisational capacity to match, the euphoria of upheaval more often than not gives way to despair and a deepening of the status quo.

So far, only 4.5 million girls out of the targeted 13 million have been vaccinated against the virus, which causes cervical cancer.
The update was shared with State Minister for National Health Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath, who visited the HPV vaccination site at Islamabad Model School for Girls (IMSG), G-6/1-3, to observe the public health effort.
The visit was organised by UNICEF in collaboration with the Federal Directorate of Immunisation (FDI).
The campaign, which began on 17 September, will conclude on 27 September.
Participants at the event included Dr Soofia Yunus, Director General of FDI; Dr Khurram Akram, Director (Technical), FDI Islamabad; Sharmeela Rasool, Deputy Country Representative, UNICEF Pakistan; Ellen Thon, Deputy WHO Representative, Pakistan; Dr Rashida Batool, District Health Officer; and Ms Mehreen Balooch, Assistant Commissioner ICT.
“This campaign is more than a vaccination drive — it is a promise of a healthier future for our daughters.
Every girl vaccinated is a life protected, a family safeguarded, and a future secured,” said Dr. Bharath.
 
 

He added, “Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer among women in Pakistan, with two out of three women diagnosed not surviving.
“The HPV vaccine is a safe, effective, and scientifically proven solution to prevent cervical cancer and save lives. Increasing HPV coverage among girls averts more deaths per person vaccinated than any other immunisation activity.”
A social media campaign was launched before the vaccination drive, but many parents refused to vaccinate their daughters.
Federal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal attempted to raise awareness by vaccinating his daughter in front of the media.
Reassuring parents, Dr Bharath stressed that the HPV vaccine was halal, endorsed by leading Islamic scholars, and already included in the national immunisation schedules of Muslim-majority countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Malaysia, Qatar, Bangladesh, and Indonesia.
“Protecting life (Hifz al-Nafs) is among the highest obligations in Islam. Shielding our daughters from a preventable disease is both a moral and religious duty,” he said.
Pakistan’s HPV vaccination campaign is aligned with the World Health Organisation’s Cervical Cancer Elimination Initiative, which seeks to ensure that 90 percent of girls worldwide are vaccinated against HPV by age 15 by 2030.
The campaign is being implemented in three phases: Phase 1, running from 15–27 September 2025, covers Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Islamabad Capital Territory; Phase 2 will expand to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026; and Phase 3 will reach Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027.
The goal is to vaccinate 90 per cent of girls aged 9–14 in Phase 1 regions by the end of 2025, and to sustain high coverage through routine immunisation in the coming years.
“The HPV vaccine is safe, free, and available to every eligible girl. By protecting their health today, we are safeguarding their education, their future, and their ability to contribute to society. Let us keep this momentum going until every eligible girl is reached,” Dr Bharath said.

The water had risen to his torso, his jeans soaked and rolled up over sandals, leaving him vulnerable to electrocution and infectious diseases.
Even as monsoon rains deluge Pakistan’s cities, food and grocery orders on the Singapore-based delivery platform Foodpanda pour in.
“If I don’t deliver the orders, my Foodpanda account will get blocked, which would leave me without money,” Abbas told AFP in the old quarter of Lahore, known for its narrow, congested streets.
“I need this money to pay my high school fees,” added the 19-year-old, who is completing his last year of secondary school.
Since June, monsoon rains in Pakistan have killed more than 1,000 people, swelling major rivers and devastating rural communities along their banks.
Urban centres such as Lahore, a city of more than 14 million people, and Karachi, the country’s largest city with more than 25 million people, have also suffered urban flooding in part because of poorly planned development.
 
 

Abbas earns around $7 a day, above the average salary, but only when the sun is shining.
To meet the average monthly pay of around $140, he was to work seven days a week for over 10 hours, fitted around his studies.
“Customers behave rudely and you have to handle all the stress,” added Muhammad Khan, a 23-year-old Foodpanda rider, as he carefully navigated his motorbike through Karachi’s muddy, pothole-ridden roads.
Pakistan, where 45 per cent of people live below the poverty line, is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with limited resources dedicated to adaptation.
‘Stressful’
By the middle of August, Pakistan had already received 50pc more monsoon rainfall than last year, according to disaster authorities, while in neighbouring India, the annual rains kill hundreds every year.
While South Asia’s seasonal monsoon brings rainfall that farmers depend on, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic.

A report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said brown water inundating city streets is not only the result of climate change but “clogged drains, inadequate solid waste disposal, poor infrastructure, encroachments, elitist housing societies.”
Doctors warn that working repeatedly in damp conditions can cause fungal infections and flu, while exposure to dirty water can spread eye and skin infections.
Gig economy workers attached to delivery apps such as Foodpanda and ride-hailing apps Bykea and InDrive, made up nearly two per cent of Pakistan’s labour force or half a million people in 2023, according to Fairwork, a project by the University of Oxford.
Fairwork rated six digital labour platforms in the country, and all of them have the “minimum standards of fair work conditions”.
The International Labour Organisation, meanwhile, says gig workers lack government protection and face systemic violations of international labour standards.
Motorbike rider Muneer Ahmed, 38, said he quit being a chef and joined Bykea to become “his own boss”.
“When it rains, customers try to take rickshaws or buses, which leaves me with no work,” said Ahmed, waiting anyway on the side of the flooded street.
“Rain is a curse for the poor,” he said, watching the screen of his phone for a new customer.
Daily wage labourers, often working in construction, also see their work dry up.
It has been nearly four days since labourer Zahid Masih, 44, was hired, he told AFP while taking refuge under a bridge with other masons in Karachi.
“Jobs do come up, but only after the rain stops. There is no work as long as it is raining,” says the father of three.
“Sitting idle at home is not an option, as our stoves won’t be lit.”

Senator Faisal Vawda claimed that the FBR is finalising a plan to tax income earned by TikTokers, suggesting that the largest share of recoverable taxes would come from Punjab. He urged the tax authority to begin enforcement there.
The committee, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, also reviewed the Pakistan Remittances Initiative (PRI) and the government’s remittance subsidy policy. Deputy Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan informed members that the subsidy, originally introduced in 2020 at 20 Saudi riyals per transaction, was raised to 30 in 2024 but has since been reduced back to 20 riyals.

Senators question remittance subsidies benefiting banks

Vawda criticised the move and described the policy as a “scandal”, alleging that commercial banks were benefiting disproportionately from the scheme. He called for a formal inquiry and urged the FBR to recover the allegedly misappropriated funds.
Chairman Mandviwalla also raised concerns, stating that while the PRI was designed to support overseas Pakistanis, its financial benefits were not reaching intended recipients. Instead, he noted, banks and money transfer operators appeared to be absorbing the subsidy. He called for rationalisation of transaction costs to ensure that remittance beneficiaries in Pakistan receive full value.
It directed the Ministry of Finance to provide a detailed report on expenditures and reversals linked to the remittance subsidy scheme over the past three to four years. It also recommended a comprehensive review of the PRI framework to prevent misuse and improve transparency.
In response, Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani assured the committee that the issue would be examined in consultation with the State Bank and other stakeholders. He emphasised the need to streamline the mechanism and address gaps in implementation.
The FBR chief updated the committee on the non-implementation of a Presidential Order issued on July 16, 2025, noting that the matter is under litigation before the Sindh High Court.
Published in Dawn, September 25th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-25 05:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/25095327c55ad92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944473/govt-grants-tax-relief-to-end-gb-traders-strike' target='_blank'><strong>Govt grants tax relief to end GB traders’ strike</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a bid to end the ongoing strike by Gilgit-Baltistan traders, the federal government on Wednesday agreed to exempt imports routed through the Sost Dry Port from key federal taxes — provided the goods are for local consumption and meet strict eligibility conditions.
Announcing the agreement at a press conference, Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari stated that the decision followed talks between the federal government, the GB government, and regional business leaders.
Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, and trader representatives were also present. A formal agreement was signed and released to the media.
The tax exemptions apply to sales tax, advance income tax, and federal excise duty collected by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), but only for goods imported via the Silk Route Dry Port (SRDP) in Sost and consumed within Gilgit-Baltistan. The initiative aims to support regional trade and facilitate economic development.
Leghari said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had approved the relief package after a committee led by him finalised recommendations within 45 days. He noted that longstanding policy and tax issues had stalled trade through the Sost port, and the relief package was designed in consultation with all stakeholders, including local traders and the GB leadership.

Imports through Sost dry port will be exempt from sales tax, advance income tax, and FED

Conditions and limitations
Under the agreement, only goods declared for local consumption in GB — brought in by locally registered firms owned by indigenous residents — will qualify. The GB government must authorise these firms, and all imports must be accurately declared to Pakistan Customs, with no misrepresentation. The exemption will apply only to items listed under a predefined list of positive tariff lines.
 
 

The total annual value of tax exemptions has been capped at Rs4bn. Quotas for each product line will be based on assessed customs values, and relief will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis through the Customs system.
Imports that exceed quota limits or violate conditions will not qualify for tax exemption, even if pre-approved. In the event of shortages or emergency requirements, trade bodies may request additional quotas or special concessions from federal authorities through the GB government.
The tax exemption scope will be reviewed every two years, or earlier if necessary, and may be modified or suspended if port operations are disrupted or if goods are smuggled out of the GB region. The government reserves the right to withdraw relief for items found in commercial quantities outside GB.
Additional measures
A custom tribunal will hear Sost-related cases as needed, and a Deputy Director of Valuation will visit GB on an annual basis. The terminal operator will review cases of delay, detention, or demurrage on stuck consignments.
Goods imported in violation of the Import Policy Order will be confiscated after due legal process.
The minister emphasised that the tax relief is part of broader efforts to boost trade and address the longstanding concerns of the GB business community, which has protested against what they called unfair taxation and regulatory hurdles.

Allama  Iqbal
FOR some time, most of those in their right mind have not had any doubt that all is not well with the superior judiciary. Now, even the hardiest of sceptics have been forced off the fence.
The disturbing images of five judges of Islamabad High Court (IHC) walking through the litigants’ gate of the Supreme Court to lodge their petitions was perhaps the last straw.
Their grievances are not personal. Their complaints centre around not being allowed to perform their judicial duties in accordance with their conscience and the Constitution.
The complaint they voice is not against an imperious legislature or an executive run amok. It is against their own chief justice.
Differences of opinion between groups of judges or between them and their chief are not uncommon. At times subtle, at times strong, but seldom — if ever — uncivil, such dissensions have a long history.

The five IHC judges have only formally addressed their petition to the Supreme Court, their real appeal is to the court of the people

These are not peculiar to Pakistan either. The passions and prejudices that afflict the rest of us do not pass the judges by. Often, such disagreements are both natural and healthy. They contribute to the growth of the judiciary as a department engaged in rational discourse.
 
 

Such matters were resolved in the committee rooms of the respective high courts. However, the manner was such that it kept comity alive and the institution integrated. The images splashed across the pages of the national newspapers break with this tradition. They undermine public confidence in the administration of the IHC by its chief justice.
Critics may argue that all of this was a ‘tamasha’ — a mere show. The judges had access to an advocate-on-record and the petitions could have been filled through him. Such criticism misses the point: there has been a breakdown of communication between the judges and their chief. They have lost faith in him and no longer regard him as someone interested in facilitating the administration of justice.
Given their recent experience, they also cannot be sanguine about the prospects of success in the Supreme Court
One may ask, then, why tilt at the windmills? In my view, being astute lawyers, they have only formally addressed their petition to the Supreme Court. Their real appeal is to the court of the people; their submissions are addressed to those who still may have a shred of faith left in the constitutional promise of a republican government.
The contents of the petitions shall be the subject of a separate essay. What is lamented here is the decline of form and manner in the IHC, at least for now. A mere glance at the petitions suffices to reveal that most of these grievances could have been redressed by the chief justice. Some give and take, an amiable discussion and a promise to reset course would have calmed things down.
The IHC chief justice may be too invested in the position he has taken. He may not have taken a leaf out of the favourite book of the father of nation: Morley on Compromise.
New to the charge, he may lack the skill required to convert rivals into a team. He may not have the hand required to steady the ship. Here, help could have been provided by the chief justice of Pakistan; a man with an enviable first-rate temperament. He is, after all, in the words of the Supreme Court, ‘paterfamilias’, or head of the judicial family.
The ruckus may have escaped his attention. He may even have continued to believe that it was a storm in a teacup till the fan got fertilised.
Even then, all was not lost. The head of the Constitutional Bench, in whose remit the matter fell, could have swiftly constituted a bench. Notices could have been issued and directions given that the matters be amicably resolved within a stated timeframe. Behind-the-scenes mediation of well-respected judges both serving and retired would have helped.
All this was not to be. The petitions have not been listed for hearing. The registry of the Supreme Court has recorded their objections to the petition and matters are now pending further consideration. If one thing is clear, in the practice of the Supreme Court it is that while the Registry can note what it perceives to be flaws in a petition, the matter must then be put up before a bench of the court to confirm the objections or overrule these and hear the case on merits.
IHC is the only high court in the country where all federal executive and legislative action can be called in question. In this respect it is unique. To allow this turmoil to continue paralyses the IHC and is a disservice to the state. These petitions ought to be heard and decided on merits immediately.
To keep them pending will deepen the malaise. By persuasion, through mediation, by gentle direction and ultimately — if necessary — through orders, the Supreme Court must nudge the IHC chief justice to take his judges into confidence, deal with them with respect and build consensus. A failure to do so would fail the nation.

The division bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Bareech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi, delivered the verdict during a hearing of a constitutional petition filed by senior lawyer Sajid Tareen Advocate.
After hearing arguments from the petitioner and BNP’s Central Secretary Information Agha Hassan Baloch Advocate, the bench ordered the removal of Mengal’s name from the no-fly list.
Officials’ absence irks bench
At a separate hearing, the same bench expressed dissatisfaction over prolonged power outages and the absence of senior officials the court had earlier summoned.

The court had ordered the chief secretary of Balochistan, the CEO of the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco), and the principal secretary to the CM to appear in person with a report on electrifying solar tube wells and reducing loadshedding.
Qesco’s legal adviser Barrister Muzaffar Azam informed the court that the CEO was “busy in Islamabad” and could not attend the hearing. No report was submitted on behalf of the Additional Advocate General.
The court noted that Qesco officials were disconnecting household connections attached to tube wells without notice, causing severe hardship for farmers. It observed that widespread power loadshedding was disrupting education, office and business activities.
Detailed report sought
Subsequently, the court directed the three officials to appear in person at the next hearing on Oct 7 and submit detailed replies.
Additionally, the bench expressed strong displeasure over traffic disruptions at Lakpass Tunnel and sought a detailed report from relevant authorities.
The court declared a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Mastung “unsatisfactory” and ordered him to appear at the next hearing with a comprehensive plan to improve traffic flow.
The bench remarked that criminal activities and public problems around the tunnel have been rising for the past year.
Despite repeated calls, the petitioner’s lawyer did not appear, however, according to the petition, Levies, Customs, and FC North posts at the tunnel, which connects Quetta with several districts, often cause vehicles to be “stuck for hours”.
The court directed the Deputy Attorney General and FC North’s counsel to explain at the next hearing why the check points had not been shifted to a more suitable location.

• Several parts of Jamshoro remain under water
LAHORE / DADU: A vast reservoir of floodwater continues to rise along the eastern side of the M-5 motorway, inundating farmland and threatening to erase entire  villages in Multan’s Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil.
Fifteen days after breaches first appeared at the Noraja Bhutta embankment on the Sutlej River, residents in union councils across Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran remain stranded, with many clinging to embankments as the water  swallows their homes.
To prevent damage to the highway, the  National Highway Authority (NHA) has blocked culverts and bridges with  heavy stones, effectively turning the motorway into a dam.
But this is preventing floodwaters from draining away and causing water levels to rise on the eastern side, creating a dam-like effect from Noraja  Bhutta embankment to the motorway.
Communities in Noraja Bhutta,  Bahadurpur, Basti Lang, Kanu, Dipal, Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur,  Belaywala, Dunyapur, Jhangra, Muradpur Soiwala and surrounding areas are  among the most severely affected.
“Thousands of people were becoming homeless due to floodwater in their tehsil  Jalalpur Pirwala,” said Muhammad Bakhsh, a resident of Basti Lang who evacuated his family to Ahmadpur Sharqia.

He said he and his sons returned on Wednesday to find most of their houses had collapsed.
“All of our belongings, including wheat, refrigerators, beds, doors, washing machines, air conditioners and other items, were washed away,” Mr  Bakhsh said, adding that theft from abandoned homes is now rampant.
Residents  argue that a controlled cut in the motorway would drain the water,  which they say currently cannot find a path to the Chenab River.
“The government was not giving way to water and closed all the bridges under M-5 motorway and made the eastern side of Jalalpur a dam,” Mr Bakhsh said.
The NHA defended its actions as necessary to preserve the critical infrastructure.
 
 

“We are placing stones around the motorway for its safety,” NHA General Manager Kashif Nawaz told Dawn. He stated they were not closing waterways but were reinforcing points where the speed of the water could cause damage.
Mr  Nawaz said he did not have equipment to measure if water levels were  rising and that controlling the inflow was the irrigation department’s  responsibility.
Flooding in Jamshoro
According to authorities in Sindh, a medium-level flood that is moving through the  Indus, has submerged vast tracts of agricultural land and dozens of villages. The flow at Kotri Barrage is around 400,000 cusecs, leaving most low-lying areas between Sehwan, Jamshoro and Kotri inundated.
The towns of Kotri, Khanpur, and Karoon Khu remain safe for now. However, in  Petaro, UCs Manzoorabad and Moro Jabal are submerged. In the  Manjhand area, villages including Aliabad, Khanot, Indpur, and Budhapur are affected. Over 20 rural settlements in the floodplain are now underwater, forcing residents to evacuate to safer locations on their own.
Flooding has cut off land routes to many villages from Sehwan and Bhan Saeedabad.

Pakistan’s Muneeba Ali shuffles in the crease and moves outside the leg stump. Paul follows, but the left-handed batter caresses the ball to the boundary from in between the legs of the cover fielder to thundering applause from the dressing room.
With that boundary, Muneeba became the first woman from Pakistan to score a T20I hundred and the sixth in international cricket to get a ton at the World Cup.
Now, the bespectacled 28-year-old opener is looking to make a similar impact at the Women’s ODI World Cup. Muneeba featured in just two matches of the last edition of the tournament back in 2022.
 


She played just two matches in New Zealand but was part of the team that beat the West Indies for their solitary victory of the global showpiece. That win snapped the team’s winless streak at the World Cup since 2009.
“I enjoyed it a lot,” Muneeba told Dawn in an interview inside the dimly-lit break room of the media centre at the National Stadium ahead of the team’s T20 series in Ireland last month.
“I enjoyed batting there — it is very exciting to play in the World Cup and I really got immersed in the whole experience.”
Muneeba heads into this month’s World Cup in good form. She made 76 in the opening One-day International against South Africa last week and then scored 44 in the third and final game of the series — the only game won by her side.
 
 

Apart from the red-hot Sidra Amin, she is the only batter in the squad to have scored a century in ODIs.
“We are looking to improve our team’s average score and the head-coach focuses on our individual players plans,” she said of the side’s preparations for the World Cup, where all of Pakistan’s fixtures will be staged in Colombo due to the recent agreement reached at the International Cricket Council which ensures both Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues in tournaments hosted by either country.
 






“We have identified where we are lacking and are confident about our individual plans with clarity regarding our specific roles.”
All of Muneeba’s international centuries so far have come against Ireland. Months after the last World Cup, she got her only One-day International century against the Irish in Lahore.
Her second T20 ton came against Ireland in Dublin last month.
 
 

“I have developed a lot of scoring areas [since my first century],” she said. “There are still a lot of improvements to be made — as long as you play — you have to improve your skills and develop more shots.“
“My focus is to improve my skills so that I can meet the demands of the team,” the bespectacled opener said.
Muneeba grew up playing tape-ball cricket as well as badminton with her cousins and friends on the streets in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal.
But then came the inspiration to take up cricket professionally: Pakistan’s women’s cricket team winning gold at the 2010 Asian Games in China. Still, she couldn’t have made it this far without the active support from her family.

“I got to know for the first time that there is a women’s cricket team and they play for Pakistan — I told my mother after that win that I wanted to get involved in cricket,“ she said, in her typical candid manner.
“She got me a kit bag and admitted me to the Asghar Ali Shah cricket academy — my cricketing journey started from there,” the 28-year-old batter said.
However, despite the strides Pakistan has made in women’s cricket, things are not easy for the players.
 
 

“Obviously, a reasonable pay is the financial demand of everyone looking at the inflation in our country,” said Muneeba.
“You need a lot of things to play cricket, and they’re expensive. If you are doing individual coaching, then there are other things. Then there are travelling [costs as well]. I think it is essential to provide support to girls who can play well by identifying and securing them financially.”
To ensure that, Muneeba believes that a women’s franchise league, on similar lines to the Pakistan Super League, is launched. “We have been saying this for a long time,” she said, as skipper Fatima Sana walked into the room and joked about Muneeba’s frank manner of giving interviews.
“It’s been two years since the exhibition matches for two years — and it was said then that the women’s PSL will start. But we haven’t heard anything yet. We are hopeful that it will happen as soon as possible, as we need to grow according to the standards of world cricket.”
Those are the odds the national team, Muneeba included, will be fighting against when they begin their World Cup campaign against Bangladesh on Sept 2.

• World Nuclear Industry Status Report says solar outshone nuclear in terms of efficiency, cost; reveals Pakistan’s renewable energy, including hydro, rose to 15.2GW from 14.2GW in 2023
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s net nuclear energy generation touched a record 21.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024, even though overall electricity costs and inefficiencies reached a systematic tipping point, forcing consumers to switch to renewables, particularly solar, said the World Nuclear Industry Status Report (WNISR) 2025.
“Pakistan operates six nuclear reactors with a combined (net) capacity of 3.3 gigawatts (GW). Nuclear electricity production has increased from 21.3TWh in 2023 to a new all-time high of 21.7TWh (net) in 2024,” it said, adding Pakistan started developing another 1200MW plant in December 2024 with Chinese support.
The share of electricity from nuclear power plants to the commercial grid increased from the 16.2pc peak in 2023 to a record 17pc in 2024, it said, adding all operating reactors were built by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). This includes two Hualong One reactors (Kanupp-2 and Kanupp-3) outside Karachi and four CNP-300 nuclear reactors in Chashma.
CNNC was also building another 1200-MW Hualong One reactor in Chashma (Unit 5). The agreement to build this reactor dates back to 2017, but it took over seven years to progress to the formal construction start, i.e. first pour of concrete for the base slab of the reactor building, which occurred on December 30, 2024. It is China’s only ongoing nuclear newbuild project abroad and represents the first non-Russian construction start anywhere in the world in the past five years.
In January this year, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority published an estimated overnight cost of Rs966 billion ($3.4bn) for the Chashma-5 project and the total cost (including financing and other costs) of Rs1.125 trillion ($4 billion). The majority of the cost is planned to be covered by credit from China for the project to start production by 2030, the report said, adding the project had been criticised for its high cost of power, and shelving renewable energy projects to make way for it.
The report said India had 21 operational nuclear power reactors, with a total net generating capacity of 7.4GW, more than double that of Pakistan (3.3GW), and New Delhi planned to add another 100GW by 2047, a target unlikely to be met.
Renewables vs nuclear
Talking about global trends, the report said solar energy added hundreds of gigawatts globally while nuclear remained irrelevant in market development in 2024. “As storage passed a trigger point, there are first signs of a revolution behind the meter and low-income countries are starting to leapfrog,” it said.
In 2024, total investment in non-hydro renewable electricity capacity reached a record $728bn, 21 times the reported global investment in nuclear energy. “Solar and wind power capacities grew by 32 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively, resulting in 565GW of combined new capacity, over 100 times the 5.4 GW of net nuclear capacity addition. Global wind and solar facilities generated 70 per cent more electricity than nuclear plants”.
Not only this, as challenges of integrating nuclear power into the energy system remain, new energy technologies disrupt markets and systems. Photovoltaics directly produce electricity from solar radiation in harmless nanometre-thin semiconductor junctions, allowing for ongoing steep cost reductions and performance increases. This is complemented by similar advances in power electronics and batteries.
Together these new technologies are evolving towards a highly flexible fully electrified energy system with a decentralised control logic outcompeting traditional centralised fossil and nuclear systems. “Nuclear energy increasingly has difficulties to survive in this context. 2024 has been a pivotal year as battery storage costs have dropped by 40pc.”
 
 

As behind-the-meter installations continue to scale, their capacity is becoming increasingly important. This was recently illustrated in Pakistan, the report noted.
The 10pc decline in power demand in the public grid between 2022 and 2023, while the economy grew, can be partly explained by examining the import statistics for PV panels. In 2024 alone, the imported solar generation capacity amounted to 22GW (compared to 46GW of mostly conventional capacity operating in the public grid in 2023), primarily adding to private installations behind the meter.
“The chaotic development, intensified by sharply rising public electricity prices and unsatisfactory reliability of the grid, is creating new opportunities but also causing social problems,” it said. It highlighted new challenges in managing the transition in emerging economies with intense sunshine. “In the case of Pakistan, it appears that a combination of key cost trends has reached a systemic tipping point,” the report said.
Pakistan’s renewable electricity capacity was 15.2GW in 2024, up from 14.2GW in 2023. While hydropower, with a total capacity of 11.5 GW, was the most important component of this capacity, solar energy is the fastest-growing source of energy. In 2024, the total capacity of solar energy was 1.4GW, up from 1.2GW at the end of 2023, while wind constituted 1.8 GW, the same as the two previous years.

• Says new law binds security forces to inform families, produce detainees before magistrates within 24 hours
ISLAMABAD: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on We­­dnesday that the policy of appeasement — such as the one adopted towards the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan — had always harmed the interests of the state, and the same was true in Balochistan.
“The policy of appeasement in reference to the prevalent situation in Balochistan has always damaged the cause of the state,” the chief minister said while addressing a reception hosted by the Supreme Court Bar Association at the Supreme Court building. On the occasion, he also announced a Rs100 million grant for the association.
When asked about the incarceration of rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch, the chief minister alleged that her group had allegedly burnt the Pakistani flag at their events, replacing it with the flag of an “independent Balochistan”, and played the so-called national anthem composed by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army before their public meetings.
“Tell me, which country tolerates such advocacy on its soil?” he asked, adding that he wished to speak his heart out about the province’s situation, but in-camera rather than before cameras.
CM Bugti conceded that bad governance and rampant corruption had compounded the province’s problems. Still, he said the gravest challenge to the state was the violence unleashed by perpetrators who “as­­s­assinate travellers, civili­a­­ns or off-duty soldiers, and mercile­ssly kill Punjabi families in front of their wo­­menfolk”.
He said an even bigger cha­­llenge was the “fal­se narrative” built on social media portraying violence as legitimate and aimed at se­­curing people’s rights. He regretted that numerous centres abroad were engaged in spreading hate campaigns against Pakistan.
He said that even political leaders hesitate to oppose the “separatists’ narrative” simply because the state’s position is unpopular.
 
 

On the issue of missing persons, CM Bugti accused some political actors of exploiting the matter for political gain. He said his administration had addressed enforced disappearances through legislation binding security forces to inform families of any detained person, produce them before a magistrate within 24 hours, and house them in civilian centres subject to weekly medical inspections.
Meeting with Afghan envoy
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Sar­fa­raz Bugti met Afghanistan’s acting Consul General Maulvi Muhammad Habib Nasir on Wednesday to discuss the ongoing repatriation of Afghan refugees from Balochistan. The meeting focused on ensuring a humane, respectful and well-coordinated return process.
CM Bugti assured him that all possible assistance was being provided to Afghan refugees.

This initiative raises crucial questions about Pakistan’s own invertebrate populations. As our country experiences frequent floods, droughts and heatwaves, how are these climatic extremes affecting the unsung architects of our ecosystems? What implications do these impacts hold for Pakistan’s food security and public health?
In Pakistan, the global and national significa­­n­­ce of insects and invertebrates is profound yet ov­­erlooked and critically threatened. Their collective work underpins the very foundations of life: from pollinating the crops that feed us to decomposing organic matter that enriches our soils.
These unrecognised heroes of ecosystems are indispensable to biodiversity and food security. Pakistan’s diverse ecology, from the Himalayas to the Indus delta, is home to a wide range of invertebrates crucial to environmental and economic health. As the backbone of the country’s agriculture, insect pollinators are vital for such crops as fruit, vegetables and cotton.
Beyond farming, insects play crucial roles in nutrient cycling in arid zones and maintaining the delicate balance of alpine flora. Aquatic invertebrates serve as indicators of water quality and support aquatic food chains in our water bodies. While credible data is hard to come by, some species like the Kashmir Kaiser-i-Hind butterfly are considered globally threatened. Threats to these species are multifaceted.

In Pakistan, the significance of insects and invertebrates is profound yet overlooked.

Bees are the most critical pollinators, enabling the reproduction of major food crops and wild flowering plants. Without them, farm yield would plummet. Beyond pollination, insects like ladybugs are natural pest controllers, reducing the need for chemical pesticides. Beetles and earthworms, known as detritivores, decompose organic matter, enriching soil and preventing erosion.
They also form the base of food chains, supporting birds, amphibians and mammals. The decline of insect populations is a crisis.
Impact of floods: Floods, like the recent ones in Pakistan, cause mass invertebrate mortality, as widespread floods and prolonged inundation drown or wash away vast numbers of terrestrial insects and their nests. These events also lead to habitat destruction, as floodwaters destroy the plants and soil that invertebrates rely on for food and shelter. The water itself, often polluted, can be toxic in Pakistan.
Phenological mismatch and species migration: Perhaps most concerning is the slow climatic on­­set of phenological mismatches: the decoupling of synchronised relationships between insects and their food sources. As temperatures shift, bees may emerge from hibernation before their preferred flowers bloom, while butterfly lifecycles become misaligned with host plant availability. Across Pakistan’s seven elevation zones, from the Thar desert to the Karakorams, these mismatches create unpredictable ecosystem dynamics.
Climate change has also triggered a northward movement of species. Rising temperatures and al­­tered precipitation patterns have enabled disease vectors like mosquitoes to establish their ha­­bitat in previously cooler, higher-altitude regi­ons. Stu­dies in Islamabad and Peshawar show increasing dengue transmission risk as these vectors colonise northern Pakistan, while native invertebrate populations struggle with changing conditions.
Invertebrate wealth: Pakistan’s diverse ecosystems host a range of invertebrates crucial for environmental and economic resilience. Native bee species serve as the backbone of agriculture, pollinating key export crops like cotton, fruit and oilseeds. The economic value of these pollination services is invisible in the national account.
Beyond agriculture, many unique species represent significant biodiversity assets and potential flagships for ecotourism in northern Pakistan. Aquatic invertebrates serve as vital indicators of water quality throughout our river systems, while beneficial insects like ladybugs provide natural pest control.
Growing international trade in invertebrates presents both opportunities and risks. Pakistan could develop indigenous biocontrol solutions for export while expanding its managed pollination services sector. The commercial production and harvesting of insects have emerged as a major trade commodity.
However, unregulated trade poses biosecurity threats, as seen with the global spread of Varroa mites that have devastated honeybee populations worldwide. While Pakistan also grapples with illegal wildlife trafficking of mammals and reptiles, invertebrate commerce requires distinct regulatory frameworks due to its unique biosecurity and ecological implications.
Governance gaps: Pakistan addresses invertebrate protection through multiple agencies, primarily the ministries of climate change and food security. Key legislation includes the Pakistan Plant Quarantine Act (1976) and the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Act (2012) aligned with CITES. However, significant gaps re­­main.
Despite research conducted by the Ento­mo­logical Research Institute and various universit­ies, the Pakistan Zoological Survey lacks a centr­a­­lised national dataset for monitoring invertebr­ate populations — a critical oversight given their importance to agricultural and food security.
Conservation priorities: Protecting Pakistan’s invertebrates requires immediate action across four fronts: conducting nationwide population su­­r­veys and enhanced entomological research to un­­derstand climate vulnerabilities; strengthening protected areas and converting lands along railway tracks and road networks into ecological corridors linking fragmented habitats; impleme­n­ting agricultural reforms that reduce pesticide de­­­pendency through integrated pest managem­ent, while incentivising pollinator-friendly farming; and, developing a unified national action plan integrated into climate strategies. Crucially, Pakistan’s NDCs and national adaptation plans must prioritise investment in bees and pollinators as essential climate resilience components.
The invertebrate crisis threatens our food security, economic stability and ecological resilience. The 2022 and 2025 floods exposed this catastrophic vulnerability while also demonstrating invertebrates’ essential role in ecosystem recovery. As climate change intensifies phenological mismatches and drives species’ migration or extinction, I cannot imagine a healthy childhood without chasing butterflies and fireflies or running away from wasps.

The American president used the august international platform to recycle conspiracy theories and highlight far-right talking points, along with taking a verbal sledgehammer to the UN itself. He blasted mass migration, saying that the UN was creating problems and “funding an assault on Western countries” by supporting migrants. Mr Trump referred to climate change as the “greatest con job ever” and warned nations to stay away from “this green scam”. As for the UN’s peacemaking role, or lack of it, Mr Trump asked “what is the purpose of the United Nations”, adding that the forum only offered “empty words”. He was also critical of states recognising Palestinian statehood, terming it a “reward” for Hamas.
 
 

Refuting each of Mr Trump’s ill-considered assertions at the UNGA requires far more space than is available in these columns. Briefly, it should be shocking that the leader of the world’s foremost economic and military power should turn MAGA talking points critical of the ‘globalist elite’ into key arguments of his address.
However, little is shocking when it comes to Mr Trump. His climate denialism is dangerous, especially for countries like Pakistan, which are lurching from one climate crisis to another. It is also disturbing that he chooses to scapegoat migrants for destroying Western civilisation. He should remember that many Western countries, led by his own, have helped destroy states in the Middle East and Africa through regime change, which has fuelled the migration crisis.
His criticism of the UN for failing to prevent conflict may not be off the mark, but again, the global body is only the sum of its parts. When powerful member states, such as the US, paralyse the UN through the Security Council, is the global institution alone to be blamed for inaction? Moreover, it is the unilateralism of the Western bloc that contributed to the weakening of the UN.
 
 

Speaking later with leaders of Muslim states, including Pakistan, Mr Trump suggested that these countries could help end the Gaza war. However, the American leader’s emphasis seemed to be on getting the Israeli hostages back, not on ending the genocide of Palestinians.
While the Arab and Muslim states should be leading an economic and diplomatic boycott of Israel for its crimes in Gaza, arguably, only one state has the key to halting the Zionist aggression: the US. If America, as well as its Western allies, stopped funding Tel Aviv and shipping deadly weapons to it, and refrained from defending Israel at every international forum, the Zionist regime could be forced to rethink its bloody and criminal strategy.

The country’s growth model has run its course, and over the past five years, the number of people living below the poverty line has begun to swell after two decades of shrinkage.
Not only that. Nearly 40 per cent of children are stunted, and this percentage has not changed much over a long period of time. One quarter of children of primary school age remain out of school. Of the ones that do go to school, 75pc of those who finish primary schooling cannot read, or follow a simple story.
One after another, the dismal state of the population as seen in the social indicators testifies to the fact that the economy is not delivering, whether or not it grows. The middle of the decade of the 2010s saw a high-growth spurt, yet between the years 2011 and 2021, “real wage growth in sectors employing the poor remained minimal at just 2-3pc” the report notes, “making the poor ill-equipped to convert economic growth into income-generating opportunities”.
 
 

The report is a strong reminder that Pakistan’s economic urgency is actually not about growth. It is about reform. This economy cannot lift people out of poverty even when it grows. It cannot reduce income disparities between urban and rural, or between geographical regions. It cannot create enough jobs for the youth, or furnish income-generating opportunities for women at a rate sufficiently fast to make any meaningful impact in the lives of the multitude.
 
 

One reason for this, the report points out, is that 95pc of all job growth for the poor in the early years of the 2000s, when poverty levels fell sharply, was due to opportunities in the informal sector, and the movement of labour from agriculture to low-quality jobs in services and construction. That drop in poverty was not brought about due to expanding opportunities in the formal sector.

The World Bank report is a strong reminder that Pakistan’s economic urgency is actually not about growth.

Meanwhile, the state as presently constituted cannot educate its children, reduce the incidence of stunting among them, build resilience to shocks (such as floods) at the local level — and on and on and on.
The report proposes a number of pathways forward. These include strengthened public service delivery, devolution to local governments and their empowerment via a fiscal model that provides them with the resources they need to discharge their responsibilities.
Other ways forward include what they call “building resilience” via social safety nets and improved targeting through the National Socio-Economic Registry, and finally developing better data systems “through a robust statistical infrastructure that produces accessible, high-frequency, and granular data” to drive evidence-based research, which can serve both as a feedback loop and an input in policy design.
Of all these, the last deserves particular mention. I have long argued for more legally mandated data release templates across government departments. This has many benefits that appear slowly, but reliably, and help focus attention on metrics against which to measure progress.
For now, the single most robust data dissemination template that operates in the country is the one that focuses on the health of the external sector. We get high-quality data on the balance of payments and trade, and multiple data points against which to measure the foreign exchange reserves, as well as the forward positions taken by the State Bank. The debt statistics are more thorough than any other, and a clear picture of Pakistan’s debt profile can be easily built very quickly.
Try finding out a few basic facts about education or health, however, and you’ll notice how woefully inadequate our data is. Try looking for more regular data on the power sector, and you will have to wade through unspeakably complex Nepra documents to piece the picture together yourself. Forget about employment. That data gets released once a year in a good year.
Maybe the World Bank can play a proactive role here in helping develop a data release template for the power sector, for starters. Maybe it would be a good idea for data on the accumulation of circular debt to be released officially, as per pre-defined protocols, on a fortnightly basis.
Maybe there should be a simple data page on the Nepra website, where we can see fuel consumption data broken down by power plant every month. Maybe units sent out can be shown on a map by coverage area, and next to it we can see recoveries made in the same area during the same period.
There is a lot of room for expansion here. The provincial governments should also be mandated to release key data relating to health and education on a regular basis. The template for this release should be standardised to enable comparisons across provinces, and ideally with other countries as well.
This sort of data release requirement helps bring some discipline in government departments. It enables outsiders to track performance. It helps identify those areas where policy needs to be strengthened. And it reduces the scope for discretionary decision-making. In short, an expansive and standardised data collection and disclosure requirement on government departments can help bring about the kinds of reforms the World Bank is saying Pakistan needs to undertake.
One big reason why change is so hard to bring about in this country is precisely because large swathes of it operate in the dark, in the sense that there is no transparency. Without transparency, it is hard to build accountability. And without accountability, there is no incentive to change, because continuing with business as usual is easier and risk-free.
Maybe a little daylight in the darker recesses of the state will help jolt a few civil servants out of their complacency. Maybe some evidence-based metrics will help light the way, away from the culture of idle complaining that has taken root among the elites.

• GSF says Israel endangering lives of 500+ unarmed civilians aboard the flotilla that is carrying activists from 45 countries
GAZA CITY: Israeli forces killed 40 people across Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including 22 killed by three air strikes on a warehouse sheltering displaced people near the Firas market in Gaza City as the military pressed its assault on the Palestinian territory from where hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee.
Gaza’s Civil Defence agency’s spokesman, Mahmud Bassal, said the dead included six women and nine children.
Israel has launched a major air and ground offensive on Gaza City. The United Nations says at the end of August around one million people lived in Gaza City and its surroundings, where it has declared a famine.
UN for probe into attack on flotilla
Meanwhile, the United Nations called on Wednesday for an investigation into drone attacks against a Gaza-bound aid flotilla, as Brussels slammed the strikes as unacceptable and Italy sent a navy frigate to assist.
The Global Sumud Flotilla blamed Israel for the more than a dozen explosions heard around the flotilla Tuesday off Greece, with damage caused by “unidentified objects” dropped on deck.
“Israel escalates dangerous attacks”, including “the deployment of explosive and incendiary devices, deliberate dispersal of chemical substances onto civilian vessels” and attempts to render the boats unseaworthy, it said.
UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said anyone responsible for the “violations” should be held accountable.
The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) set sail from Barcelona this month with the aim of breaking the Israeli blockade of Gaza and delivering humanitarian aid.
Israel, which blocked two previous attempts by activists to reach Gaza by sea in June and July, has said it will not allow the flotilla to reach the embattled Palestinian territory.
GSF condemns Israel
GSF accused Israel of endangering the 500+ unarmed civilians aboard the flotilla that is carrying activists from 45 countries, including Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg.
Thunberg said the “scare tactic” was “not going to stop us”.
“We are sailing peacefully in international waters. We are not carrying weapons. We are carrying food, baby formula, medical supplies, and water,” she said in a live interview on GSF’s Instagram account.
Italy dispatched a frigate that was already in the eastern Mediterranean to provide protection for the flotilla, which is carrying Italian activists and members of parliament.
“The vessel is already en route to the area for possible rescue operations”, Defence Minister Guido Crosettohe posted on X.
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said he told Israel that “any operation entrusted to Israeli forces must be conducted in compliance with international law”.
The GSF currently numbers 51 vessels, most of which are off the Greek island of Crete. Vessels waiting to join the flotilla had already been targeted in two drone attacks in Tunisia.
Maritime escort
The Greek coastguard said that a patrol boat from the EU borders agency Frontex was directed to the area “in response to a report of a threat” to a Polish-flagged boat, but the crew said “they did not require assistance”, so it left.
Eva Hrncirova, European commission spokesperson, said “the freedom of navigation under international law must be upheld”.
“No attacks, no drone strikes, no seizures or any use of force against the flotilla is acceptable”, she said.
The Sumud Flotilla describes itself as an independent group not linked to any government or political party. Sumud is Arabic for “resilience”.

According to Hindustan Times, the FIR was registered following orders by the metropolitan magistrate court at Borivili, which directed the Bangur Nagar police to register an FIR against Nusli Wadia, Maureen Wadia, 78, Ness Wadia, 54, Jehangir Wadia, 52, H.J. Bamji, 75, K.F. Bharucha and R.E. Wandewala, 65, for alleged cheating and forgery.
The case revolves around a 30-year-old development agreement between Wadia and Ferani Hotels on a plot of land in Malad, which Ferani Hotels was to develop with builder K. Raheja and pay Wadia 12pc of the gross sale proceeds. Disputes arose in 2008, leading to legal battles over Wadia’s share of sales and the management of the land. The case has involved allegations of mala fide, lack of authority, and commercial disputes, and has proceeded through various courts, including the Bombay high court and the Supreme Court.
On Monday, the case was registered under Sections 3(5) (general explanations), 318(4) (cheating), 331(2) (punishment for house-trespass or house-breaking), 336(3) (forgery), 339 (possession of a document described in Section 337 or Section 338, knowing it to be forged and intending to use it as genuine), 340(2) (forged document or electronic record and using it as genuine), and 61(2) (criminal conspiracy) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.
According to the FIR, Mahendra Chande, the chief executive officer of Ferani Hotels Private Limited and its group companies, complained to the police that the accused persons had allegedly forged documents and submitted them to the Bombay high court in 2010 in a commercial matter against them.
Chande said he had lodged a complaint with the Bangur Nagar police station on March 15, and again with the Mumbai police commissioner on March 24, but the police did not register an FIR. Based on his complaint, the metropolitan magistrate court at Borivali on Sept 20 issued the order to the Bangur Nagar police station.
“We are still verifying the complaint and will be able to comment on the matter only after scrutinising the bulky documents involved in the case,” said a police officer from Bangur Nagar police station.
Despite text and WhatsApp messages, Nusli’s son, Ness Wadia, remained unavailable for comment, the paper said.

Under Article 209 of the Constitution, the SJC consists of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, two senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, and two senior-most chief justices of high courts.
CJP Yahya Afridi heads the forum, while Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar represent the Supreme Court. Among chief justices, LHC’s Chief Justice Alia Neelum was already a member, and the seat vacated following the retirement of SHC Chief Justice Junaid Ghaffar has now been filled by Jus­tice Dogar, who ranks as the most senior among the sitting high court chiefs.
 
 

The Constitution says that seniority among chief justices of high courts is determined by their dates of appointment as permanent chief justices, and in case of a tie, by their earlier appointment as judges of any high court. It further stipulates that if a member is unable to act due to illness or conflict of interest, the next senior judge or chief justice automatically substitutes him.
 
 

The Council’s majority opinion prevails in all inquiries, which may be initiated either by the President or by the SJC itself if a judge is suspected of misconduct or incapacity. No superior court judge may be remo­ved except through this process

• Azma Bokhari accuses PPP of indulging in ‘flood politics’
• PPP leaders lash out at JI chief’s BISP ‘fraud’ remarks
LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: The war of words between coalition partners PML-N and PPP escalated on Wednesday after the former questioned the transparency of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), while the latter accused its senior partner of showing an “irresponsible attitude” by refusing to use the programme’s data to compensate flood-affected people in Punjab.
Several PPP leaders criticised the PML-N for “attempting to make the BISP controversial”. On Wednesday, PPP’s Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari — the first lady and a member of the National Assembly — entered the debate, questioning what she called the PML-N’s “unfounded concerns” in refusing to use BISP data to provide relief to flood victims in Punjab.
“Over four million people have been impacted by the unprecedented floods in Punjab. The Benazir Income Support Programme is the fastest and most effective way to distribute relief. Not utilising one of the state’s key organisations, which has both the data and the capacity to deliver assistance, would be irresponsible,” Aseefa wrote on X.
 






Senior PPP leaders Nadim Afzal Chan and Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed — while addressing a press conference in Islamabad — also lambasted the Punjab government for rejecting BISP data for compensating flood victims.
Taking a jibe at Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, Mr Chan said that regardless of whose picture appeared on the relief package, the flood-affected people, especially farmers, should be compensated forthwith. He also advised CM Maryam to consult farmers regarding the compensation package.
Maryam Nawaz has often been criticised for putting her picture on every Punjab government project.
Mr Chan said the Punjab government was shirking its responsibility of helping poor farmers affected by recent floods. He stressed that BISP was the only welfare initiative in Pakistan that had won international recognition.
Chaudhry Manzoor underscored that only BISP had the infrastructure to reach down to the union council level. “Apart from BISP, no other mechanism has such reach,” he claimed.
 
 

PPP Vice President Sherry Rehman, too, strongly advocated the use of BISP for compensating flood victims during a Senate committee meeting. BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
PML-N reaction
Responding to the criticism, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said in a statement on Wednesday that some elements of the PPP had done nothing except indulge in “flood politics” and point-scoring.
“The PPP is trying to drag BISP into politics. The programme functions under its own law and mechanisms. To repeatedly link it with floods is nothing more than political point-scoring,” she said, adding that the PPP had no solutions for people’s problems and was only interested in “flood politics”.
Ms Bokhari accused the PPP leaders of dictating from their homes which embankments the Punjab government should break. “Governments make such decisions based on prevailing circumstances and ground realities, not on political statements,” she remarked.
A day earlier, the minister had clarified that the Punjab government would issue relief cards to flood victims in their personal names, using its own resources, instead of using BISP for assistance.
So far, the Punjab government has announced a compensation package for flood-hit families, including Rs20,000 per acre for crop loss, Rs1 million for completely destroyed homes, Rs500,000 for partially damaged homes, and Rs500,000 for the loss of cattle.
PPP condemns JI emir’s remarks
Meanwhile, the PPP on Wednesday strongly condemned Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman’s remarks branding BISP a “fraud”.
A day after BISP chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid rebuked the JI emir over his remarks, PPP leaders Nadeem Afzal Chan and Chaudhry Manzoor denounced his statement in strong terms.
Mr Chan alleged that JI had recruited innocent citizens in the name of Afghan jihad and collected billions of rupees for a project that ultimately failed.
“Was Jamaat-i-Islami’s jihad project a success or a failure?” he asked, claiming that JI had sacrificed innocent lives in a futile war.
Mr Manzoor accused JI of exploiting the poor by pushing them into Ziaul Haq’s so-called jihad project. “That project was fraudulent, a failure, and history has proven it. JI even won seats in elections under its cover. They must stick to politics instead of exploiting people’s lives,” he remarked.

The committee chairman, Malik Ibrar Ahmad, decided to call officials of the power division at the next meeting to discuss the matter.
The committee was informed that companies were carrying out loadshedding as per Aggregate Technical and Commercial Loss Policy on the instructions of the power division.
Mr Ahmad noted that this practice was a clear violation of Nepra’s Performance Standards Distribution Rules, 2025.
The committee termed the policy a clear intrusion into Nepra’s mandate. It was later briefed on Ogra performance as the regulator of petroleum and gas sector downstream sectors.
The panel denounced Ogra’s monitoring mechanism on sale and decanting of LPG in residential areas.
 
 

It expressed concern over the manufacturing of substandard LPG cylinders and demanded strict legal action against it.
The panel also decided not to recommend a private members bill regarding am­e­ndment to Services Tribunals Amendment Bill, 2025. The bill sought reduction of time period from 90 to 35 days allowing aggrieved civil servants to file appeal in Federal Services Tribunal.
The committee was informed that reduction in the time period will not only over-burden the tribunal but also deprive departments of due diligence while deciding appeals of aggrieved civil servants.
The panel directed Benevolent and Group Insurance Funds Manag­ement to pursue the Actuarial Study of both the Funds and get it completed within 90 days.

• Premier asks IMF to take flood damage into account as lender’s team meets govt officials in Islamabad today
• In joint statement after meeting Trump, Muslim bloc leaders reject forced displacement from Gaza
NEW YORK: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s diplomacy-packed US visit is expected to reach a climax in a White House meeting with President Donald Trump today (Thursday).
During his whirlwind tour, PM Shehbaz has attended UNGA sessions, a key multilateral summit of the Muslim bloc, as well as side meetings with the heads of international financial institutions in New York.
All signs now point to a flagship engagement in Washington, though officials remain guarded about specifics.
The PM’s media team, the staff at Pakistan’s embassy and its UN mission, all describe the meeting as being “almost certain”.
This is evident from the fact that several senior diplomats have already returned to Washington to prepare. Members of the embassy’s media staff are also shifting back to the capital, while journalists from Pakistan covering the visit are arranging a quick trip south.
In a media interaction, when asked by reporters about the possibility of his meeting with President Trump on Thursday, PM Shehbaz simply smiled and said that he would speak about it the following day.
 
 

Sources also suggest that Field Marshal Asim Munir may join the PM for the meeting in Washington. Earlier this year, the army chief became the country’s first military commander to be invited to the White House for a bilateral meeting.
Nevertheless, there was still no overt official confirmation that the meeting with Trump would take place, at the time of going to press.
When asked about the possibility of the meeting, a senior State Department official artfully referred journalists to the president’s schedule. However, Trump’s schedule for Thursday was yet to be released at the time of going to press.
Meeting with IMF, WB officials
Earlier, in a meeting with International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Kristalina Georgieva, PM Shehbaz urged the lender to take into account the recent flood damage in its upcoming review for the country.
An IMF team is due in Islamabad today (Thursday) to begin talks with the government.
Ms Georgieva expressed her sympathy for all people affected by the floods, a PM Office statement said.
PM Shehbaz also met World Bank (WB) Group President Ajay Banga and praised the bank’s support for the country.
Also on Wednesday, the premier met with Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, and attended a high level meeting of the Global Development Initiative, convened by his Chinese counterpart, Li Qiang.
Joint statement
Following their meeting on Wednesday, PM Shehbaz and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also had some one-on-one face time with President Trump.
A Foreign Office statement on X, alongside a video of the brief rendezvous, described it as an informal exchange. The video showed the US president warmly greeting PM Shehbaz and FM Dar, followed by a brief conversation.
 






The joint statement, issued after the meeting of Muslim leaders with the US president, underscored the unbearable situation in the Gaza Strip, including the humanitarian catastrophe and high human toll, as well as its serious consequences for the region and impact on the Muslim world as a whole.
The leaders of Muslim nations reiterated their common position, rejecting the forced displacement of people from Gaza. They emphasised the need to end the war and achieve an immediate ceasefire that would ensure the release of hostages and allow the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid as the first step toward a just and lasting peace.

• Ruling underscores principle of judicial equality, places emphasis on judicial discipline; affirms that judges cannot ‘pick and choose’ cases
• IHC judges’ pleas ‘still under review’, says SC spox
ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court, in an 11-page verdict, has ruled that judges cannot initiate contempt proceedings against their peers, establishing that only the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) has the constitutional authority to probe misconduct allegations against the judges of both the apex and high courts.
He explained that judges within the superior cou­rts share equal power and status, with no individual holding superiority or inferiority over another. He warned that allowing judges to take such punitive mea­sures against one another would cripple the judiciary.
The ruling formally justified why a six-judge Supreme Court bench on Jan 27 disposed of an Intra-Court Appeal (ICA) filed by Additional Registrar (Judicial) Nazar Abbas. Mr Abbas had faced contempt proceedings from a smaller two-judge bench for his non-compliance with a judicial order.
The additional registrar was subsequently removed from his office for withdrawing a case challenging the Customs Act from that two-judge bench, which was headed by a senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, and transferring it to a larger Constitutional Bench.
Justice Mandokhail warned that permitting judges to hold their colleagues in contempt could ignite internal conflicts, ultimately threatening the integrity of the entire justice system.
“Permitting superior court judges to initiate contempt proceedings against his fellow judges would militate against the necessity of maintaining a high degree of comity amongst them,” Justice Mandokhail wrote.
He cautioned that such a practice would foster an environment of hostility rather than collegiality, severely damaging the institution’s credibility.
“The maintenance of cordial relations amongst members of the superior judiciary is important for the smooth functioning of courts and issuing a process of contempt of court by a judge against his fellow judge would create internal conflicts, grievances and grudges amongst themselves,” the judgement said.
The justice painted a dire picture of the potential consequences.
“There would be anarchy and justice system would crumble, which will be against the principle of ‘Esprit de corps’ (common spirit existing in the members of a group and inspiring enthusiasm, devotion, and strong regard for the honour of the group),” Justice Mandokhail observed.
He added that “the trend will erode public trust and that no legal system can permit judicial system to collapse.”
The judgement affirmed that while judges possess inherent constitutional power to initiate contempt of court proceedings, this authority does not extend to their colleagues on the bench.
“Judges of the superior courts possess the same status and power within their hierarchy, therefore, no one amongst them neither was superior or inferior to issue direction nor can punish the other,” he noted.
The ruling clarified the boundaries of judicial immunity, observing that while judges are generally protected for their judicial work and administrative functions, this protection is not absolute and does not shield them from accountability for misconduct. However, the proper and sole channel for such accountability is the Supreme Judicial Council.
“The allegation of misconduct against a judge of the Supreme Court or of a high court can only be inquired into and dealt with under Article 209 of the Constitution by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC),” Justice Mandokhail observed.
Recalling a rare historical instance, the justice referenced the case of Iftikhar Chaudhry and others, in which the Supreme Court had issued contempt notices to several apex and high court judges for violating a restraining order from Nov 3, 2007. However, Justice Mandokhail stressed that the context of that case was unique and markedly different from the matter at hand.
The judgement also delved into crucial matters of judicial procedure and discipline, particularly the handling of “part-heard” cases.
Justice Mandokhail affirmed the well-settled legal principle that matters partially heard by a bench should not be transferred administratively unless explicitly permitted by law or constitutional rules.
“The purpose behind this principle was that once a bench or a court hears a case at a considerable length, transferring that case from that court can lead to a denovo hearing,” he explained.
However, he introduced a critical exception that directly applied to the registrar’s case: if a court’s jurisdiction is removed through new legislation or a constitutional amendment while a matter is pending, that court loses all authority to proceed.   “The court where the matter is pending or is treated as part-heard, it loses its authority to take any further action into the matter, hence, must stop proceedings,” Justice Mandokhail observed.
“With great respect, there was no justification for the regular bench for further proceedings into the matter in contravention of the relevant provisions of the Constitution after the amendment,” he emphasised.   He noted that court committees also had no power to override the constitutional change.
Underscoring that judges are bound by their oath and a strict Code of Conduct, he said, “If every judge of the SC or of a High Court starts picking and choosing cases for disposal by him, without following the practice and procedure in vogue, of their respective courts, the discipline in the court will be damaged.”
IHC judges’ petition under review
Separately, the Supreme Court said that petitions filed by five senior sitting judges from the Islamabad High Court are in the normal process of review and that any order regarding their fate will be made in due course.
“Petitions are in the normal process of procedural scrutiny and any order thereon is to be made in due course,” said Dr. Shahid Hussain Kamboyo, a spokesperson for the Supreme Court.
 
 

On Sept 19, five judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Raffat Imtiaz — personally appeared before the apex court to file their constitutional petitions.
The petitioner judges pleaded with the Supreme Court to declare that the administrative powers of the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court cannot be deployed to undermine or trump the judicial powers of high court judges.  They sought a declaration that the CJ-IHC was not authorised to constitute benches or transfer cases once a high court bench was already seized of a matter.
It also asked the apex court to declare that the CJ-IHC cannot exclude available judges from the roster at will and use the power to issue a roster to oust judges from performing judicial functions.

“Addressing difficulties faced by victims of various financial scams in receiving their amounts, NAB has decided to transfer recovered funds to victims online,” says an official press release issued by the NAB headquarters on Wednesday.
The new payment system was launched at a ceremony presided over by NAB chairman retired Lt-Gen Nazir Ahmed. In the first phase, recovered funds were directly transferred online to victims of the B4U fraud.
The NAB chief himself initiated the online transfer of funds directly into the bank accounts of victims.
In the past, NAB used to return money to a limited number of victims at a time via pay orders, a time-consuming process that required victims to physically visit NAB offices to receive their money. Now, NAB has completely digitised this process so that funds can be transferred directly to the victims’ bank accounts, eliminating the traditional, time-consuming method, the press release said.
At the ceremony, NAB Islamabad/Rawalpindi region transferred Rs878.709 million to accounts of 5,008 victims of the B4U fraud in a single day
NAB began its investigation into the B4U fraud in Feb 2021 based on complaints from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and the victims.
The investigation has now been completed after which the accused have admitted a liability of Rs7.3 billion, of which an initial amount of Rs3.7 billion has been recovered and it is being distributed among 17,250 victims. The remaining amount will be distributed among victims after its recovery.

Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh last week.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also comes just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.
The Iranian president praised the defence deal while addressing the General Debate of the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) today.
“Iran welcomes the defensive pact between the two brotherly Muslim countries, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, as a beginning for a comprehensive regional security system with the cooperation of the Muslim states of West Asia in the political security and defence domains,” he said.
 


Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had hinted on Friday that some countries were showing interest in building strategic defence agreements with Pakistan following the deal.
“It’s premature to say anything, but some other countries want to enter into an agreement of this nature,” FM Dar had told reporters in London, replying to a question about whether other states will join the pact or ink similar deals.
Iran and Saudi Arabia have often been on opposing sides of regional conflicts, including in Syria and Yemen. The two regional heavyweights broke off diplomatic relations in 2016 before re-establishing them in 2023 under a rapprochement deal brokered by China.
 
 

The two Muslim countries have since been witnessing warming relations with high-level meetings of their leaders.
Saudi Arabia had condemned the Israeli strikes on Iran in May, calling them “aggressions” and a “clear violation of international laws”. Riyadh had also expressed its “great concern” following the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Tells UN Tehran will never seek to build nuclear bomb
President Pezeshkian also said Iran has no intention to build nuclear weapons, just days before international sanctions could be reimposed on his country over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
“I hereby declare once more before this assembly that Iran has never sought and will never seek to build a nuclear bomb. We do not seek nuclear weapons,” Pezeshkian said.
On August 28, Britain, France and Germany launched a 30-day process to reimpose UN sanctions that ends on September 27, accusing Tehran of failing to abide by a 2015 deal with world powers aimed at preventing it from developing a nuclear weapon.
The European powers have offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months to allow space for talks on a long-term deal if Iran restores access for UN nuclear inspectors, addresses concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engages in talks with the US
Pezeshkian criticised the move by European powers as “illegal”, saying it was made at “the behest of the United States of America”.
The US, its European allies and Israel accuse Tehran of using its nuclear programme as a veil for efforts to try to develop the capability to produce weapons. Iran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only.
“In doing so, they (the E3) set aside good faith. They circumvented legal obligations. They sought to portray Iran’s lawful remedial measures … as a gross violation,” Pezeshkian said.
But amid the looming threat of sanctions and last-ditch talks on the sidelines of the UNGA, gaps remain between Tehran and European powers over a deal to avert the snapback of sanctions.
Still, both sides have left the door open to further negotiations. While the E3 says Iran’s clerical rulers have so far failed to meet the conditions it set, Tehran says it will not offer concessions.
 
 

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last say on key state matters such as foreign policy and Iran’s nuclear programme, has ruled out negotiations with the US under threat.
If Tehran and the E3 fail to reach a deal on an extension by the end of September 27, then all UN sanctions will be reimposed on Iran, where the economy already struggles with crippling sanctions reimposed since 2018 after President Donald Trump ditched the pact during his first term.
The so-called “snapback” process would reimpose an arms embargo, a ban on uranium enrichment and reprocessing, a ban on activities with ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, a global asset freeze and travel bans on Iranian individuals and entities.
Soon after the US and Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran’s parliament passed a law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
However, the IAEA and Tehran reached a deal on September 9 to resume inspections at nuclear sites and UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday a team of inspectors was on its way to Iran should Tehran and the E3 strike a deal this week to avert revival of sanctions.</p><small>2025-09-24 20:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625371-at-un-climate-meet-shehbaz-sharif-warns-debt-is-no-solution' target='_blank'><strong>At UN summit, PM Shehbaz warns piling up debt won't solve climate crisis</strong></a><br><p>

The holders posted 168-6 batting first after stumbling following a quick start, but their spinners helped stifle Bangladesh to 127 all out.
The result means Sri Lanka are out of the tournament, with Thursday’s Super Four match between Pakistan and Bangladesh to decide who faces India in Sunday’s final.
 






Abhishek has enjoyed a remarkable start to his T20 international career with 783 runs from 22 matches at a strike-rate of 197.72.
The opener set up victory with another brilliant innings, striking six sixes and five fours in his 37-ball blitz, which ended with a run-out caused by a mix-up with captain Suryakumar Yadav.
Both Abhishek and fellow opener Shubman Gill, who made 29, started cautiously before the two took on left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed, smashing 21 runs off the fourth over.
Abhishek reached his fifty off just 25 balls after Gill fell to leg-spinner Rishad Hossain.
Rishad quickly struck again with the wicket of the promoted Shivam Dube, before the dismissals of Abhishek and Suryakumar, for five off 11 balls, left India on 114-4.
Hardik Pandya ensured India reached a competitive total with a 29-ball 38 with four fours and one six.
Jasprit Bumrah struck first to send back opener Tanzid Hasan for one in the second over of Bangladesh’s chase, before Saif Hassan and Parvez Hossain Emon, who made 21, put on 42 runs to steady the innings.
But Kuldeep Yadav dismissed Parvez, and Bangladesh soon lost their way as the Indian spinners took charge.
Saif, who survived four dropped catches, played a lone hand to raise Bangladesh hopes.
Kuldeep struck twice with successive balls before Nasum played out the hat-trick ball.
Saif finally fell in the 18th over for 69 to Bumrah, and Bangladesh were bowled out in 19.3 overs.
Kuldeep stood out with figures of 3-18 as the left-arm wrist spinner took his tournament tally to 12 wickets in five matches.
Teams:
Bangladesh: Saif Hassan, Tanzid Hasan, Parvez Hossain Emon, Towhid Hridoy, Jaker Ali (captain and wicket-keeper), Shamim Hossain, Rishad Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Mohammad Saifuddin, Mustafizur Rahman
India: Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav (capt), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, and Varun Chakravarthy.</p><small>2025-09-24 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/242156427a5499f.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944359/ecc-green-lights-proposals-for-commercial-import-of-used-vehicles' target='_blank'><strong>ECC green-lights proposals for commercial import of used vehicles</strong></a><br><p>The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Wednesday decided to amend relevant provisions of the Import Policy Order, 2022 to allow the commercial import of used vehicles.
According to a statement issued by the Finance Division, “The ECC considered a summary regarding the commercial import of used vehicles and, after detailed discussion, accorded approval to the proposals.”
Initially, only vehicles not older than five years will be permitted until 30th June 2026, after which the vehicle age limit shall stand removed, it added.
 
 

As per the statement, Federal Finance and Revenue Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the ECC meeting virtually from New York.
The ECC further directed that “such commercial importation would remain subject to strict compliance with prescribed environmental and safety standards”.
“The committee also approved the imposition of 40 per cent regulatory duty in addition to the existing customs duties, on the commercial import of used vehicles (less than five years old),” it added.
“This enhanced duty will remain applicable until 30th June 2026. Thereafter, the duty shall be reduced gradually by 10 percentage points per year, reaching zero by 2029-30, in line with the recommendations of the Tariff Policy Board.”
The statement further read that on another summary moved by the Cabinet Division, the ECC considered and approved a technical supplementary grant of Rs800 million in favour of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
The ECC’s decisions will now be approved by the federal cabinet.
 
 

The meeting was attended by Federal Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik, Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari, federal secretaries and senior officials from concerned ministries and regulatory bodies, the statement concluded.
Last month, local auto parts manufacturers warned of a potential shutdown of Pakistan’s car assembly industry within the next two years if the government proceeded with plans to liberalise the commercial import of used vehicles from September.
Former chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), Aamir Allawala, raised concerns during a media briefing at various vending units, stating that used vehicles already account for 25pc of the market — over 40,000 units annually. In contrast, used car market share stands at zero in India, 0.3pc in Vietnam, and 1.2pc in Thailand, he noted.
Allawala said import duties on completely built-up (CBU) units in Pakistan range from 50–100pc, compared to 125pc in India, 52pc in Vietnam, and 80pc in Thailand. The negligible used car imports in these countries are the result of both tariff and administrative measures, he added.
In May, as the International Monetary Fund was pushing the government for rationalisation of tariffs on the auto industry, the All Pakistan Car Dealers and Importers Association (APCDIA) urged the government to allow the import of used vehicles with certain conditions through banking channels in the budget FY26.
This step will eliminate the outflow of foreign exchange through the kerb market and will promote a documented economy as all transactions will be done through banking channels, the association said, adding that this will not only promote tax culture but also make all importers bound to submit sales data to the Federal Board of Revenue to bring transparency in this process.</p><small>2025-09-24 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24205803cdb9c7c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944360/nccia-arrests-pti-activist-falak-javed-in-azma-bokhari-video-case-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA arrests PTI activist Falak Javed in Azma Bokhari video case: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>PTI social media activist Falak Javed Khan has been arrested by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in a case pertaining to the fake videos of Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari being uploaded on social media, her lawyer said on Wednesday.
The PTI alleged that she was arrested in Islamabad last night.
 






Her lawyer, Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, confirmed to Dawn.com today that she was arrested in the fake videos case.
“My team and I will appear in Lahore District Court tomorrow in Falak Javed’s case. We will provide full legal assistance in Falak Javed’s case. If NCCIA applies for Falak Javed’s physical remand, we will oppose it. The case is being reviewed from all angles,” he said.
 
 

The Punjab minister had sought action last year in July against the persons involved in sharing her edited images on social media. She alleged that Falak edited and spread her images on social media.
The minister said a request was made to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) under the Peca (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) to take action against Falak and others, but the agency did not take any action.
The minister argued that she had been defamed on social media and that her constitutional rights had been violated.
In her petition, she asked the court to order the FIA to take action against the respondents and submit a compliance report.</p><small>2025-09-24 17:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24182625101ffbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944350/cii-clarifies-no-final-decision-yet-on-withholding-tax-issue' target='_blank'><strong>CII clarifies no final decision yet on withholding tax issue</strong></a><br><p>The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) on Wednesday clarified that no final decision had been taken yet on the issue of withholding tax on money transfers and withdrawals after the body earlier declared it to be “un-Islamic”.
The CII made the earlier decision and others at its 243rd meeting today, presided over by CII Chairman Allama Dr Muhammad Raghib Hussain Naeemi, the press release read. “The council declared the withholding tax imposed on withdrawal or transfer of money as excessive and declared it un-Islamic,” the press release said.
As per the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), withholding tax is an advance payment of tax deducted at the time of economic activities specified under certain sections of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 and Sales Tax Act, 1990.
However, a clarification issued later read: “Regarding today’s meeting of the CII, there was an impression that the council had formed a final opinion on the withholding tax, whereas in fact, a few members had an initial discussion on it, in which the members had different opinions. The members said that they would consult experts on this in the next meeting.
“Therefore, it was decided that in the upcoming meeting of the council, it should be discussed in detail and the opinions of the relevant experts should be sought. The council did not take any decision on the issue under discussion.”
As per the earlier press release, decisions were also taken on matters including components in insulin made from pork, the amendment of the diyat law (blood money) and keeping copies of the Holy Quran clean after they have been used for testimony.
“The council did not agree with the proposed amendment bill [to] the diyat law. The council is of the opinion that the Islamic amounts of diyat, namely gold, silver and camels, should remain included in the law, while the bill has deleted silver and made the un-Islamic amount of gold a standard,” the press release read.
Separately, the [CII] expressed reservations over the decision of a two-member bench of the Supreme Court on September 11, 2025, saying that “making iddah and maintenance mandatory for a non-consummated woman in the event of divorce is against the Quran and Sunnah”, the press release read.
In a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman’s right to maintenance (Nafaqa) was neither contingent upon consummation or ‘Rukhsati’ (bridal departure) nor was it subject to her husband’s discretion.
Additionally, the CII declared that human milk storage institutions can be established under specific conditions, but noted that there needs to be mandatory legislation first, with the council included in the process, to “prevent corruption”.
At the request of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the council also recommended that a ringtone should be developed that instructs citizens to respect flags and banners with holy words on them during the month of Rabbiul Awwal.</p><small>2025-09-24 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625341-pakistan-urges-afghan-govt-to-act-decisively-against-terrorist-groups' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges Afghan govt to act decisively against terrorist groups</strong></a><br><p>

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted the operation in the Daraban area, upon the reported presence of terrorists “belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij”.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], 13 Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
The ISPR added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area.
The statement added that these terrorists were involved in “facilitation [of] a suicide bombing attack in Daraban in December 2023, [the] abduction and target killing of government officials and innocent civilians”.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
On September 21, security personnel launched an IBO in the same district, where they killed seven terrorists, including three “Afghan nationals”. In a statement, the ISPR said that the operation was carried out in the Kulachi area upon the presence of “khawarij”.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], seven Indian sponsored khwarij, including three Afghan National khwarij and two suicide bombers, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government, run by the Afghan Taliban, to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil to carry out acts of terror.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-09-24 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625259-opposition-alliance-suffers-blow-after-hamid-raza-resigns-from-ttaps-info-secy-post' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance suffers blow after Hamid Raza resigns from TTAP's info secy post</strong></a><br><p>
