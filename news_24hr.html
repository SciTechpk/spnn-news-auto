Today’s incident comes days after a portion of a building collapsed in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported. The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over 570 buildings declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.
Rescue efforts were underway at the building situated on Fida Hussain Shaikha Road in Lyari’s Baghdadi neighbourhood, according to a statement from the Baghdadi police.
Pakistan Rangers, in a statement, said its personnel were also assisting in the rescue operations and “engaged in rescuing individuals trapped under the rubble”.
The heavy rescue machinery struggled to access the narrow alleys, and police baton-charged residents to clear the way, AFP reported.
Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said the government needed to “take action”, noting that there were around 434 buildings in the Old City area that had been declared “dangerous” by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). A statement by the authority put the number of such buildings across Karachi at 588.
“We have two options: to convince people to move out or force them to evacuate,” Wahab said, adding that any government tries not to take any forced action but to convince people.
“This loss of lives today shows that when the state or the government tells you anything, you should follow it.”
The mayor requested the inhabitants of such dilapidated buildings to evacuate as soon as possible to prevent any unpleasant incident and loss of life or property.
 


Saad Edhi of the Edhi Foundation described the structure to AFP as a “worn-out building”. Police official Arif Aziz told AFP that up to 100 people had been living in the building.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the incident reportedly occurred between 9-9:30am but due to disruption of the communication network, the department received the information late.
He said that as per the residents and relatives, there were still 20-25 people stuck in the rubble and the rescue operation was still under way. He said some families had already realised the gravity of the situation and begun leaving with a few of them having already left the building as its structure had started to deteriorate after the recent rains.
SBCA says issued multiple prior notices to vacate building
Meanwhile, the SBCA said it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.
It said it had received a complaint from the Sindh Human Rights Commission on July 22, 2022, and the authority had thereafter promptly issued the first ejectment notice on June 2, 2023, directing the residents and occupants to vacate the premises.
It said a second notice was issued on February 28, 2024, followed by a third with a three-day final warning and lastly a fourth notice addressed to the managing director of K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) on June 25, 2024, instructing them to disconnect utility services.
The SBCA added that an urgent reminder for ejectment was issued on June 2 with copies sent to the South deputy and assistant commissioners and the Kalari station house officer, requesting their intervention to evacuate the premises and prevent any potential incident.
“On June 29, 2025, the SBCA director also reported that residents were warned via megaphones to evacuate the building immediately.
“Regrettably, the residents were reluctant to vacate the building unless alternate accommodation was provided. Furthermore, the utility agencies, K-Electric, SSGC, and KWSB, did not respond or disconnect services in a timely manner, nor did the district administration paid attention and responded by our issued ejectment notices.
“It is important to note that the monsoon season is ongoing, increasing the risk associated with dangerous structures. According to SBCA records, 588 buildings have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone. The SBCA has repeatedly advertised these threats through print and electronic media.”
It also pointed out that during his tenure, former Sindh chief secretary Sohail Rajput had instructed then-Karachi commissioner Saleem Rajput to take efforts to vacate the buildings declared dangerous by the SBCA Technical Committee. It added that the matter was still pending.
‘We are helpless’: Relatives worry for trapped families
All six family members of 70-year-old Jumho Maheshwari were at his flat on the first floor when he left for work early in the morning.
“Nothing is left for me now — my family is all trapped and all I can do is pray for their safe recovery,” he told AFP.

Another resident, Maya Sham Jee, said her brother’s family was also trapped under the rubble.
“It’s a tragedy for us. The world has been changed for our family,” she told AFP.
“We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.”
Shankar Kamho, aged 30, a resident of the building who was out at the time, said around 20 families were living inside.
“I got a call from my wife saying the building was cracking and I told her to get out immediately,” he told AFP at the scene.
“She went to warn the neighbours, but one woman told her ‘this building will stand for at least 10 more years’. Still, my wife took our daughter and left. About 20 minutes later, the building collapsed.”
Saeed Ghani stresses timely evacuation of unsafe buildings
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a high-level committee has been formed that will submit a report on the incident within three days.
His spokesperson Zubair Memon said the committee has been directed to submit a report identifying the responsible officers and their negligence. The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.
Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Ghani lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously due to the unsafe conditions of the run-down structure.
“Not one but many notices were given to them (residents) to evacuate the building in the past four to six years. But I can also understand the citizens’ struggle.
“[…] On the one hand is your home in which you are residing, [but] on the other hand is your life,” Ghani added, urging residents of other dilapidated structures to evacuate to avoid any disaster.
 






“If we forcibly make them evacuate, then also a humanitarian aspect comes forward, and we have to become a target of criticism for it,” the minister stressed.
Ghani said he had been told that the building was built in 1974. “There is an entire mafia that constructs these illegal buildings in the city; we have taken strict action against them and filed FIRs,” he said, urging citizens not to buy or rent such buildings to “end the demand”.
Taking notice of the incident in a statement, Ghani ordered the top officials of the relevant authorities, including the SBCA, to reach the site of the incident to monitor the rescue efforts.
“A report on the causes of the building collapse and all its reasons should be submitted immediately,” he said in the statement issued by Memon.
“All obstacles around the building should be removed to speed up the rescue operation,” Ghani added.
Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
 
 

In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.
Rescue DG lists ‘hinderances’ in operations
Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said the service’s Central Command and Control Centre received an alert of the incident at 10:53am.
“As soon as the alert was received, the Urban Search and Rescue team, along with a disaster-response vehicle (DRV), immediately reached the site of the incident,” the Rescue 1122 DG asserted.
He detailed that over 100 rescue personnel, five DRVs, two snorkels and multiple ambulances were present at the building’s location. Cranes and lifters have also been dispatched to the site, DG Shaikh added.
He explained that there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.
Mobile services are usually suspended in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.
The Rescue 1122 head affirmed that the operation would continue till the site was “cleared”.

Sindh CM seeks report
Taking notice of the incident, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed that rescue teams immediately rescue those trapped under the rubble, while immediate medical assistance be provided to the injured.
“This is an unfortunate incident; concerned authorities should submit an immediate report,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.
CM Murad also sought details of dilapidated buildings in Karachi from the SBCA.
“Dangerous buildings should be identified immediately and practical steps should be taken to protect citizens,” CM Murad said. “Negligence will not be tolerated; protection of human lives is the top priority.”

Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori expressed his grief over the incident and ordered rescue authorities to conduct “immediate, effective, and coordinated relief operations”.
In a statement, he directed that all available resources be employed to safely rescue those trapped under the rubble, and that “every possible facility” be provided to the affected families.
“Any kind of neglect or carelessness will be intolerable,” Tessori warned.
 






President, PM stress preventing such future incidents
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep grief and sorrow over the incident, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
In separate statements, the president and the premier offered their “heartfelt condolences and sympathies” to the family members of those who lost their lives.
Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured, President Zardari directed the Sindh government to expedite the relief efforts and immediately rescue those trapped under the debris.
The president also ordered that the causes of the incident be determined immediately and that effective measures be implemented to prevent such incidents in the future.
 






PM Shehbaz also issued directives that all possible medical facilities be provided to the injured.
“Such incidents must be prevented in the future by formulating a strategy on a priority basis,” the prime minister stressed.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, chairman of the PPP that governs Sindh, conveyed his condolences to the aggrieved families and wished the injured a quick recovery.
“I assure [the public] that the Sindh government will provide all assistance [needed],” Bilawal said in a statement shared by his party.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, and Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah also expressed their condolences.
Sindh Assembly Syed Awais Qadir Shah, in a statement, highlighted that immediate action must be taken to identify dilapidated buildings and ensure public safety.
Sardar Abdulrahim, information secretary of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), said that further loss of lives could have been avoided if the rescue machinery had reached the site on time.
“A fair of illegal buildings has been set up in the city due to the [Sindh] government’s incompetence,” the GDA leader said.
He demanded that the families of the injured and wounded be provided with financial assistance, that alternate accommodation be arranged for the affected people, and that a case be filed against those responsible for the loss of precious lives.

Air raid sirens, the whine of kamikaze drones and booming detonations reverberated from early evening until dawn as Russia launched what Ukraine’s Air Force said was a total of 539 drones and 11 missiles.
Families huddled in underground metro stations for shelter. Acrid smoke hung over the city centre. Outside a high-rise apartment block damaged by a drone, residents stood around surveying the scene as the clean-up job began. Some cried. Others looked on silently.
“I woke up to the sound of explosions, first the Shahed drones started buzzing, and then the explosions began,” said 40-year-old resident Maria Hilchenko. “Then people started screaming outside. The explosions from the Shaheds kept coming.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack “deliberately massive and cynical”.
“Notably, the first air raid alerts in our cities and regions yesterday began to blare almost simultaneously with media reports discussing a phone call between President Trump and Putin,” Zelensky said on X.
“Yet again, Russia is showing it has no intention of ending the war and terror,” he added, calling for increased pressure on Russia and more air defence equipment.
 






Kyiv officials said the attack damaged about 40 apartment blocks, passenger railway infrastructure, five schools and kindergartens, cafes and many cars in six of Kyiv’s 10 districts. Poland said the consular section of its embassy was damaged in central Kyiv, adding that staff were unharmed.
Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram that 14 of the injured were taken to the hospital.
Ukraine’s state-owned railway Ukrzaliznytsia, the country’s largest carrier, said on Telegram that the attack on Kyiv forced them to divert a number of passenger trains, causing delays.
Damage was recorded on both sides of the wide Dnipro River bisecting the capital, and falling drone debris set a medical facility on fire in the leafy Holosiivskyi district, Klitschko said.
Russian airstrikes on Kyiv have intensified in recent weeks and included some of the deadliest assaults of the war on the city of 3 million people.
Call for sanctions
Trump said that the call with Putin on Thursday resulted in no progress at all on efforts to end the war, and the Kremlin reiterated that Moscow would keep pushing to solve the conflict’s “root causes”.
Speaking to reporters on his return to Washington from a trip to Iowa, Trump said, “I’m very disappointed with the conversation I had today with President Putin, because I don’t think he’s there, and I’m very disappointed.
“I’m just saying I don’t think he’s looking to stop, and that’s too bad.”
The decision by Washington to halt some shipments of critical weapons to Ukraine prompted warnings by Kyiv that the move would weaken its ability to defend against intensifying airstrikes and battlefield advances.
On Friday, Zelensky called for increased pressure on Moscow to change its “dumb, destructive behaviour”.
“For every such strike against people and human life, they must feel appropriate sanctions and other blows to their economy, their revenues, and their infrastructure,” he said.
Ukraine’s Air Force said it destroyed 478 of the air weapons Russia launched overnight. However, airstrikes were recorded in eight locations across Ukraine, with nine missiles and 63 drones, it added.
Social media videos showed people running to seek shelter, firefighters fighting blazes in the dark and ruined buildings with windows and facades blown out.
Both sides deny targeting civilians in the war that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion in February 2022. Thousands of civilians have been killed in the conflict, the vast majority of them Ukrainian. Many more soldiers are believed to have been killed on the front line, but neither side releases military casualty figures.
Late on Thursday, Russian shelling killed five people in and near the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, Ukraine said.
Trump, Zelensky discuss weapons, escalating Russian strikes
Zelensky said he discussed air defences in a conversation with Trump later on Friday, agreeing to work on increasing Kyiv’s capability to “defend the sky” as Russian attacks escalate.
He added in a message on Telegram that he discussed joint defence production, as well as joint purchases and investments with the US leader.
Ukraine has been asking Washington to sell it more Patriot missiles and systems that it sees as key to defending its cities from intensifying Russian air strikes.
A decision by Washington to halt some shipments of weapons to Ukraine prompted warnings by Kyiv that the move would weaken its ability to defend against Russia’s airstrikes and battlefield advances. Germany said it is in talks on buying Patriot air defence systems to bridge the gap.
One source briefed on the call told Reuters they were optimistic that supplies of Patriot missiles could resume after what they called a “very good” conversation between the presidents.
US outlet Axios reported, citing unnamed sources, that the call lasted around 40 minutes, and that Trump told Zelensky he would check what US weapons due to be sent to Ukraine, if any, had been put on hold.
Zelensky, speaking later in his nightly video address, said he and Trump had agreed to “arrange a meeting between our teams to strengthen air defences.
“We had a very detailed discussion on joint production. We need it, America needs it.”
Speaking to reporters as he left Washington for Iowa earlier on Friday, Trump said “we haven’t” completely paused the flow of weapons but blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for sending so many weapons that it risked weakening US defences.
“We’re giving weapons, but we’ve given so many weapons. But we are giving weapons,” he said. “And we’re working with them and trying to help them, but we haven’t [completely stopped]. You know, Biden emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.”
The pause in US weapons shipments caught Ukraine off guard and generated widespread confusion about Trump’s current views on the conflict, after saying last week he would try to free up a Patriot missile defence system for use by Kyiv.
Ukrainian leaders called in the acting US envoy to Kyiv on Wednesday to underline the importance of military aid from Washington, and caution that the pause in its weapons shipments would weaken Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russia.
The Pentagon’s move has meant a cut in deliveries of the Patriot defence missiles that Ukraine relies on to destroy fast-moving ballistic missiles, Reuters reported on Wednesday.</p><small>2025-07-04 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612444-if-india-wants-more-action-against-terrorists-it-must-hold-talks-with-pakistan-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>If India wants more action against terrorists, it must hold talks with Pakistan: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

An internal inquiry committee — formed to probe the deaths of only five children on June 19 — reported the deaths of 20 children, raising many serious questions. The findings confirmed that 15 of the 20 deceased were neonates and newborn babies, while all 20 deaths occurred between June 16 and June 22.
A three-member external inquiry committee was formed to investigate the incident, particularly the reported oxygen failure, links between the fatalities and systemic shortcomings and the hospital’s emergency response.
A statement issued today said that during a five-hour visit to the hospital, CM Maryam ordered the arrest of the chief executive officer and medical superintendent. She also suspended and launched inquiries against three pediatric doctors for alleged negligence.
Three laboratory technicians were also arrested for referring patients to their privately run labs operating outside hospital premises.
 






She directed Deputy Commissioner (DC) Maria Tariq to relinquish her charge and report to the Services and General Administration Department.
Upon arrival, CM Maryam was briefed on the preliminary findings of the two external inquiry committee reports.
A representative from the provincial health department and Sahiwal Commissioner Asif Tufail presented the final report. Commissioner Tufail revealed that many infant deaths were linked to the referral of critical newborns from an unregistered private maternity hospital run by traditional midwives and quacks.
He confirmed that oxygen shortage was not a factor, citing the availability of 45 oxygen cylinders at the facility.
He further said that the hospital had failed to follow the protocols of the Punjab Healthcare Commission in running as a major facility in the district.
Subsequently, the health department sealed the operating theatres of four unauthorised private hospitals: Al-Farid Hospital, Doctor Hospital, Shahid Hospital and Ali Hospital.
During the briefing, PML-N MPA Choudhry Javed advocated for upgrading the local nursing college, constructing a multipurpose hall and developing the Western Loop Bypass in Pakpattan City. The chief minister assured that development funds would be allocated as needed.
CM Maryam also ordered action against the owner and the in-charge of the hospital’s parking contractor for overcharging Rs50-100 in excess parking fees.
A comprehensive audit of all medical equipment in the DHQ hospital was initiated. She mandated the implementation of emergency response systems, “Code Red” and “Code Blue”, across all public hospitals in Punjab.
CM Maryam visited multiple wards, laboratories, and the medical store, engaging directly with staff, patients and technicians. Some citizens complained that even basic medicines such as aspirin were unavailable in the emergency ward.
She expressed anger and questioned how patients were forced to purchase medicines externally despite a provincial allocation of Rs100 billion for medicines.
The chief minister said that essential drugs were reportedly available in hospital stores but were not reaching patients.
A letter by Senior Head Nurse Salma Tufail had recently surfaced online in which she had warned the hospital medical superintendent of impending oxygen shortage and the urgent need to maintain supply records.
The letter — written in the first week of June — was circulated on social media. It contradicted the statements of the Pakpattan district health authority chief executive officer who had categorically stated that there was no shortage of oxygen in the pediatric ward during the first three weeks of June.
DC Tariq had questioned the letter’s authenticity, stating, “She (Salma Tufail) submitted that oxygen was available and her letter only requested better documentation.”</p><small>2025-07-04 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04213200a3fab54.jpg?r=215845' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922101/no-bar-on-extraditing-individuals-of-concern-if-india-cooperates-says-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>No bar on extraditing ‘individuals of concern’ if India cooperates, says Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Friday said Pakistan had no objection to extraditing “individuals of concern” to India as a confidence-building measure, as long as New Delhi showed willingness to cooperate in the process.
Ties between Pakistan and India have remained tense, further strained after New Delhi, without presenting evidence, blamed Pakistan for the deadly April attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This led to a four-day military confrontation in May, with both sides dropping their guns after American intervention.
The PPP chairman has repeatedly called for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace.
Speaking during an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera, the PPP chief responded to a question about extraditing Laskhar-i-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed and Jaish-i-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as possible concessions and good-faith gestures to India.
“As part of a comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan, where terrorism is one of the issues that we discuss, I am sure Pakistan would not be opposed to any of these things,” Bilawal said.
Both LeT and JeM have been banned by Pakistan, according to the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), while Saeed is currently serving a 33-year sentence for terror financing and Azhar has been proscribed by Nacta.
Bilawal added that cases prosecuted against these “individuals” were those related to Pakistan, such as terrorist financing. However, he noted that prosecuting them for cross-border terrorism was difficult due to noncompliance from Delhi.
“India is refusing to comply with certain basic elements that require that conviction to take place,” he explained. “It’s important … to present evidence within these courts, for people to come over from India to testify, to put up with whatever the counter-accusations will be.
“If India is willing to be cooperative in that process, I am sure there will be no hurdle in extraditing any individual of concern.”
 


‘New abnormal’
Bilawal also expressed concern about India’s vow to pursue terrorists, calling it a “new abnormal”.
“The new normal or the new abnormal that India would like to impose in the subcontinent … is that any terrorist attack within India means war with Pakistan,” he said. “This does not serve the interests of Pakistan, and it does not serve the interests of India.
“Two nuclear-armed countries have got to the point that they have reduced the threshold for military conflict … to this level, which in effect means that we leave the destiny of 1.7 billion people not in the hands of the Pakistani or Indian government, but to nameless, faceless non-state actors,” he added.
Pressed on the whereabouts of Saeed and Azhar, Bilawal stated that the former was incarcerated, while stating that Islamabad believes the latter is in Afghanistan.
“It is factually not correct that Hafiz Saeed is a free man; he is in the custody of the Pakistani state,” he maintained, stating that Islamabad has been unable to arrest Azhar.
“It is our belief that he is in Afghanistan,” Bilawal stated. “If and when the Indian government shares information that he is on Pakistani soil, we will be more than happy to arrest him.
“But the fact is that the Indian government is not referring to them, nor any of these individuals involved in the terrorist attack that justified this war,” the PPP chief continued.
“We went to war on a lie. This is a precedent that has been set and India is trying to exploit: you cry terrorist and attack a sovereign, Muslim country.”</p><small>2025-07-04 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04162501c9061f9.jpg?r=223117' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922079/at-eco-summit-pm-shehbaz-calls-for-regional-cooperation-to-confront-global-challenges' target='_blank'><strong>At ECO Summit, PM Shehbaz calls for regional cooperation to confront global challenges</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday urged stronger regional cooperation in the face of increasing geopolitical tensions, including the Iran-Israel conflict and Indian hostility towards Pakistan, stressing that the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) offered the country its “best hope” for a unified response.
Addressing the 17th ECO Summit in Azerbaijan’s Khankendi city, the prime minister said two recent events — the Iran-Israel war and the India-Pakistan conflict — showed that “the forces of instability and chaos continue to destabilise our region for geo-political agendas.
“The evolving global landscape has made regional cooperation even more essential,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing the 10-nation Eurasian bloc. “ECO represents our best hope, and Pakistan is a proud partner in these collective efforts.”
Speaking about the 12-day Iran-Israel war, he said that “the unlawful, uncalled for and unjustified Israeli attack on Iran was the most recent manifestation of this dangerous trend.”
According to Iran’s health ministry, at least 627 people were killed and 4,870 wounded in Israeli strikes.
“Pakistan condemns this act of Israeli aggression against Iran and offers our condolences to the martyrs,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also condemned the recent Indian aggression against Pakistan and New Delhi’s attempts to weaponise water by holding the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance.
“The unprovoked and reckless Indian hostility directed at Pakistan after an unfortunate incident in India’s illegally occupied Kashmir was yet another attempt to destabilise regional peace.
“The world saw the steadfast determination of our armed forces under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir and the unyielding spirit of our resilient people who stood firm in the face of provocation and responded with courage and professionalism.”
India had launched missile attacks on several Pakistani cities after baselessly accusing Islamabad of backing an attack on held Kashmir’s Pahalgam town, which saw the killing of 26 tourists on April 22.
In response, Pakistan downed five Indian jets and launched retaliatory strikes on India. It took US intervention on May 10 for both countries to reach a ceasefire.
“We are witnessing a new and alarming trend with India’s weaponisation of water, illegal attempt to defy the World Bank-negotiated Indus Water Treaty and its blatant disregard for the recent ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) are unacceptable and should be rejected with contempt.”
Last week, the PCA in The Hague issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. However, India “categorically rejected” the PCA’s supplemental award and stated that it did not recognise the court itself.
PM Shehbaz said the Indus waters were the lifeline of Pakistan’s 240 million people and India couldn’t be allowed to “pursue this dangerous path that will be regarded as an act of aggression by the people of Pakistan”.
The prime minister also voiced concerns over the situation in Gaza and the ongoing Israeli strikes there, which have killed more than 57,000 Palestinians since October 7, 2023.
“The world is witnessing an unprecedented man-made catastrophe in Gaza, a region that has descended into an abyss of perpetual suffering,” the premier said.
“It is as if humanity no longer exists as famine looms large, while humanitarian workers, including UN personnel, are being attacked with impunity by Israel to cut off the only lifeline of the helpless and starving people of Gaza.”
He said Pakistan stood firmly against those who “perpetrate barbaric acts against innocent people, whether in Gaza, occupied Kashmir or Iran”.
Regarding the effects of climate change, the prime minister said Pakistan had undertaken a series of climate-related policy initiatives focused on the government’s Resilience, Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework (4RF).
He proposed the development of low-emission corridors, ECO-wide carbon market platforms and a regional disaster resistance system.
Earlier in the day, PM Shehbaz held a bilateral meeting with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev on the sidelines of the ECO Summit.
The two leaders expressed satisfaction over the progress made regarding investment prospects and agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of trade and investment.
They reiterated their resolve to strengthen the economic partnership, especially Azerbaijan’s investment in Pakistan, according to a statement by the PM’s Office.
PM Shehbaz reaffirmed that the recent interactions between the leadership of both countries helped in making the relationship even stronger. He also invited President Aliyev to visit Pakistan.
In a post on X, the prime minister said he congratulated President Aliyev on “successfully hosting the summit and lauded Azerbaijan’s proactive role in ECO”.
 






He said they “reviewed the progress in Pakistan-Azerbaijan bilateral ties, which are growing stronger through our frequent and productive high-level exchanges”.
“We reaffirmed our commitment to deepen cooperation across diverse sectors, particularly trade and investment,” he added.
The prime minister also met Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian discussed regional developments following the recent Israel-Iran war, said a statement issued by the Press Information Department.
“During the meeting, both leaders reviewed the ongoing bilateral cooperation across all areas and expressed satisfaction over the progress made on the decisions taken during their last meeting for further strengthening of Pakistan-Iran relations,” it added.
PM Shehbaz appreciated Pezeshkian’s leadership and lauded Iran’s decision to reach a ceasefire during the recent conflict, according to the press release.
The premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unwavering solidarity” with Iran’s government and people, as well as its strong commitment to continue working closely with Iran for “peace in the region through dialogue and diplomacy”.
“President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s strong diplomatic support to Iran, including at the international forums, during the crisis and thanked him for Pakistan’s vital role in de-escalating the conflict,” according to the statement.
The prime minister requested the Iranian president to convey his warm greetings and good wishes to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, it added.
 






The premier also met Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
“We agreed to deepen our robust partnership, on all areas of mutual interest especially in trade, connectivity, energy, culture and the landmark Trans-Afghan Railway Project.”
 






Azerbaijan inks $2bn investment in Pakistan’s economic sector
Later, Azerbaijan signed an agreement with Pakistan to invest $2 billion in its economic sector.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Azerbaijan’s Minister of Economy Mikayil Jabbarov signed the agreement in the presence of PM Shehbaz and a Pakistani delegation.
“Following a pleasant meeting today in Khankendi between the prime minister and the Azerbaijani president, the agreement was signed between the two countries, while the final and detailed agreement will be signed during the Azerbaijani president’s visit to Pakistan,” PTV reported.
Though it did not provide details, PTV reported that the agreement “elevated the investment and trade relations between the two countries to a historic level”.

The pay hike was announced as part of the budget for the coming fiscal year, where the salaries of federal employees from Grade 1 to 22 would be raised by 10pc and retired government servants would be eligible for a 7pc pension increase.
According to one of the notifications, dated July 4, basic pay to armed forces personnel, civil armed forces, and civil employees of the federal government are subject to the pay raise.
The notification read that the pay would be “subject to income tax; admissible during leave and entire period of LPR except during extraordinary leave; will not be treated as part of emoluments for the purpose of calculation of pension/gratuity and recovery of house rent.”
It further said that the pay would “not be admissible to the employees during the tenure of their posting/deputation abroad; and will be admissible to the employees on their repatriation from posting/deputation abroad at the rate and amount which would have been admissible to them had they not been posted abroad”.
A separate notification, also dated July 4, read that federal government employees from Grades 1-22 could draw on DRA at 30pc of basic pay. The grant applies to those employees already drawing on DRA.
“For those employees who have been appointed on or after July 1, 2022, this allowance will be admissible on the basis of the relevant initial Basic Pay Scale of 2017,” the notification stated.
Last month, the government approved an over fivefold increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker, taking it to Rs1.3 million a month.
A May 29 notification revealed that the Senate chairman and NA speaker’s salaries have been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50pc of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance.
The hike, with a retrospective effect, was effective in January 2025.
Meanwhile, in May, President Asif Ali Zardari promulgated an ordinance to increase the salaries of federal ministers and ministers of state to match those of National Assembly members (MNAs).
The National Assembly’s Finance Committee, headed by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, approved the proposed increase of the monthly salary of each MNA and senator to Rs519,000. Previously, lawmakers received a monthly salary of Rs180,000.
“The federal ministers and ministers of state shall receive a monthly salary equivalent to the salary of a member of the National Assembly,” read the ordinance.</p><small>2025-07-04 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0412464466e1558.jpg?r=124917' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922052/over-5500-police-personnel-deployed-across-karachi-for-8th-muharram-processions-today' target='_blank'><strong>Over 5,500 police personnel deployed across Karachi for 8th Muharram processions today</strong></a><br><p>More than 5,500 police personnel will be deployed across Karachi on Friday for the security of 8th Muharram processions.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), which will be observed on Sunday.
According to the Karachi police, as many as 829 processions and 5,227 majalis are scheduled to take place during the first 10 days of Muharram.
“Karachi police [are] performing [their] duties at various locations in the city for the security of the 8th Muharram  processions,” said a statement from the office of Karachi’s additional inspector general of police.
A total of 5,543 police officers and personnel will be present to monitor and secure the central procession, the statement added.
It continued that apart from senior officers and 4,957 constables and head constables of the Karachi police, 586 NGOs will also be performing duty for the security of the central procession. Expert police snipers will also be deployed alongside the main procession.
“Traffic police officers and personnel have been deployed to maintain traffic flow on main procession routes and crossings, including alternative traffic routes arranged for the 8th Muharram procession, so as to keep the traffic flowing and keep the public safe from any inconvenience,” the statement said.
“The Karachi police are providing complete security to the mourners participating in the 8th Muharram processions.”
The statement urged the public to keep an eye on their surroundings and immediately inform the police on Madadgar 15 of any suspicious or unusual situation.
Separately, Karachi police said that Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Javed Alam Odho visited the Jama Cloth Market near Iqbal Centre to review the security arrangements for the main procession.
He met with the organisers of the procession and discussed security-related matters, while also directing
the officers and personnel present at the spot to ensure “foolproof” security during the procession.
The statement added that surveillance was being carried out at the procession routes through CCTV cameras and the Command and Control Centre.

In another statement, Karachi police said that South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali also reviewed security arrangements for the procession near the city’s southern district.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza was also present, along with other police officers.
The main procession started from Numaish Chowrangi and entered the limits of South district from Taj Medical Complex through the designated routes to finally end at Hussainia Irani Imam Bargah.
SSP Ali met the officers and personnel deployed on the procession route, instructing them to remain fully alert during duty. He directed the security personnel to keep an eye on any suspicious people, vehicles and objects around the procession to prevent any untoward incident.
He also met the organisers of the procession and conducted a joint inspection of the route, assuring them of providing complete security.
A day earlier, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said a total of 49,662 police personnel will be deployed across Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas, and Shaheed Benazirabad from 8th Muharram till Ashura to prevent any untoward incident.
He added that 14,546 police personnel would be deployed for security of majalis, while 35,116 to protect Muharram processions. He further said that over 14,000 additional personnel had been assigned to ensure security of all events.
 
 

Also on Thursday, the Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) issued a traffic plan for 8-10th Muharram, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
According to the KTP plan, Muharram processions on all three days will depart from Nishtar Park and culminate at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah after following their traditional fixed routes.
Due to security reasons, MA Jinnah Road will remain closed from Guru Mandir to Tower. Additionally, vehicles performing sabeel, niaz or tabarruk were instructed to enter the procession route at Tower/Memon Mosque.
Lahore arrangements
Meanwhile, Punjab Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said in a statement that the rescue service’s secretary reviewed the final arrangements for Ashura and Muharram 9 on the chief minister’s instructions and over 12,000 personnel would be deployed on the weekend.
Rescue 1122 Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer said the arrangements included 815 ambulances, 2,166 motorbikes, 316 fire and rescue emergency vehicles to be deployed.
He said over 1,350 staff would be deployed in Lahore, including 55 emergency ambulances, 300 rescue motorbikes, 44 fire and rescue and specialised emergency vehicles.
Naseer said that additional rescue posts would be set up at more than 1,000 important places on Ashura and Muharram 9 across Punjab and the Provincial Monitoring Cell would oversee all rescue operations. In case of any major emergency or challenging situation, immediate relief teams will also respond from the nearby districts, he said.
He added that district officers would also monitor all operations and keep the Provincial Monitoring Cell updated.
Along with the Ashura arrangements, Naseer said that routine rescue operations would also continue and district officers would mark alternative routes for the provision of immediate rescue services.
Naseer added that providing immediate rescue services to the general public would be ensured at all costs. “In case of any negligence, laziness or shortcomings, strict disciplinary action will be taken immediately,” he said.
Naseer directed citizens to dial 1122 immediately from the mobile app, landline and PTCL in case of an urban emergency.
‘We will not allow anti-state elements to disturb peace’
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (Operations) Faisal Kamran stated that the Lahore Police was fully prepared to respond to any unforeseen situation during Muharram.
According to a statement from the police, Kamran affirmed that “anti-state elements will not be allowed to disrupt the peace of the city, and the duty of protecting citizens will be fulfilled at all costs.”
He made the remarks while inspecting the security setup for processions emerging from inner-city Mori Gate, as well as at Qasr-i-Batool Imam Bargah in Iqbal Town, Ali Raza Abad and other sensitive areas, the statement said.
“He (Kamran) closely examined the entry and exit points of processions, monitoring the checking process for all incoming participants,” the statement read. “He issued essential instructions to officers and Dolphin squads stationed at duty points, emphasising that no individual should be allowed to enter the gatherings without thorough physical screening.”
According to the statement, the DIG instructed officials to remain vigilant of suspicious individuals, unattended bags, and unusual activity, additionally directing that motorcycles and vehicles be parked at safe distances from procession routes.
“Complete adherence to the designated routes and timings of majalis and processions must be ensured,” the statement read.
DIG Kamran was quoted as saying that strict searches are being conducted at the city’s entry and exit points as part of a broader security framework. He appealed to citizens to “cooperate with police personnel during security checks in order to maintain a peaceful environment in Lahore”.</p><small>2025-07-04 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04192915291465c.jpg?r=192938' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922097/karachi-police-arrest-primary-suspect-in-ittehad-town-gang-rape-case' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Police arrest primary suspect in Ittehad Town gang-rape case</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi Police on Friday said they had arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.
In a statement issued today, Keamari Senior Superintendent of Police Captain (retired) Faizan Ali said that the Ittehad Town Police had registered the gang-rape case a day ago.
He said the incident had occurred on July 1 when the detained suspect had forcibly taken away the victim on his bike to his dera (sitting place) in Ittehad Town, where he gang-raped her along with his friends.
“The rape survivor managed to escape from the place at night and reached the home of her maternal uncle and later on informed the police about the incident,” he said, adding that her medical examination was carried out at the Civil Hospital Karachi and a case was subsequently registered.
“The main suspect was arrested within hours after the registration of the case, while efforts are underway to arrest other suspects.
“Such beasts are cancer for the society and they will be taken to task,” the SSP vowed.
Despite the presence of laws such as Sections 375-A and 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribe life imprisonment or death for gang rape and up to 25 years for rape, sexual violence against women remains pervasive.
In May this year,  a student was found murdered in a seminary in the Gadap area and an autopsy revealed that he was raped before being killed.
In February, a sessions court sentenced a man to 10 years in prison for raping a minor boy in a Lyari area.
According to a report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO), conviction rates remain dismally low, around 0.5 per cent nationwide in 2024 and under 5pc in other studies.
More than 500 women and underage girls were sexually assaulted in Karachi alone during the year 2023, which also saw 4,042 cases of physical assault on them, a police surgeon had told Dawn.com</p><small>2025-07-04 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612397-ms-ceo-of-dhq-hospital-pakpattan-arrested-over-deaths-of-20-children' target='_blank'><strong>MS, CEO of DHQ Hospital Pakpattan arrested over deaths of 20 children</strong></a><br><p>

The accident occurred at a sharp bend on the Neelum Valley road near Chilyana village, approximately 50 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad.
Chilyana is located across from the Indian-occupied village of Titwal on the opposite bank of the Neelum River, a point that once served as a foot-crossing under the cross-Line of Control (LoC) travel arrangement before activity came to a halt in 2019.
“Shortly after Friday prayers, a vehicle … went out of the driver’s control while negotiating a dangerous curve near Chilyana,” Akhtar Ayoub, the Neelum Valley District Disaster Management Officer (DDMO), told Dawn.com.
“It rolled down the mountain slope but stopped just short of entering the river; otherwise, it would have been swept away by the violent current,” he added.
Ayoub said that upon receiving reports about the incident, a Rescue 1122 emergency unit was immediately dispatched from the district headquarters in Athmuqam.
“Police personnel, army troops, and a large number of local residents also reached the scene and took part in the recovery operation,” he said.
During the operation, the bodies of five women and one man were recovered and transported by Rescue 1122 to a nearby army unit in Nauseri, where they were identified and handed over to the bereaved family, Ayoub outlined.
According to Ayoub, the deceased hailed from Botha Tanda, a village on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad, and were on their way to Jura town in the valley to visit relatives.
They were identified as Ameer Khan, 65; his wife, Gulshan Bibi, 50; his daughters, Naima Bibi, 23, and Mishal Bibi, 21; and his relatives, Sundas, 27, and Halima Basheer, 27.
Meanwhile, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Minister for Law Mian Abdul Waheed, and PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir expressed deep sorrow over the tragic loss of lives.
In their condolence messages, they extended sympathies to the bereaved family and urged motorists to exercise extra caution while driving on the region’s mountainous roads.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.
In May, an assistant director, three inspectors and a constable of the AJK police lost their lives when their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine in the Poonch division.
According to a statement from the central control room, a police pickup truck was travelling along the Toli Pir–Lasdanna Road when the tragic accident occurred around 6:30pm near a place known as Chatti Dhok.
“The vehicle skidded off the road and tumbled hundreds of feet down the mountainside, crashing into trees and rocks before being reduced to the wreckage,” said Khalid Kiani, an official at the police control room in Rawalakot.</p><small>2025-07-04 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04184922b7ee205.jpg?r=190412' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922094/syria-ready-to-work-with-us-to-return-to-1974-disengagement-deal-with-israel' target='_blank'><strong>Syria ready to work with US to return to 1974 disengagement deal with Israel</strong></a><br><p>Syria said on Friday it was willing to cooperate with the United States to reimplement the 1974 disengagement agreement with Israel, which created a UN-patrolled buffer zone separating the two countries’ forces.
In a statement following a phone call with his US counterpart Marco Rubio, Asaad al-Shaibani expressed Syria’s “aspiration to cooperate with the United States to return to the 1974 disengagement agreement”.
Washington has been pushing diplomatic efforts towards a normalisation deal between Syria and Israel, with envoy Thomas Barrack saying last week that peace between the two was now needed.
Speaking to The New York Times, Barrack confirmed this week that Syria and Israel were engaging in “meaningful” US-brokered talks to end their border conflict.
Following the toppling of longtime Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Israel deployed its troops into the UN-patrolled zone separating Syrian and Israeli forces.
It has also launched hundreds of air strikes on military targets in Syria and carried out incursions deeper into the country’s south.
Syria and Israel have technically been in a state of war since 1948.
Israel conquered around two-thirds of the Golan Heights from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, before annexing it in 1981 in a move not recognised by much of the international community.
A year after the 1973 war, the two reached an agreement on a disengagement line.
As part of the deal, an 80-kilometre-long (50-mile) United Nations-patrolled buffer zone was created to the east of Israeli-occupied territory, separating it from the Syrian-controlled side.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Monday that his country had an “interest” in normalising ties with Syria and neighbouring Lebanon.
He however added that the Golan Heights “will remain part of the State of Israel” under any future peace agreement.
Syrian state media reported on Wednesday that “statements concerning signing a peace agreement with the Israeli occupation at this time are considered premature”.</p><small>2025-07-04 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612393-pm-shehbaz-urges-eco-states-to-strengthen-cooperation-on-climate-regional-issues' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz urges ECO states to strengthen cooperation on climate, regional issues</strong></a><br><p>

CCTV footage released by the police showed the lion jumping the barrier around its home and pursuing a woman carrying her shopping on Thursday night.
The lion jumped on her back, knocking her to the ground, the footage showed.
A police report quoted the father as saying the lion then turned to his five-year-old and seven-year-old children, and clawed their arms and faces.
All three were taken to the hospital but were not in critical condition.

The owners who ran out of the house were “amused to see their lion attack” the passersby, the father added in the report.
Police said on Friday they had arrested three men.
“The suspects fled from the spot, taking the lion with them. They were arrested within 12 hours of the incident,” the office of the Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations told AFP.
The lion, an 11-month-old male, was confiscated by police and sent to a wildlife park. Officials at the facility said that the animal appeared to be in good health.
 
 

Keeping exotic animals, especially big cats, as pets has long been seen as a sign of privilege and power in Punjab.
In December 2024, an adult lion escaped from its enclosure in another neighbourhood of Lahore, terrorising residents before being shot dead by a security guard.
The incident prompted the provincial government to pass new laws regulating the sale, purchase, breeding and ownership of big cats. The law now requires owners to obtain licenses for the animals which are barred from being kept in residential areas.

Scores of people die each year during the rainy season due to flash floods and landslides across India, a country of 1.4 billion people.
Rivers swollen by lashing rain, including the mighty Beas, which starts from the region’s glacial peaks, disrupted several routes in the state of Himachal Pradesh.
The “cumulative damage” includes 69 people dead, and 110 others injured in different incidents over the past two weeks, the state’s revenue department said in a statement.
India’s meteorological department on Thursday issued a fresh alert for “heavy to very heavy rainfall” in Himachal Pradesh and neighbouring Uttarakhand, another picturesque Himalayan state popular with Indian tourists.
India’s annual monsoon season from June to September offers respite from the intense summer heat and is crucial for replenishing water supplies, but also brings widespread death and destruction.
Heavy monsoon rains claimed at least 30 lives and injured dozens in India’s remote northeast region in June.
 
 

It led to the Brahmaputra, another major river that originates in the Himalayas, overflowing into nearby towns and villages in India’s state of Assam.
Other instances of landslides and flash floods were also reported in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Manipur, with authorities pressing the Indian military to aid in relief and rescue operations.
South Asia is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting monsoons.
Last month, India’s financial capital Mumbai was swamped by monsoon rain that began two weeks earlier than usual, the earliest for nearly a quarter of a century, according to weather forecasters.</p><small>2025-07-04 12:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04165155e6099f3.png?r=165350' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922078/pakistan-through-to-u13-u15-finals-at-asian-junior-squash-championship' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan through to U13, U15 finals at Asian junior squash championship</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan continued their dominance on the squash courts as four players advanced to the finals of the 32nd Asian Junior Individual Squash Championships in Gimcheon, South Korea, on Friday.

The announcements were made as Iqbal chaired a meeting of the National Task Force on Artificial Intelligence. Formed in April 2023, the body is working to develop a 10-year roadmap for accelerated adoption of AI in different sectors.
According to a statement from the Press Information Department, during the meeting, Iqbal emphasised that it was time for Pakistan to move with clarity and purpose.
“He stated that AI adoption cannot be advanced in isolation and must instead be guided by cross-sectoral collaboration, alignment with national priorities, and effective coordination across all relevant institutions,” the statement read.
It added that the taskforce was assigned a clear mandate to identify twelve key sectors, including education, health, agriculture, climate, business, and governance, where AI applications can generate measurable national benefits.
 






“Each sector will establish a multi-stakeholder working group, comprising experts from government, academia, and the private sector. These groups will develop sector-specific AI roadmaps, with defined objectives, timelines, and resource requirements,” the statement said. “The purpose is to ensure that Pakistan not only aligns with global technological trends but also maximises the utility of AI in solving domestic challenges.”
The minister also directed the establishment of a national AI fund to provide financial support for innovative ideas and pilot projects. To utilise these resources effectively, he called for the mapping of AI experts, research centres, and resources across the country.
Iqbal, according to the statement, instructed the task force to organise a national AI workshop in collaboration with the Pakistan IT Industry Association (P@SHA) and other relevant industry bodies to provide a platform for dialogue between government, academia, and industry.
“It will focus on designing practical AI solutions tailored to Pakistan’s development context,” the statement read.
Last year, Iqbal inaugurated a three-day international conference on 3D printing and vacuum technology at the National Centre for Physics (NCP) at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, calling on scientists, researchers and innovators to work tirelessly to position Pakistan at the forefront of technological advancements.</p><small>2025-07-04 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/041540161d89df7.jpg?r=154635' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922074/body-of-liverpool-footballer-jota-arrives-in-portugal-for-hometown-wake' target='_blank'><strong>Body of Liverpool footballer Jota arrives in Portugal for hometown wake</strong></a><br><p>The bodies of Liverpool footballer Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva arrived in northern Portugal on Friday for a wake in their hometown, as tributes continued to pour in after they died in a car accident in Spain.
A convoy of hearses left for Gondomar near Porto on Thursday evening from the morgue of Puebla de Sanabria, near where the Lamborghini the brothers were travelling in had veered off the road and burst into flames after midnight early on Thursday. Police said they suspected a tyre had burst.
Jota’s wife Rute Cardoso, who had married the footballer just weeks earlier, was seen leaving the morgue and joining the convoy, as was Jota’s longtime agent Jorge Mendes.
A wake is expected to take place at a chapel in Gondomar from 4pm (8pm PKT) and a funeral on Saturday at a church nearby at 10am local time, Gondomar’s mayor’s office said.
Portugal’s Prime Minister Luis Montenegro arrived in the village on Friday morning.

The death of Jota at the age of 28 has jolted the world of football, with messages of homage pouring in from former teammates, clubs, national leaders and fans.
Outside Liverpool’s Anfield stadium fans left flowers, scarves and hand-written notes, many from children.
Football clubs including Paris St Germain, who have several Portuguese internationals in their squad, Bayern Munich, Chelsea and Real Madrid observed a moment of silence during training for their matches in the Club World Cup taking place in the United States.
Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca said on Thursday that forward Pedro Neto was weighing whether to play in Friday’s quarter-final against Palmeiras, as the Portuguese international mourns the tragic death of his close friend.
Jota’s manager at Liverpool, Arne Slot, said in a statement on Thursday that his thoughts were with his family.
“My message to them is very clear you will never walk alone,” Slot said.
“For us as a club, the sense of shock is absolute. Diogo was not just our player. He was a loved one to all of us. He was a teammate, a colleague, a workmate and in all of those roles he was very special,” he added.
 






Jota was making his way back to Liverpool by car after he was told he should avoid plane travel for up to 6 weeks following lung surgery to address a fractured rib, his physiotherapist Miguel Goncalves told broadcaster Now late on Thursday.
Goncalves said Jota was recovering well from the pneumothorax surgery and that he had planned to take a ferry to the UK from Spain.</p><small>2025-07-04 10:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612361-pakistan-azerbaijan-vow-to-boost-cooperation-in-trade-investment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Azerbaijan vow to boost cooperation in trade, investment</strong></a><br><p>

Chairman of the Pakistan Netball Federation Mudassir Arian, along with President Sameen Malik and Secretary General Muhammad Riaz, extended their congratulations to the team.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the team for their victory.
“Special appreciation for staying undefeated throughout the tournament!” he said in a post on X. “Very well played!”
 






The Pakistan Embassy in Seoul congratulated the team on their win, calling it  “a proud moment for the nation and a great milestone for [Pakistani]  women in sports.”
 






A day earlier, the Green Shirts clinched their spot in the final after defeating Japan 64-39. In the quarter-finals, Pakistan defeated the Maldives 49-39 to advance to the semi-finals.
The tournament was taking place from June 27 to July 4 at the Jeonju Hwasan Gymnasium in South Korea.

“The Israeli military’s current mission is to prepare an enforcement plan to ensure that Iran cannot threaten Israel again,” Katz said at a meeting with military leaders on Thursday, according to a statement released by his ministry.
“The army must prepare on the intelligence and operational level to ensure that the air force maintains air superiority over Tehran, the ability to enforce restrictions on Iran and prevent it from rebuilding its capabilities,” he added.
Israel launched a bombing campaign against Iran on June 13 following a decades-long shadow war, saying it aimed to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon — an ambition Tehran has consistently denied — and degrade its ballistic missile arsenal.
Following a US-announced ceasefire, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to prevent Iran from ever rebuilding its nuclear facilities, raising the prospect of further conflict.
Katz wrote on X on June 27 that the army will “act regularly to thwart such threats”.
 






Israeli media say the country’s leaders are seeking a similar approach to the one it has adopted in Lebanon.
 
 

Its army regularly launches strikes on what it says are suspected Hezbollah militant positions and operatives in Lebanon despite a truce signed in November.
Israel has acknowledged being hit by more than 50 missiles during the 12-day war with Iran, resulting in 28 deaths, according to official figures.
In Iran, Israeli strikes killed more than 900 people, according to the country’s judiciary.</p><small>2025-07-04 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04130550b392824.jpg?r=131341' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922059/india-plans-230m-drone-incentive-after-pakistan-conflict-sources-say' target='_blank'><strong>India plans $230m drone incentive after Pakistan conflict, sources say</strong></a><br><p>India will launch a $234 million incentive programme for civil and military drone makers to reduce their reliance on imported components and counter rival Pakistan’s programme built on support from China and Turkiye, three sources told Reuters.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
The nuclear-armed neighbours are now locked in a drones arms race.
New Delhi will launch a 20 billion Indian rupees ($234m) programme for three years that will cover the manufacture of drones, components, software, counter-drone systems, and services, two government and one industry source, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Details of the programme have not been previously reported and its planned expenditure is higher than the modest 1.2bn Indian rupees production-linked incentive scheme New Delhi launched in 2021 to promote drone start-ups, which have struggled to raise capital and invest in research.
India’s civil aviation ministry, which is leading the incentives programme, and the defence ministry did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment.
Reuters previously reported that India plans to invest heavily in local industry and could spend as much as $470m on unmanned aerial vehicles over the next 12 to 24 months, in what government and military officers said would be a staggered approach.
In the past, India has mainly imported military drones from its third-largest arms supplier, Israel, but in recent years its nascent drone industry has scaled up its cost-effective offerings, including for the military, although reliance on China continues for certain components such as motors, sensors and imaging systems.
 
 

Through the incentives, India is aiming to have at least 40 per cent of key drone components made in the country by the end of fiscal year 2028 (April-March), the two government sources said.
“During (the India-Pakistan) conflict there was quite a lot of use of drones, loitering munitions and kamikaze drones on both sides,” Indian Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said last week.
“The lesson that we’ve learned is that we need to double down on our indigenisation efforts to ensure that we build a large, effective, military drone manufacturing ecosystem.”
India bans import of drones but not their components and the government has planned additional incentives for manufacturers that procure parts from within the country, the two government sources said.
The state-run Small Industries Development Bank of India would also support the incentive programme by providing cheap loans for working capital, research and development needs for the firms, the government sources added.
Currently, there are more than 600 drone manufacturing and associated companies in India, according to estimates shared by an industry source involved in the discussions for the incentives programme.</p><small>2025-07-04 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04141310631ec5f.jpg?r=142530' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922068/pdma-issues-glof-warning-in-kp-amid-heavy-rains' target='_blank'><strong>PDMA issues Glof warning in KP amid heavy rains</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA)  warned on Friday that the risk of glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) has increased in the glacial areas of the province due to heavy rains and flash floods.
Glof refers to the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake, leading to the loss of lives, property and livelihoods in mountain communities. Over 7.1 million people in Gilgit Baltistan and KP are vulnerable, according to the Ministry of Climate Change.
In an advisory issued today, the PDMA warned that continuous increase in temperature increases the possibility of melting of glaciers and flash floods.
“The residents of Chitral, Dir, Swat and Kohistan have been instructed to remain alert about possible glacial outbursts. The district administration has been instructed to monitor sensitive areas, ensure timely warning and evacuation drills,” the disaster management agency said.
The PDMA has advised residents to avoid unnecessary movement near rivers and canals and refrain from taking vehicles into fast-flowing water. It also instructed tourists to remain alert and take precautionary measures.
The agency said evacuation sites have been set up in potentially affected areas and rescue services have been instructed to remain alert with required emergency equipment.
The National Highway Authority (NHA), Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and the Communication and Works Department (CWD) have been instructed to remain alert and take preventive measures for timely restoration of roads.
The PDMA has instructed district administration to take emergency measures in case of any untoward incident. District authorities have launched awareness campaign to inform the general public about measures to prevent possible losses.
“The PDMA’s Emergency Operation Centre is fully functional. The public should contact 1700 for further information,” it added.
The advisory comes heavy rainfall and flash floods across the country that have killed 64 people and injured 117 in a week, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
The highest toll was in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 23 dead, including 10 children, the authority said. Fourteen of the victims were swept away in a flash flood in the Swat Valley last week.
The PDMA has already warned district administrations across the province about the possibility of flash floods, urban flooding and landslides due to a new spell of monsoon rains from July 5 to 11.
In an advisory, the PDMA quoted the Pakistan Meteorological Department as revealing that moist currents are penetrating into most parts of the region and likely to intensify in the next couple of days.
It also said that urban flooding was very likely to happen in low-lying areas of Mardan, Nowshera, Peshawar, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan, while there’s a likelihood of riverine flooding in Chitral, Swat, Panjkora and Kabul rivers.
The PDMA said authorities should keep monitoring rivers, streams, local and rainfed nullahs, ensure drainage systems are clear from obstacles to facilitate the efficient flow of water and minimise the risk of urban flooding.</p><small>2025-07-04 09:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0411441127bfdf9.jpg?r=114425' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922039/30-terrorists-killed-in-north-waziristan-as-bid-to-infiltrate-via-pak-afghan-border-thwarted-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>30 terrorists killed in North Waziristan as bid to infiltrate via Pak-Afghan border thwarted: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Thirty terrorists of an “Indian proxy” outfit were killed as they attempted to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border in Hassan Khel tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025.
A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) read that on the nights of July 2 and July 3, “movement of a large group of khwarij, belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was detected by the security forces in general area Hassan Khel, North Waziristan district”.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term used by the government for the TTP, while those associated with the terrorist group are referred to as khaarji.
As per the ISPR, “all 30 Indian-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell” as a result of the military’s “prices and skilful engagement” after the security forces foiled their attempt to infiltrate the border.
“A large number of weapons, explosives and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorists,” the statement added.
 






The ISPR appreciated the “exceptional professionalism, vigilance and preparedness” displayed by the security forces in preventing a “potential catastrophe”.
The military’s media wing urged the Afghan government to “check and prevent the use of Afghan soil by ‘foreign proxies’ for orchestrating terrorist activities against Pakistan”.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement added.
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces for their bravery and reaffirmed the country’s “unwavering” resolve to curb terrorism.
“Security operations will continue until the terrorists are eliminated completely,” he said, according to a statement issued by the president’s office.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the operation, saying the “entire nation salutes the security forces”, in a statement reported by Radio Pakistan.
“The brave armed forces of Pakistan are standing like a solid wall to protect the country,” he asserted.
 






“Pakistan’s courageous security forces served as an unyielding shield to protect the nation,” the premier was quoted as saying by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
“We are determined to eliminate all forms of terrorism from the country completely,” PM Shehbaz reaffirmed.
The engagement comes only days after security forces killed two terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Duki district.
In June, Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).
The monthly security assessment recorded 78 militant attacks in June, compared to 85 in May.</p><small>2025-07-04 09:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612335-imran-directs-pti-to-begin-anti-govt-movement-after-10th-muharram-says-aleema' target='_blank'><strong>Imran directs PTI to begin anti-govt movement after 10th Muharram, says Aleema</strong></a><br><p>

The bill, when enacted, will overhaul the government’s Medicaid healthcare programme that covers around 71 million low-income Americans, introducing changes including mandatory work requirements that are expected to leave nearly 12 million people uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
Republicans have said the legislation will lower taxes for Americans across the income spectrum and spur economic growth. According to the CBO, the bill would lower tax revenue by $4.5 trillion over 10 years and cut spending by $1.1tr. Much of those spending cuts come from Medicaid.
Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association, an influential US doctors’ group, warned that the Medicaid cuts would limit access to care by leaving millions without health insurance and make it harder for them to see doctors.
“It will make it more likely that acute, treatable illnesses will turn into life-threatening or costly chronic conditions. That is disappointing, maddening, and unacceptable,” he said.
The Alliance of Community Health Plans, which represents local, nonprofit health plans, also rebuked the bill’s passage, saying it would drive up consumer costs while slashing federal health spending to historic levels.
The group pledged to work with policymakers to minimise disruption for communities.
Greg Kelley, president of the Service Employees International Union’s healthcare branch, representing Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas, called the bill a “moral failure” that threatened healthcare access, jobs, and the stability of the healthcare system.
Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare programme at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said their research showed such cuts would hurt patient health. He said expanding Medicaid had saved lives and cutting it back was likely to have the opposite impact.
Ge Bai, a Johns Hopkins health policy professor and adviser to the conservative Paragon Health Institute, said she expected the private market would step in as able-bodied adults lose Medicaid and subsidies.
“These people will come back to the private market,” she said. “The financial burden to purchase insurance will be shifted away from US taxpayers to these people’s shoulders.”</p><small>2025-07-04 06:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0407255113d1ba9.png?r=072621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921952/ndma-issues-monsoon-alert-from-july-6th' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues monsoon alert from July 6th</strong></a><br><p>• Flash flood risk in northern areas from July 7-12

A bench consisting of PHC Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali ordered the government to conduct an impartial and across the board operation for removing encroachments along the Swat River.
The bench was informed by head of three-member inquiry committee Khayyam Hassan Khan that they had visited Swat and had been probing the incident for the last four days.
He said that they had observed lapses on part of some of individuals and departments during flash floods in Swat and would highlight it in the report.

Committee head says he will highlight negligence by some individuals and depts

The bench was hearing two petitions related to the Swat incident of June 27, during which 13 persons stuck in gushing floodwater were killed near Fizzagut, Swat.
One of the petitions is filed by a lawyer Naeem Ahmad Khattak, seeking directives of court for respondents including government to take effective measures and remove obstacles/encroachments throughout KP near riverbeds.
 
 

Another petition is filed by a citizen, Amir Alam, for ordering a judicial inquiry into the ‘circumstances’ that led to deaths of several people during the floods in Swat as well as a probe into the alleged misuse of Rescue 1122 vehicles by the provincial government for ‘political’ purposes.
The petitioner has sought directives for law enforcement agencies and accountability authorities to look into alleged misuse of Rescue 1122 vehicles and resources by the provincial executive for political purposes and proceed strictly in accordance with law if cognisable offences were committed.
Advocates Babar Khan Yousafzai and Nasir Khan appeared for the petitioners, whereas KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel appeared for the government.
The chairman of the inquiry committee, Khayyam Hassan, also turned up along with some of divisional commissioners.
When the bench inquired who was the inquiry officer probing the incident, Mr Khayyam, the chairman of Provincial Inspection Team, informed the bench that provincial government had constituted the inquiry committee under his chairmanship.
He stated that the other two members of the committee were the inspector general of prisons, Mohammad Usman, and the director (admin) of excise and taxation department, Sheharyar Qamar. He said that according to the notification, the committee had to complete its probe within seven days.
Mr Khayyam said that according to terms of reference of the committee, they had to inquire into multiple aspects of the incident. He said that they were assigned to conduct thorough and impartial investigation into the flash flood incident, which had resulted into loss of precious lives.
He said that that they would assess and identify lapses or negligence on part of government functionaries and tourists. He said that they would also identify the individuals or institutions involved in any lapse regarding compliance of safety and fix responsibilities.
He said that they would put forward recommendations in order to avoid such tragic incidents in future and ensure strict adherence to safety measures.
Shah Faisal Uthmankhel informed the bench that government and administration in Swat had started an anti-encroachments drive along the Swat River that was facing certain hurdles.
The PHC chief justice observed that the court was aware that certain quarters would be exerting pressure in the drive. The bench directed him to continue with the operation without extending favour to any person.
The petitioners’ lawyers stated that government was having two helicopters and if it intended it could have saved lives of the deceased persons. The petitioners have also requested the court to issue directives for the respondents to cancel all mining activities, carried out through auction or otherwise, in the Swat River.
They said that the failure of Rescue 1122 and provincial authorities to respond timely and effectively caused unnecessary and avoidable loss of lives.

• Says absence of master plan led to disorganised, haphazard urban growth
• Mayor promises to include all relevant stakeholders in formation of new plan
KARACHI: The maiden meeting of the steering committee tasked to develop the Greater Karachi Regional Plan 2047 was informed on Thursday that the new master plan of the country’s commercial capital would be ready within two years.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani chaired the inaugural meeting of the high-powered body, which was also attended by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, director generals of the Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Development Authority, Malir Development Authority and Lyari Development Authority, Additional Chief Secretary-Local Government Waseem Shamshad, Senior Member Board of Revenue Baqaullah Unar, Planning & Development Secretary Sajjad Abbasi, Project Director Muhammad Arshad Khan, representatives of the project’s consulting firms and other officials.
 
 

The meeting was told that under the Greater Karachi Regional Plan 2047, a comprehensive master plan for the city will be developed within the next two years by the local government department in collaboration with all stakeholders, civic agencies, and civil society organisations.
Participants of the meeting were briefed by the project director on the progress made so far on the Greater Karachi Regional Plan 2047, while representatives of consulting companies involved also presented a comprehensive review of the Phase-I of the project.
‘No approved master plan’
Speaking on the occasion, LG Minister Ghani, who is also the chairman of the steering committee, said currently there is no approved master plan for Karachi.
He said that the absence of an approved master plan of Karachi has resulted in disorganised urban growth.
He said the government has started work to develop the Greater Karachi Regional Plan 2047, an ambitious initiative aimed at monitoring the city’s future growth and resolving civic and infrastructural issues.
According to a press release issued after the meeting, he said the master plan aims to address illegal constructions and bring improvements across all key sectors of the metropolis, including water supply, sewerage, health, education, transport, infrastructure and commerce.
The minister said that the new master plan would serve as a crucial blueprint for the city’s development over the next two decades.
Previous plan expired in 2017, says mayor
Mayor Wahab told the meeting that the last master plan for the city was extended up to 2017. He said it had expired and the absence of a new master plan has caused difficulties across all sectors and led to the city’s unregulated expansion.
He expressed optimism that upon completion of this project and the formulation of the Master Plan 2047, it will be possible to better address Karachi’s infrastructure and public issues.
The mayor added that the Sindh government and the local government department were making all-out efforts to ensure that all relevant stakeholders who can play a vital role in the city’s and country’s progress are included in the formation of the plan.
It may be noted that six master plans have been prepared for Karachi in the 1923, 1948, 1952, 1974, 1991 and 2007. The last plan — Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020 — was prepared by the now defunct City District Government Karachi but it could not be fully implemented due to various reasons.

• Regrets how petition by death row prisoner received first hearing seven years after it was filed
• Criticises abysmal conditions in overcrowded prisons across the country
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday expressed regret over the inordinate delays plaguing the country’s criminal justice system, warning that such inefficiencies are eroding public confidence in the judiciary and amount to a form of “unauthorised punishment”.
In a detailed judgement, Justice Athar Minallah called for the urgent completion of appeal processes and said the abysmal conditions in overcrowded prisons across the country add to the unimaginable suffering of prisoners — especially those on death row. These conditions become “a form of unauthorised punishment not intended by the legislature”, he wrote.
He emphasised that it was the constitutional duty of every organ of the state — the executive, the judiciary and the legislature — to take urgent steps for ensuring that the criminal justice system serves the people of this country and they repose their trust and confidence in its fairness, impartiality and independence.
Justice Minallah presided over a three-member bench hearing the appeal of Tahir alias Tahri, who had challenged a 2014 Lahore High Court (LHC) decision upholding his conviction and death sentence for the murder of five individuals.
Justice Minallah observed that a weak and compromised criminal justice system undermines the rule of law and thus encourages corruption, authoritarianism and the rule of the powerful and privileged instead. “An effective and responsive criminal justice system, free from political interference and corruption, is a fundamental right of every citizen, while inexpensive and expeditious justice is a commitment of the state under the Constitution,” he wrote.
He conceded that judiciary was also responsible when the process of appeal exceeds the necessary and reasonable time required for its completion, but other branches of the state — the executive and legislature — were equally responsible for ensuring that the conditions in the prisons were humane and that the treatment of prisoners was not cruel, inhumane and degrading.
In the case at hand, Justice Minallah regretted that the appellant was sentenced to death by the trial court on Sept 3, 2008, and the appeal was preferred within time. The LHC decided the appeal on Sept 18, 2014, and the reference was answered in the affirmative, and thus, the sentence of death was confirmed.
But there was a six-year delay in deciding the appeal of a prisoner who has been handed down a death sentence, which cannot be justified when the necessary time for taking up the appeal and its ultimate disposal should not have been more than a year, Justice Minallah bemoaned.
The appellant had then sought leave by filing a petition before the Supreme Court, and the necessary and reasonable time required for its final disposal should not have been more than 12 months, he wrote.
The petition, which was filed in 2014, was fixed for hearing for the first time after seven years — on March 22, 2021 — and finally on Jan 29, 2025. It took more than 17 years to complete the appeal process from the date when the death sentence was handed down, the judgement regretted.
Throughout this time, the prisoner remained in a death cell, despite having no role in the delay nor any control over the procedural hurdles. Justice Minallah said such delays grossly exceed the “necessary and reasonable” time that should be required for appellate procedures.

The designations, announced by the State Department and the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), target a network of shipping and management firms accused of helping Iran covertly move oil and petrochemicals in violation of US sanctions.
The latest measures come weeks after Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and reflect Washington’s resolve to enforce the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” policy.
“The Treasury will continue to target Tehran’s revenue sources and intensify economic pressure to disrupt the regime’s access to the financial resources that fuel its destabilizing activities,” said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a statement.
 
 

Among those sanctioned is SAI Saburi Consulting Services, a New Delhi-based company that served as the commercial manager of two LPG tankers, BATELEUR and NEEL.
According to the Treasury, in September 2022, BATELEUR transported petroleum products from Iran on behalf of Alliance Energy Co., a previously sanctioned entity.
Alliance Energy Pvt Ltd, based in Lahore, Pakistan, was also sanctioned for its role in the Iranian oil trade. The company had already been blacklisted for violating US sanctions.
Other entities targeted include UAE, Iran and Panama-based firms and the vessels they operate.
