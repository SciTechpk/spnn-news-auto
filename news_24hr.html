As a result of the explosion, at least nine people have died so far.
The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered yesterday on the complaint of B-Section Station House Officer (SHO) Niaz Panhwar.
It invoked Sections 322 (punishment for intentional murder), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 286 (negligent conduct with respect explosive substance), 336 (punishment for mutilation or dismemberment of a limb), 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance), 337-H (punishment for hurt by a rash or negligent act) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Factory owner Asad Yousafzai and his alleged accomplices, Rashid Khan, Dilshad Khan, Arshad and Shakeel Punjabi, have been nominated as suspects in the FIR.
The FIR quoted SHO Panhwar as saying that he received information about the explosion and resultant fire at the factory at 4.03pm. He further stated in his complaint that police, fire brigade and rescue officials rushed to the spot, where he found some bodies upon his arrival. The injured, he added, were taken to the hospital in Edhi ambulances.
The SHO said three of the deceased could not immediately be identified.
According to him, factory owner Asad Yousufzai and his accomplices had set up the factory illegally in the riverine area of Hyderabad’s Latifabad. Human lives were lost when the explosion occurred at the site, and human limbs were found at the spot, he said.
Separately,  Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Adeel Chandio told Dawn that police had arrested some of the suspects, but prime suspect Yousufzai remained at large and raids were being conducted to hunt him down.
Death toll
The seventh death as a consequence of the incident was reported earlier today after another body was pulled out from the rubble of the explosion.
Rescue officials confirmed to Dawn the recovery of one more body from the rubble, which was pulled out late on Saturday.
Later today, Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital’s medical superintendent (MS), Dr Khalid Bukhari, told Dawn over the phone that two of the injured brought to the facility in Karachi had succumbed to their injuries.
They had suffered severe burns, he said, adding that one of the injured, who had full-thickness burns and whose left leg had been amputated, died today morning and another died in the evening.
Hyderabad’s Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) administration had been informed of the deaths, the MS said.
Dr Roshan Chandio, the registrar at the LUH burns ward, also confirmed to Dawn that two patients who had been shifted to Karachi’s Civil Hospital due to their critical condition had died.
‘Illegal factory’
Yesterday, Latifabad Assistant Commissioner Saud Lund had confirmed that firecrackers at the factory were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence.
However, the Hyderabad senior superintendent of police said: “Initial findings show that the factory owner actually got a licence for some other spot, but he was manufacturing firecrackers at the present location.”
He said that the owner was absconding, and details of the factory’s licence were being verified
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed the relevant authorities to determine the cause of the explosion and conduct a comprehensive audit of the factory’s safety measures.
Sindh Home Minister Lanjar instructed officials to immediately investigate the factory’s legal status and verify whether it held the required licence and adhered to safety regulations for manufacturing fireworks.</p><small>2025-11-16 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161917303959499.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955457/coas-munir-reiterates-pakistans-commitment-to-enhance-military-to-military-cooperation-with-jordan' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir reiterates Pakistan’s commitment to enhance military-to-military cooperation with Jordan</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir reiterated on Sunday Pakistan’s commitment to further enhancing military-to-military cooperation with Jordan and jointly realising the mutual vision of a stable and peaceful region, according to the military’s media affairs wing.
The army chief also underscored the “strong defence partnership” between Pakistan and the Hashemite Kingdom — the royal family of Jordan — during a visit of Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein at the Tilla Field Firing Ranges near Jhelum, a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The Jordanian king, who arrived in Pakistan for a two-day official visit on Saturday, also visited Global Industrial and Defence Solutions, the state-owned conglomerate involved in the export and marketing of military, industrial and technological products and services. He was accompanied by Princess Salma bint Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein and a delegation of Jordanian civil and military officials and was received by Field Marshal Munir and other officials, according to the ISPR.
 






The ISPR statement said that during his visit to GIDS, the Jordanian king was given a comprehensive briefing on the structure, capabilities, and product portfolio of the conglomerate.
“The briefing showcased Pakistan’s progress in indigenous defence production, technological innovation, and potential avenues for bilateral defence cooperation between Pakistan and Jordan,” the statement added.
Later, it said, King Abdullah visited Tilla Field Firing Ranges, where he was joined by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “Vugar Valeh oglu Mustafayev, minister of defence industry of the Republic of Azerbaijan, was also amongst the distinguished guests at the firing ranges.”
At the firing ranges, the “distinguished guests witnessed a joint fire and manoeuvre exercise”, the ISPR statement said, adding that the “exercise demonstrated multi-domain operations, including conventional and air firepower, coordinated manoeuvres, spectrum warfare capabilities supported by multi-purpose drones employed in various configurations and roles”.

“King Abdullah II appreciated the high standards of training, professionalism, and operational capabilities and preparedness demonstrated by the participating troops and aircrews,” it further stated.
Moreover, PM Shehbaz expressed “Pakistan’s deep respect and affection for His Majesty King Abdullah II and the people of Jordan, noting that the visit reflects the enduring friendship, mutual trust and a shared desire for peace and development”.
Earlier, the ISPR statement said, King Abdullah conferred upon the COAS the Order of the Military Merit of First Degree, “in recognition of his outstanding service and significant contributions to strengthening military cooperation between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Pakistan”.
The statement highlighted that the Jordanian king’s visit to Pakistan “marks a significant milestone in reinforcing the historic bonds of fraternity and brotherhood between Pakistan and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan”.
Highest civilian award for Jordanian king
Separately, the Government of Pakistan also conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, upon King Abdullah II of Jordan
during a special Investiture ceremony at the Presidency in Islamabad today.
The accolade was presented to the king, who is on a two-day visit to the country, by President Asif Ali Zardari. In response, King Abdullah conferred the Order of the Bejewelled Grand Cordon of Al-Nahda, one of the kingdom’s highest honours, upon President Zardari.

PM Shehbaz and other federal ministers were present at the ceremony, while PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari were also in attendance.
“His Majesty, King Abdullah II … is a visionary leader and a statesman of exceptional statesmanship who has championed the cause of moderation, justice and dialogue amongst nations,” the citation for the award said.
“Under His Majesty’s sagacious leadership, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has emerged as a beacon of stability, tolerance and prosperity in the region,” it added. “His unwavering advocacy for a just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question and his efforts towards reaching the Gaza peace agreement have earned him profound international acclaim and recognition.
“His Majesty has been a steadfast friend of Pakistan. By virtue of his personal engagement, the bilateral relations between Pakistan and Jordan have been significantly strengthened across diverse fields encompassing political and economic cooperation, defence collaboration, educational partnerships, cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts.”
It continued: “These developments serve to reinforce the enduring foundation of the historic friendship and brotherhood between the two nations, while concurrently fostering new avenues of cooperation.
“The people and government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan deeply value His Majesty King Abdullah II’s … commitment to strengthening bilateral relations and consistent solidarity with Pakistan.
“In recognition of his remarkable statesmanship and enduring contributions for further cementing Pakistan-Jordan relations, coupled with promotion of regional and international peace, the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has been pleased to confer … the award of Nishan-i-Pakistan as a symbol of profound respect, admiration and friendship from the people and Government of Pakistan.”
The prime minister and Jordanian king also held a bilateral meeting on Saturday at the PM House after the latter arrived in Pakistan.
During the meeting, both leaders affirmed “zero-tolerance” for any displacement of Palestinians from the besieged Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the devastating military onslaught by Israel in the territory.
King Abdullah II also praised Pakistan’s consistent support for Jordan’s role in regional stability and humanitarian efforts during the Gaza conflict, as well as for the territory after the ceasefire.
Both dignitaries also witnessed a ceremony on the exchange of memorandums of understanding in the fields of media, culture and education.</p><small>2025-11-16 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633906-constitution-will-reflect-parliament-and-people-not-judges-talal-chaudhry' target='_blank'><strong>Constitution will reflect parliament and people, not judges: Talal Chaudhry</strong></a><br><p>

The army chief made these comments to the Urdu newspaper during a luncheon held in honour of King Abdullah II of Jordan, who arrived in Islamabad yesterday for a two-day visit.
“During the war with India, Allah helped us raise our heads high,” Field Marshal Munir said. “When a Muslim puts their trust in Allah, He turns the dirt thrown at the enemy into missiles.”
The COAS added that he performs his duties according to the command of Allah and said it was by God’s grace that Pakistan defeated its enemy.
“This army is an army of Allah and our soldiers fight in His name,” the field marshal added.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched the retaliatory ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul last month, Field Marshal Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.”
Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.“</p><small>2025-11-16 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161821126d3a0d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955438/karachi-may-face-water-shortage-due-to-power-breakdown-at-dhabeji-restoration-expected-by-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi may face water shortage due to power breakdown at Dhabeji; restoration expected by tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Karachi could face a shortfall of 100 million gallons of water per day (MGD) due to a power breakdown at the Dhabeji Pumping Station, which is expected to be fully repaired by tomorrow, the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) said on Sunday.
The Dhabeji Pumping Station is a key pumping station operated by KWSC, Karachi’s sole water utility, that serves the city’s major areas. Past breakdowns at the facility have impacted supply to the East and Central districts, including areas like Nazimabad, New Karachi, Landhi and Korangi.
In a statement today, a KWSC spokesperson said the “major” power breakdown in the second phase of the Dhabeji station was reported at 6:35am.
“Due to the sudden power suspension, 72-inch line No. 5 has been affected, while four pumps of the phase shut down,” a later statement by the KWSC said, adding that the issue “severely damaged” the water supply system.
“According to initial estimates, the city could face a shortage of 100 million gallons of water due to the pumps’ shutdown and the line being impacted,” the KWSC cautioned.
It said water supply to the city was resumed by restoring power supply to two pumps of the station’s second phase at 9am. The other two pumps will also be made functional again as soon as the repair work on the affected pipeline is complete, the utility added.
 
 

The repair work of the affected line had been initiated on an “emergency basis” on the directives of KWSC Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Ali Siddiqui, the statement noted.
It assured the citizens that KWSC’s technical teams were “utilising all resources in making every effort to restore the water supply from the affected line”.
According to the statement, the restoration work is expected to be completed by Monday, after which the entire system of the Dhabeji Pumping Station will be operational again as usual.
The KWSC asserted that repair work of the affected line “will be completed on an emergency basis”, and assured citizens that the utility’s management was making every effort to complete the repair work in a timely manner.
“As soon as the repair work has been completed, Dhabeji Pumping Station’s system will return to routine,” the utility added.
The statement recalled that electricity at the Dhabeji station had remained suspended for “many hours” on November 5, November 11 and November 13 due to a “cable fault of K-Electric in the second phase, fourth phase and the K-III Pumping House”.
The KE said on November 14 (Friday) that power on 20 of the 22 pumps had been restored. The utility blamed “leakages” in the KWSC’s water pipelines for damaging the underground electricity cables.
 






The Dhabeji Pumping Station, which is the city’s primary water intake point, is highly dependent on uninterrupted electricity. Even brief outages result in immediate service disruptions.
The station has been facing multiple problems related to poor maintenance and technical issues for a decade, with multiple breakdowns this year alone, leaving residents in many areas grappling with a water crisis.
 
 

Karachi faced a shortfall of 100MGD in January after “two water pipelines burst due to a power outage” at the Dhabeji station. The facility also remained without electricity for at least three days in late June, causing a shortfall of 350MGD.
Last month, one pump at the Dhabeji station was taken offline for maintenance-related needs, while the North East Pumping Station already faced a power breakdown.
Due to persistent water shortages across the city, people mostly rely on water tankers. They, however, face a great deal of hardship in getting them, as the water utility receives more bookings than the quota of water reserved for each district.</p><small>2025-11-16 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161819112007948.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955444/wasim-haris-and-faisal-star-as-pakistan-restrict-sri-lanka-to-211-in-third-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Wasim, Haris and Faisal star as Pakistan restrict Sri Lanka to 211 in third ODI</strong></a><br><p>A brilliant bowling show from Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to a meagre 211-run total in the third and final One-day International at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Sunday as the hosts looked to sweep the series.
Pacers Haris Rauf (2-38) and Mohammad Wasim Junior (3-47) and left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram (2-42) kept taking wickets at crucial times through the course of the innings after Pakistan put Sri Lanka into bat, keeping the visitors from gaining momentum at any given point.
Pakistan had made four changes for the match, with wicket-keeper Haseebullah Khan coming in for opener Saim Ayub, Faisal replacing spinner Abrar Ahmed, captain Shaheen Shah Afridi returning at the expense of fellow pacer Naseem Shah while Faheem Ashraf replaced all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz.
A flurry of exquisite strokes on a batting friendly pitch by Sri Lankan openers Patthum Nissanka and Kamil Mishara had given the visitors a flying start before in-form pacer Haris forced Nissanka into playing one on to his stumps. Sri Lanka, however, had 57-1 on the board by the end of the first 10 overs.
First-drop Kusal Mendis, though, carried on the momentum, flicking two full deliveries by Haris for boundaries in the 11th over. But Sri Lanka received another blow when Mishara uncharacteristically poked an out-swinger by Wasim to get caught behind in the next over.
The wicket brought pushed down Sri Lanka’s run-rate, with Kusal and Sadeera Samarawickrama taking them to 99-2 by the 20th over, which saw a DRS review save Samarawickrama after an lbw appeal by Faisal was accepted by the on-field umpire.
With the boundary drought prolonging — spanning 47 balls to be exact — the pressure on the Sri Lankan batters increased, and its consequence came in form of yet another wicket for Pakistan and Wasim, who seamed one in with pace on it to castle Kusal through the gate as the Islanders reeled at 117-3 at the halfway stage.
Faisal, who had kept it tight throughout his five overs till that point, returned in the next over to catch Kamindu Mendis off his own bowling in what was a soft dismissal, pushing Sri Lanka deeper into trouble. Janith Liyanage was the next to follow, playing Faheem ’s medium-pace onto his stumps.
Faisal produced a stunning delivery in the 36th over, spinning one back into right-hander Samarawickrama to clean him up for 48.
Maheesh Theekshana followed suit as Shaheen’s searing yorker hit his foot, with DRS confirming the umpire’s lbw decision.  Another perfect yorker saw Wasim uproot Jefferey Vandersay’s middle stump.
After Pavan Rathnayake had threatened a late fightback by launching Haris handsomely over long-off for six, his partner at the other end, Pramod Madushan, was stunned by a fierce bouncer by the pacer, as the ball kicked off his gloves and into those of Haseebullah behind the wickets.
Rathnayake was the last to fall, thanks to throw by substitute Saim that ran the batter out.</p><small>2025-11-16 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633901-president-confers-highest-civilian-award-on-jordanian-king-for-peace-contributions' target='_blank'><strong>President confers highest civilian award on Jordanian king for peace contributions</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is home to about 13,000 glaciers. According to a 2023 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), Hima­layan glaciers, which provide critical water to nearly two billion people, are melting faster than ever before due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters.
The minister made the remarks at the sidelines of COP30, at an event titled “Cryosphere Adaptation & Disaster Risk Reduction”, where he delivered the keynote address via video, the Press Information Department (PID) said on Saturday.
Malik told the participants that “climate-induced glacier melt is occurring at an unprecedented pace,” calling for the “urgent need” to protect the HKH cryosphere, which he described as the “white rooftops of the world” and the “primary lifeline of millions across South Asia.”
 


As per the PID statement, the event — organised by the Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination in collaboration with the ICIMOD — featured interventions from Deputy Ministers of Türkiye and Azerbaijan, the Director General of ICIMOD, and senior representatives from Nepal, Bhutan, UNESCO, UNDP, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
“Pakistan hosts 13,000 glaciers, which feed the Indus River system and sustain the country’s agricultural, ecological, and economic foundations,” the press release quoted Malik as saying.
He informed the audience that climate-induced glacier melt was “resulting in severe losses and damages, including Glaicial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs).”
A Glofs refers to a rush of water from a glacial lake, which could lead to severe flooding downstream.
Terming it an issue of “justice and rights”, Malik said: “Seventy per cent of the world’s carbon emissions come from just ten countries, yet these same countries receive 85pc of global green finance.“
“He urged countries with historic emissions responsibility to contribute their fair share toward adaptation and resilience in vulnerable mountain regions, calling on the global community to elevate the cryosphere agenda at COP30,” the press release read.
Malik, in his address, also noted that Pakistan had “demonstrated leadership through its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC 3.0)”.
As per the 2023 ICIMOD report, glaciers in the HKH region are a crucial water source for around 240m people in the mountainous regions, as well as for another 1.65bn people in the river valleys below.
Based on current emissions trajectories, the glaciers could lose up to 80pc of their current volume by the end of the century, said the Nepal-based ICIMOD.</p><small>2025-11-16 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161700129d36f15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955253/diary-of-a-social-butterfly-zeal-for-zohran' target='_blank'><strong>DIARY OF A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY: ZEAL FOR ZOHRAN</strong></a><br><p>Bhai, I’m tau so happy about Mamdani, so happy kay don’t even ask. Such a cutee he is. With that boyish smile of his. And his nice English. And the way he ghulo milos with everyone, even the poors and the Africans.
And thanks God, his beard is also not that big or bushy. And his wife, Rahma, so stylish with her short hair and cool outfits and eyeliner. Suna hai artist hai. And like him, a Muslim also, but from Syria only. Apparently, speaks furr furr Arabic. But, Mashallah, looks like total foreigner. Both husband wife give such nice impression of us to the world, na.
Inshallah, when Kulchoo gets married and has a son, I’ll name him Zohran. I’ve mulloed the name from now only. And if he has a girl (which I’m hoping he won’t because firstborn should always be a boy), I’ll call her Rahma.
In this time, Indians becharon kay liye main bohat feel karti hoon, vaisay. They don’t know what to do with Zohran. Actually tau, Zohran is quite a lot Indian. His mother is fully Indian — oho baba, she’s Mira Nair only, voh Monsoon Weddings vaali — and fully Hindu also. Wears tilak and speaks Hindi. And while the father says he’s African (doesn’t look African from anywhere, vaisay), actually, peechhay se, he is Gujrati, not our Chaudhriyon vaala Gujrat but their Modi vaala Gujrat.

New York’s new political heartthrob might have triggered Modi and Trump, but the real battle is over his name…

So, with like Rishi Sunak (remember him?) and the Koh-i-Noor diamond and mutton dum pukht, Indians tau are dying to rush out and put their thappa on Zohran and say that he is also ours but, problem is, he’s gone and announced kay he’s Muslim. Tau ab, what to do?
And this thapparhh from Zohran after Trump’s already flapped tariffs on India and has already done kutti with Modi. Apparently, Trump went to Korea and did nakals of Modi over there and called our Field Martial ‘a great guy’ and, sub se worst, he went and said that we shot down eight of their plains. Can you imagine how much Modi must have sarrhoed?
And I think so, Zohran is not a fan of Modi’s also. Apparently, he quoted Nehru in his acceptance speech and Nehru tau is Modi’s Enemy Number One, na (even though he’s been dead for 50, 60 years). And Zohran’s said kay if that dajjal Netanyahu comes to New York, he’ll arrest him because he’s a war criminal. And Netanyahu and Modi tau are pukka besties. So, one tight slap after another for Modi.
But to be honest, a lot of Americans are also sarrhoing after receiving this joota in their face. White Americans who hate Muslims and love Israel like Nylon Must and Trump and V. D. Dance and other richie rich types called Bill Ache Man, who gave millions of dollars to try and defeat our cutee Zohran. Aur karay. Haan. So glad his millions went down the brain.
 


You know, I used to think kay everything could be taken from you, except your blood and your faith. Whatever happens, those two things remain your own. But V. D. Dance is now saying that poor Usha — oho bhai, his wife — should give up being Hindu and instead embrace Catholicism as tightly as he’s embraced Erika Kirk.
And poor Andrew, who was a prince by blood, is now just an aam aadmi. His blood must have turned from blue to red. I wonder if he’ll join aam aadmi party now? Apparently, William and Kate nay barra hand kiya hai uske saath. They told Charles kay get him out before he spoils our brand also. Imagine! Doing that to your own chacha. Honestly…
I was telling to Janoo all this about poor Usha and poor Andrew but majaal hai that he will listen for one minute even. All day, all night, he’s going on and on about 27th Amendment and how this will make army even more stronger and civilians even more weaker and how judges will be sidelined and God knows what other bore, bore things.
Tau, when Mulloo called and wanted a chat, I shukar karoed. She’d called, super excited, to tell me that her sister’s daughter had twins — one boy, one girl — and they want name suggestions. Her sister’s daughter is called Zara and her husband is Zahid, so they want names with Z for the babies also.
“I was thinking of suggesting Zohran and Zaina,” said Mulloo. Honestly, Mulloo has a sick sense about grabbing anything I want. The second I even think of something, she’s on it.
“No, no,” I said, playing it cool. “Don’t do copy of Zohran. Be a bit more original.”
“What do you suggest?”
“How about Zehereela and Zehereeli?”

Thousands marched on the capital’s historic main public square, the Zocalo, in a demonstration fueled by young Mexicans with ties to a global wave of Generation Z protests as well as supporters of the domestic “Sombrero Movement,” which emerged after the recent assassination of a mayor known for his fight against organised crime.

AFP observed participants of all ages taking part in the rally in front of the National Palace, where President Claudia Sheinbaum lives and works.
Several protesters, some wearing balaclavas, toppled the metal barriers protecting the palace and threw paving stones at riot police, who responded with tear gas, according to AFP journalists.
“For many hours, this mobilisation proceeded and developed peacefully, until a group of hooded individuals began to commit acts of violence,” Pablo Vazquez, Mexico City’s security chief, told reporters.
Twenty protesters and 100 police were injured, with 40 officers hospitalised for cuts and bruises, he added.
Police arrested 20 people for theft and assault, Vazquez said, and had also launched an investigation into the assault of a journalist from La Jornada newspaper, who alleged that police officers were behind the incident.
Inspired by murdered mayor
Sheinbaum, in power since October 2024, maintained approval ratings above 70 per cent in her first year in office but faced growing criticism of her security policies in the wake of several high-profile murders.
“This is one of the most corrupt governments we’ve ever had,” said Valentina Ramirez, a student interviewed by AFP. “It’s a corrupt narco-government that wants to defend the corrupt and the cartels instead of the people.”
On Saturday, several protesters wore sombreros similar to the style of hat made famous by Carlos Manzo, a mayor in western Michoacan state who was assassinated on November 1. He had been known for his crusade against drug-trafficking gangs in his hometown Uruapan.
 
 


The assassinated mayor’s widow, however, distanced her husband’s movement from the demonstration on Saturday.
Bernardo Bravo, a leader of lime producers in the same region, had also been shot dead in late October.
Earlier this week, Sheinbaum questioned the motivations for the demonstration and said at her regular morning news conference that the protest was “inorganic” and “paid for”.
“It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,” she said.
Demonstrators displayed banners bearing messages such as “We are all Carlos Manzo” alongside the iconic pirate flag from the Japanese manga One Piece, which has become a symbol of youth protest around the world, from Madagascar to the Philippines and Peru.
“You should have protected Carlos Manzo like this!” some protesters shouted at security forces, who responded with fire extinguishers and tear gas.</p><small>2025-11-16 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161604414ee7f4e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955449/tallal-chaudhry-says-parliament-can-bring-another-constitutional-amendment-for-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Tallal Chaudhry says parliament can bring another constitutional amendment for ‘stability’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on Saturday said the ruling coalition could introduce another constitutional amendment if needed to “maintain stability” in the country.
His remarks come just three days after the 27th Amendment was signed into law after passage from the National Assembly and the Senate, amid strong opposition by the opposition parties.

Insisting that the 26th and 27th Amendments brought “stability” to the country,  Chaudhry said, “If another amendment is needed to maintain this stability, we will definitely bring it together with other parties.”
“The parliament will bring amendments whenever it wants, and the parliament should do them. The parliament should be seen as a parliament,” the PML-N leader said while addressing a media briefing in Punjab’s Faisalabad.
Responding to a query, Chaudhry termed the recent resignations of superior court judges as “political”.
On November 13, the day the 27th Amendment was enacted into law, the Supreme Court’s then-senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah resigned, censuring the legislation as an “assault” on the Constitution and as weakening the judiciary.
A day later, Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza quit the Lahore High Court, also citing the 27th Amendment as the reason, and the Islamabad High Court might also see some departures.
The state minister asserted that making amendments to the Constitution was the parliament’s right.
“Judges take oath under the Constitution; they are not a political party that they will resign if the Constitution is amended,” the PML-N leader said. “The Constitution will not be as per their (judges’) wishes, but of the parliament and the people of Pakistan,” he asserted.
“Their (judges’) every single thing — from their salaries to their decisions — is decided by the parliament,” the state minister said.
He further accused the senior judges who resigned of being “biased” and of handing “political” judgments.
“There have been many extensions of ‘good to see you’, but the environment is not the same anymore,” Chaudhry quipped, referring to the renowned remark made by former Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial in May 2023, when he said “good to see you” to ex-premier Imran Khan upon his court appearance.
 
 

The PML-N leader lamented the judges’ alleged excessive use of suo-motus — the SC’s power to take notice of matters of public importance but has now been revoked under the 27th Amendment — to “send prime ministers home” and assail the government on a whim.
On the PTI’s decision to boycott the upcoming by-elections in Faisalabad, Chaudhry said the party did not want to contest wherever there was considerable opposition.
By-elections on two NA seats (NA-96, NA-104) and three provincial ones (PP-98, PP-115, PP-116) in Faisalabad district are set for November 23.
The PML-N is likely to win all five seats up thanks to the PTI’s boycott, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) being in no condition to contest due to the recent ban on it, and the PPP fielding no candidate.</p><small>2025-11-16 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16155207647991e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955451/asylum-overhaul-in-uk-to-impose-20-year-wait-for-permanent-settlement' target='_blank'><strong>Asylum overhaul in UK to impose 20-year wait for permanent settlement</strong></a><br><p>Britain said it would make refugee status temporary, and the wait for permanent settlement would be quadrupled to 20 years under the country’s most sweeping overhaul of policy on asylum seekers in modern times.
The Labour government has been hardening its immigration policies, above all on illegal small-boat crossings from France, in efforts to stem the soaring popularity of the populist Reform UK party, which has driven the immigration agenda.
The government said it would take inspiration from Denmark’s approach, one of the toughest in Europe  — where growing anti-immigrant sentiment has led to increased restrictions in many countries  — and widely criticised by rights groups.
Temporary status subject to review
As part of the changes, the statutory duty to provide support to certain asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances, will be revoked, the Home Office (interior ministry) said in a statement issued late on Saturday.
The department, led by Shabana Mahmood, said the measures would apply to asylum seekers who can work but choose not to, and to those who break the law. It said that taxpayer-funded support would be prioritised for those contributing to the economy and local communities.
The Home Office also said that protection for refugees would “now be temporary, regularly reviewed and revoked” if the home country was deemed safe.
“Our system is particularly generous compared to other countries in Europe, where, after five years, you’re effectively automatically settled in this country. We will change that,” Mahmood told Sky News on Sunday.
She added that under the changes, a refugee’s status would be reviewed every two-and-a-half years, during “a much longer path to permanent settlement in this country of 20 years”.
Mahmood said she would provide further details of the changes on Monday, including an announcement on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
The government has said it wants to stay in the ECHR but change how the Article 8 provision, covering the right to a family life, is interpreted.
Mahmood said it was being “applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country.”
The government’s tougher approach has drawn criticism. More than 100 British charities wrote to Mahmood, urging her to “end the scapegoating of migrants and performative policies that only cause harm”, saying such steps are fuelling racism and violence.
Polls suggest immigration has overtaken the economy as British voters’ top concern. Over the summer, protests took place outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.
A total of 109,343 people claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending March 2025, a 17 per cent rise on the previous year and 6pc above the 2002 peak of 103,081.
Mahmood said the government would look to open more “safe and legal” routes for asylum seekers, as she believed Britain should play its part in helping those fleeing danger.
UK govt inspired by Denmark, other European countries
The Home Office said its reforms would look to “match and in some areas exceed” the standards of Denmark and other European countries, where refugee status is temporary, support is conditional and integration in society is expected.
Asylum seekers are granted temporary residence permits under Denmark’s approach, usually for two years, and they must reapply when these expire. They can be repatriated if their home country is deemed safe, and the path to citizenship has also been lengthened.
The Home Office said Denmark’s more restrictive immigration policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the deportation of 95pc of rejected applicants.
Denmark’s reforms, implemented while it remains a signatory to the ECHR, have drawn sharp criticism. Rights groups say the measures foster a hostile climate for migrants, undermine protection and leave asylum seekers in prolonged limbo.
Britain’s Refugee Council said on X that refugees do not compare asylum systems while fleeing danger, and that they come to the UK because of family ties, some knowledge of English, or existing connections that help them start anew safely.</p><small>2025-11-16 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1615241280ecd7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955450/three-suspects-arrested-for-allegedly-attacking-cricketer-naseem-shahs-house-in-kps-lower-dir-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three suspects arrested for allegedly attacking cricketer Naseem Shah’s house in KP’s Lower Dir: police</strong></a><br><p>Police in Lower Dir have arrested three suspects in connection with the attack on Pakistani cricketer Naseem Shah’s residence in the Mayar area earlier this month, officials said on Saturday.
The attack had occurred in the early hours of November 10, when unidentified gunmen opened fire on the main gate of the cricketer’s house at around 1:45am, leaving bullet marks on doors, walls, and windows. The attackers had fled immediately, leaving the family shaken but unharmed.
A special police team, led by Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigations Rashid Ahmed Khan, and comprising Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Jandol Circle Alim Khan, Station House Officer (SHO) Mayar police station Idrees Khan, and Chief Information Officer (CIO) Hayat Muhammad Khan, investigated the case.
Reviewing CCTV footage and other evidence from the vicinity, the police said they identified and arrested the three suspects after Naseem’s father, Zafar Shah, nominated them in the case.
During interrogation, all three confessed to their involvement in the attack, the police claimed, adding that the motive behind the attack appeared to be tied to a recent land dispute between two local families.
“A few days before the incident, a disagreement over land had escalated. On the day of the attack, one party was cultivating wheat on the disputed land when the other party allegedly opened fire. As the relatives of Naseem’s mother were connected to one of the rival families, the cricketer’s house was targeted,” an official explained.
He added that further investigation into the case is underway, while authorities have enhanced security around the cricketer’s residence to prevent any further incidents.
Residents described Naseem Shah’s family as respected and law-abiding, expressing relief at the swift police action. “The arrests have brought some peace to our community,” a relative said.</p><small>2025-11-16 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/6918828fa6753.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955259/football-what-kind-of-league' target='_blank'><strong>FOOTBALL: WHAT KIND OF LEAGUE?</strong></a><br><p>The notice is out: the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) under its recently-elected chief, Mohsen Gilani, is looking for willing partners in order to launch a new domestic league.
In a public notice, the PFF has asked prospective partners to submit an expression of interest and a detailed proposal by early next month.
The big question remains, however, is whether the new competition would be based on the old model of the Pakistan Premier Football League — which had a mix of departments and smattering of clubs, and hasn’t been held since 2019 — or will it be franchise-based.
Franchise league merchants, several in number in Pakistan, will be quick to jump in; their plans have been in motion for years. The only thing lacking was an endorsement by the PFF.
For departments — many of whom have shut down their sports operations due to changing domestic policies and the decade of crisis in the PFF — and clubs, however, getting a proposal together would be more taxing. A proposal as such will also have to deliberate about the teams promoted from the last edition of the second-tier Pakistan Football Federation League, held in 2020 under the FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee for the PFF.

Pakistan Football may soon get a new domestic league. But questions remain about what kind of league it will be and whether it will be what Pakistan really needs

PFF’s sense of urgency to start the league has been heightened by the visit to the country last week of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa. Sheikh Salman, FIFA’s senior vice-president, reaffirmed AFC’s support for the holding of the league.
“We will offer all the support we can,” Asia’s football chief told Eos in an interview during his visit. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be a pro league [at the outset] but maybe, in the future, it should be one. It will depend on the value of the market and how much we can sustain it.
“The solution is to bring the right people to guide and advise what needs to be done in your country. Each country is different from the other, so maybe a formula that is beneficial for Japan, might not work in Pakistan. If we take it step by step, we will see some difference.”

The clamour in Pakistan, though, is about a franchise football league on similar lines to cricket’s hugely-popular Pakistan Super League. There has also been a prolonged infatuation with the Indian Super League (ISL) across the border, which is seemingly teetering to its end after a decade-long run. Those backing the same model in Pakistan, however, remain unflinching.
Sheikh Salman, though, had some words of advice. “It should be a proper league and not one that runs for three months,” he said when asked about taking lessons from India. “It has to be a good balance between the football aspect and the commercial side. We want to keep it hand in hand, not one taking over the other.”
THE PROBLEMS OF ISL
The ISL was launched to huge fanfare in 2014, with hopes it would take football in India to great heights. It didn’t and, instead, it stands on the verge of collapse after the All India Football Federation received no bids on its tender for a new commercial partner by last week’s deadline.
Critics of the ISL said its formation cut the pathways for the grassroots, with the franchise owners more interested in adding more glamour. The former India national team coach, Stephen Constantine — who later steered Pakistan to their first-ever victory in a FIFA World Cup qualifier — said he wouldn’t go to see an “ISL match with seven foreigners in a team.”
Constantine’s reasoning was clear: as the coach of the Indian team, he wanted to see more Indian players play. Other Indian coaches, such as Shanmugam Venkatesh, the assistant of Constantine’s successor Igor Stimac, said the ISL was more about entertainment than about developing local players.
ISL’s short duration (it eventually became a six-month event) was always a talking point. India had to overhaul its running domestic system to make space for it, and its eventual succession to become the top-tier league. Now, its very existence is at stake.
During his tenure as Pakistan coach, Constantine had expressed his constant frustration at the local players not getting enough competition. “Anything would do,” he would say. “Just get the bloody league started.”
The question remains if there will be sizeable local representation in a franchise league. Franchise owners will want a return on their investment quickly and the eyeballs they need are most likely to come through foreign players.
It all boils down to the will of the prospective franchise owners and whether they can promise investment for developing local players with the franchise league, to create the pathways for the clubs — several thousands of them spread across the country — to rise to the very top.
And unlike cricket, where the PSL was to be the crowning jewel, the cream at the top with a domestic system very much running, football in the country at this point in time needs to start at the very base of the pyramid.
THE UZBEK MODEL
Sheikh Salman spoke during his interview about being patient but making steady progress, highlighting the rise of countries such as Uzbekistan and Jordan, who secured World Cup finals qualification for the first time in their history this year.
“When you look at a country like Uzbekistan, they have won the Under-17 Asian Cup [this year] and the Under-20 Asian Cup [in 2023],” he said. “That means progress is going steady, which is great. It is good for Asian football. Tajikistan played well in the last Asian Cup and it also shows football in Central Asia is booming, but that hasn’t been the case in South Asia.”
There’s something common in both Uzbekistan and Jordan: a no fancy-frills league, but one that is sure and steady. Uzbekistan has moved beyond the ill-fated experiment of its club Bunyodkor attempting to become a ‘super club’ in 2009, when it lured Brazilian great Rivaldo.
In fact, its age-group successes that have subsequently powered the national team could well be attributed to one club: Olympic Tashkent. Owned by the Uzbek Olympic Association, it is made up entirely of youth-level players and features in the top-tier league. It acts like a nursery, while ensuring competition for top under-23 talents who would otherwise be warming the benches of bigger clubs.
LEARNING LESSONS
The decade of crisis has meant the new PFF starts with a clean slate, but with a job to not only revive the league but also the domestic cup competition. The National Challenge Cup was last held in 2024 by the Normalisation Committee, featuring departments and clubs.
It is the franchise league that has dominated the agenda, though, with an Eos investigation showing last year that officials from global football body FIFA were also involved in the plan to get it underway during the tenure of the chairman of the Normalisation Committee appointed by it.
Officials of the government seem smitten by the franchise league plan as well, and the strong possibility remains that it will soon be off the ground — the only thing to be decided being which partner the PFF will choose.
Pakistan, though, should make an informed decision on what it needs and what it will get. It should heed the lessons others have learnt the hard way.

According to the first information report (FIR) filed with the Kakrali police, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the case was registered under section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The victim alleged that her 18-year-old son-in-law had sexually assaulted her multiple times, but claimed that he was being possessed by a djinn and controlled into doing so.
“A djinn named Adil is in love with me,” she claimed according to the FIR, adding that whenever he “gains control” of the suspect, he “does not become normal until he has sex with [her]”.
 
 

The victim added that the incidents had “destroyed” her home life and requested legal action to be taken against the suspect.
Reports of ‘djinns’ being responsible for criminal activity are uncommon, but not unheard of in Pakistan. In September, the Lahore High Court summoned the Punjab inspector general of police (IGP) in a petition seeking the recovery of a woman who had gone missing six years ago and was still unrecovered; according to the complainant and the police, the victim’s in-laws insisted she had been kidnapped by a djinn.</p><small>2025-11-16 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161248033cdd8d3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955440/state-must-ensure-every-woman-receives-her-rightful-share-in-inheritance-sc' target='_blank'><strong>State must ensure every woman receives her rightful share in inheritance: SC</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the state must ensure every Pakistani woman gets her share in inheritance and called for a mechanism to assist them in securing this “divinely bestowed” right.
The observation came in a seven-page judgment released on Saturday, authored by Justice Athar Minallah for a case heard by him and Justice Irfan Saadat Khan on August 29. It may be noted that the verdict was authored before Justice Minallah resigned as a judge on November 13, criticising the newly passed 27th Amendment that has practically replaced the SC with the Federal Constitutional Court as the country’s apex judicial platform.
“It is incumbent upon the state under the Constitution and the clear
Injunctions of Islam, to ensure the effective and unfettered realisation of women’s right to inheritance,” the order read.
 
 

In its verdict, the SC bench dismissed an appeal filed by Abrar Hussain against a March 3, 2023, order of the Sindh High Court (SHC). The high court had rejected his plea challenging a 2021 order that had also refused his appeal against a 2019 trial court decision.
The case pertained to a property dispute between Hussain and his sister Bibi Shahida, who had filed a complaint in March 2015. Shahida said she repeatedly demanded her share after her father passed away in 2002, as well as her two other siblings later on, but Hussain refused to give it.
Hussain “took exclusive possession of the property; thereby depriving the other legal heirs of their lawful shares”, the SC judgment observed.
“The petitioner (Hussain) had no case on merits and yet persisted in litigation, thereby prolonging the deprivation of his siblings of their lawful inheritance, which devolved upon them on 1.1.2002, the date of their father’s demise,” Justice Minallah wrote.
“The challenge before this court was nothing more than an attempt
to delay and frustrate the rights of the other legal heirs, amounting to
a mere abuse of process,” he noted.
 
 

The state had a constitutional duty to ensure that “every woman is informed of, and enabled to claim her rightful share in inheritance without delay, fear or dependence on lengthy litigation”, the judgment read.
It added that the state must establish a “proactive and accessible mechanism through which women can be identified, reached out to,” and assisted in securing their lawful entitlements.
“Furthermore, those who, through coercion, deceit, or undue influence, deprive women of this divinely bestowed right must be held accountable under the law and made answerable,” Justice Minallah stressed.
The judgment also referred to the Federal Shariat Court’s (FSC) landmark ruling in March this year, wherein it declared that any custom — such as of ‘Chaddar’, ‘Parchi’ or ‘Haq Bakhshwai’ — that deprived women of inheritance right was “un-Islamic” and had no legal standing whatsoever.
The SC judgment observed that the right to inheritance was “not a concession granted by human law but a divinely ordained command, explicitly declared in the Holy Quran”. “Any denial or obstruction of this right is, therefore, not merely unlawful but a transgression against Divine Will,” it stated.
 
 

The ruling, echoing the FSC’s verdict, emphasised that “cultural or societal practices that deprive women of their rightful inheritance are rooted neither in faith nor in justice”.
It termed such customs “remnants of ignorance which the
message of Islam came to abolish”, and noted that the state bore a “sacred
constitutional duty to uproot such practices”.
“A society that turns a blind eye to deprivation of inheritance rights to its women defies the spirit of Constitution and express Command of Almighty Allah,” the ruling stated.
“A state that fails to safeguard the inheritance rights to its women fails in its duty to uphold the principles of equity, faith and justice.”
The SC in its short order had imposed a cost of Rs500,000 on Hussain, which was to deposed with the SC registrar within seven days. “It is directed that the
amount so deposited shall be distributed amongst the legal heirs
declared by the trial court,” the SC judgment reiterated.
The property dispute
In her 2015 complaint, Shahida alleged that Hussain “was in illegal possession of the property and had rented out a portion of it without the consent of the other legal heirs, while retaining the rent without distributing it according to their respective shares”, the judgment recalled.
It noted that the remaining siblings supported the assertion made by Shahida and consented to her suit.
On the other hand, Hussain contested the suit claiming that the “predecessor-in-interest had gifted the property to him during his lifetime out of love and affection and that possession had been handed over to him”.
In October 2019, a trial court decreed Shahida’s 2015 suit, declaring Shahid, Hussain and other siblings as the legal heirs. It ordered that the property be partitioned, or sold, and its proceeds be divided if the former was not possible, and also directed Hussain to pay mesne profit to other legal heirs from the rent received by him.
Hussain challenged that decision in an appellate court, but his petition was dismissed in January 2021. A second appeal was also dismissed by the SHC in an order dated March 3, 2023.</p><small>2025-11-16 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16132117324c5ed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955442/sakurajima-volcano-erupts-in-southwest-japan-spews-ash-up-to-4400m' target='_blank'><strong>Sakurajima volcano erupts in southwest Japan, spews ash up to 4,400m</strong></a><br><p>A volcano on Sakurajima in southwestern Japan’s Kagoshima Prefecture erupted early on Sunday morning, spewing ash and smoke up to 4,400 metres into the atmosphere, according to Kyodo News.
As the eruption continued, the weather agency issued an ashfall forecast for parts of Kagoshima, Kumamoto and Miyazaki prefectures. However, no injuries or building damages have been reported.
“An explosive eruption around 12:57am (8:57am PKT) on Sunday at the Minamidake crater sent a plume rising above 4,000m for the first time since October 18 last year,” the news agency said citing the local meteorological observatory.
 
 

In the latest series of eruptions, large volcanic rocks flew “as far as the fifth station”, but no pyroclastic flows were detected, said Kyodo News. It added that the alert level remains at a three on a scale of five, restricting access to the mountain.

The statement said that on various dates in October, students along with external accomplices stormed the registrar’s office, assaulted a female student, attempted to forcefully enter the vice-chancellor’s office, attacked a police guard, and showed deliberate disrespect during the national anthem at an event. Another reported incident involved anti-Pakistan slogans during a cricket match screening.
A fact-finding committee was formed to investigate the incidents, after which the case was referred to the university’s disciplinary committee. The accused students were issued show-cause notices and given the opportunity to present their defence. Their replies were found unsatisfactory.
Under university discipline rules, the administration expelled the involved students and cancelled their admissions. Hostel rooms were vacated and sealed. Those expelled include Aman Burki, Irfanullah, Nangyal Bittani, Ehsan Mehsud, and Tariq Bittani, while former student Amir Bittani has been banned from campus for five years.
The university clarified that expelled students cannot seek admission in any other institution.
The administration stated that a small group, backed by disruptive elements, has been attempting to disturb the university’s peaceful environment. It added that despite recent improvements in academics and administration under Vice-Chancellor Dr Zafar Iqbal, certain groups tried to incite unrest through false propaganda.
The university has also sought support from district authorities and the police to maintain security on the campus.

Mr Musa is the main accused in a case of a domestic servant over a minor dispute at his residence in the Pir Ghani area of Pakpattan on July 17, 2025.
The judge directed the Pakpattan Saddar Police to arrest Musa Maneka and present him before the court on November 19.
A case was registered against Mr Musa at the Saddar police station after getting enraged when his 18-year-old servant, Ali Bahadur, removed bedsheets from his room without his permission.
In a fit of anger, Musa allegedly fired a 30-bore pistol at Ali, hitting him in the left knee.
The bullet passed through his leg. Witnesses claimed that Mr Musa then threatened other household servants with similar consequences if they attempted to assist the injured servant.
A call was later made to the police, prompting District Police Officer (DPO) Javed Iqbal Chadhar and a team of the Saddar police to reach the scene.
DPO Chadhar reportedly confronted Musa Maneka and took him into custody and also recovered the weapon used in the incident.
 
 

Ali Bahadur, a resident of Chak Alam Hatayka, had been employed at the Maneka residence for the past two years. After the shooting, he was transported to the Pakpattan District Headquarters Hospital by Rescue 1122.
A case was registered against Musa at Saddar Police Station on the complaint of Ali’s father, Manzoor.
Musa Maneka is also a key suspect in a Rs113.1 million corruption case alongside his father Khawar Maneka and brother Ibrahim Maneka. Ibrahim has been declared an absconder after reportedly fleeing to Spain.
The case has been under investigation at the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) regional office for the past two years.
The Maneka trio, along with Excise Inspector Allah Nawaz, Patwari Muhammad Ashraf, and Auqaf Manager Shafqat, were named in a reference filed by the then Okara deputy commissioner on August 23, 2023.

Mr Moonis has been living in Spain for about three years following the crackdown on Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) here.
Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had been vigorously pursuing the extradition plea before Interpol and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had furnished so-called evidence related to money laundering and other offences during the last couple of years with the Interpol.
 
 

Rejecting the Pakistan government’s plea, the Interpol said: “The General Secretariat of International Criminal Police Organization – Interpol – hereby certifies that as of today Mr Moonis Elahi is not subject to an Interpol notice or diffusion.”

Cites lack of evidence in money laundering, murder and other cases

A source in the FIA told this reporter that Interpol had dropped the investigation against Moonis for want of evidence against him. “Although the FIA had been pursuing this case for about two years, it appears that Interpol did not accommodate its stance because most cases were of political nature,” he said.
Interestingly, Gujrat police implicated Moonis in a murder case that was used in the government’s plea before Interpol. However, the local court withdrew arrest warrants and proclamation of him after the case turned out to be false, which helped Moonis prove the government’s malafide stance.
A counsel for Moonis Amir Rawn told Dawn that the Interpol cleared his client of all baseless charges framed by the PML-N government after a thorough fact-finding probe.
“The Interpol’s clean chit has proved that all allegations ranging from murder to money laundering and fraud to corruption were politically motivated against Moonis,” he said and added the Elahi family had been victimised for staying loyal to Imran Khan.
“Moonis Elahi deserves an apology from the Pakistani authorities for targeting him through fake cases,” he said and added that the Elahi family had faced relentless targeting since the PML-N returned to power.
“Moonis has been vocal in criticising the PML-N regime, especially Mohsin Naqvi and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, making him a prime target. The ruling party’s use of fake cases, arrests, and coercive measures against opposition figures reflects a broader strategy to suppress dissent,” he said and added the case in point serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of weaponising state institutions against political opponents.
Interior ministry spokesperson Qadir Yar Tiwana did not comment on Dawn’s query in this regard.

According to the data from IQAir, an air quality monitoring platform, Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) soared to a staggering ‘hazardous’ level of 577 in the early hours of the day, once again ranking it as one of the most polluted cities in the world. The provincial capital was ranked second after improvement in its air quality on the global pollution index in the evening.
The AQI of other stations in Lahore at 8pm were recorded at 448 at Phase 8 DHA, 342 at Gurumangat Road and AC Office Shalimar Complex Wahga at 305.
 
 

Other major cities in Punjab also reported hazardous conditions. In Gujranwala, particulate matter levels soared to 632, far exceeding safe limits. Similarly, Sialkot recorded an AQI of 462, indicating extremely poor air quality and prompting renewed concerns over public health.

Lahore retains the most polluted city title for fourth consecutive day

As smog casts a pall over the cities turning the sun into a faint, orange disc, environmental experts have warned that prolonged exposure to such high pollution levels can lead to respiratory illnesses, eye and throat irritation, and long-term health complications. Authorities continued to urge residents to limit outdoor activities, wear masks, and take precautionary measures as smog conditions persist across the region.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasted dry weather in most districts of Punjab, however, cold and dry weather, with very cold during the mornings and nights, is likely in Kashmir, Murree and Galliyat. It also warned that smog could further develop over a few plain areas of Punjab.
Earlier, a smog awareness campaign was launched in Lahore and masks were distributed among citizens at China Chowk. The campaign was launched by Nawaz Sharif Lovers group Chairperson Uzma Aamir Butt. The participants also appealed to the citizens to conduct emission tests of their vehicles and not come out of their houses without wearing masks.
Meanwhile, Punjab police carried out an anti-smog operation and registered 28 cases against violators and arrested them from various districts, including Lahore, during the last 24 hours.
Punjab Police spokesperson said that during the operations, fines amounting to Rs915,000 were imposed on 499 individuals, and 44 people were issued warnings. A total of 26 violations of crop residue burning, 227 violations by smoke-emitting vehicles, and five violations related to brick kilns were reported.
The spokesperson further said that during the current year, a total of 2,548 cases were registered and 2,278 violators were arrested across various districts as a result of the anti-smog crackdown. During this period, fines amounting to more than Rs192.3 million were imposed on 91,518 individuals, while 13,166 people were issued warnings. Reported violations included 1,652 cases of crop-residue burning, 54,850 violations by smoke-emitting vehicles, 1,407 industrial violations, and 2,117 brick kiln violations.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar has directed the concerned officers to further accelerate the anti-smog crackdown on highways, in industrial areas, agricultural lands, and other locations. He made it clear that under the zero-tolerance policy, no delay should be made in taking strict action against those who violate the smog SOPs.

The report covered PTI founder Imran Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister. Imran married Bushra in February 2018.
 






An official response, issued by the party’s media wing, claimed that co-writer Bushra Taskeen was a known critic of PTI and the “so-called” analysis published in the report was to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and stolen elections.
The party said it had the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and publication, if they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology.
 






“We have seen this narrative play out before. Half-truths, innuendo, selective outrage, all packaged and presented as ‘objective analysis’. This attempt to misrepresent facts is not intended to inform Pakistan or its people, but rather to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and systematically stolen elections,” it claimed.
“What is most striking is the convenient targeting of Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, who have been incarcerated for two years and three months, while the article remains silent on what has been happening in Pakistan for the last three years and seven months. There is no mention of human rights violations, the rigged elections confirmed even by the Commonwealth observers, the hundreds of PTI supporters who have recently been convicted to 10-year sentences in fabricated cases, or the systematic political persecution the party has faced.
“Instead, the writers chose to focus on the personal lives of the country’s most popular and courageous leader, a man revered by millions of Pakistanis, while ignoring the glaring injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens, party members, and the democratic system itself.”
 
 

The party further claimed that the Al Qadir Trust case, frequently cited in the article, was ongoing and had not been “fixed” as implied.
“PTI has consistently sought transparency and judicial resolution. The Constitution itself has been repeatedly tampered with, in fear of Imran Khan, undermining the rule of law. One must ask the writers why they did not highlight these grave concerns and instead chose to sensationalise the personal life of the PTI leader? Furthermore, co-writer Bushra Taskeen is a known critic of PTI, demonstrating clear bias against Imran Khan and favouring the PML-N, calling into question the objectivity of this analysis,” the party stated.
“Imran Khan’s own trials are far from open and fair. They are being conducted inside prison, denying him his basic rights, including meetings with family, friends, and legal counsel, despite explicit court orders. This systematic denial of due process exposes the politically motivated nature of these proceedings, yet the article conspicuously omits these facts.“
The PTI added that they “reserve the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and The Economist, should they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology for this baseless, reckless, and defamatory personal attack on the leader of 240 million Pakistanis and the millions of devoted supporters of Imran Khan worldwide”.
“The people of Pakistan know the truth. They see through these attempts to malign their leader and continue to revere Imran Khan for his courage, integrity, and steadfast commitment to the nation. His moral leadership and dedication to justice remain a beacon of hope for millions, despite the relentless political persecution he and his family have endured,” the response concluded.</p><small>2025-11-16 03:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16082022e75841a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955376/fazl-addresses-clerics-in-dhaka' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl addresses clerics in Dhaka</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman called for stron­ger ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh on Sunday, telling a large religious gathering that a shared “unity of faith was a stronger bond between the two nations that cannot be abolished”.
The JUI-F chief was addressing the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat conference at Suhrawardy Ground in Dhaka. “The people of Bangladesh possessed a strong and dynamic spirit of activism, but religious movements stood for continuity and stability at the ideology not violence,” he said.
 






Maulana Fazl emphasised that the delegation from Pakistan had not come merely to attend the event but to convey a message of goodwill from the Pakistani people to their Bangladeshi brethren. Focusing on the conference’s central theme of the finality of prophethood, Maulana Fazl underscored a core shared belief.
“We the Muslims of Pakistan and Bangladesh are part of a single Ummah,” he said, adding that scholars across the subcontinent are united in the belief that anyone claiming prophethood after Prophet Muhammad is outside the fold of Islam.
The JUI-F chief also expressed hope that the conference would serve as a catalyst for strengthening relations and cooperation across various sectors.
He pledged that “if Bangladesh took one step forward, Pakistan would take two”, and asserted that “mutual goodwill and affection would continue to grow stronger between the two countries”.
Participants were also seen carrying Palestinian flags during the event.

The regional police officer’s (RPO) spokesperson confirmed the clash between law enforcers and terrorists. “A large police contingent backed by CTD commandos was dispatched to the remote rural area when local police authorities received credible information about the presence of Fitna al-Khawarij terrorists,” he said, using an official term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He added that a fierce gun battle erupted when law enforcers tried to surround the terrorists in the border area between Lakki Marwat and Bannu.
According to the official, seven terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire that lasted several hours. “The police first recovered five bodies and then two more bodies of terrorists were found during a search operation,” he said, adding that no policemen were hurt in the fighting.
The regional police chief said the militants had initially moved into the Shaikh Landak area, within the Havaid police jurisdiction, to attack a police post. He told reporters when police, with the support of residents, swung into action, the terrorists fled towards Takhtikhel, where they were again confronted by police and villagers. “The terrorists were surrounded by the police and armed tribesmen of both districts,” he said, adding that police had seized arms and ammunition from the slain militants and launched a search for their fleeing accomplices.
“Law enforcers are busy in the sanitisation operation to clear the area of other terrorists and recover the bodies of more slain Khawarij, if any,” he said.
RPO Khan said the militants’ hideouts were being identified with the help of locals. “These operations are proof of the police’s strong resolve and commitment to eliminate the menace of terrorism,” he asserted.
KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed praised the police for their “quick and effective action” against Fitna al-Khawarij.
Bridge blown up
Separately, a small bridge was blown up with explosives in the Masoomabad area on the Bannu-Miranshah Road on Friday night.
A police official said an improvised explosive device planted under the culvert exploded, damaging part of the bridge. He said the blast was heard across the locality. “Luckily, no human loss occurred as a result of the explosion,” he added.
Quadcopter strike
Meanwhile, four people, including two teenagers, were injured in a quadcopter strike in the Sher­i­k­hel area of Lakki Marwat on Friday evening. A police official said that based on initial reports, explosives were dropped from a quadcopter on a cricket ground where villagers had gathered to watch a match.
“The injured were shifted to the District Head­quarters Hos­pital,” the official said.
Also on Saturday, RPO Sajjad Khan paid an unannounced visit to parts of Bannu city to review security arrangements, traffic management and police deployment at key public places.

The initiative addresses multiple forms of violence against children in Pakistan, including killings, physical and sexual violence, psychological abuse, and neglect.  The plan comes as the country faces challenges where only one in three children under five is registered at birth and over 12.5 million are involved in child labour.
 
 

The consultations, which included experts, partners, participants from all provinces and self-governed areas, began in Karachi last week and concluded in Islamabad.
The new strategy will be grounded in the principles of the  UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the INSPIRE framework, an evidence-based package developed by international agencies under WHO’s leadership.
According to a WHO statement, the framework outlines seven strategies focused on laws, norms, safe environments, caregiver support, financial stability, response services, and life skills, which have proven effective in reducing violence against children.

Consultations underway to protect 112m minors against various abuses

“We recognise that fragmented efforts must now evolve into a cohesive, national, multi-sectoral strategy, one that mobilises education, health, law enforcement, and community systems together,” Federal Secretary for the Ministry of Human Rights Abdul Khalique Shaikh said.  “The strategy will provide that unified vision, with measurable targets, clear institutional responsibilities, and a robust monitoring and evaluation framework.”
The lack of birth registration creates significant gaps in protection, leaving many children vulnerable. Displaced, migrant and those in poor urban settlements face high risks of exploitation, early marriage, trafficking and child labour.

Immunisation against climate-sensitive diseases and the strengthening of health infrastructure have some of the highest climate-adaptation values among health sector investments. For every $100 invested in these activities, up to $36.50 goes towards addressing the additional disease burden caused by climate change.
The report, titled “Protecting Our Future: An Investment Framework for Quantifying the Climate Adap­ta­tion Benefits of Health and Immu­nisa­tion Investments”, proposes a quantitative framework that enables key funders and national governments to identify health sector investments — such as strengthening healthcare infrastructure, early warning and health surveillance systems, improving vaccine delivery and cold-chain systems, and bolstering immunisation and disease-outbreak preparedness — that simultaneously advance both health and climate objectives.
Collectively, multilateral development banks (MDBs) have invested nearly $2bn between 2019 and 2023 in making health systems more resilient to the effects of climate change. Despite the urgent need to build health resilience among vulnerable populations facing escalating climate-driven threats, less than 0.5 per cent of global climate finance currently supports human health interventions, leaving a critical gap in adaptation strategies, notes the report.
Six countries examined
The report assessed all health-sector investments made by AIIB, the World Bank and Gavi between 2019 and 2023. It also examined six countries highly vulnerable to climate impacts — Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and the Philippines — and found that the share of funding for health programmes with climate adaptation objectives has increased in these countries in recent years.

In Pakistan, 74pc of the funding targeted mitigation

Regarding Pakistan, the report states that growing exposure to extreme climate events, such as floods, droughts and heatwaves, has contributed to an increase in climate finance. Estimates place the total amount of development finance targeting climate change from 2019 to 2021 at $5.4bn.
 
 

During this three-year period, the majority (74pc) of the funding targeted mitigation, while a quarter ($1.37bn) went to adaptation activities. Overall, Pakistan has limited climate-finance provision, as pressing priorities such as poverty eradication often outweigh long-term domestic investments. One earlier report noted that climate-relat­­ed expenditures made up only 6pc of the federal development budget in 2014.
The most common climate-related health hazards in Pakistan stem from extreme heat, erratic rainfall patterns, landslides and droughts. Many of these extreme weather events have intensified and become more frequent in recent years.
Flooding also poses major risks due to heavy rainfall and erratic monsoons. Communities along the Indus River are particularly susceptible to diseases like cholera and malaria because of their proximity to flooding events.

The highest number of arrests or detentions were made in 2025, the report says, adding that a total of 100,971 Afghans were arrested from Jan 1 to Nov 8, 2025, whereas 9,006 Afghans were detained in 2024. In 2023, 26,299 Afghans were arrested.
The UNHCR report, which was released on Friday, says that prior to 2023, there was no data collected on the arrest and detention of Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders or undocumented Afghan nationals. Since January 2023, International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has started to collect this data.
From Nov 2 to 8, a total of 13,380 Afghan nationals were arrested and detained, marking a 72 per cent increase compared to the previous week. Out of all arrests and detentions during Nov 2 to 8, the ACC holders and undocumented Afghans represented 76pc of the total arrest and detentions, and Proof of Registration (PoR) holders represented 24pc.

Majority of detentions reported from Chagai, Quetta and Attock

During the reporting period of Nov 2 to 8, 41pc of the total reported arrests and detentions took place in Balochistan, and 43pc in Punjab.
Key findings of UNHCR report says cumulatively, from September 15, 2023, to November 8, 2025, 1,723,481 individuals have returned to Afghanistan. During the period November 2 to 8, UNHCR and IOM say 55,768 Afghans returned through the Torkham, Ghulam Khan (located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Chaman, Badini and Bahramcha (located in Balochistan) border crossing points to Afghanistan.
Between Nov 2 and 8, the number of returns and deportations rose by 49pc and 75pc, respectively, compared to the previous week of Oct 26–Nov 1 (37,448 returns including 7,733 deportations). From Nov 2 to 8, the figures reached 55,768 returns, including 13,548 deportations.
The increase in returns is attributed to the reopening of the Torkham border on Nov 1, which allowed more Afghan returnees to cross into Afghanistan. However, the overall number of Afghan returnees during this reporting period still remain more moderate compared to the peaks observed in late August and September.
For the returns from Nov 2 to Nov 8, most of the returnees were PoR holders (48pc) followed by undocumented (43pc) and ACC holders (9pc). Majority of the POR returns include those facilitated by UNHCR through the Voluntary Repatriation Centres (VRCs).
For the deportees from Nov 2 to 8, most were undocumented (84pc), followed by PoR holders (13pc) and ACC holders (3pc).
Since April 1, this year, 869,448 Afghan nationals returned to Afghanistan, of which 115,159 (13pc) were deported. During this period, fear of arrest remained the main reason for the return among undocumented individuals and ACC holders (93pc) as well as PoR holders (47pc).
 
 

During the same time period, returnees were most likely to return from Quetta (20pc); Attock (13pc) and Islamabad (9pc) in the country and intend to go to Kunduz (19pc), Nangarhar (18pc) and Kabul (17pc) in Afghanistan.
In 2025, the Pakistan government issued several directives impacting Afghan nationals. In January, the government announced that Afghan nationals should relocate from Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and Rawalpindi, or else face deportation.
In April, further announcements indicated the implementation of the second phase of the “IFRP”, targeting ACC holders, in addition to undocumented Afghans.
 
 

In July, the government issued a Statutory Regulation Order (SRO) directing the repatriation/deportation of PoR card holders following the expiry of PoR card validity on June 30. The government later indicated a deadline of Sept 1 for PoR holders to leave Pakistan, before the start of the repatriation/deportation process.
434 shifted to refugee camp
As police raids continued in different parts of Balochistan, a total of 434 Afghan nationals were taken into custody in Nokundi, officials said.
Acting on a tip-off, they said, the law enforcement agencies raided a residence in Killi Burhanabad, Nokundi, where the Afghan nationals were hiding. Upon seeing the police, the house owner, Sarfaraz, who belongs to Burhanzai tribe, along with three unidentified suspects fled. However, police detained around 200 Afghans during the operation and registered an FIR.
In a subsequent operation, police raided the residences of Khaleel Ahmed and Attaullah, sons of Sher Ali, and took at least 234 Afghan nationals into custody. All detainees were later transferred under police supervision to the Girdi Jungle Refugee Camp for deportation proceedings.

According to a notification from the Finance Division, the new HSD price is Rs284.44 per litre. The prices will come into effect on November 16.
“The government has revised the prices of the petroleum products following input from the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) and the relevant ministries.”
 






Most of the transport sec­tor runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
The government charges about Rs99 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petrol levy and climate support levy.
It also charges about Rs17-18 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre of distribution and sales margins are going to oil companies and their dealers. Petrol and HSD dominate consumption at 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes a month compared to about 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.
Petroleum levy collections reached Rs1.161 trillion in FY25 and are budgeted to rise about 27pc to Rs1.47tr in the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-11-16 02:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1607271805aeb66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955382/china-russia-may-not-veto-gaza-resolution-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>China, Russia may not veto Gaza resolution tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: Senior UN diplomats are cautiously optimistic that China and Russia may abstain rather than veto a US-sponsored Security Council resolution to authorise an international stabilisation force (ISF) in Gaza — a key test of the UN’s ability to back a postceasefire vision for the enclave, according to diplomatic sources.
The draft resolution is expected to come up for vote in the UN Security Council on Monday, and would take effect if it secures at least nine affirmative votes and avoids a veto from any of the five permanent members (the US, China, Russia, Britain and France).
“China will not veto the resolution, but Russia’s position is uncertain, and key as well,” said one senior diplomat. Another added, “both China and Russia may abstain, but they will not use their veto.”
 
 

The draft resolution, formally circulated by the US, would authorise a two-year mandate for a transitional body called the Board of Peace, chaired by President Donald Trump, as proposed in his 20-point Gaza plan. It would also authorise a temporary, 20,000-strong ISF to disarm non-state armed groups, secure humanitarian corridors, protect civilians, and help rebuild governance structures. The US has clarified that no American troops will be deployed in the force.
In a strong show of regional support, eight Arab and Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Qatar, Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Jordan and Turkey, signed a joint statement this week, endorsing the US draft and called for its swift passage. The United States also joined the statement. According to the diplomats, this backing reflects deep concern over a resurgence of violence.
Asked why Muslim states supported the US resolution, one diplomat said, “Nobody wants the Palestinian genocide to resume.”
At the UN, the Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine, Riyad Mansour, met Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN Asim Iftikhar Ahmad and concurred that “blood-letting in Gaza must stop immediately.” The Palestinian mission is believed to have endorsed the Arab-Muslim group’s support for the US text.
The draft envisions a Board of Peace to administer Gaza during the transition, but this has drawn sharp criticism. Russia and China have pressed to remove the board entirely.
The ISF would work on “permanent decommissioning of weapons” from non-state armed groups, including Hamas, a particularly sensitive point.
As the force “establishes control and stability,” the draft requires an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza tied to agreed “standards, milestones and timeframes” negotiated among Israel, the stabilisation force, the US, and others.
In response to criticism, the US draft was modified to emphasise “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” but only conditionally, after “faithful” reforms to the Palestinian Authority and progress in Gaza redevelopment.
 
 

Some Arab and possible troop-contributing countries have also raised concerns about how the Board of Peace will be composed, who will lead it, and what role (if any) the Palestinian Authority (PA) will have.
Opposing draft from Russia
Moscow has responded by tabling a rival draft that removes the Board of Peace and instead asks the UN Secretary-General to propose options for stabilisation and governance.  In its submission, Russia argues that the US draft falls short of “universally recognized international legal standards,” notably the long-standing two-state framework.  The alternative text seeks a more inclusively negotiated international force under clearer UN oversight.
The Trump administration, however, is pressing Council members hard to adopt the resolution. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has publicly defended the proposal, calling it “the best path to peace in the Middle East” and thanking the Arab and Muslim countries endorsing the resolution.
Despite optimism from US diplomats, the resolution faces serious hurdles as there is still no guarantee about veto; the UAE though in close talks publicly stated it sees “no clear framework” for the force and has not committed to sending troops; besides legitimacy concerns for the Board of Peace especially if the Palestinian Authority is sidelined; ambiguity over logistics and funding, and humanitarian urgency.

The International Day for Tolerance, which is being observed today, is a reminder that acceptance and appreciation bind us, and that the divergence of opinions, cultures, behaviour, heritage and beliefs close the loopholes in our social fabric. Ancient societies were rife with intolerance. Sadly, despite education and scientific advancements, we are witnessing a global regression towards earlier patterns due to misplaced superiority. Power, in all its manifestations, seeks to control the vulnerable. In Pakistan’s turbulent societal setting, governments weaponise fear, which creates insularity and animosity. We need a greater sense of security for more harmony among our people. Some have different faiths, others different politics, ethnicity, aspirations and practices. All these should translate into collective growth.
The path to prosperity lies in valuing differences. A firm stand against intolerance of any kind hinges on how committed the state, citizens and the clergy are to tackle the factors that drive hate and parochialism in the country. Respect for fundamental rights must be safeguarded to curb patriarchy, xenophobia and online hate. Educational institutions play a pivotal role in inculcating independent views, critical thinking and ethical inference in the young. Teachers cannot transform attitudes without a comprehensive overhaul of textbooks so that our history, heritage and ideals are reframed away from exploitative narratives. Moreover, access to information coupled with open-minded and balanced religious coaching, as well as implementation of laws against crimes of discrimination promise peace and productivity. The government must endorse justice for vulnerable and economically weaker groups. We have watched intolerance cause havoc across the globe. Prejudice and racism have not spared Pakistan’s image either. Only tolerance, free thought and democracy sustain diverse cultures. Lastly, we must embrace respect. Societies thrive as a confluence not a cauldron.

SSGC spokesperson Sal­man Ahmed Siddiqui said an 18-inch diameter QPCEP pipeline had ruptured at around 5am, affe­cting gas supply to multiple districts of the province.
The interruption hit Pis­hin, Kuchlak, Ziarat, Bus­tan, Hur­muzai, Mast­u­ng, Kalat, Mangocher, Kad Kocha, and nearby areas.
The spokesperson noted that as an interim arrangement, gas supply was being maintained at a limited level. He added that gas at low pressure was being provided through the company’s 12-inch QPL line to some suburban parts of Quetta, including Nawan Killi, Hanna, Sra Ghurgai, Pasht­unabad, and Eastern Bypass.
“The SSGC’s technical teams were immediately dispatched to the site and efforts are underway to repair the damaged pipeline at the earliest,” he elaborated.
The spokesperson said it was too early to give a timeline for the completion of repair work.
However, he added that the company would continue to keep its consumers updated on the situation.
