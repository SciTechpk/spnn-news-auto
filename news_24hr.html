However, no such development occurred.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping comprising members such as China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. Their defence ministers’ meeting was held on June 26 as a precursor to the annual summit of their leaders set for the autumn.
The defence ministers attending the SCO meeting failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal because of what it said was “a lack of consensus on referring to ‘terrorism’”.
Russia and India are close allies with significant military and defence interests, while the former’s relationship with Pakistan has seen significant growth in recent years.
On Sunday, digital news outlet The Daily CPEC shared a post on X that read: “Breaking: Russia has officially signed the joint SCO statement, supporting Pakistan’s position over India.”
It was viewed by 915,000 users.
Former Indian soldier and journalist Pravin Sawhney also quoted the post with the following caption: “This is a sure signal of where regional geopolitics is moving. Pakistan’s profile is on the rise!” racking up 563,000 views.
The claim was extensively shared by multiple users on X, here, here, and here, gaining 297,000, 159,000, and 80,000 views, respectively.
Other shares of the viral claim could be found here, here, here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in Pakistan’s regional position following the conflict with India earlier in May.
A keyword search for “Russia” and “SCO summit” yielded no relevant news stories from credible international media outlets or Chinese state news outlets that corroborated the alleged development.
As per the claims, Russia had officially signed the joint statement; however, checking Russian media outlets, including TASS, Russia Today, and Sputnik, yielded no announcement, press release or report to this effect.
All reported news coverage around the June 26 defence ministers’ meeting, such as by British outlet BBC and international wire news agency Reuters, was solely on India’s refusal to sign a joint statement at the summit over concerns the document was biased towards Pakistan for not mentioning April’s terror attack on Indian tourists, which subsequently led to the lack of any joint statement being issued.
Since then, there has been no other SCO-related development where member states have signed any statement.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that Russia officially signed the SCO summit statement in favour of Pakistan is false.  No statement was issued after the June 26 SCO defence ministers’ meeting and no such development has occurred or been reported by credible media outlets or state news outlets.

“During the meeting, both sides held discussions on [a] wide range of areas of mutual interest and bilateral cooperation,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press statement.
“The dignitaries discussed practical measures to further expand the level and scope of engagements between the two militaries. They also exchanged views on the broader geopolitical landscape.”
Gen Mirza, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, shared Pakistan’s perspective on the evolving regional security landscape and highlighted Pakistan’s contributions towards regional peace and stability, the ISPR added.
The visiting dignitary lauded the professionalism of Pakistan’s armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
Upon arrival at the Joint Staff Headquarters, a smartly turned out tri-services contingent presented a guard of honour to Lt Gen Mbambo.
 


Meeting with PAF chief
A day earlier, the SAAF chief called on Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, at Air Headquarters in Islamabad.
During the meeting, Chief of Air Staff Sidhu “emphasised the shared values and aspirations that form the foundation of the deep-rooted friendship between Pakistan and South Africa”.
He reiterated PAF’s commitment to bolster SAAF’s aerial combat capabilities through tailored training and capacity-building initiatives.
Lt Gen Mbambo lauded PAF’s robust operational readiness, its multi-domain warfare capabilities and its success in maintaining a credible deterrence posture.
The South African air chief articulated a strong desire to further strengthen and institutionalise the formal relationship between the SAAF and the PAF.
The discussions centred on revamping SAAF’s training regime. Lt Gen Mbambo sought the PAF’s support in developing a modern and comprehensive training framework, commencing at the academy level.
He also expressed his earnest desire for SAAF officers’ participation as observers in PAF’s major operational exercises.
Acknowledging the technical excellence and cost-effective maintenance capabilities offered by PAF’s engineering infrastructure, Lt Gen Mbambo also conveyed SAAF’s intent to undertake the inspection and maintenance of its C-130 fleet in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-03 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612214-pti-to-file-reference-against-four-mnas-who-joined-pml-n' target='_blank'><strong>PTI to file reference against four MNAs who joined PML-N: Qaiser</strong></a><br><p>

Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), which will be observed on Sunday.
“It is not enough how much we thank you for your role — the heads and ulema of all sects — in Muharram, as everyone has a role in this,” Naqvi said as he met with scholars from various schools of thought in Islamabad.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad, chairman of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, were also present during the meeting.
Naqvi highlighted that the efforts of law enforcement agencies during Muharram were as important as those of religious scholars, according to a post on X by the interior ministry.
 






The minister noted that the ulema remained in “constant communication” with the administration during Muharram and “solved minor disputes”.
He requested Maulana Azad, as well as other scholars, to collectively offer Zuhr prayers at Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque on August 14. “This will give a message to the whole world that we are all united, and there is no better day than the 14th of August.”
Chaudhry also credited religious scholars for dealing with terrorism, sectarianism, and maintaining peace during the month of Muharram.
On his part, Maulana Azad affirmed that they all were united for the country’s security.
For Muharram, Islamabad police have identified 13 points as potential trouble spots, banned the entry of 17 “firebrand” ulema and increased intelligence operations.
 
 

While the Punjab government has imposed certain restrictions under Section 144 across the province till Sunday, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration has limited it to sensitive districts. In Karachi, over 20,000 officers and personnel have been deployed till Ashura.
Speaking about the uptick in terrorism in KP, Naqvi called on the ulema to engage with religious scholars in the province, offering his cooperation in the matter.
“This terrorism will only end on the condition that the locals there do not help them,” he said.
 






The interior minister’s remarks come just a day after an assistant commissioner and four others were martyred, while policemen were among 17 others injured as an official vehicle was targeted in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area.
During the meeting, Naqvi also highlighted the role of the armed forces in the recent Iran-Israel ceasefire, saying Pakistan should be proud of “convincing world leaders” and of playing its role as a Muslim country.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif noted that Iran openly thanked the people of Pakistan, its political parties, military, and political leadership for their role in ensuring the ceasefire between the two countries.</p><small>2025-07-03 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0313561259e87d2.png?r=135821' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921844/liverpools-portuguese-forward-diogo-jota-dies-in-car-crash-in-spain-report' target='_blank'><strong>Liverpool’s Portuguese forward Diogo Jota dies in car crash in Spain: report</strong></a><br><p>Liverpool’s Portuguese forward Diogo Jota, 28, died in a fiery car crash near Zamora in northwestern Spain with his brother, Spanish state-owned TV station TVE said on Thursday, citing local firefighters.
Police told Reuters everything pointed to that information being correct, although they could not yet officially confirm the names.
The regional fire department of Castille-Leon, where Zamora is located, said on its website a car crashed shortly after midnight on Thursday and burst into flames, with two men, aged 28 and 26, found dead.

Liverpool Football Club said it was “devastated by the tragic passing of Jota.”
“The club have been informed the 28-year-old has passed away following a road traffic accident in Spain along with his brother, Andre,” it said on social media.
“Liverpool FC will be making no further comment at this time and request the privacy of Diogo and Andre’s family, friends, teammates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss.
“We will continue to provide them with our full support,” the club said.
Jota, who got married on June 28, helped Liverpool win the Premier League last season and also won the Football Association Challenge (FA) Cup and League Cup with the Merseyside outfit.
Jota arrived at Anfield from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020 and scored 65 goals in 182 appearances for the club in all competitions.
He also made 49 appearances for Portugal, twice winning the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Nations League.
Condolences pour in
Portugese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the news of the death of Jota, “an athlete who greatly honoured Portugal’s name, and his brother is unexpected and tragic.
“I extend my deepest condolences to their family. It is a sad day for football and for national and international sports.”
The Portugese Football Federation said the entire Portuguese football community is devastated by the deaths of Jota and Andre.
“Diogo Jota was not only a fantastic player with almost 50 caps for the national team, but also an extraordinary person who was respected by all his teammates and opponents. He had a contagious joy and was a reference point in his own community…
“We have lost two champions. Their deaths represent irreparable losses for Portuguese football, and we will do everything we can to honour their legacy every day.”
Former Liverpool player Jamie Carragher said: “Devastating news about Diogo Jota & his brother Andre this morning. Thoughts are with everyone of their family & friends, especially his wife Rute & their three lovely kids.”
 






Portugal and Al-Hilal Midfielder Ruben Neves said: “They say that we only lose people when we forget them. I will never forget you.”
FC Porto said, “FC Porto is in mourning. It is with shock and deep regret that we send our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva, who was also our athlete in the youth ranks.
“Rest in peace.”
Sporting CP said: “The world of football is poorer. Sporting CP expresses its sorrow at the death of Portuguese international Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva. Our deepest condolences go out to the whole family at this difficult time.”</p><small>2025-07-03 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612186-pm-shehbaz-departs-for-azerbaijan-to-attend-17th-eco-summit' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz departs for Azerbaijan to attend 17th ECO Summit</strong></a><br><p>

Dhaka is proposing to buy Boeing planes and boost imports of US wheat, cotton and oil in a bid to reduce the trade deficit, which Trump used as the reason for imposing painful levies in his “Liberation Day” announcement.
“We have finalised a draft reciprocal trade agreement,” Mahbubur Rahman said on Wednesday, adding the government was “hopeful of reaching a win-win agreement”.
Rahman said a meeting between officials from both countries was slated for July 8, with the US representing 20 per cent of Bangladesh’s ready-made garments exports.
Textile and garment production accounts for about 8pc of exports in Bangladesh and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard in a student-led revolution that toppled the government last year.
Trump hit Bangladesh with 37pc tariffs in his April 2 announcement, which is more than double the 16pc already placed on cotton products.
He suspended the tolls’ introduction until July 9, as he did with other global trading partners, though a baseline 10pc levy was kept in place.
Bangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the United States in 2024, while imports from there amounted to $2.21bn, according to the Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue.
“As part of the initiative to reduce the trade gap, the government already decided to import a large volume of wheat, purchasing 14 aircraft from US manufacturer Boeing, buying cotton and more oil and gas from the US farms,” Rahman said.
He did not give further details on the exact timing or extent of the proposed deals, but said the government had held around 28 meetings and document exchanges in a bid to reach an agreement.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus spoke to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday and told him Dhaka was “working with your officials to finalise a package of measures to effectively respond to President Trump’s trade agenda”.
 






Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the national platform of the garment makers, expressed concerns about any deal.
“The already enacted additional 10pc tariff is hitting our exporters, and if it goes further, we might lose US buyers,” he warned.
But Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), told AFP he was optimistic.
“We are hopeful of a positive outcome on the US tariff before July 9,” he said.
“There will be a temporary problem if the US administration does not revise the tariff. But it will largely and ultimately hit the US buyers, as they would have to buy goods at higher prices.”</p><small>2025-07-03 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0313313837a8bf1.png?r=133950' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921839/trump-tax-bill-stalled-by-republican-rebellion-in-congress' target='_blank'><strong>Trump tax bill stalled by Republican rebellion in Congress</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump’s signature tax and spending bill was in limbo early Thursday as Republican leaders in the US Congress scrambled to win over a group of rebels threatening to torpedo the centrepiece of the president’s domestic agenda.
Trump is seeking final approval in the House of Representatives for his Senate-passed “One Big Beautiful Bill” — but faces opposition on all sides of his fractious party over provisions set to balloon the national debt while launching a historic assault on the social safety net.
As midnight (9am PKT) struck, House Speaker Mike Johnson was still holding open a key procedural vote — the bill’s last hurdle before it can advance to be considered for final approval — more than two hours after it was first called.
With no clear sign of the stalemate breaking, his lieutenants huddled in tense meetings behind the scenes with the rebels who had either voted no or had yet to come to the House floor.
“We’re going to get there tonight. We’re working on it and very, very positive about our progress,” Johnson told reporters at the Capitol, according to Politico.
Originally approved by the House in May, Trump’s sprawling legislation squeezed through the Senate on Tuesday by a solitary vote but had to return to the lower chamber Wednesday for a rubber stamp of the Senate’s revisions.
The package honours many of Trump’s campaign promises, boosting military spending, funding a mass migrant deportation drive and committing $4.5 trillion to extend his first-term tax relief.
 
 

But it is expected to pile an extra $3.4tr over a decade onto the country’s fast-growing deficits, while forcing through the largest cuts to the Medicaid health insurance program since its 1960s launch.
While moderates in the House are anxious that the cuts will damage their prospects of re-election, fiscal hawks are chafing over savings that they say fall short of what they were promised by hundreds of billions of dollars.
Johnson has to negotiate incredibly tight margins, and can likely only lose three lawmakers among more than two dozen who have declared themselves open to rejecting Trump’s bill.
‘Abomination’
Republican leaders had been hoping to spend just a few hours on Wednesday afternoon green-lighting the package, although they had a cushion of two days before Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline.
The 887-page text only passed in the Senate after a flurry of tweaks that pulled the House-passed text further to the right.
Republicans lost one conservative who was angry about adding to the country’s $37tr debt burden and two moderates worried about almost $1tr in health care cuts.
Some estimates put the total number of recipients set to lose their health insurance at $17 million, while scores of rural hospitals are expected to close.
Legislation in the House has to go through multiple “test” votes before it can come up for final approval, and a majority must wave it through at each of these stages.
There were warning signs early in the day as the package stumbled at one of the first steps, with a straightforward vote that ought to have taken minutes remaining open for seven hours and 31 minutes — making it the longest House vote in history.
Johnson had made clear that he was banking on Trump leaning on waverers, as he has in the past to turn around contentious House votes that were headed for failure.
The president has spent weeks cajoling Republicans torn between angering welfare recipients at home and incurring his wrath.
Trump pressured House Republicans to get the bill over the line in a private White House meeting with several holdouts on Wednesday.
“What are the Republicans waiting for?” he posted on his Truth Social platform just after midnight.
“What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT’S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!”
 


House Democrats have signaled that they plan to campaign on the bill to flip the chamber in the 2026 midterm elections, pointing to analyses showing that it represents a historic redistribution of wealth from the poorest Americans to the richest.
“Shame on Senate Republicans for passing this disgusting abomination,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters.</p><small>2025-07-03 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0312480841b3ea9.png?r=124912' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921834/pakistan-dominates-squash-courts-as-5-players-storm-into-asian-junior-semis' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan dominates squash courts as 5 players storm into Asian junior semis</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan dominated the squash courts on Thursday as five players stormed into the semi-finals of the 32nd Asian Junior Individual Squash Championships in Gimcheon, South Korea.

Last year, half a million devotees took part in the Amarnath pilgrimage to a sacred ice pillar located in a cave in the forested Himalayan hills above the town of Pahalgam.
India has ramped up security for the event, deploying 45,000 troops with high-tech surveillance tools overseeing the gruelling trek to reach the high-altitude cave, dedicated to the Hindu deity of destruction Shiva.
“We have multi-layered and in-depth security arrangements so that we can make the pilgrimage safe and smooth for the devotees,” said VK Birdi, police chief for the Muslim-majority territory.
Pahalgam is the site where gunmen on April 22 killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation, triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict.
On May 7, Pakistan shot down six Indian jets after they bombed sites across the border, setting off an exchange of attacks between the two countries by fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery that killed dozens until a ceasefire on May 10.
It was the worst standoff by the nuclear-armed nations since 1999, with more than 70 people killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides.
But pilgrim Muneshwar Das Shashtri, who travelled from Uttar Pradesh state, told AFP that “there is no fear of any kind”.
“Our army is standing guard everywhere. No one can raise a finger towards us,” he said.

‘Not afraid’
At Pahalgam, soldiers have turned a tented base camp into a fortress encircled by razor wire.
Troops in newly deployed armoured cars, or from gun positions behind sandbags, keep a close watch — efforts boosted by facial recognition cameras.
“High-quality surveillance cameras have been installed at all major points along the route,” said Manoj Sinha, the Indian-appointed top administrator for occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
All pilgrims must be registered and travel in guarded vehicle convoys, until they start out to walk.
Camouflaged bunkers have been erected in the forests along the route, where dozens of makeshift kitchens provide free food.
Electronic radio cards pinpoint their location.
Pilgrims can take several days to reach the cave, perched at 3,900 metres high, around 30 kilometres uphill from the last easily motorable track.

“Whatever the attack that was carried out here, I am not afraid. I have come to get a glimpse of baba (the ice formation)” said Ujwal Yadav, aged 29, from India’s Uttar Pradesh state, undertaking his first pilgrimage to the shrine.
“Such are the security arrangements here that no one can be hurt.”
Sinha has said that “public confidence is returning”, but admits that pilgrim registration had dipped by 10 per cent this year.
Once a modest, little-known ritual, attended by only a few thousand mainly local devotees, the pilgrimage has grown since the Kashmiris’ uprising erupted in 1989.
India’s government has since heavily promoted the annual event, which runs until August 9.
Those fighting against India’s occupation of Kashmir have said the pilgrimage is not a target, but have warned they would act if it was used to assert Hindu dominance.
In 2017, suspected militants attacked a pilgrim bus, killing 11 people.
The gunmen who carried out the April 22 killings remain at large, despite the manhunt by security forces in IoK, where India has half a million soldiers permanently deployed.
On June 22, India’s National Investigation Agency claimed two men had been arrested from the Pahalgam area, who they said had allegedly “provided food, shelter and logistical support” to the gunmen.
Indian police have issued wanted notices for three of the gunmen, two of whom they claimed were Pakistani citizens.</p><small>2025-07-03 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612161-three-spells-of-rain-likely-in-karachi-this-month' target='_blank'><strong>Three spells of rain likely in Karachi this month</strong></a><br><p>

Rescuers were racing to find 30 people still missing at sea after the vessel carrying 65 passengers and crew sank before midnight on Wednesday as it sailed to the popular holiday destination from Indonesia’s main island Java.
“The ferry tilted and immediately sank,” survivor Eka Toniansyah told reporters at a Bali hospital.
“Most of the passengers were from Indonesia. I was with my father. My father is dead.”
Indonesia’s national search and rescue agency chief Mohammad Syafii told a news conference on Thursday that 31 survivors had been found.
“Four people died, so 30 people are still being searched for,” he said, adding the national agency sent a helicopter to help the effort.
President Prabowo Subianto, who was on a trip to Saudi Arabia, ordered an immediate emergency response, cabinet secretary Teddy Indra Wijaya said in a statement on Thursday, adding the cause of the accident was “bad weather”.
Java-based Surabaya search and rescue agency head Nanang Sigit, who had earlier put the total number of missing at 38, said efforts to reach the doomed vessel were initially hampered by adverse weather conditions.
 


Waves as high as 2.5 metres with “strong winds and strong currents” had affected the rescue operation, he said, adding conditions have since improved.
A rescue team of at least 54 personnel including from the navy and police were dispatched along with inflatable rescue boats, he said, while a bigger vessel was later sent from Surabaya city to assist the search efforts.
Following currents
Nanang said rescuers would follow currents and expand the search area if there were still unaccounted for people by the end of the day.
“For today’s search, we are still focusing on search above the water where initial victims were found,” the Surabaya search and rescue chief said.
The ferry’s manifest showed 53 passengers and 12 crew members, he said, but rescuers were still assessing if there were more people onboard than the manifest showed.
It is common in Indonesia for the actual number of passengers on a boat to differ from the manifest.

Frequent accidents
The ferry crossing from Ketapang port in Java’s Banyuwangi regency to Bali’s Gilimanuk port — one of the busiest in Indonesia — is around 5 kilometres as the crow flies and takes around one hour.
It is often used by people crossing between the islands by car.
Four of the known survivors saved themselves by using the ferry’s lifeboat and were found in the water early Thursday, the Surabaya rescue agency said.
It said the ferry was also transporting 22 vehicles, including 14 trucks. It was unclear if any foreigners were onboard when the ferry sank.
Marine accidents are a regular occurrence in Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago of around 17,000 islands, in part due to lax safety standards and sometimes due to bad weather.
In March, a boat carrying 16 people capsized in rough waters off Bali, killing an Australian woman and injuring at least one other person.
A ferry carrying more than 800 people ran aground in shallow waters off East Nusa Tenggara province in 2022 and remained stuck for two days before being dislodged with no one hurt.
And in 2018, more than 150 people drowned when a ferry sank in one of the world’s deepest lakes on Sumatra island.</p><small>2025-07-03 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/031028597f75ec6.jpg?r=102905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921711/probe-ordered-into-abduction-forced-conversion-of-hindu-girl-in-badin' target='_blank'><strong>Probe ordered into ‘abduction, forced conversion’ of Hindu girl in Badin</strong></a><br><p>HYDERABAD/ KARACHI: The Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has taken a notice of a case involving the alleged abduction, child marriage, and forced conversion of a 15-year-old Hindu girl in Matli in the Badin district.
According to reports circulating on social media, a ninth-grade student was allegedly abducted at gunpoint near Notkani Chowk in Matli. A complaint filed by her uncle, Majno Maharaj, at the Matli police station alleges that two armed men — Maqsood Dars and Manzoor Dars — forcibly entered the family’s home and abducted the girl, Shahneela, while two unidentified men waited outside in a white vehicle used for the abduction.
The victim’s family has expressed the fear that the girl is at imminent risk of being forcibly married to someone and converted — both of which are violations of the country’s law.
The suspect’s family has allegedly refused to return the girl despite the family’s appeals, it was stated.

SHRC urges law enforcers to ensure safety and recovery of 15-year-old

The SHRC has cited several legal provisions that criminalise the actions allegedly taken by the suspects.
It stated that Sections 365-B, 364-A, and 506 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) prohibit abduction, forced marriage, and threats. Article 20 of the Constitution of Pakistan guarantees religious freedom, rendering forced conversions unconstitutional.
The Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013 and its associated Rules (2016) empower law enforcers to intervene in such cases, it said.
 
 

Specifically, Rule 8 mandates the rescue and recovery of child victims while Rule 9 authorises search warrants for missing children, it added.
Rule 10 provides for the temporary custody of rescued minors. Section 49 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) allows police to act pre-emptively in cognizable offenses.
Expressing grave concern, the SHRC highlighted the increasing number of cases involving child marriages and forced conversions among Hindu minorities in Sindh.
The commission described these incidents as serious violations of child rights, minority protections, and constitutional guarantees.
Under its powers vested by Section 4 (i) (ii) of the Sindh Protection of Human Rights Act, 2011, the SHRC has directed the authorities concerned to conduct a thorough investigation and submit a report through a competent officer before the Commission by July 7, 2025, at 11am.

The police acted when the suspects blatantly violated the Section 144 imposed by the Punjab government to ensure peace in the city during Muharram.
As per CCD sources, TikToker Kashif Zamir, along with his armed bodyguards, traveled on a city road in a double-cabin vehicle. His team recorded video clips showing the weapons displayed by his guards and uploaded the same on social media.
The police say such conduct causes harassment to the public.
A CCD official says the police arrested the TikToker in a raid and recovered firearms from him and his guards, lodging cases against them.
He says the police also recovered videos of the TikToker showing him traveling on different city roads, along with his heavily-armed security guards. The CCD official says that Kashif Zameer is a habitual offender as he was also arrested in the past on the same charges.
Later, a video statement of the TikToker, recorded in police custody, appeared on social media wherein he apologised for taking law into his hands.

Now, women will be able to get promotions and higher posts after changing their domiciles, as the Supreme Court has ruled that new domiciles will be considered and such changes will not affect the provincial quota.
The judgement, a copy of which available with Dawn, was issued by a two-judge SC bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi.
The petition was filed by Dr Shumaila Naeem, a gold medallist, who joined government service as a medical officer based on her Khyber Pakhtunkhwa domicile. After marrying a civil servant with a Balochistan domicile, she changed her domicile to that of her husband.

SC allows domicile change without career risk for couples in govt service

Subsequently, based on her new Balochistan domicile, she applied for the advertised post of Associate Professor (Obstetrics and Gynaecology), BPS-19, at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad. She topped the written exam conducted by the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC), but was not called for an interview due to her domicile change, with the FPSC alleging that her original domicile was from KP.
Speaking to Dawn, Shumaila Naeem said her departmental representation and subsequent review petition were dismissed by the FPSC. “However, my appeal under Section 7(3)(d) of the FPSC Ordinance 1977 was allowed by the Islamabad High Court through a judgement dated January 28, 2025 by Chief Justice Aamer Farooq. But instead of implementing the IHC order, the FPSC filed an appeal in the Supreme Court,” she said.
“The apex court held that a married woman retains the legal discretion or choice to either adopt her husband’s domicile or retain her own,” she added.
The court ruled that the respondent had voluntarily opted to adopt her husband’s domicile, which is legally permissible. It rejected the FPSC’s stance and declared that the seat of Associate Professor is still vacant. The court directed that the candidate be considered for appointment to the post on the basis of her Balochistan domicile within a fortnight.
Dr Shumaila said that in the past, many female civil servants had no choice but to work in a province different from their husbands’.
“This decision, which has now become a precedent, will allow them to change their domiciles and serve at the same station as their husbands. It will bring peace of mind to them and their families,” she said.

• Tasks Kundi with engaging opposition MPAs to explore options for forming a new govt
• Aimal Wali warns against dissolving KP govt, advises PM to ‘let it collapse on its own’
ISLAMABAD: Amid reports of possible efforts afoot to bring a ‘regime change’ in Khyber Pakht­un­khwa (KP), Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday met two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation.
The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events had further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Awami National Party (ANP) President Aimal Wali Khan called on the PM, where they discussed the prevailing political scenario.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Ameer Maqam,  Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashar Iqbal, Prime Minister’s  Adviser Rana Sanaullah, Minister of State for Power Abdul Rehman Kanju  and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Talha Barki were also  present on the occasion.
A source close to Governor Kundi told Dawn that the issue of possible change of KP government was thoroughly discussed.
 
 

“Yes, we discussed the matter,” the source quoted Mr Kundi as saying. A press release issued by the governor’s spokesperson said the PM  tasked Mr Kundi to start a campaign for forming a new government in KP and hold consultation with opposition members of the provincial assembly.
Mr Kundi and federal minister Ameer Muqam have also been tasked to meet JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for further consultation.
But others offered different counsel. When contacted, ANP chief Aimal Wali Khan told Dawn that the issue was discussed during his meeting with the PM. However, he said he had advised the premier against dissolving the KP government through  ‘external means’.
“I told the PM that let the KP government die its own death. If you (PM) remove the provincial government, you will give an easy escape to the PTI-led regime, which has completely failed to deliver,” Mr Aimal said.
He said KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has no other way but to leave the government and if the Centre made any attempt to topple the PTI-led regime in KP, it would be a welcome move for the CM. “I told PM that Ali Amin Gandapur has taken maximum benefits after becoming CM and it will be a blessing for him if he is removed and sent home,” he added.
 
 

He further said the prime minister was ultimately convinced that forcefully removing the provincial government would be a mistake. “We are already suffering due to the trend of toppling governments and now how can we do it by ourselves,” he said.
Saudi peace efforts
PM Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday appreciated the efforts by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for peace in the Middle East as well as its significant role in the ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India.

The prime minister said this in a meeting with the ambassador of Saudi Arabia in Islamabad Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, while fondly recalling his warm and cordial telephone conversation with the Saudi Crown Prince on June 24.
The PM told the ambassador that as Pakistan had assumed the rotating Presidency of the UN Security Council for the month of July, and it would count on Saudi Arabia’s support to ensure that its tenure was conducted smoothly and successfully.
PM to visit Baku
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office announced the PM would attend the 17th summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) in Baku, Azerbaijan, starting on July 3.
In a statement, it said the PM will “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.
He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.

Rover finds a clue</strong></a><br><p>PARIS: Why is Mars barren and uninhabitable, while life has always thrived here on our relatively similar planet Earth? A discovery made by a Nasa rover has offered a clue for this mystery, new research said on Wednesday, suggesting that while rivers once sporadically flowed on Mars, it was doomed to mostly be a desert planet.
Mars is thought to currently have all the necessary ingredients for life except for perhaps the most important one: liquid water. However, the red surface is carved out by ancient rivers and lakes, showing that water once flowed on our nearest neighbour.
There are currently several rovers searching Mars for signs of life that could have existed back in those more habitable times, millions of years ago.
Earlier this year, Nasa’s Curiosity rover discovered a missing piece in this puzzle: rocks that are rich in carbonate minerals. These  “carbonates” — such as limestone on Earth — act as a sponge for carbon dioxide, pulling it in from the atmosphere and trapping it in rock.
A new study, published in the journal Nature, modelled exactly how the existence of these rocks could change our understanding of Mars’s past.
Brief ‘oases’
Lead study author Edwin Kite, a planetary scientist at the University of Chicago and a member of the Curiosity team, said it appeared there were  “blips of habitability in some times and places” on Mars. But these  “oases” were the exception rather than the rule.
On Earth, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere warms the planet. Over long timescales, the carbon becomes trapped in rocks such as carbonates. Then, volcanic eruptions spew the gas back into the atmosphere, creating a well-balanced climate cycle supportive of consistently running water.
However, Mars has a “feeble” rate of volcanic outgassing compared to Earth, Kite said. This throws off the balance, leaving Mars much colder and less hospitable.
According to the modelling research, the brief periods of liquid water on Mars were followed by 100 million years of barren desert — a long time for anything to survive.
It is still possible that there are pockets of liquid water deep underground on Mars we have not yet found, Kite said. Nasa’s Perseverance Rover, which landed on an ancient Martian delta in 2021, has also found signs of carbonates at the edge of dried-up lake, he added. Next, the scientists hope to discover more evidence of carbonates.
Kite said the best proof would be returning rock samples from the Martian surface back to Earth — both the United States and China are racing to do this in the next decade.
Are we alone?
Ultimately, scientists are searching for an answer to one of the great questions: how common are planets like Earth that can harbour life? Astronomers have discovered nearly 6,000 planets beyond our Solar System since the early 1990s. But only for Mars and Earth can scientists study rocks which allow them to understand the planet’s past, Kite said.
If we do determine that Mars never hosted even tiny micro-organisms during its watery times, that would indicate it is difficult to kick-start life across the universe.
But if we discover proof of ancient life, that would  “basically be telling us the origin of life is easy on a planetary scale,” Kite said.

In an advisory issued to the deputy commissioners across the province, the PDMA quoted the Pakistan Meteorological Department as revealing that moist currents are penetrating into most parts of the region and likely to intensify in the next couple of days.
“A westerly wave is also expected to approach on July 5 evening and night. Under the influence of the new weather system, showers along with thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds, with isolated and scattered heavy rainfalls, are expected in Haripur, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Buner, Malakand, Battagram, Shangla, Kohistan, Kolai-Pallas, Torghar, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank and North and South Waziristan from July 5 to 11 with occasional gaps,” it said.
The PDMA warned that heavy to very heavy rains could generate flash floods in nullahs and streams of Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Abbottabad, Buner, Bajaur, Battagram, Buner, Hangu, Torghar, Haripur, Karak, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Khyber, Kohat, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Peshawar, Shangla, Kurram, Lakki Marwat, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu and Tank during the forecast period.

Urges authorities to take measures to minimise damage

It also said that urban flooding was very likely to happen in low-lying areas of Mardan, Nowshera, Peshawar, Kohat and Dera Ismail Khan, while there’s a likelihood of riverine flooding in Chitral, Swat, Panjkora and Kabul rivers.
According to the PDMA, landslides may cause roads closure in the vulnerable hilly areas of Abbottabad, Battagram, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Khyber, Kohistan, Kolai-Pallas Kohistan, Kurram, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Shangla, Swat, Torghar and North Waziristan districts.
Also, heavy rainfall and windstorms and lightning could damage weak structures like mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels during the period.
The PDMA urged deputy commissioners of all districts to take all precautionary measures against downpours and floods to minimise damage to public life and property and livestock.
It also asked authorities to assess and plan deployment of additional resources and exercise control over traffic leading to and in the vicinity of vulnerable and tourist areas and securing by physical means and keeping people away from loose structures such as buildings under construction, advertisement hoardings, electric poles and solar panels to prevent damages and save lives.
In the advisory, the PDMA said authorities should keep monitoring rivers, streams, local and rainfed nullahs, ensure drainage systems are clear from obstacles to facilitate the efficient flow of water and minimise the risk of urban flooding, coordinate with relevant municipal administrations to ensure mitigation and preparedness measures for landslides and urban flooding, and secure or remove billboards and hoardings in view of wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms.
It urged farmers to take all necessary measures to prevent damage to their crops.
The PDMA said cattle and sheep herders should undertake necessary mitigating and precautionary measures to protect their livestock from wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms.
It said that people travelling on provincial and national highways in at-risk and affected areas should be forewarned of adverse conditions and detoured to safe waiting areas under guidance of authorities, national highway and motorway police, law-enforcement agencies.
The PDMA asked people to seek shelter in safe areas such as sturdy buildings or underground structures during wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms and avoid objects that posed a risk of failing or being struck by lightning.
It stressed the need for the availability of emergency services personnel and equipment in areas at high risk of urban and flash flooding and landslides, immediate stocking of basic commodities like medicines in regions that are likely to be cut off from other regions during landslides.

German alpinist David Göttler made his way down via paraglider, while the French duo of Tiphaine Duperier and Boris Langenstein etched themselves into the history books by skiing down the peak, nicknamed ‘The Killer Mountain’.
 
 

CEO of Adventure Tours Pakistan Naiknaam Karim told Dawn that the three foreign climbers began their summit attempt on Nanga Parbat, via the Schell route.
The trio climbed from the approximately 3,600-metre-high base camp to the summit between June 21 and 24.
Göttler, 47, had planned to descend from the top by paraglider.
However, upon reaching the summit, strong winds forced him to launch his paraglider from 7,700 metres instead. He successfully flew from that altitude and landed at base camp in 30 minutes, according to the organisers.
Michael Beek, a German tour operator, mountain guide, and paragliding instructor, congratulated Göttler in a Facebook post, writing that Göttler had made a historic first.
“Summiting Nanga Parbat in alpine style with Tiphaine Duperier and Boris Langenstein was incredible; but to be able to fly down from 7,700m all the way back to base camp on the same day has brought my joy to the next level,” he said.
Meanwhile, his French companions, Duperier and Langenstein, camped the night at 7,625m, and later skied and trekked down the massive Rupal Face, which rises 4,600 meters from base camp, arriving three days later.
Theirs is considered the first ski descent of the Rupal Face, and a first from the summit of Nanga Parbat.

A Pakistani delegation, headed by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, reached Washington this week, hoping to secure a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would avert the reimposition of a 29 per cent US tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products. The tariff relief was temporarily paused earlier this year, but a final decision hinges on the outcome of the ongoing talks.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that Washington may allow limited flexibility on the deadline if meaningful progress is visible, potentially pushing the cutoff toward Labour Day. However, Pakistani officials say they are working to complete the deal this week to remove any uncertainty for exporters and investors.
The proposed framework includes increased Pakistani imports of US goods — particularly crude oil — alongside incentives for American investment in Pakistan’s mining, infrastructure, and energy sectors. Key projects under discussion include the Reko Diq copper-gold mine and associated energy infrastructure. The agreement is also expected to pave the way for greater engagement through the US Export-Import Bank.
Pakistani negotiators are optimistic that a deal can be finalised this week, ensuring continued access to the US market.

Iqbal Market SHO Sher Mohammed told Dawn that the police arrested Abdul Ghaffar Khan for killing his son, Ali Khan, with a shovel in Raja Tanveer Colony, Sector 11 ½. 
The officer said the father told police that his son had developed a “friendship” with members of the transgender community and used to meet them frequently. He said he had repeatedly warned his son to stay away from the transpersons but he won’t listen. 
The father claimed that he initially gave electric shocks to him and later killed him with a shovel. The body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medico-legal formalities.
The suspect is known to be religiously inclined and showed no remorse over the killing, the SHO said, adding that the police were waiting for medical confirmation regarding the alleged electric shocks.

Presiding over the meeting, Senator Mohsin Aziz criticised the absence of Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari, who was expected to respond to queries, particularly regarding independent power producers (IPPs) and their controversial contracts, which he described as unjust to the public.
Senator Shibli Faraz accused the Power Division of failing to address the ballooning circular debt and shifting the cost of inefficiency onto consumers. He said project costs were often inflated to benefit IPPs and lamented the lack of transparency. “The Power Division consistently avoids disclosing facts,” he said, as quoted in a statement from the Senate Secretariat.
Senator Aziz said the division’s continued deflection of responsibility to a Task Force was unacceptable, especially since the Task Force itself operates under the Power Division and remains answerable to it.

Senate panel demands accountability over circular debt and inflated IPP returns

Secretary Power Division Dr Fakhr-e-Alam Irfan informed the committee that repayment of circular debt had been linked to the debt servicing surcharge and assured that no additional burden would be passed on to consumers. He added that subsidies were being curtailed to help control debt accumulation.
Senator Aziz questioned why IPPs were granted excessively high returns and why no effort had been made to recover excess payments. He also demanded an explanation for the continued load-shedding despite the availability of surplus power.
The Secretary replied that outages were being carried out in areas with high electricity theft. He said overall losses had declined and efficiency had improved, with efforts underway to deploy theft-detection technology at the transformer level.
Senator Ponjo Bheel raised concerns about prolonged outages in Tharparkar, Matiari, and Umerkot, where load-shedding reportedly lasted up to 14 hours a day. He said residents in these areas were paying their bills yet remained without power. He also alleged corruption by local officials who took bribes for illegal connections and disconnected meters only to restore supply in exchange for further payments.
Following deliberations, the committee expressed displeasure over the Power Division’s failure to address key questions and directed that detailed responses be submitted in the next meeting.
Senator Haji Hidayatullah highlighted a billing issue in Peshawar, where a property that had been previously declared clear of dues by Pesco was later billed Rs 2.3 million. He alleged that Pesco officials offered to “settle” the bill for Rs300,000 in return for clearing it.
The Power Division secretary assured the committee the matter would be investigated.
K-Electric officials informed the committee that of their 2,100 feeders, load-shedding did not occur on 70pc, while 30pc faced outages due to high theft rates. They also noted that consumer bills were being broken into instalments to ease payment burdens.
The committee chairman proposed reviewing the strict electricity slab system and suggested switching to an annual average-based billing structure. The Secretary added that 58pc of consumers fell under the “protected” category, paying Rs10 per unit. He also highlighted the launch of a scheme that allows consumers to submit meter readings via a mobile app, with 500,000 downloads and 250,000 registrations to date.

• Officials targeted en route from Nawagai to Khar after conducting anti-encroachment drive
BAJAUR: An assistant commissioner and a tehsildar were among five people martyred, while 17 others, including several police personnel, sustained injuries when a roadside bomb explosion struck an official vehicle in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area on Wednesday afternoon.
District Police Officer Waqas Rafique said it was an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion and said the bomb was planted on a motorcycle parked alongside the road.
Four people, including Nawagi subdivision assistant commissioner (AC) Faisal Ismail, Nawagi tehsildar Abdul Wakeel Khan, policeman Zahid Khan and a passerby, Fazal Manan, died at the scene, while 18 others were injured when the IED went off, District Police PRO Israr Khan told Dawn.
One of the wounded policemen, identified as ASI Noor Hake­em, passed away while being shifted to hospital in Peshawar.
Sources told Dawn that AC Ismail and his team were returning to the Civil Colony Khar after conducting an anti-encroachment drive in Nawagai bazaar, when their official vehicle was targeted.
Residents, police and rescue officials told Dawn that the incident occurred on the Bajaur-Pesh­awar highway in Sadiqabad market, about 5km from district headquarters Khar, around 1:45pm.
Rescue 1122 workers alongside locals from nearby areas rushed to the scene and began efforts to transport the injured to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar where emergency was already declared.
The DPO along with a team of senior police officials visited the spot and collected evidence to be used for investigation.
News of the blast spread quickly across the district, especially in Khar tehsil, prompting scores of people from all walks of life to rush to the Khar DHQ Hospital to donate blood for the injured.
According to the updated data shared by Rescue 1122 and the medical superintendent of the Khar DHQ hospital, four policemen identified as constable Ayaz Khan, constable Muhammad Zameen, constable Saidur Rehman and Fazal Haq were among 17 people wounded in the blast.
 
 

The reports stated that five injured individuals, including three policemen, were referred to various hospitals in Peshawar due to their critical condition, while the others remained under treatment at the DHQ hospital.
The bodies of all five victims were dispatched to their native areas after their combined official funeral prayers held at the police line late on Wednesday evening.
The body of assistant commissioner Faisal Ismail was sent to his native Wadigram area of Swat district.
Both the outlawed TTP and the IS-Khorasan militant group claimed responsibility for the attack on social media.
The incident also drew condemnation from President Asif Ali Zardari, PM Shehbaz Sharif, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur, and Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, among several others.

This development has firmly established the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) as the dominant force in the provincial legislature.
As a direct consequence of the ECP’s ruling, the total number of PML-N members in the Punjab Assembly has surged from 206 to 229. This increase is primarily attributed to a substantial rise in their representation on reserved seats for women, which climbed from 36 to 57. Similarly, the party’s presence on minority seats has also seen an uptick, increasing from five to seven.
 
 

Other political parties have also seen changes in their numerical strength. The Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) has gained one minority and one women’s reserved seat, boosting its total membership from 14 to 16.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q) now holds three women’s reserved seats, up from two, bringing their total members to 11. The Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) also saw an increase in its representation, gaining one women’s reserved seat, which raised its total members from six to seven.
Despite these changes, the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) strength in the Punjab Assembly remains at 76 members, while the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) continues to have 27 members. Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) and Majlis Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) each retain their single seats.
Overall, in the 371-member Punjab Assembly, 369 are currently present. One independent member, Mian Aslam Iqbal elected from PP-171 (Lahore-27) in the 2024 vote, is yet to take the oath, and a by-election for one seat is still pending.
The Election Commission’s recent decision has effectively reshaped the political dynamics within the Punjab Assembly, solidifying the PML-N’s numerical majority in the house.

Meanwhile, the National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority has also issued multiple impact-based weather alerts for various regions of Pakistan in light of forecasted severe weather conditions expected from July 2 till July 8.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, with water levels in major rivers and hill torrents expected to rise sharply, flash floods are likely in Dera Ghazi Khan and urban flooding is anticipated in major cities of the province, including Lahore.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia issued the alert and directed all deputy commissioners (DCs) and disaster response teams to remain alert.

NEOC issues alert for severe weather conditions till July 8 as monsoon system pairs with westerly wave

The Provincial Control Room is operating round-the-clock, and emergency services like Rescue 1122 have been put on high alert, he added.
Farmers have been advised to manage their activities accordingly, while tourists and travelers have been urged to avoid risky routes, especially in landslide-prone areas such as Murree and Galliyat.
 
 

The disaster authority has warned people against staying in weak structures, venturing near floodwaters, or ignoring weather advisories.
Lightning strikes and roof collapse pose additional risks, it warns, saying children are particularly vulnerable near accumulated rainwater or floodwater.
It also issued a weather alert warning of intensified monsoon rains across the province from July 5, forecasting heavy-to-very heavy rainfall in most districts until July 10.
The advisory highlights risks of flash floods, urban flooding and landslides, particularly in vulnerable areas like Murree, Galliyat, and DG Khan mountains.
According to the Met Office, strong monsoon currents, coupled with a westerly wave, will trigger widespread rains, windstorms and thunderstorms, with the heaviest downpours expected in Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and Sargodha.
It warns that the low-lying areas in major cities, including Lahore and Rawalpindi, may face urban flooding, while hill torrents in DG Khan and northeastern Punjab could overflow.
Severe weather conditions
Meanwhile, the NEOC said in a statement that these alerts highlight the growing risk of flash floods, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and urban flooding in different parts of the country.
 
 

Low to moderate rainfall was likely to continue until July 5, after which an active southwest monsoon system, coupled with a westerly wave, was expected to enter the country triggering moderate to heavy rainfall and localised thunderstorms.
The most affected regions include upper catchments of major rivers including central and lower Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Due to this forecast, increased river flows were expected across the country.
In particular, Kabul River Nowshera is likely to swell due to rising tributaries such as Swat, Panjkora, Bara, and Kalpani Nullah.
Inflows into Tarbela Dam may reach the low flood limit. Flash floods in riverine areas, especially where nullahs and local streams converge, may pose threats to nearby settlements.
Simultaneously, the risk of glacial lake outburst floods and landslides had increased in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where ongoing high temperatures had accelerated glacier and snow melt.
The situation was further worsened by incoming moist currents and rainfall. Vulnerable glacial valleys and narrow mountain passes may face sudden glacial lake outburst floods, flash floods, road blockages, and disruptions to infrastructure and tourism.
The National Disaster Management Authority has has urged the public to take precautionary measures.
It asked residents in at-risk areas to avoid unnecessary travel, secure important belongings, and prepare for potential evacuation.

• Firing, strikes by Israeli forces claim lives of 139 Palestinians in 24 hours
CAIRO: After US President Donald Trump announced that Israel had agreed to the “necessary conditions” to finalise a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, Hamas said on Wednesday it was studying the so-called “final ceasefire proposal”.
But while the group wants Israel to completely pull out of the enclave, Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu has set his sights on the elimination of Hamas.
A day earlier, Trump had said that after a “long and productive” meeting between his representatives and Israeli officials, Tel Aviv had agreed to the conditions needed to finalise a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza.
 
 

In its statement, Hamas said it was studying new ceasefire offers it received from the mediators Egypt and Qatar, but stressed it aimed to reach an agreement that would ensure an end to the war and an Israeli pullout from Gaza.
In a statement, Hamas said it was “conducting national consultations to discuss what we received from the proposals of the… mediators.”
It added that it sought “to reach an agreement that guarantees ending the aggression, achieving the withdrawal (of Israel from Gaza) and urgently aiding our people in the Gaza Strip”.
Qatar and Egypt have been mediating efforts to end the conflict.
A Palestinian source familiar with the negotiations said, “There are no fundamental changes in the new proposal” under discussion compared to previous terms presented by the United States.
The source said the new proposal “includes a 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release half of the (22) living” Israeli prisoners in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for Israel releasing a number of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
“There will not be a Hamas. There will not be a Hamastan. We’re not going back to that. It’s over,” Netanyahu claimed at a meeting hosted by the Trans-Israel pipeline.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said a majority within the coalition government would back an agreement that would see the release of the remaining Israeli prisoners held by Hamas in Gaza.
Of the 50 Israeli prisoners yet to be released, at least 20 are believed to be still alive.
Deaths in Gaza
Meanwhile, Gaza health authorities said Israeli gunfire and military strikes killed at least 139 Palestinians in separate attacks in north and southern areas over the past 24 hours.
 
 

Among those killed on Wednesday was Marwan Al-Sultan, director of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza, who perished in an airstrike that also claimed the lives of his wife and five children, medics say.
For Palestinians, who have fled multiple times and face daily struggles to find food 21 months into Israel’s military campaign, there was a glimmer of hope but many worried that any ceasefire would only be temporary.
“We want a complete end to the war on Gaza, not like every time — a partial agreement and ceasefire that lasts a month or two, then the war returns,” said Samir Al-Masri in Khan Yunis.
At the end of May, Hamas had said it was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, which Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff said was “totally unacceptable”.
That proposal had involved a 60-day ceasefire and the release of half the Israeli prisoners held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and the remains of other Palestinians; Hamas would release the remaining Israeli prisoners as part of a deal that guarantees the end of the war.
A source close to Hamas said that Hamas leaders were expected to debate the proposal and seek clarifications from mediators before giving an official response.
Meanwhile, the Hamas-run interior ministry has accused Yasser Abu Shabab, a Bedouin clan leader, of treason and ordered him to surrender and face trial.
Shabab, who does not recognise the authority of Hamas and accuses the group of hurting the interests of Gaza, had 10 days to surrender, the ministry said.
The Abu Shabab group described the Hamas order as a “sitcom that doesn’t frighten us, nor does it frighten any free man who loves his homeland and its dignity”, in a post on the Facebook page that usually carried the group’s announcements.
Israel also claimed to back some of Gaza’s clans against Hamas, but has not said which.

• Ruling coalition’s strength in NA jumps to 235, opposition shrinks to 98
• Four independents also added to govt tally
ISLAMABAD: The ruling coalition formally gained a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly on Wednesday after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) distributed the disputed reserved seats among the PML-N, PPP and JUI-F, in light of last week’s Supreme Court verdict.
The ECP issued victory notifications for 74 of 77 lawmakers, including 19 members of the National Assembly, 27 of the Punjab Assembly, 25 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly and three of the Sindh Assembly.
 
 

These reserved seats for women and non-Muslims were originally designated for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the electoral front of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
The ECP’s decision follows a landmark 7-3 majority decision by a 10-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, which last week overturned a previous 8-5 verdict delivered by a 13-member bench on July 12, 2024. The earlier judgement had ruled in favour of PTI’s eligibility for reserved seats.
The PML-N secured the most, bagging 43 out of the 74 seats across the national and provincial legislatures.
The PPP has benefited by the addition of 14 seats, while the JUI-F saw its tally rise by 13. One seat each has gone to the PML-Q, MQM-Pakistan, Awami National Party, PTI-Parliamentarians and the Iste­h­kam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP).
Among the 19 restored National Assembly seats, 13 were awarded to PML-N, four to PPP, and two to JUI-F.
Three National Assembly notifications were withheld — JUI-F’s Sadaf Khan, due to a Supreme Court order dated April 22, 2024; and PML-N’s Sobia Shahid and Shehla Bano, who have already taken oath as members of the KP Assembly.
Although the Supreme Court bench did not clarify how the reserved seats would be redistributed, the ECP had already allocated them among various parties following the Peshawar High Court’s decision.
However, a week after the apex court suspended the PHC verdict last year, the ECP had halted notifications for 77 lawmakers elected on these reserved seats across the National and provincial assemblies.
Updated party position
The National Assembly has now updated the party position. According to an official document issued by the NA Secretariat, the PML-N now leads with 123 members, the PPP has increased its strength to 74, the MQM-P holds 22 seats, PML-Q five, and IPP four. The Balochistan Awami Party, National Party, and PML-Z each retain one seat.
The total now stands at 231, but the document cites the ruling coalition’s strength as 235, also counting four independent lawmakers.
Sources told Dawn these include Chaudhry Usman Ali (NA-142 Sahiwal), Mubarak Zeb (NA-8 Bajaur), Aurangzeb Kitchi (NA-159 Vehari) and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146 Khanewal) — all of whom were PTI-backed independents who have since switched allegiances.
According to the document, the opposition’s strength in the 333-member house has shrunk to 98, comprising 80 SIC members, 10 from JUI-F, five PTI-backed independents, and one each from Balochistan National Party, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party.
In the Punjab Assembly, PML-N’s tally has risen to 229 from 206 with the addition of 23 seats (21 for women and two for non-Muslims). PPP now holds 16 seats compared to 14 previously, as it gained one seat each reserved for women and minorities. PML-Q and IPP have 11 and seven seats, respectively, after gaining one reserved seat each for women.
In the Sindh Assembly, PPP’s numbers rose to 120, with one additional seat each for women and non-Muslims. Its rival MQM-P now holds 38 seats after securing one more reserved seat for women.
In KP, JUI-F saw the biggest gain, adding 10 seats (eight for women, two for non-Muslims) to reach a total of 29.
PML-N added seven (six for women, one for minorities), reaching 26. PPP’s representation doubled to 12 with the addition of five reserved seats for women and one for non-Muslims. PTI-Parliamentarians and ANP each added one seat, bringing their totals to five each.
