ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: The Islamabad High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Ministry of Human Rights on a petition challenging the vires of the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act, 2026, and sought their response.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir of the IHC heard the petition filed by Advocate Abdul Wahab Farid against the recently enacted law.
During the hearing, counsel for the petitioner, Maham Fatima and Sardar Tariq Hussain, arg­ued that the impugned legislation was contrary to several constitutional provisions, including Articles 4, 8, 10-A, 35 and 227. They contended that the law infringes fundamental rights and is inconsistent with Islamic injunctions.

 

The counsel submitted that the procedure prescribed under the new law for registration and redressal of complaints violates the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10-A of the Constitution. They further argued that certain provisions confer excessive and arbitrary powers that could be misused and undermine due process.
After a preliminary hearing, Justice Tahir issued notices to the respondents and adjourned further proceedings until a date to be fixed by the office.
Man convicted
Meanwhile, a model criminal court (minor offences) in Lahore issued a judgement Wednesday in a domestic abuse case, convicting a man of assaulting his wife and mother-in-law.
Judicial Magistrate Hamidul Rahman Nasir conducted the trial, which involved testimony from several witnesses, including the victims and police investigators.
The incident took place on April 2, 2021. According to the FIR, the conflict began when the man allegedly pressured his wife to seek employment against her wishes. When she refused, he and several of his family members reportedly began beating her.
Following a telephone call from the wife, her mother and brother arrived at the scene.
The prosecution argued that during the ensuing confrontation, the man assaulted his mother-in-law, tearing her clothes and beating her until she lost consciousness. Neighbours eventually intervened to rescue the victims.
The FIR stated that after only two months of marriage, the husband began subjecting his wife to routine physical abuse. As a result, she stayed at her parents’ house for about eight months and received medical treatment at their expense.
The defence contended that the FIR was fabricated and pointed to the absence of official medico-legal certificates.
However, the prosecution explained that hospital protocols during the Covid-19 pandemic and police negligence contributed to the lack of formal documentation.
The magistrate found the man guilty under Section 354 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which addresses assault or use of criminal force against a woman with intent to outrage her modesty.
In the judgement announced on Tuesday, the magistrate sentenced the husband to three months’ rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs1,500 for assaulting his wife. He was also awarded another three months’ rigorous imprisonment for assaulting his mother-in-law, along with a fine of Rs1,500.

France and Germany have called for Francesca Albanese to step down over remarks in which she referred to a “common enemy of humanity” after criticising “most of the world” and the media for enabling Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza.
Critics and Israel have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a “common enemy”, while Albanese has denounced this as a “manipulation” and “completely false”.
In response to a question about the comments, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Feb 11 told parliament she should step down.
In an open letter, the former diplomats criticised what they called “the use of inaccurate and manipulated elements to discredit a holder of an independent UN mandate”.
They called on Barrot to “retract his inaccurate statements about Ms Albanese and correct them.”
“This controversy must not divert attention from the massacres of civilians, nor from the humanitarian crisis and the massive human rights violations taking place in Gaza,” said the signatories.
The letter, written in French, was signed by mostly former foreign ministers and diplomats from the Netherlands.
More than a dozen current members of parliament and senators from Europe were also among the signatories, along with a former foreign minister of South Africa.
Columbia University activist
A US immigration judge has blocked the deportation of a Palestinian graduate student who helped organize protests at Columbia University against Israel’s war in Gaza, according to US media reports.
Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested by immigration agents last year as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen. Mahdawi had been involved in a wave of demonstrations that gripped several major US university campuses.

I have been on the roads for 14 years… I have grown old, and people have to hold my hand while disembarking from a vehicle. But I protest here so that I get justice.”
These are the words of the late Bibi Houri, immortalised in a brief clip that has been circulating on social media since her demise.
Since 2012, when her son went missing in Balochistan, Bibi Houri had been a regular fixture at demonstrations staged by relatives of missing persons. Despite her advanc­­ed years, she would sit from dawn to dusk at the protest camps, pining for her son Gul Mohammad Marri and hoping for his safe recovery.
The widow, in her 70s, who broke with societal norms by coming out of her home and seeking justice — on the roads, in court, and at police stations — breathed her last on Tuesday.

Septuagenarian had been campaigning for her missing son’s recovery since 2012

“She used to come to the missing persons’ camp along with her missing son’s daughter — even on Eid,” recalled Nasrullah Baloch, chairman of Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP).
Bibi Houri — also known af­­fectionately as ‘Amma Hou­­ri’ — hailed from Kohlu, a district dominated by the Marri tribe in eastern Balochistan.
After the end of the fourth Baloch insurgency, which was fought predominantly by Marri Baloch tribesmen, her family went to Afghanistan along with the other Marri tribesmen.
Upon their return, they settled in New Kahan, on the outskirts of Quetta, near the Hazarganji area.
“After his cousin, Dr Moh­a­mmad Akbar Marri, went mis­­sing in 2010, Gul Moham­mad started struggling for his safe release because (Dr Marri’s) children were too young to come out,” recalls Nasrullah Baloch.
“Instead, he himself beca­­me a missing person within two years.”
An activist who used to participate in demonstrations alongside the septuagenarian told Dawn that Bibi Houri came into the media limelight in 2023, when several Baloch families staged a long march to Islamabad.
At the time, the families of the missing — comprising mo­­stly women and children — were dealt with unsympathetically, being subjected to baton-charges and water cannons after they reached the capital.
Besides Islamabad, the eld­erly Bibi Houri attended public meetings and protests in Mastung, Quetta, and Dalba­ndin, among other places. She would stand among the cro­wd, holding her son’s photo while calling for the recovery of all missing persons.
“There are many women like Bibi Houri who search for their sons, brothers or husbands & sometimes die without ever knowing whether they are alive or dead,” journalist Munizae Jahangir wrote on X.







“Houri worried for her son Marri’s children who are growing up without a father, she said she was old but she braved the rain & the unforgiving sun for them,” she wrote in her epitaph.
Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari also lamented on X that there was no one to pursue Bibi Houri’s legal case following the imprisonment of her daughter, Imaan Mazari-Hazir, who had been handling it.

The “Asia and the Pacific SDG Progress Report 2026”, published on Wed­nesday by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), also reveals a picture of deeply imbalanced development in the region.
Gains in health and well-being, and poverty reduction over the past decades, are being overshadowed by severe environmental dec­line and widening inequalities. Evidence shows setbacks in ensuring equal access to education and com­pliance with labour rights.
Insufficient data on gender equality and on peace, justice and strong institutions are obscuring policymakers’ understanding of how effe­ctively the most vulnerable are being reached. In critical areas such as climate action, marine conservation and biodiversity, the situation is rapidly deteriorating.
For cities and communities, persistent regression, including damage to critical infrastructure, underscores a dangerous gap between planning and resilience on the ground.
“The very engines of gro­wth that once lifted millions out of poverty and fuelled rapid industrialisation are now undermining our future,” said UN Under-Secretary-General Armida Salsiah Alisja­hbana, who is also the ESCAP executive secretary. “Our collective challe­nge is also our ­greatest opportunity: to build a region that is not only wea­lthier but smarter and healthier,” she added.

The Israeli authorities also imposed age restrictions on West Bank Palestinians, permitting entry only to men aged 55 and older, women aged 50 and older, and children up to age 12 to attend the Friday prayers.

 

“Ten thousand Palestinian worshippers will be permitted to enter the Temple Mount for Friday prayers throughout the month of Ramadan, subject to obtaining a dedicated daily permit in advance,” COGAT, the Israeli agency in charge of civilian matters in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement.
“Entry for men will be permitted from age 55, for women from age 50, and for children up to age 12 when accompanied by a first-degree relative.” COGAT said, adding that restrictions apply only to Palestinians travelling from the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

Imam of Al Aqsa arrested by Israeli police; Hamas condemns arrest, restrictions on worshippers’ access to holy mosque

“It is emphasised that all permits are conditional upon prior security approval by the relevant security authorities,” COGAT said.
“In addition, residents travelling to prayers at the Temple Mount will be required to undergo digital documentation at the crossings upon their return to the areas of Judea and Samaria at the conclusion of the prayer day,” it said, using the Biblical term for the West Bank.
During Ramazan, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Al Aqsa, Islam’s third holiest site, located in east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed in a move that is not internationally recognised.
Since the war in Gaza broke out in October 2023, the attendance of worshippers has declined due to tough Israeli restrictions.
Israel arrests Al Aqsa Mosque Imam
Israeli police on Monday arrested the Imam of Al Aqsa Mosque, Sheikh Moh­am­med al-Abbasi, from inside the mosque’s courtyards in occupied Jerusalem.
The Palestinian news agency WAFA, citing local sources, reported that Israeli forces detained Sheikh al-Abbasi inside the courtyards of Al Aqsa Mosque without giving any reason.
It said the arrest “comes amid escalating Israeli measures against the blessed Al Aqsa Mosque, including restrictions on imams, preachers and worshippers stationed there, limitations on the entry of worshippers, and intensifying incursions carried out by settlers under heavy protection from Israeli police”.
On Tuesday, Hamas condemned the arrest of al-Abbasi in a statement, saying he had been “served with an order banning him from the mosque”.
The movement said the measure “constitutes blatant interference in the affairs of Al Aqsa and an unacceptable assault on its imams”.

Ukraine has faced repeated pressure from US President Donald Tru­mp to agree to a deal that could mean painful concessions, as Russ­ian forces pound its power grid and slowly advance on the battlefield.
As the delegations met for a second day at a hotel in the Swiss city, under the mediation of US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Zelensky had called the first day “difficult”. “We can state that Russia is trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage,” he wrote on X.







No date for talks to resume
Moments after his statement, the delegations broke off the talks and said they would meet again in the future, without providing a date. Russia’s chief negotiator, former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, described the talks as “difficult, but business-like”.
Medinsky — whom Ukrainian officials have accused of engaging in history lectures rather than substantive talks — spoke with the Ukrainians for nearly two hours after formal talks ended, according to a representative of Kyiv’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov.
A spokesperson for Zelensky said the formal part of the talks had addressed territory in Ukraine’s east and the fate of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, both sticking points since the beginning of the process.
Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the roughly 20pc of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian forces have been unable to conquer — something Kyiv has repeatedly rejected. Kyiv, meanwhile, wants Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to be operated by the US and Ukraine, which Russia has said is unacceptable.
Pressure from Trump
Tuesday is the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, which has killed hundreds of thousands, driven millions from their homes, and ravaged Ukrainian cities, towns and villages. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians.
Trump has twice suggested in recent days that it is up to Kyiv to make sure a deal is agreed quickly. He had told reporters on Monday: “Ukraine better come to the table fast. That’s all I’m telling you.” In an interview with the US news outlet Axios, Zelensky was quoted as saying that it was “not fair” that Tr­u­mp kept publicly demanding con­­c­essions from Ukraine, not Russia.
Zelensky also said any plan requiring Ukraine to give up territory that Russia had not captured in the east would be rejected if put to a referendum. “I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky was quoted as saying.
The Geneva meeting follows two rounds of US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi that made no breakthrough. Both Zelensky and Umerov have made a point of repeatedly thanking the US for its mediation in recent weeks.
Zelensky has expressed concern that US Congressional mid-term elections in November could draw Washington’s attention away from efforts to end Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two.
Kyiv is also seeking strong US-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks in the event of a peace deal. US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll and Brigadier General Michael Adamski took part in three-way military negotiations on Wednesday, according to a US official.

Addressing a crowded press conference at the Central Press Club, leaders of the opposition alliance — comprising the PML-N, the PTI and its dissidents — alleged that the government was evading constitutional accountability within the assembly.
PML-N regional president and Leader of the Opposition Shah Ghulam Qadir said a requisitioned session of the House, convened by the opposition, was abruptly adjourned despite quorum and agenda items.
“We ensured quorum. With business on the agenda, the sudden adjournment was incomprehensible,” he said, adding that at one stage only one minister was present to respond to questions.

Vows to resist ‘any attempt’ to derail polls

The session was prorogued before calling attention notices and resolutions could be taken up, prompting the opposition to pass what he described as an unprecedented resolution of condemnation against the government.
Mr Qadir claimed the PPP no longer commanded a majority in the House and accused it of making hasty appointments and distributing discretionary posts arbitrarily. Political advisers, he alleged, were being posted in the Kashmir Liberation Cell instead of subject experts.
Warning the government against what he termed complacency, he said: “If the PPP does not mend its ways, it will not take long to move a no-confidence motion. If they are under any illusion, they should disabuse themselves of it.”
However, he added that with elections approaching, the opposition did not wish to destabilise the system and would act within constitutional bounds. “The government will act, and we will react,” he said, making it clear that the opposition would not allow the assembly’s term to be extended “even by a single day”.
Referring to the Supreme Court’s restoration of the Third Party Act, he alleged that appointments were still being made without due process, including tests and interviews.
Former prime minister Raja Farooq Haider ter­med the present arrangement a deviation from what was initially agreed as a temporary set-up. He alleged that budgetary changes were being made without assembly appr­oval and warned that the prime minister was “walking a tightrope”.

The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) demanded a higher fuel cost on account of power consumed in January, even though almost 60 per cent of the power was generated from domestic, cheaper sources. Electricity consumption was reported to be around 12pc higher than the same month last year and 8pc higher than December 2025.
Once approved, the power companies would charge an additional amount of about Rs16bn to consumers of all the power companies, including ex-Wapda Distribution Companies (Discos) and K-Electric, in the billing month of March. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has called a public hearing on February 26 to examine the request for fuel cost adjustment (FCA).
The CPPA, which filed the petition for a higher FCA for January consumption, said the power consumption was around 12.1pc higher than the same month of the previous year and about 8pc higher than the previous month, December 2025. The power companies have claimed an average fuel cost of Rs12.18 per unit for January 2026, compared to Rs11.03 per unit of the same month of the previous year and almost Rs2.56 per unit higher than Rs9.62 per unit in December 2025.

CPPA demands higher fuel charges citing 12pc increase in demand

The CPPA reported that 8,762 billion units (gigawatt hours) of electricity were delivered to Discos in January.
The power companies have claimed that the average fuel cost amounted to Rs12.18 per unit in January, against a pre-approved reference fuel cost of Rs10.395 per unit. There is a need for an additional FCA of about Rs1.78 per unit.
The CPPA said about 9,140GWh of electricity was generated in January at an estimated fuel expenditure of Rs106.4bn (Rs11.64 per unit), of which 8,762GWh of energy was delivered to Discos for Rs106.7bn (Rs12.18 per unit), leading to a higher fuel cost over what was already charged to consumers in December bills. Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas (RLNG)- based power generation accounted for the largest share of the grid’s fuel, with almost 22pc.
This was followed by nuclear power with its 17.5pc share. Traditional hydropower generation dipped to just 8pc in the wake of the annual canal closure for maintenance. Third position was secured by imported coal, with a 17.28pc share, followed by local coal with a 15.4pc share.
The share of local gas-based generation stood at 12pc in January, up from 11pc in December. Furnace oil-based generation revived to 3pc, although the fuel has been officially phased out.
Furnace oil-based generation was the most expensive at Rs33.55 per unit, followed by Rs20 per unit from RLNG, Rs13.5 per unit from imported coal, Rs12.74 per unit from local gas, and Rs11.63 per unit from local coal. There was no power generation from high-speed diesel.
The nuclear fuel cost amounted to Rs2.23 per unit in January. The three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — together contributed a 4.55pc share to the grid. Wind and solar have no fuel costs, while bagasse-based plants had a fuel cost of Rs10.39 per unit, with just 1.11pc contribution to the grid. Electricity imports from Iran accounted for 0.38pc of the total, with a fuel cost of Rs22.06 per unit.

Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, a three-judge bench that had taken up a number of cases moved by the PTI founder.
National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Barrister Ali Zafar and others were present inside Courtroom No. 2.
During the hearing, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar wondered why the petitioner had not challenged the ECP notification, which had disqualified him. Justice Kakar observed that it would be better to summon the ECP to explain the disqualification.

Apex court adjourns proceedings in cipher, defamation cases against PTI chief

Sardar Latif Khosa argued that in the concealment of assets case, the sentence awarded to the petitioner was suspended, but not the judgement. Justice Kakar reminded the counsel that he had only requested the Islamabad High Court to suspend the sentence and the high court had granted him the relief.
Mr Khosa contended that he wanted to cite 2019 Nasir Mehmood case in which the SC had held that suspension of sentence would have the same consequence as the suspension of the judgement.
Prosecutor General Islamabad Sarwar Nahang, however, said that the suspension of the sentence and suspension of the conviction were two different things.
Despite reluctance by Mr Khosa, the court asked the counsel to read the particular paragraph from the 2019 judgement, wherein it was held by the SC that unless the conviction was specifically suspended or the appeal was ultimately allowed and conviction as well as sentence were set aside, the conviction of the appellant would continue to hold the field and the disqualification would remain intact.
Justice Kakar observed that the counsel, by invoking a citation against his case, had blocked the way the court was considering to provide relief. “It seems your eyesight has become weak,” Justice Kakar quipped. He added that another way was to listen to the ECP’s point of view to know why the petitioner was disqualified.
The SC then postponed the proceedings for an indefinite period.
The same bench adjourned further proceedings in the cipher case against PTI’s Shah Mehmood Qur­e­shi when Special Prosecutor Zulf­ikar Naqvi sought time to furnish a detailed judgement in the case.
Moreover, referring to a set of appeals against the interim orders in the defamation case, which was mov­ed by PM Shehbaz Sharif aga­i­nst Mr Khan, the court adjourned the proceedings until after Ramazan.

WASHINGTON: Pakistan joined the international community in asking Israel to immediately halt the expansion of its unlawful presence in the occupied West Bank, hours before Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Washington to attend a US-sponsored international summit on Gaza today (Thursday).
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar made the call while delivering Pakistan’s national statement at a high-level United Nations Security Council (UNSC) briefing on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question.
Pakistan told the UNSC there can be “no durable peace without justice” in the region, reaffirming unwavering support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and announcing its participation in a new diplomatic initiative aimed at advancing a two-state solution.
“There can be no durable peace without justice, no stability without accountability, and no sustainable solution without the realization of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” the deputy premier said in his address.
Just a day earlier, the Palestinian mission to the United Nations issued a joint statement by 85 nations, calling for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the occupied West Bank.
Also, the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Arab League and the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc condemned Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank. The foreign ministers reiterated their categorical rejection of all unilateral measures aimed at altering the legal, demographic, and historical status of the occupied Palestinian territory.
Ready to back peace initiatives
Highlighting Pakistan’s participation in the inaugural meeting of US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” (BoP) in Washington on Feb 19, Deputy PM Dar said Pakistan was doing so with the objective of reinforcing ongoing diplomatic efforts for the resolution of the Palestinian issue.
“We engage in this process with the firm conviction that sustained diplomacy, anch­or­ed in international law and the UN Charter and guided by accountability, provides the only viable pathway to a just and lasting peace,” he said.
Reaffirming Islamabad’s political and moral position, the deputy prime minister said: “Pakistan’s solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters and their just cause remains unwavering. We stand with them in their legitimate pursuit of right to self-determination, dignity and freedom.”
He underscored Pakistan’s readiness to support multiple peace initiatives, noting: “Pakistan is ready and willing to contribute to all diplomatic initiatives, including President Trump’s Peace Plan, the BoP, the High-Level Conference on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Global Alliance for the Two-State Solution, which must reinforce one another through coordinated and concrete implementation, in the interest of our shared objective of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.”
Outcome of BoP meeting
Meanwhile, international observers say it remains unclear whether the BoP’s first meeting will “deliver reconstruction, legitimacy or simply controversy”.
US President Donald Trump will host the Board of Peace meeting in Washington today (Thursday), where he is expected to announce that member states have pledged more than $5 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in Gaza, the White House said, adding that more than 20 countries will attend board of peace meeting.
The Italian Institute for International Political Studies (ISPI), an independent non-profit think tank established in Milan in 1934, noted that member states are expected to announce a collective $5bn commitment for Gaza’s reconstruction, against overall requirements of about $70bn, according to UN estimates.
ISPI said the BOP also plans to deploy thousands of personnel for international stabilisation and policing forces in Gaza and that the meeting is expected to clarify which countries will participate.
According to the think tank, key regional states — Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Turkiye, Bahrain, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait — have confirmed their participation, along with Israel, which is sending its foreign minister to the summit-level meeting.
Indonesia has become the first country to signal readiness to contribute to the force, pledging to deploy 8,000 troops by June.

Speaking at a joint press conference following a seminar on ‘Rest­oring Peace in Balochistan and Confidence-Building, the Institutional Respo­nsibilities of Ulema and Mashaykh’, the scholars — including Maulana Dr Ata ur Rehman, Allama Muh­ammad Juma Asadi, Mau­lana Anwar-ul-Haq Haq­qani, and Qari Abdul Reh­man Noorzai — emphasised that lasting solutions lie in justice, mediation, and reconciliation rather than the use of force. 
The clerics urged the government to conduct transparent investigations into all missing persons’ cases. They said that anyone found guilty should be tried in open courts, while innocent individuals must be released immediately. 
Warning that the province now stands at a crossroads, the scholars noted one path leads toward com­­plete separation and the other toward a constituti­o­nal struggle for basic righ­­ts. They traced the current cycle of violence, the consequences of which are still being felt today, to the 2006 killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti, a former federal minister, Balochistan chief minister and governor. 
The scholars warned that hostile elements exp­loit local grievances and demanded that citizens be treated as partners of the state rather than suspects. 
To reduce frustration and anxiety among the youth, they demanded that locals be given jobs and a meaningful stake in Gwadar, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and mining projects.  
They also called for a major portion of revenue generated from provincial resources to be allocated to local development. 
The clerics blamed foreign interference for worsening the situation, alleging that external forces sought to create divisions, hatred and mistrust to prevent unity among Muslim countries and destabilise Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. 
Noting that the Quran declares peacemaking between disputing parties a religious duty, the scholars said the seminar proposed several specific measures to restore stability.  
These include holding transparent elections in the province; granting locals their rightful share in natural resources; expanding education, specifically technical and vocational training and employment opportunities; regulating border trade routes and eliminating drug and trawler mafias; empowering the Human Rights Commission; establishing a reconciliation council comprising ulema and respected community figures. 
They further called for improved intelligence systems with community participation and introduced the idea of special quotas for Balochistan in public and private sectors. 
The scholars reaffirmed that Balochistan’s leading ulema and mashaykh stand ready to shoulder any responsibility assigned to them for restoring peace and stability in the province.

The authority is offering 597 megahertz (MHz) in several bands in the upcoming auction and three existing telecom operators have been mandated to obtain a minimum of 100 MHz in the auction process.
“With the prescribed rate, even if 300 MHz is obtained by the telecommunication operators without any competitive bidding, the government will get $300 million,” PTA Director General Licensing retired brigadier Aamir Shahzad told a media briefing.
“And if all the 597 MHz is sold at auction at a slightly competitive rate, $700 million will be available for the government, but this scenario is less likely to happen,” he added.
Shahzad said that the auction would be conducted using a multi-round electronic clock auction format, with the main allocation stage starting on March 10. He said the 2600 MHz and 3500 MHz bands would be offered during the first round.
He added that after the auction process, the rollout of 5G services would take between three and six months as certain infrastructure was needed for the fresh spectrum.
Meanwhile, PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman said that the auction would lead to improved quality of service and data speed.
“Around 50 million new users have been added in the system during the last five years, but only 10MHz was increased in the 2021 spectrum auction,” the PTA chairman said.
“Improved data service and enhanced coverage will also increase average revenue per user (ARPU) for telecommunication operators,” he said.
The ARPU is a key performance indicator that measures the average revenue generated by a company from each consumer within a specific timeframe, monthly or annually.
“We started with $0.7 and now the ARPU has reached $1.3. Therefore, it is likely to increase as more data is consumed by the subscribers,” Rehman said.
“The authority expects mobile broadband speeds to improve by around 25 per cent following the auction,” he said.
He said that the government had offered many incentives to telecom companies in the new spectrum auction, but obligations to improve the quality of service as well as coverage area had been increased.
“This will help the country to embrace further upgradations like 6G and not like 5G, where we have been delayed,” the PTA Chairman said.
He added the government had also eliminated the right-of-way fee that used to be around Rs36,000 per kilometre annually; this, he said, would encourage fiberisation projects.
The chairman also said that telecom operators had already placed orders for 5G equipment, while local manufacturing of 5G-enabled smartphones had commenced, with 500,000 to 600,000 units produced so far.
He said the other measures being taken to facilitate the faster rollout of services after the auction were options for spectrum sharing, relaxation of certain regulatory terms and incentives for network expansion.
“Operators have been given one year to make the necessary capital investments without upfront spectrum payments, allowing them to focus on improving service quality,” Rehman added.

 

However, the operators will have to expand 5G coverage to additional cities apart from Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta, while fiber-to-the-site ratios will increase from 20 per cent to 35pc by 2035.
Besides, the minimum download speeds for 4G service have been increased from four megabytes per second (Mbps) to 20Mbps in 2026–27 and to 50Mbps by 2030–35.
For 5G, minimum download speeds will rise from 50Mbps initially to 100Mbps by 2030–35, with latency targets reduced to 35 milliseconds. Upload speeds are benchmarked at 20pc of download speeds across both technologies.</p><small>2026-02-18 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/182309476ecb600.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974194/ahead-of-inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-asif-says-recognition-of-israel-not-on-the-cards-at-all' target='_blank'><strong>Ahead of inaugural Board of Peace meeting, Asif says recognition of Israel ‘not on the cards at all’</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday that recognition of Israel by Pakistan was “not on the cards at all” as he highlighted the country’s support for the Palestinian cause.
The minister made the remarks in an interview with France 24. The comments come as the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, led by US President Donald Trump, will be held in Washington on February 19. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar will be attending the meeting.



In the interview, Asif was asked about Pakistan’s decision to join the Board of Peace and if the country would contribute troops for a military force in Gaza.
“I don’t see any problem in that. It all depends on what sort of terms of reference are drafted for that peace force,” he said, highlighting that Pakistan was a part of UN peacekeeping missions.
“So we have that experience. Palestine is a cause that is very close to our hearts. We have been demonstrating solidarity with them for many, many, many decades,” he said.
He said that Pakistan had supported the cause of Palestine on countless international forums.
“So this is something worth attempting. This is a good opportunity. Let’s hope it brings us closer to the two-state solution in the Middle East,” he said.
The interviewer then pointed out that many Muslim countries had normalised ties with Israel and asked whether this was on the table for Pakistan.
“No, not yet. You know, I do not see this option even being considered by Pakistan. Maybe, in the future, when there is a total paradigm shift and two states are established and Palestinians have the right of self-determination, their own homeland,” he said.
“At the moment, it is not on the cards at all,” he said.
‘India waging proxy war’
The minister was then asked about the security situation in the country, including the attack at an imambargah in Islamabad.
In response, Asif said that there were almost “all franchises of terrorism” in neighbouring Afghanistan, which he attributed to the “non-seriousness” of the Afghan Taliban government. He said that the Afghan Taliban was providing terrorists safe haven on their soil.
“Nothing can happen from across the border from Afghanistan … any attack in Pakistan, it has the blessings of the Afghan government,” he said.
Asked about Pakistan’s strikes in Afghanistan, the minister said, “We always have that option and we can exercise that option. We won’t hesitate.”
He further said that if terrorist outfits were operating from Afghan soil, the responsibility lay with Kabul’s rulers.
Asked about India, the minister highlighted the military conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025.
“Our air force practically decimated whatever attempt they were making to invade Pakistan. So now they are waging a proxy war against Pakistan,” he said.
“Delhi and Kabul and all these terrorist outfits are on the same page,” he said.
He said that friendly countries had attempted to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul but “these attempts did not produce any results”.
He said that the Afghan Taliban had accepted that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was operating from their territory.
“They indirectly said that they had no control over them. We told them that allow us to deal with them … they accepted their responsibility verbally, but whatever we agreed upon … they are not ready to give it in writing,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-18 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18214221ba4c16d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974189/no-basant-celebrations-before-february-2027-says-punjab-information-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No Basant celebrations before February 2027, says Punjab information minister</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari on Wednesday said that the Basant festival, which was revived by the provincial government earlier this month in Lahore after an 18-year hiatus, would now be celebrated in February 2027.
“I want to state categorically … that Basant will be celebrated in February 2027. No suggestion for celebrating it before that is under consideration,” she said in a video message posted by the Punjab government’s official account on X.







She also noted that people in a couple of cities had celebrated the festival over the last few days.
“We did not give a harsh reaction at that as there were no losses reported,” Bokhari added.
The Punjab minister highlighted people’s “excitement” for the festival and said she shared the same sentiment.
Bokhari reiterated that the Basant would be celebrated in February 2027 and would be “bigger and better than the one held this year”.
The three-day Basant festival was celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations.
Subsequently, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif had praised authorities for organising a “safe Basant” festival in Lahore. She also stated that there was not a single death caused by injuries from kite strings during the festival.</p><small>2026-02-18 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18212100008c53e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974187/our-goal-win-t20-world-cup-says-shadab-as-pakistan-into-super-eights' target='_blank'><strong>Our goal? Win T20 World Cup, says Shadab as Pakistan into Super Eights</strong></a><br><p>Shadab Khan said Pakistan believed they could go on and win the T20 World Cup after their best performance of the tournament secured the last Super Eights berth on Wednesday.
Pakistan bowled out Namibia for 97 to win by a colossal 102 runs in Colombo and bounce back in style after a defeat to arch-rivals India had left them in danger of elimination.
Pakistan rode on an undefeated maiden T20 international century by opener Sahibzada Farhan to post 199-3.

 

Spinners Usman Tariq and Shadab Khan then shared seven wickets to rout Namibia in 17.3 overs.
“We didn’t take this game lightly after so much talk about one match against India,” said Shadab, who scored a brisk 22-ball 36 and grabbed 3-19.
“We are on the right track to achieve the goal of winning the World Cup and we are following a process,” he added.
Shadab warned that the Super Eights, which Pakistan will begin with a match against New Zealand in Colombo on Saturday before facing England and co-hosts Sri Lanka next week, will be a step up.
“There are eight good teams so it will be a tough stage and all matches will be high-pressure games,” said Shadab.
Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha was beaming when he described the win as a “complete performance”.
“We started really well and in the middle, we put partnerships on and then finished well,” he said.
“Sahibzada has been outstanding, the way he’s been batting for us for the last six months. He scored a hundred today and I’m very happy for him,” he said.
“When it comes to bowling, we were lethal and we were ruthless. We bowled in the right areas.”
Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus admitted there were lessons to be learned as they head home after losing all four of their group matches.
“I think for us, it’s always about nailing those specialist positions,” said Erasmus.
“It has been a great learning experience and will help us in future.”
Erasmus said Namibia were now looking forward to the ODI World Cup next year, which they will co-host with South Africa and Zimbabwe.
“There is a lot of cricket around and lots of really exciting things happening in and around cricket in Namibia, which gives the boys a lot of pleasing things to play for,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-18 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181924491501a8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974092/ramazan-moon-sighted-holy-month-to-begin-in-pakistan-on-thursday' target='_blank'><strong>Ramazan moon sighted; holy month to begin in Pakistan on Thursday</strong></a><br><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee announced on Wednesday that the Ramazan moon was sighted, and the holy month would begin in Pakistan on Thursday (February 19).
The announcement was made by committee chairman, Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, as it met in Peshawar for the moon sighting.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Azad said that the skies were clear in some areas and cloudy in others.



He said that testimonies were received from several parts of the country, including Quetta, Islamabad, Waziristan, Dir, Karachi, Buner, Mardan and Tando Allahyar.
“Therefore, it was decided with consensus that the first day of Ramazan would be on Thursday,” he said.
Separately, according to the Daily Star, the crescent moon was sighted in Bangladesh, while The Hindu reported that it was also spotted in India.

 

Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Afghanistan observed their first day of fasting on Wednesday after the crescent moon was sighted on Tuesday night.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended “heartfelt” greetings to the nation, as well as Muslims around the world, on the beginning of Ramazan, state-run APP reported.
He said the holy month was a blessing from God and gave Muslims an opportunity to “renew the values of devotion and humility in worship, righteousness and piety and spiritual purification”.
“Fasting is not merely the observance of a religious obligation; rather, it is practical training in patience, discipline and a sense of responsibility in our daily lives,” the PM said.
He added that the government had launched a Ramazan Package to “provide maximum possible support to the vulnerable groups”.
“Under this initiative, financial assistance will be provided to deserving individuals in a dignified manner through digital wallets, ensuring that every household,” he said.
President Asif Ali Zardari also extended greetings to the nation and the Muslim Ummah, describing the sacred month as a period of mercy, forgiveness, and salvation,  according to APP.
“At a time when Pakistan faces various social and economic challenges, Ramazan brings a message of hope, patience, and collective solidarity,” the report quoted the president as saying.
He expressed the resolve that “the nation should rise above personal interests and give priority to national and collective welfare”.
In a post on X, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari congratulated the Muslim Ummah on the month of Ramazan.







National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also extended felicitations to the people of Pakistan and the Muslim Ummah on the commencement of the holy month.
He appealed to the public to “demonstrate patience, avoid hoarding and profiteering, and ensure the availability of essential commodities at reasonable prices”.







Earlier this month, based on the moon’s expected age, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) had predicted that the first day of Ramazan was “likely to fall” on February 19.
It is worth mentioning that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced a Rs38 billion Ramazan Relief Package for 12.1 million deserving families across the four provinces as well as Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
“Every deserving family will receive Rs13,000 through a digital wallet or bank transfer, without discrimination based on party affiliation or point of view,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-18 15:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18200121ab8ce97.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974182/uae-president-reemerges-in-video-with-us-senator-after-rumours-about-health' target='_blank'><strong>UAE president reemerges in video with US senator after rumours about health</strong></a><br><p>United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan has appeared in a meeting with US Senator Lindsey Graham for the first time after rumours about his health spread following a now-deleted Turkish presidency statement.
Earlier this month, Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan went to Saudi Arabia and was meant to later visit the neighbouring United Arab Emirates, amid an ongoing rift between the two Gulf powers.
But on Sunday, Erdogan said he was postponing his Abu Dhabi trip because the Emirati leader had a “health problem” — in a statement that was later deleted.
The incident fuelled rumours online about Sheikh Mohamed’s health, with his Wikipedia page even briefly being edited to say he had died.
On Wednesday, the presidential court shared video footage of the Emirati president, smiling alongside powerful US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham during a meeting at Qasr Al Shati in Abu Dhabi.

 


The UAE’s official WAM news agency also shared photographs of the meeting, in which Sheikh Mohamed appeared alongside Graham.
The Emirati leader’s team on Saturday evening released photos taken the same day showing Sheikh Mohamed, known as MBZ, smiling and apparently in good health, with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar.
Graham, writing on X, said he met the UAE president for an hour-and-a-half and dismissed those perpetuating false narratives against the UAE and President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed as “full of it”.

The case against Barkat has been registered over accusations of spreading misinformation about state institutions during an interview he conducted.
A two-member bench headed by Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and including Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb took up Barkat’s bail petition in the case, which was filed against a January 21 order of the Lahore High Court (LHC) that had rejected the journalist’s previous bail plea.
The petition was moved by Advocate Saad Rasool on Barkat’s behalf with the latter currently imprisoned at Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.
During the hearing on Thursday, Deputy Attorney General Raja Muhammad Shafqat Abbasi contended that the charges levelled against Barkat entailed 10 years’ imprisonment.
Justice Afghan, however, observed that the court even granted bail to those facing charges under Section 302 (punishment for intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code, the maximum penalty for which was death.
He also noted that while the Peca law was being applied against those who criticised a “particular institution”, no action was being taken against those who pass “derogatory remarks” against the judiciary and its judges.
At that, the deputy attorney general said that the law should be applied even against those who maligned ordinary citizens.
Eventually, as the court approved Barkat’s bail, Justice Afghan made it clear that the journalist was not being acquitted and the “government can proceed against him”.
The court also enquired at what stage the trial currently was, following which the counsel for Barkat argued that PTI activist Sanam Javed, whom his client had interviewed, had not been included in the investigation.
He also complained that Barkat did not have access to the challan against him despite it having been furnished.
“Neither a charge sheet has been filed nor a formal trial has commenced,” he added.
The case against Barkat was registered on a complaint filed by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for his alleged involvement in diminishing public trust in the state and for allegedly maligning state functionaries and dignitaries.
The complainant has alleged that Barkat’s interview with Sanam had “derogatory remarks against state institutions”.
Meanwhile, Barkat’s plea against the LHC order said that his arrest was in “blatant violation” of earlier high court orders. The plea accused the prosecution of being “malicious” and associated it with a “pattern of harassment”.
Moreover, the NCCIA/FIA never disclosed the existence of an FIR against the petitioner, which proved mala fide intent on their part, and the FIR attributed no specific unlawful act or speech to the petitioner, the plea said.
The petitioner then, could not be held liable for the views of the interviewee, it contended. Claims that Barkat was the owner of siasat.pk, where the interview was uploaded, were also rebutted in the plea.
It contended that the LHC’s refusal to grant Barkat bail was “legally unsustainable” and based on a “misreading of facts and law”.
The journalist’s continued detention amounted to “pre-trial punishment” and a “miscarriage of justice”, the plea said.</p><small>2026-02-18 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181907374c5c31e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974179/imaan-hadis-appeals-against-conviction-in-controversial-social-media-posts-case-fixed-for-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan, Hadi’s appeals against conviction in controversial social media posts case fixed for hearing</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday fixed for hearing the appeals of human rights lawyer advocate Imaan Mazari and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha against their conviction in the controversial social media posts case.
According to the cause list issued by the registrar’s office, IHC’s Justice Muhammad Asif will take up the appeals on Thursday (February 19).
The court also scheduled for hearing applications seeking the suspension of sentences awarded to the two lawyers.
Last month, Imaan and Hadi were handed a total of 17 years in jail on multiple charges under the Prevention of Electr­onic Crimes Act (Peca) by a sessions court in Islamabad, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society.
The written order by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka said the prosecution had proved its case against Imaan and Hadi under Sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism) and 26-A (false information) of Peca. Under Section 9 of Peca, both were sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs5 million each, with an additional year in default.
For Section 10, they were each handed 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs30m, with two more years in default. Under Section 26-A, they received two years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs1m each, with six months’ additional jail time in case of non-payment. All sentences will run concurrently.
On Feb 7, the couple had challenged the trial court’s order. In their appeals, the two contended that the impugned judgment was passed in blatant violation of settled legal principles and mandatory procedural requi­rements.
They argued that the trial court proceeded to pronounce the verdict despite the fact that an application seeking transfer of the case was pending adjudication before the IHC, rendering the decision “unlawful and without jurisdiction”.
On January 29, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and its partner organisations published a joint statement condemning the “arbitrary arrest” and conviction of the two lawyers, calling for their release.
Separately, the United Nations Human Rights Office also said that the conviction and sentencing of the couple “following fair trial concerns” was deeply disturbing”.







The European Union’s (EU) Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anouar El Anouni had also raised concerns over the conviction of Imaan and Hadi. The EU official said their convictions “over social media activity goes against freedom of expression and independence of lawyers”.
“These are not only key democratic principles but also part of [Pakistan’s] international human rights commitments,” Anouni said.







Further, five United Nations experts on Feb 4 expressed alarm over the conviction. In a joint statement, UN special rapporteurs Margaret Satterthwaite, Ben Saul, Mary Lawlor, Irene Khan and Gina Romero noted that the two were convicted on multiple criminal charges, which resulted in lengthy prison sentences “for simply exercising rights guaranteed by international human rights law”.
“Lawyers, like other individuals, are entitled to freedom of expression. The exercise of this right should never be conflated with criminal conduct, especially not terrorism,” they were quoted as saying, while also emphasising the vague definition of terrorism-related offences under Pakistan’s counter-terrorism framework.
“Doing so risks undermining and criminalising the work of lawyers and human rights defenders across Pakistan and has a chilling effect on civil society in the country,” the experts said.</p><small>2026-02-18 14:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18163117ed6a535.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974141/govt-says-no-power-or-gas-loadshedding-during-sehr-iftar' target='_blank'><strong>Govt says no power or gas loadshedding during Sehr, Iftar</strong></a><br><p>The power and petroleum ministers on Wednesday assured the nation that there would be no electricity and gas loadshedding during Sehr and Iftar throughout the month of Ramazan.
Addressing a joint press conference alongside Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik, Power Minister Awais Leghari said, “We have decided that there will be absolutely no loadshedding in any area — unless there is a huge fault God forbid — during the timings of Sehr and Iftar.
“Even economic loadshedding in areas with high-loss feeders will be restricted at the time of Sehr and Iftar,” he added.
Leghari noted that it was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s wish that those fasting were provided with utility services in a proper and timely manner so they “do not face any issues”.

 


Meanwhile, Malik stated that “complete arrangements” had been made to ensure the supply of gas “with maximum pressure from 3am to 10:30pm, especially during Sehr and Iftar”.
Leghari affirmed that it would be ensured that “there is no suspension of electricity during these timings across Pakistan”.
He highlighted that a special control room has been established at the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) to monitor all feeders and ensure the same.
“You have the 118 helpline; please file a complaint on it if you face any kind of issues. It will be addressed immediately,” the power minister said.
In his remarks, Malik said the decision regarding no gas loadshedding was taken after consultations with the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), so that the public could be provided with “as many facilities as possible”.

 

“Additional volumes have been arranged,” he said.
For gas-related issues, consumers can lodge a complaint on 119, the petroleum minister stated, adding that situation rooms have been established in the SNGPL and SSGC head offices.
He added that directives have also been issued to the regional offices to monitor the supply of gas, especially “on the tail ends”.
Malik contended that the gas supply in the winter this year was comparatively better than in previous winters.
“With all these efforts, the Power Division and the Petroleum Division are trying to become a source of ease during the blessed month of Ramazan,” the minister said.
After the Ramazan moon was sighted in other parts of the world last night, Pakistan is expecting to begin the holy month with the first fast on Thursday.
In a supply schedule issued days ago for Karachi and its nearby areas, the SSGC said gas would be available from 3am to 9am for Sehr and from 3:30pm to 10pm for Iftar, with the supply expected to be suspended outside these hours to manage overall demand.

 

Similarly, the SNGPL had proposed providing gas from 3am to 10:30pm daily during the upcoming holy month across Punjab.
On Tuesday, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution calling for no gas loadshedding during Sehr and Iftar.
“We have already written to the federal government,” Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said.</p><small>2026-02-18 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18125928465cdc4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974093/india-tells-university-to-leave-ai-summit-after-presenting-chinese-robot-as-its-own-sources-say' target='_blank'><strong>India tells university to leave AI summit after presenting Chinese robot as its own, sources say</strong></a><br><p>An Indian university has been asked to vacate its stall at the country’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) summit after a staff member was caught presenting a commercially available robotic dog made in China as its own creation, two government sources said.
“You need to meet Orion. This has been developed by the Centre of Excellence at Galgotias University,” Neha Singh, a professor of communications, told state-run broadcaster DD News this week in remarks that have since gone viral.
But social media users quickly identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, sold by China’s Unitree Robotics for about $2,800 and widely used in research and education globally.
The episode has drawn sharp criticism and has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on India’s artificial intelligence ambitions.
The embarrassment was amplified by IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who shared the video clip on his official social media account before the backlash. The post was later deleted.
The stall remained open to visitors as of Wednesday morning with university officials fielding questions from media about accusations of plagiarism and misrepresentation.
Galgotias has yet to receive any communication about being kicked out from the event, a representative at the booth said.
‘Truly embarrassing’
The silver mechanical dog — a model sold by Chinese startup Unitree —appeared at a booth run by the private Galgotias University at this week’s AI Impact Summit in New Delhi.
Following online uproar over the professor’s claim in a televised interview, Galgotias said that while it did not build the machine, “what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies”.
“You need to meet Orion,” the professor told an Indian TV reporter as the dog performed tricks such as waving at the camera and springing up on its hind legs.
“This has been developed by the centres of excellence at the Galgotias University,” she said, touting the institution’s investments in artificial intelligence technology.
“As you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes… it’s quite naughty also,” she said.
In a statement posted on social media platform X, the university said: “Let us be clear — Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed.”
The “recently acquired” Unitree robodog is a “classroom in motion” and “our students are experimenting with it, testing its limits”, it said.







India’s Congress opposition party used the incident to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is hosting nearly 20 world leaders and dozens more national delegations at the five-day summit.
“The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own,” the party wrote in a post on X.
“This is truly embarrassing for India,” it added, calling the incident “brazenly shameless”.







The TV reporter who had conducted the interview, Tapas Bhattachary, urged viewers to take a broader perspective.
“If one out of hundreds of exhibitors wasn’t being upfront about their innovation, I would not give up on the entire India’s youth who are very innovative,” Bhattachary said.</p><small>2026-02-18 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651600-pm-shehbaz-to-seek-clarity-on-troops-for-gaza-in-us-visit-sources' target='_blank'><strong>'Board of Peace': PM Shehbaz lands in Washington to seek clarity on Gaza peace force</strong></a><br><p>

Global tech giants are racing to unveil deals and investments in the country this week, as world leaders and top industry figures gather to discuss the opportunities and challenges that AI poses.
Google’s announcement follows its October commitment to spend $15 billion over five years to construct its largest AI infrastructure hub outside the United States, in Visakhapatnam, an Indian port city in the southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh, also known as Vizag.
The US giant said it would build “three subsea paths connecting India to Singapore, South Africa, and Australia”.
It will also create “four strategic fiber-optic routes that bolster network resilience and capacity between the United States, India, and multiple locations across the Southern Hemisphere”.
These would include a direct cable connecting Vizag to South Africa, and another to Singapore, Google said in a statement.
And India’s financial capital Mumbai would be connected to Western Australia, it added.
Google said the initiative was part of a project launched in collaboration with regional partners called “America-India Connect” that will “establish a new international subsea gateway in Visakhapatnam”.
“These investments will establish Vizag as a major international subsea gateway, adding vital diversity from existing landings in Mumbai and Chennai,” the company added.
“For a nation of more than one billion people, this will increase the resilience of India’s digital backbone and improve economic security.”
Among other deals announced Wednesday, US chip titan Nvidia said it was partnering with three Indian cloud computing companies to provide advanced processors for data centres that can train and run AI systems.
Last year India leapt to third place — overtaking South Korea and Japan — in an annual global ranking of AI competitiveness calculated by Stanford University researchers.
But despite plans for large-scale infrastructure and grand ambitions for innovation, experts say the South Asian country has a long way to go before it can rival the United States and China.
“India’s going to have an extraordinary trajectory with AI and we want to be a partner,” Sundar Pichai, head of Google’s parent company Alphabet, told reporters in New Delhi.
The world’s most populous country is “uniquely positioned at this moment” to push ahead in the sector, he said, adding that India was one of the largest markets for Google’s Gemini AI chatbot.</p><small>2026-02-18 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181659178eb6e7d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974156/citizens-stage-protest-outside-karachi-press-club-against-killing-of-suspect-during-ctd-raid' target='_blank'><strong>Citizens stage protest outside Karachi Press Club against killing of suspect during CTD raid</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A large number of people gathered outside the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday to protest the killing of a man during an alleged encounter by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) a day earlier, alleging that the deceased was a student who was earlier arrested by law enforcers.
On Tuesday, the CTD said that officials had conducted a raid on a house in Shah Latif Town on a terrorist hideout.
According to the department, the men inside the house opened fire on officials, who then retaliated, leading to the deaths of four suspects. The CTD said the suspects belonged to the Bashir Zeb network of Fitna al-Hindustan, a term used by the state for Balochistan-based terrorist groups.
However, on Wednesday afternoon, a large number of residents of Old Golimar, including women and children, protested and staged a sit-in outside the KPC, demanding justice for Hamdan, one of the killed suspects identified by the CTD.
The deceased’s father, Mohammed Ali said that on December 29, 2025, his son Hamdan was allegedly taken away by the CTD.
He said that he had also filed a petition before the Sindh High Court against the alleged disappearance of his son.  He asserted that it was a “fake encounter” and termed it an “extra-judicial killing”.
He further alleged that the CTD was not even handing over the body and was demanding that he sign a form admitting that his son was a “terrorist”.
He said that the CTD, in a press conference on Jan 6, 2026, had announced the arrest of his son Hamdan and others, and their affiliation with a banned terrorist organisation.
He said that his son was a student who had no affiliation with any terror group.
The father said that his son was supposed to be presented before a court on Wednesday after the completion of his physical remand in the CTD custody. However, the family was informed that he had been killed in an alleged encounter.
He said the family visited the Edhi morgue, but were informed by officials that they would not hand over the body without the approval of the CTD.</p><small>2026-02-18 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651593-live-ruet-e-hilal-committee-meeting-underway-for-ramadan-2026-moon-sighting' target='_blank'><strong>Ramadan moon sighted in Pakistan, fasting starts today</strong></a><br><p>

“So one way or the other, we are going to end, deter Iran’s march towards a nuclear weapon,” he added.
US and Iranian officials held talks in Geneva on Tuesday aimed at averting the possibility of US military intervention to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme.
Iran said following the talks that they had agreed on “guiding principles” for a deal to avoid conflict.

Rahman was sworn into office on Tuesday after a landslide election victory, taking over from the interim administration that had led the country of 170 million people since a deadly 2024 uprising that toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina.
The 50-member cabinet announced in a gazette notification issued late Tuesday includes Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury, 76, a businessman and veteran lawmaker who has now returned to the finance ministry.
Chowdhury is tasked with reviving growth after months of turmoil that rattled investor confidence in the world’s second-largest garment exporter.

 

He had previously served in the cabinet of Rahman’s late mother, three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia, but was forced to resign in 2004.
According to media reports, his resignation came after he had granted permission for Taiwan to open a commercial office in Dhaka.
Chowdhury has not spoken publicly about the issue.
He was also arrested several times during Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, as her government regularly targeted opposition leaders in cases often decried as politically motivated.
Rahman, 60, has appointed himself defence minister, as his government faces a daunting list of challenges, including improving security and healing rifts in a country polarised by years of bitter rivalry.
Bangladesh is squeezed between India — where border tensions are high — and Myanmar, where clashes have spilled over into frontier areas.

 

Bangladesh is home to more than a million Rohingya refugees who have fled Myanmar.
Khalilur Rahman is the foreign minister, an experienced diplomat and former UN official who holds degrees from universities in Dhaka and the United States.
Khalilur Rahman held the security portfolio in the caretaker government and helped mediate trade talks with the United States.
He faces the tricky task of balancing regional relations after ties with neighbour India soured during the interim government, and Dhaka deepened engagement with New Delhi’s arch-enemy Pakistan.
In separate posts on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar conveyed his “heartiest congratulations” to Khalilur Rahman and State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shama Obaed Islam on their appointments.
“I am confident that his vast diplomatic experience and commitment to regional peace, stability and connectivity will greatly benefit the people of Bangladesh, the region, and beyond,” Dar said about his counterpart.
“I look forward to working closely with him to further deepen the brotherly ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, and to advance mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral cooperation.”







For the state minister, Dar expressed his wish to work closely with her to further strengthen Pakistan-Bangladesh relations and to advance “regional peace, stability, and mutually beneficial cooperation in areas of shared interest”.







India’s Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar congratulated his counterpart, saying in a statement that they would work together to “advance our cooperation”.







PM Rahman was expected to chair his first cabinet meeting later on Wednesday.
Other members of the cabinet include veteran politicians, former ministers and lawmakers, as well as academics and several party workers.</p><small>2026-02-18 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/181334036425f4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974086/ttap-calls-off-parliament-house-sit-in-but-insists-on-personal-physicians-access-to-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP calls off Parliament House sit-in but insists on personal physicians’ access to Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) announced on Wednesday it would end its days-long sit-in at Parliament House over ex-premier Imran Khan’s health concerns.
However, it reiterated the demand being voiced by Imran’s family to grant the PTI founder access to his personal physicians and allow jail meetings with his relatives.
Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas — flanked by National Assembly counterpart Mehmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja — addressed the media in Islamabad after a Supreme Court hearing concerning Imran’s cases.
“Thanks to God, there is a minor improvement compared to the situation before, when the vision had gone completely — just a little bit,” Abbas told reporters.
However, he criticised the government for “not taking on board” Imran’s family or personal doctors. The senator reiterated that Imran’s longtime physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, should be allowed to examine the PTI founder.
Stressing that the opposition members would be glad to know about even the slightest improvement in Imran’s condition, Abbas said, “Therefore, as the month of Ramazan is also beginning, we will end our sit-in that we were staging in the parliament.
“And in the next stage, we can take different measures as TTAP and we will do so as we have time,” he added.



“If our rulers want to solve this issue, which has been raised across the world and the world has voiced concerns, then witnessing [is necessary],” Abbas said, calling for Imran’s personal physicians to be granted access to Imran.
“When Imran Khan sahib has said he has concerns, then it means there are concerns,” the Senate opposition leader emphasised, calling for the ex-premier’s jail meetings with his sisters.
“Whatever their demands are, which will satisfy them, should be taken,” he said, calling on the public to pray for Imran’s prompt recovery.
Abbas also termed the demand by Imran’s family to have him treated at Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital as “genuine”, noting that there were independent and competent doctors there who were not subordinate to any government medics.

 

Recalling the “extremely worrying” earlier reports of vision loss in Imran’s right eye, Abbas noted that the Adiala jail staff had not taken timely action to provide medical care to Imran.
“This was a crime. God-willing, we are about to approach the court about this,” he announced.
The senator stressed that the objective of the TTAP sit-in was to ensure that the “government does not commit any more mistakes”. “People across Pakistan — whether opponents or critics — were worried.”
Claiming that Parliament House’s gates were shut, Abbas alleged that the parliament was “made a jail”.
“Our MNAs were confined in the [Parliament] Lodges. The friends from KP were confined in the KP House,” he said, adding that cases under terrorism charges were filed against TTAP members.
Abbas further said that Achakzai had vowed to go on a hunger strike if the reports of “Imran completely losing his eyesight” had turned out to be true.
Earlier in the day, the TTAP leadership — including Achakzai, Abbas, Gohar and Raja — reached the SC to show solidarity with Imran during the hearing of his cases.
“They may announce further strategy regarding the protest and will also address the crackdown on PTI supporters,” TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai had told Dawn.
The TTAP also shared a video of Achakzai inside the SC premises and speaking to Imran’s sister Aleema Khan.







Ahead of the SC hearing, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi met with Imran’s three sisters — namely Aleema, Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum.
“A detailed discussion was held on Imran Khan’s health, judicial matters, other affairs and the challenges being faced in these,” the PTI said.







SC again denies Latif Khosa meeting with Imran
Meanwhile, the SC again denied PTI leader Latif Khosa a meeting with Imran, as the court indefinitely adjourned multiple cases concerning the ex-premier.
A three-member bench, headed by Justice Hashim Khan Kakar and including Justices Salahuddin Panhwar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim, resumed hearing a set of petitions regarding the PTI founder.
When the bench took up the matter of Imran’s eligibility to contest polls, Khosa requested that a meeting be arranged between him and the jailed party founder.
To this, Justice Kakar replied, “You have taken away the power of taking suo motu notice from us. How can we order a meeting in a criminal case?”
Justice Panhwar also questioned how the bench could issue directives in a case that was not fixed before it.
Therefore, the bench dismissed Khosa’s request for a meeting.
At one point, Justice Kakar told Khosa “not to speak about political matters while standing in the court”. “Speak on politics in the parliament,” the judge remarked.
He added, “Now that you have said such things, tickers will also be aired about this and vlogs will also be made.”
The SC then issued a notice to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and adjourned the hearing for an indefinite period.
During his conversation with Justice Kakar about an old judgment that he had cited, Khosa brought up the matter of PTI’s intra-party elections.
At this, ostensibly referring to Gohar, the judge acknowledged, “A big, living PTI chairman is sitting before us.”
The appeals against Imran’s acquittal in the cipher case were adjourned without any proceedings as the prosecutor general informed the bench that the detailed order of the case had not been submitted.

 

The prosecutor general sought more time to submit the detailed order.
Here, Barrister Salman Safdar, who had appeared as Imran’s lawyer, informed the SC that he had not been issued a notice in the case.
Justice Kakar observed that the court could issue a notice to him, but noted that the appeal’s maintainability was yet to be decided.
Separately, the SC also indefinitely adjourned Imran’s appeal against a Rs10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his time as the Punjab chief minister.
Imran’s lawyer stated he had challenged the additional sessions court hearing the case, contending that the district and sessions courts have the authority to conduct the trial. The court then issued a notice to PM Shehbaz’s counsel Mustafa Ramday.
KP CM announces ‘Free Imran Khan Force’
In yet another attempt to secure Imran’s release from jail, CM Afridi announced the formation of a “Free Imran Khan Force” for a “peaceful” movement.
Addressing a press conference outside the SC, Afridi emphasised that a “public movement has now become unavoidable after persistent violations of court directives”, according to a PTI post on X.
The KP CM said the “Free Imran Khan Force” will offer memberships for youth from across the country and would include professionals, members from the Insaf Students Forum (ISF), as well as the PTI’s youth, women and minority wings.
“The Free Imran Khan Force will wage a completely peaceful struggle. After his release, Imran Khan will himself dissolve the force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying.
The chief minister elaborated that the membership cards would be ready within four to five days, with youth from Peshawar taking oaths after Eidul Fitr.



TTAP ‘demands’ full medical access for Imran
In the early hours of Wednesday, the TTAP also shared a list of five “immediate and unconditional demands”.
The first was immediately granting Imran “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan, so “they could conduct a medical examination independently”.
The alliance further asked for certified copies of Imran’s medical tests, diagnostic reports, X-rays, scans and laboratory results to be shared with his personal physicians.







The TTAP also demanded that the PTI founder’s personal doctors be “given full authority to formulate their independent medical opinion without the presence or pressure of the government’s medical board”.
It further sought “regular and continuous follow-up examinations” of the PTI founder by his personal physicians.
Lastly, the TTAP demanded that, for transparency and accountability, the government clarify in writing why “any obstruction or delay occurred in the provision of treatment, diagnosis, and medical facilities”, and also provide assurance that such negligence will not be repeated in the future.
The TTAP stressed that any kind of “delay, excuses or staged actions” would be unacceptable. “The matter of Imran’s health is not political, but a requirement of human and constitutional responsibility,” it added.
Family members and senior party leaders have repeatedly attempted to meet him at Adiala jail in recent weeks, but most visits have been blocked by authorities.
The SC’s intervention on February 10 allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, with the ex-premier telling the counsel he had “15 per cent” vision left in his right eye. This followed a “medical procedure” that Imran underwent on the night of January 24.
A report prepared by a team of doctors who visited Imran on February 15 stated that, unaided, Imran’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.
However, the PTI founder’s family and the opposition alliance rejected the report and demanded that Dr Yusuf and family members be allowed regular and confidential access to monitor his condition.
The TTAP framed their sit-in as a push against the government’s alleged negligence and lack of transparency regarding Imran’s treatment.

Judicial Magistrate Hamidul Rahman Nasir conducted the trial, which involved testimony from several witnesses, including the victims and police investigators.
The incident took place on April 2, 2021, when a dispute erupted at the man’s residence in the jurisdiction of the Shafiqabad police station.
According to the first information report (FIR), the conflict began when the man allegedly pressured his wife to seek employment against her wishes. When she refused, he and several of his family members reportedly began to beat her.
Following a telephone call from the wife, her mother and brother arrived at the scene.
The prosecution argued that during the ensuing confrontation, the man assaulted his mother-in-law, tearing her clothes and beating her until she lost consciousness. Neighbours eventually intervened to rescue the victims.
The couple had been married for about one year and three months before the incident, and the wife gave birth to a daughter three months ago, according to the FIR.
The FIR, however, stated that after only two months of marriage, the husband began subjecting his wife to routine physical abuse. As a result, she stayed at her parents’ house for about eight months and received medical treatment at their expense.
The defence contended that the FIR was fabricated and noted the absence of official Medical Legal Certificates (MLCs).
However, the prosecution explained that hospital protocols during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and police negligence during the investigation contributed to the lack of formal documentation.
The magistrate found the man guilty under Section 354 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which addresses assaulting or using criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty.
The magistrate observed that minor inconsistencies in testimony due to the passage of time did not invalidate the consistent core allegations against the primary accused.
He also relied upon recent legal precedents from the Supreme Court (SC) and Lahore High Court (LHC) regarding delays in registering FIRs, stating that victims should not be penalised for police inefficiency.
In the judgment announced on Tuesday, the magistrate sentenced the husband to three months of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of Rs1,500 for assaulting his wife.
He was also awarded another three-month rigorous imprisonment for assaulting his mother-in-law, along with a fine of Rs1,500.
The magistrate’s order said both sentences would run concurrently.
After the announcement of the verdict, the accused, who was present in the court, was taken into custody and shifted to the district jail to serve his sentence.
Four other accused were exonerated for lack of evidence.
An alarming number of over 15,000 cases of violence and harassment against women occurred in Punjab in the first half of 2025, and an average of 85 women face violence every day, according to the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO) in its bi-annual Violence Against Women Punjab 2025 factsheet.
The findings depicted a grim picture of women’s safety in Punjab. On average, nine women were raped every day, 51 were kidnapped, and 24 endured domestic violence during the first half of the year.
In January, the SC called out societal apathy towards victims of domestic violence, noting that despite sustained maltreatment by their husbands and in-laws, women are still forced to return to the same abusive environments.</p><small>2026-02-18 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/18105809b0f840f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974082/14-suspected-militants-killed-during-ctd-operations-in-quetta-barkhan' target='_blank'><strong>14 suspected militants killed during CTD operations in Quetta, Barkhan</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Wednesday said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts.
In a statement, the CTD said eight armed men were killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area.
“Eight armed persons were killed in a fire exchange during the operation,” read the statement, adding that three CTD personnel were injured during the action.
According to the CTD, weapons and ammunition were recovered from the killed miscreants. It noted that the dead individuals were said to be from a banned outfit.
In a separate statement, the CTD said “six terrorists were killed in a fire exchange” during an intelligence-based operation in Barkhan.

 

“All security personnel remained safe,” it stated, adding that arms and ammunition were recovered from the killed militants.
“The terrorists were involved in the planning of disruptive actions,” the CTD said, reaffirming to continue its efforts to eliminate terrorism.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
On February 5, security forces concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The operation was initiated as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across the province on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days.
During simultaneous operations, around 180 suspects were arrested and a huge cache of arms and ammunition was seized by Frontier Corps and police, officials said.</p><small>2026-02-18 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651528-ruet-e-hilal-committee-to-meet-in-peshawar-for-ramadan-2026-moon-sighting-today' target='_blank'><strong>Ruet-e-Hilal Committee to meet in Peshawar for Ramadan 2026 moon sighting today</strong></a><br><p>

According to officials, attackers opened fire with automatic weapons on the Yarik police station and a nearby customs office, located along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) route.
A police spokesperson said the officials martyred in the attack were customs official Israr Khan and police constable Mohammad Bilal.
The injured, identified as Hazrat Umar and Khayal Mohammad, were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital’s trauma centre, where they were undergoing treatment.
Police said the attackers also fired at passenger buses travelling on the CPEC route, causing panic in the area. A customs vehicle was set ablaze during the assault.
Security personnel returned fire, prompting the assailants to flee. A heavy police contingent reached the site soon after the incident, and a search operation was launched in the surrounding area.
Investigations are underway, and officials said efforts were ongoing to apprehend those involved in the attack.
Earlier this month, at least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred when armed militants attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area of Dera Ismail Khan.
On January 24, five people, including a peace committee leader, were killed, while 10 others were injured in an explosion — said to be a suicide attack — during a wedding ceremony in the district.</p><small>2026-02-18 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651490-hrcp-raises-alarm-over-staged-encounters-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP raises alarm over 'staged encounters' in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>
