• Internet service across Balochistan to stay suspended until 31st, lawmakers told
• PML-N legislator accuses govt of ‘copying’ his bill
ISLAMABAD: Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar has assured the Senate that the release of an official advertisement on Independence Day, without a portrait of the country’s founder Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, would be investigated.
“It is not in our notice. If it has happened, this is heart-afflicting for all,” he told the upper house of parliament on Friday. He assured that an inquiry would be conducted to ascertain how it happened and the house will be formally informed about the progress.
The government had come under fire from political and social circles over the official advertisement issued by the Ministry of Information, which omitted images of the Quaid-i-Azam and national poet-philosopher Allama Iqbal.
The advertisement, published in major national newspapers and aired on television channels, featured images of President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, as well as the chiefs of navy and air force, besides tanks and aircraft, and a picture depicting the cultural diversity of the country.
 






The issue was raised by PTI’s Faisal Javed in his maiden speech, following his reelection, soon after the house unanimously adopted a resolution reaffirming the resolve to protect the sovereignty of Pakistan, preserving its democratic ethics and building a prosperous future for generations to come.
He stressed that the ruling elite had not paid for these advertisements out of their own pockets, saying public funds had been used for personal promotion. “They even put their photographs on newly built public toilets,” he remarked.
The PTI lawmaker also accused the government of doling out civil awards on political grounds and demeaning the prestige of the awards. “This is the insult of the people who truly deserved receiving these,” he remarked.
The law minister, himself a recipient of the Nishan-i-Imtiaz, defended giving civil awards to politicians — all from the ruling coalition. He said that out of roughly 200 recipients, only about 15 were politicians.
He said these included eight members of the team led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that visited various countries after heightened tensions with India, while the rest were part of the ‘war cabinet’ formed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during the conflict with India, spending many sleepless nights to remain available for emergency decisions at all times.
 


Resolution on Independence Day
Through a resolution marking the Independence Day, the house pledged to strive for sustainable development, economic empowerment and national unity.
Honouring the leadership of the Quaid-i-Azam, the resolution, moved by the law minister, paid homage to all those whose sacrifices made Pakistan a sovereign and independent state. The resolution commended the armed forces and security institutions for their unmatched valour and sacrifices in defending the nation. It paid tribute to the martyrs and Ghazis, pledging to preserve and uphold their legacy for future generations.
The resolution paid special tribute to the parliamentarians, who framed the Constitution of Pakistan and advanced democratic reforms, while reaffirming the commitment to preserving the parliamentary democracy, constitutional supremacy and rule of law.
 






The resolution also expressed commitment to promoting peaceful coexistence, regional stability and constructive engagement with neighbouring countries. It also expressed commitment to address the shared challenges, including climate change, economic inequalities, terrorism and public health crisis, while safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty.
The resolution called upon the citizens, particularly the youth, to work beyond personal and political differences and contribute actively to nation building through education, innovation, civic engagement and service to humanity.
Another resolution, urging the federal and provincial governments to celebrate the 1,500th Eid Miladun Nabi (peace be upon him) on a grand scale, was also adopted unanimously.
 






Internet services
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry informed the house that internet services in Balochistan would remain suspended until the end of August.
Responding to a calling-attention notice about the suspension of mobile internet across 36 districts of the province in the name of security causing great unrest among students, freelancers and businessmen, he said the suspension was temporary and solely a security measure.
 
 

As per a policy directive under Section 8 of the Pakistan Telec­ommunication (Reor­ganisation) Act, 1996, he said such decisions followed a specific process. He explained that requests originated from the Ministry of Interior, based on recommendations from relevant security stakeholders, and were then forwarded to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) for implementation.
The minister said that mobile internet services in Balochistan were suspended from August 6 to 31 due to credible security concerns. However, he added, telephone services remained fully operational, and the restriction was limited to mobile internet.
“All airlines, including PIA and private carriers, are fully functional in Balochistan, while road and rail links to Quetta and other cities remain open,” he added.
‘Plagiarism’ accusation
Another highlight of the day’s proceedings was criticism the government had to face from one of its own.
As the Virtual Assets Ordinance was laid before the house, PML-N MNA Afnan Ullah Khan said the bill had been blocked when he tried to bring it to the house after months of hard work.  “Now they have copied and brought it to the house,” the PML-N lawmaker said and noted that this comes in the ambit of plagiarism and cheating. “The credit should be given to the one whose bill this is,” he said.
Later, another government ally protested an attempt to get the petroleum amendment bill — okayed by the National Assembly — passed without sending it to the standing committee concerned.  It was BAP parliamentary leader Manzoor Kakar loudly opposed the bill.
The law minister initially pointed out that it was a prerogative of the house to pass a bill without referring it to the standing committee, as it had been discussed threadbare in the lower house, but PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Ali Zafar opposed the move.
The law minister ultimately had to surrender and agreed that the bill be referred to the standing committee. He, however, said he was doing this out of respect for Mr Kakar and still believed it was not a legal requirement to send a bill already passed by the NA to a standing committee.

The LSM, which contributes around 8pc to the national GDP, had contracted by 0.03pc in FY24, following a growth of 0.92pc in the preceding year.
In June 2025, LSM posted a 4.14pc year-on-year (YoY) growth, the fourth consecutive month of positive growth, mainly due to a reduction in the key interest rate to 11pc earlier in the fiscal year. However, on a month-on-month (MoM) basis, LSM showed a decline of 3.67pc in June.
The food sector, a significant component of LSM, declined by 1.83pc YoY in FY25. However, wheat and rice milling experienced a 6.38pc rise, while starch production rose 0.59pc. Vegetable ghee production dropped by 0.94pc, cooking oil by 0.33pc, and tea by 2.76pc.

Food, steel and energy weigh, while automobiles and textiles shine

The textile sector performed better, growing by 2.49pc YoY. Cotton yarn production rose by 7.59pc, and cotton cloth by 0.68pc, together making up more than 80pc of the textile sector’s output. Garment exports surged by 5.70pc.
 
 

The coke and petroleum products sector grew of 5.33pc. Petrol output increased by 1.68pc, high-speed diesel by 10.96pc, and kerosene by 23.88pc. However, LPG production fell by 1.59pc, and jet fuel oil dropped by 10.19pc.
The automobile sector exhibited robust growth, expanding by 46.15pc YoY, primarily driven by a 41.99pc increase in cars and jeeps, a 157.73pc rise in light commercial vehicles (LCVs), and 100pc growth in trucks. Bus production also grew by 66.41pc, though diesel engine production declined by 6.05pc.
The pharmaceutical sector recorded a growth of 2.74pc, while fertiliser production saw a modest increase of 1.69pc.On the downside, the iron and steel sector contracted by 8.71pc, with billets/ingots, used mainly in construction, falling by 21.86pc.
Production of hot-rolled sheets, strips, coils, and plates decreased by 1.98pc. Rubber products, non-metallic minerals, and electrical equipment also experienced declines, with respective decreases of 1.27pc, 7.88pc, and 11.65pc.

Under the PM’s Cashless Economy initiative, key goals include raising the number of active digital merchants to 2 million by the end of 2025-26, increasing mobile and internet banking users from the current 95 million to 120m within a year, and doubling annual digital payment transactions to 15 billion.
According to finance ministry sources, another primary target is routing 100pc of overseas remittances through bank accounts or mobile wallets, up from the current 80pc. This move seeks to eliminate cash payouts and boost transparency in remittance flows.
Following the directives of the committee chaired by the prime minister, the SBP is expected to play a pivotal role in expanding mobile banking services to all segments of society.

2m digital merchants and 15bn transactions targeted by FY26

Meanwhile, Minister for IT and Telecom Shaza Fatima said Pakistan, with over 143 million broadband users, has significant potential to transition to a cashless economy.
 
 

“Mobile wallets now outnumber traditional bank accounts, and the branchless banking infrastructure is robust,” she said, noting the government’s commitment to reducing reliance on physical currency and promoting digital payments. However, she acknowledged that among the four cellular mobile operators, only two — Jazz and Telenor — have established strong mobile wallet platforms.
Telenor’s Easypaisa, launched in 2009, was Pakistan’s first mobile wallet and has since evolved into the country’s first digital bank.
Farhan Hassan, Chief Digital Officer of Easypaisa Digital Bank, said the platform now offers a full range of banking services similar to those of traditional banks, helping to drive financial inclusion for millions of unbanked and underbanked Pakistanis. Easypaisa currently has around 18 million monthly active users, including 14 million mobile app users.
JazzCash, which began operations in 2012, remains the market leader with 21 million monthly active users and 15 million app users, making it the largest digital financial service provider in the country. Khayam Siddiqi, Head of Communication at JazzCash, attributed this growth to the ease of account opening, which requires no paperwork or branch visits. “Digital wallets offer a suite of services in one place — nano loans, savings, insurance, welfare disbursements, and everyday payments,” he said.
While JazzCash has gained traction in rural areas, Easypaisa enjoys a strong presence in urban centres. Despite occasional speculation surrounding its future amid the Telenor-PTCL merger, Easypaisa has retained a loyal user base.
The strength of mobile digital wallets lies in their simplicity — accounts are linked to mobile phone numbers, and transactions are facilitated by local shopkeepers acting as agents for cash-in and cash-out services. In contrast, Upaisa, the mobile wallet offered by Ufone, has a limited footprint, while Zong has yet to enter the digital market.

Donald Trump wants Friday’s summit at a Cold War-era air force base to be the start of the end of the deadliest war in Europe since World War II. Vladimir Putin, ascendant in the war, has offered the prospect of a possible deal to limit strategic nuclear weapons, which the Kremlin hopes would usher in a much broader discussion of US and Russian global interests beyond Ukraine.
In Anchorage, nearly 8,000 kilometres from the front lines of the war, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in a sweatshirt with the old Soviet Union initials “USSR” across the front.
A bear and a moose ambled across one live television feed.
The Kremlin press pool was housed in an Alaska Airlines centre, where a semi-open-plan room was subdivided by partitions and some reporters were seen making their own camp-style beds.
They were fed for free at a nearby university campus.
The state, whose far western tip lies just 90 kilometres from the Russian Far East, is home to indigenous peoples and was settled by Europeans, including Russians, from the 18th century.
The United States purchased Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million in 1867 and no Russian leader has visited before.
“I understand the historical moment. It’s kind of exciting,” said Russian-American Anchorage resident and former school teacher Galina Tomisser.
“I just want to hope and they say the hope dies last, so that there will be some fruitful results from this meeting, from this summit,” she said.
Different waves of emigrants from the former Soviet Union have settled in Alaska, including both Russians and Ukrainians.
Pro-Ukrainian protesters held up a large Ukrainian flag with the words ALASKA STANDS WITH UKRAINE.

“This is just grandstanding for Donald Trump,” said Anchorage resident Helen Sharratt, 65, and originally from England.
“He likes to look good and think he’s doing something, but he’s not doing anything. And meeting with Putin is, I mean, actually, I don’t know who’s worse in terms of making a deal and not actually adhering to it.”
At the Chilkoot Charlie’s bar in Anchorage a collection of Soviet and czarist memorabilia adorns the Russian room, including pictures of Vladimir Lenin and the last tsar Nicholas II, who was shot by the Bolsheviks in 1918.
On the other side of the world, in Moscow, matryoshka dolls featuring Putin and Trump were selling well.
Fear and apprehension
In Ukraine, though, there was fear and apprehension about what Putin and Trump might agree to at a meeting to which Ukraine and its Euro­pean backers were not invited.
“I don’t think anything good will come of it. There won’t be a positive outcome; the conflict will continue. At best, it will be a frozen conflict, nothing else,” Konstantyn Shtanko said in Kyiv.

This adds to the casualties in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, where the unprecedented floods have claimed at least 12 and nine lives, respectively, besides causing widespread destruction.
KP witnessed devastating scenes yesterday as flash floods caused by heavy rainfall and cloudbursts in multiple districts claimed over 200 lives in a day, including five crew members of a provincial government chopper that crashed in Mohmand during relief and rescue efforts.
Buner was the worst-affected district in the province with 184 lives lost in the past 48 hours, according to a situation report seen by Dawn.com. Shangla reported 36 deaths, Mansehra 23, Swat 22, Bajaur 21, Battagram 15, Lower Dir five and a child drowned in Abbottabad.
Detailing infrastructure damage, the report said 11 houses were destroyed while 63 were partially damaged due to the floods. Two schools in Swat and another in Shangla were also affected.

In a separate daily situation report on its website, the PDMA said 93 more bodies — all men — were recovered in Buner, taking the district’s toll to 184.
Buner DC Kashif Qayum Khan also confirmed the casualties to Dawn.com, adding that rescue teams were continuing their search as 30 remained missing in the Chagharzai tehsil, while “over 100” were injured.
The KP government has declared the severely affected mountainous districts of Buner, Bajaur, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra and Battagram as disaster-hit areas.
 
 

The KP PDMA told AFP that around 2,000 rescue workers were engaged in recovering bodies from the debris and carrying out relief operations in nine affected districts.
“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” KP Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told AFP.
“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.
“They are trying to evacuate survivors, but very few people are relocating due to the deaths of their relatives or loved ones being trapped in the debris.”
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a heavy rain alert for the northwest areas for the next few hours, urging people to take “precautionary measures”.

An FIR has been filed against her husband and children for murder and concealing evidence of the crime.
Ghulam Akhtar, a resident of Kot Adu (District Muzaffargarh), lodged an FIR with the Dhamial police stating that his daughter Samina had married Amir Abbas of her own choice about 19 years ago and was settled in Malik Colony, Girja Road, Dhamial.
The couple had three children — Mohammad Zaman, 17, Shan Haider, 15, and Maryam Rani, 12.
He said that on Wednesday morning, an announcement was made in their native town that the funeral of his daughter would be held at 8am in a local graveyard without his family being informed about her death.
Mr Akhtar said he along with his brothers Ghulam Rasool and Abdul Rehman, sister Kalsoom Bibi and others reached Amir Abbas’s home. He said his sister, Kalsoom Bibi and other women had seen torture marks on the body of Samina.
He said he contacted the police emergency in Kot Adu and sought help. As he called the police, Amir Abbas and his children started hurling threats of dire consequences at him.
After the Kot Adu police informed Ghulam Akhtar that the incident had happened in the jurisdiction of the Dhamial police station in Rawalpindi, the concerned police took legal action on his complaint. Samina’s body was transported to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital Rawalpindi for postmortem.
He further alleged in the FIR that his son-in-law, along with his children, murdered his daughter.

He owns no mask, no boots, no uniform; he only possesses second-hand shoes whose soles have long forgotten resistance, and a ragged scrap of cloth tied across his mouth. The cloth, damp with filth, clings to his face, offering no defence against the stench of sewage and rot. There is no protective gear — there never was. Only a body made disposable by the city it serves.
Each morning, without fail, the sanitation worker lowers himself into gutters, dry latrines and septic tanks armed only with a metal rod. When toxic gases overwhelm him, there is no ambulance; there are only fellow workers who haul his unconscious body out like a sack of waste. He wakes, bruised and breathless, to do it all again.
Official job notices for sanitary workers — hundreds documented in recent years — often specify, in clinical language, ‘Only non-Muslims eligible’.
Our Constitution, in Article 25, proclaims that “all citizens are equal before the law”. Yet this promise lies buried in sludge. Sanitation workers receive no pension, no health coverage, no formal contract. When one of them dies, and many do die, it is recorded as an ‘accident’. His family is left only with grief. There is no compensation, and his name vanishes into silence.

Someone labours beneath our feet to keep the streets clean.

The roots of this injustice can be traced back to colonial codifications of caste and enduring social norms that conflate certain bodies with impurity. Over the decades, the labour of manual scavenging and sewer-cleaning has been imposed upon marginalised religious communities: Hindu, Christian and lower-caste alike. The result is a rigid social hierarchy that Pakistan has yet to dismantle.
 
 

In contrast, India’s Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prohibits employing manual scavengers and cleaning sewers or septic tanks without protective equipment. It mandates rehabilitation and alternative employment, and obliges local authorities to identify and eliminate insanitary latrines. Yet even there, enforcement has been uneven.
Sanitary workers form the backbone of urban sanitation, removing blockages that, if left unattended, would flood the streets, spread disease and paralyse city life. Yet, society treats them as disposable.
In March 2024, four men entered a manhole in Sargodha without protective gear. They never emerged. Their deaths compelled the Punjab government to adopt standard operating procedures (SOPs), mandating certified masks, gloves, boots, gas detectors, regular health check-ups and mechanical alternatives to manual cleaning. Discriminatory job advertisements have since been removed in several jurisdictions, though some still appear. Some municipalities have begun regularising temporary sanitation workers, providing pensions, health coverage and grievance mechanisms.
Under Article 184(3), the National Commission of Human Rights filed a constitutional petition in the Supreme Court, seeking a declaration that manual sanitation and scavenging are illegal and unconstitutional. It asks the court to require provinces and municipalities to provide certified protective gear and health check-ups, phase out manual sewer-clearing in favour of mechanisation, abolish faith-based restrictions on sanitation work and establish an independent monitoring body. The petition has been admitted and awaits a hearing date.
 
 

Despite these ad­-vances, gaps re­­ma­­in. Punjab’s SOPs are not yet being en­­­forced unifor­mly. Other provinces have still to adopt binding safety protoco­­ls. Funding for me­­chanisation is limi­-
ted; municipal cap­acities vary widely. Social stigma persists; many citizens remain unaware that someone labours beneath their feet to keep their streets clean.
To close these gaps, we must ensure nationwide SOP enforcement. Federal oversight and regular audits are essential. The government of Pakistan must also allocate a budget for mechanised equipment; manual scavenging must end in law and practice.
It should integrate sanitation workers into social protection schemes; pensions, insurance and compensation must be guaranteed. It is also time to launch a dignity campaign.
The media, schools and local governments should highlight sanitation work as an essential public service, restoring respect to those who perform it.
Ending this injustice will require the commitment of the courts, governments and communities alike. The health of our cities — as well as the measure of our justice — depends on it.

During a provincial assembly’s session presided over by Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi here, Dr Ali said that floods in Malakand and Hazara divisions claimed several lives and destroyed buildings.
He said that the chief minister would be approached with a request for declaring emergency in both divisions to help out the calamity-hit residents.
The aide to the CM warned that floodwaters would soon reach Charsadda and Nowshera. He asked authorities to take all necessary steps to prevent loss of public life and property to the natural disaster.

Dr Amjad Ali calls for measures to prevent damage to public life, property

Special assistant of the chief minister for population Liaquat Ali Khan claimed that when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan was the prime minister, neither the province faced any law and order situation nor did any resident receive extortion phone calls.
He said that the people demanded early yet effective resolution of their problem.
Mr Khan said the terrorists, who were resettled in the province, should be sent back to Afghanistan.
He sarcastically said that in the past, the PPP and PML-N leaders “fell ill” within days of detention,but PTI founder Imran Khan has not reported any such complaint in the last two years of imprisonment.
The chief minister’s special assistant said that former PTI MNA and Senator-elect Murad Saeed was named in several cases just for raising his voice for peace.
He said that the opposition parties jointly got the Mines and Mineral Bill passed in the BalochistanAssembly but were resisting a similar proposed law in KP.
Mr Khan said that Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur would never allow the passage of that bill in the provincial assembly.
He accused the opposition members of committing corruption, triggering heated exchanges.
Earlier, during the question hour, member of the opposition PPP Ahmad Karim Kundi said that he had inquired about the number of “regularised surplus employees” in the culture and tourism department and the reply submitted to the house didn’t satisfy him.
He said that since vacancies in government departments would be advertised and recruitment would be made, those recently terminated by the provincial government should be preferred for those posts.
However, law minister Aftab Alam Afridi said that the KP Culture and Tourism Authority was established in 2020.
He said that since it was a policy matter, the adviser to the chief minister on tourism would brief the opposition lawmaker on it in detail.
Mr Kundi said he would be satisfied only if the sacked employees were recruited against those vacant posts.
Minister Mr Afridi said that the government departments should not become limited companies.
He said that the opposition leadership in the Centre had “overburdened” several departments, leading to their collapse. The chair later referred the question to the relevant house committee for discussion and recommendations.
Member of the opposition JUI-F Adnan Khan said that he, too, was not satisfied with the department’s answer about the “scale and time period for upgradation of an initially recruited police constable.”
He said that in the upgradation summary laid before the chief minister, the total salary of the initially recruited constable was Rs69,127 compared to Rs73,000 for a constable in Punjab and that it was misleading as according to the salary slip of a fresh recruited constable, he received 43,000.
Mr Khan said that there were differences in the risk allowances for different grades as BPS-7 constable received around Rs4,000, BPS-9 head constable around Rs3,210 and BPS-11 assistant sub-inspector around Rs2,100.
He said that the police rendered sacrifices but had yet to receive a pay raise. He requested the chair to refer his question to the relevant house committee for further deliberation and recommendations.
Minister Afridi said that the government had no objection to the referring of the question to the relevant committee.
Minister for local government Arshad Ayub tabled the KP Local Government Amendment Bill, 2025, saying the proposed change is in connection with the authority of the mayors and chairmen. He added that the law was being amended on the recommendations of the local government association.
Minister Afridi laid the KP Tourism Amendment Bill, 2025, and the KP Press Newspapers, News Agencies and Books Registration Bill, 2025, in the house. The chair later put off the session until August 22 due to a lack of quorum.

With damage assessment in progress, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority said seven houses were destroyed and 38 were damaged in the province, mostly in the Swat district. It also reported the destruction of three schools and damage to three.
The PDMA said that the rainfall would continue until August 21 in different parts of the province.
 
 

Deaths and damage to infrastructure were recorded in Swat, Buner, Shangla, Bajaur, Lower Dir, Battagram and Mansehra districts.
Meanwhile, the KP government declared one-day mourning on Saturday (today) to honour the five crew members of the Mi-17 helicopter who embraced martyrdom when the aircraft crashed during a rescue operation.

According to a notification issued by the administration department, the national flag will be flown at half-mast across the province as a mark of respect.
The Rescue 1122 teams shifted 2,071 stranded people, including 300  schoolchildren, to safety in Buner district following heavy rainfall and  flash floods.
Deputy commissioner Kashif Qayyum said that an emergency had been declared across the district as relief efforts continued in the calamity-hit areas.
“Helicopters are being used to carry out rescue operations in remote and inaccessible regions,” he said.
Mr Qayyum said that floodwaters had submerged Pir Baba Bazaar and its neighbourhood, while a mosque in Gokand was destroyed and a large number of animals perished.
Also, several roads were blocked.
 
 

Officials said the number of people, who went missing during the flooding, would be known only after waters receded.
In Mansehra, police rescued seven tourists stranded in the upper parts of Kaghan Valley. They had visited Simicsar Lake but were trapped by rain and landslides.
Rains lashed the district throughout the day, dangerously swelling the Indus, Siren and Kunhar rivers along with their tributaries.
The district administration banned tourist visits to the Siren Valley.
Landslides and uprooted trees blocked the Nawazabad and Batrasi roads, which police later cleared for traffic.
 


Meanwhile, passengers and tourists travelling between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan were stranded in Upper Kohistan after the local administration restricted movement on the Karakoram Highway in the Uchar Nullah area due to high water levels in the Indus River.
Abbottabad city was badly hit as almost all main roads were inundated, creating flood-like conditions throughout the area. The most affected arteries were PMA Kakul Road, Mirpur Mandian Road, Supply Road, Karakoram Highway, Sethi Masjid Road, Iqbal Road, Banda Dalazak, Banda Khair Ali Khan Road, Trakana, and the Link Road near Ciena Laboratory.
Most drainage systems were clogged, leading to rainwater overflowing onto the streets and entering houses to damage goods.
Traffic remained paralysed for hours, especially on the KKH in front of Ayub Teaching Hospital where swift floodwaters swept away several vehicles. Some vehicles broke down due to accumulated mud and debris.
Meanwhile, more than 25 tourists along with their vehicles got stranded in Shahi area due to high water flow on the other side of Kambat and Shahi areas of Lower Dir.
They were evacuated by personnel of the Frontier Corps 181 Wing, Rescue 1122 and the district administration.
Meanwhile, several link roads in Lower Dir remained blocked due to landslides triggered by heavy rain. Candidates for teaching posts in Talash and other areas struggled to reach examination centres.
Traffic was suspended near Gulabad Bazaar at Safruno after floodwaters damaged the road.
Heavy rainfall and flash floods severely damaged the power infrastructure in Swat, as floodwaters entered the 132kv grid station, causing the tripping of 41 feeders and the complete suspension of electricity transmission across the region. The feeder supplying power to Malam Jabba was also submerged, causing extensive damage.
The flash floods washed away several electricity poles and transformers.
On the instructions of federal power minister Awais Ahmad Laghari, the Peshawar Electric Supply Company began efforts to restore power supply.
It deployed additional workforce to expedite the rehabilitation process and dispatched transformers, poles, cables and heavy machinery to support field operations.

After an abrupt ending to three hours of talks with aides, Trump and Putin offered warm words but took no questions from reporters — highly unusual for the media-savvy US president.
“We’re not there yet, but we’ve made progress. There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Trump said.
He called the meeting “extremely productive” with “many points” agreed, although he did not offer specifics.
“There are just a very few that are left, some are not that significant, one is probably the most significant,” Trump said without elaborating.
 


Putin also spoke in general terms of cooperation in a joint press appearance that lasted just 12 minutes.
“We hope that the understanding we have reached will … pave the way for peace in Ukraine,” Putin said.
As Trump mused about a second meeting, Putin smiled and said in English: “Next time in Moscow.”
The former KGB agent quickly tried to flatter Trump, who has voiced admiration for the Russian leader in the past.
 


Putin told Trump he agreed with him that the Ukraine war, which Putin ordered, would not have happened if Trump were president instead of Joe Biden.
Trump, for his part, again complained of a “hoax” that Russia intervened to help him in the 2016 election — a finding backed by US intelligence.
Before the summit, Trump had warned of “severe consequences” if Russia did not accept a ceasefire.
But when asked about those consequences during a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity after the talks, Trump said that “because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that now”.
 






Putin warns Western allies
The friendly reception contrasted with Trump’s berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky when he met him at the White House in February.
Trump earlier said he sought a three-way meeting with Zelensky but did not announce one at the summit.
Trump said he would now consult Zelensky as well as Nato leaders, who have voiced unease about the US leader’s outreach to Putin.
“Now it’s really up to President Zelensky to get it done,” Trump said in the Fox News interview after the summit.
Putin warned Ukraine and European countries to “not create any obstacles” and not “make attempts to disrupt this emerging progress through provocation or behind-the-scenes intrigues”.
Trump invited Putin just a week ago and ensured there was some carefully choreographed drama for their first in-person meeting since 2019.
The two leaders arrived in their respective presidential jets and descended on the tarmac of an air base, with Trump clapping as Putin appeared.
 


US military might was on display with a B-2 stealth bomber flying overhead, as a reporter shouted audibly to Putin, “Will you stop killing civilians?”
Putin, undaunted, grinned widely as Trump took the unusual step of escorting him into “The Beast”, the secure US presidential limousine, before a meeting in a room before a screen that said — in English only — “Pursuing Peace”.
Putin smiled and joked with Russian reporters on the visit, a landmark for a leader who is facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court related to the Ukraine war, which has killed tens of thousands of people.

Battlefield gains
Russia, in recent days, has made battlefield gains that could strengthen Putin’s hand in any ceasefire negotiations, although Ukraine announced, as Putin was flying in, that it had retaken several villages.
Trump had insisted he would be firm with Putin, after coming under heated criticism for appearing cowed during a 2018 summit in Helsinki.
While he was travelling to Alaska, the White House announced that Trump had scrapped a plan to see Putin alone and he instead held the talks alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his roving envoy Steve Witkoff.
Zelensky was not included and has refused pressure from Trump to surrender territory seized by Russia.
“It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,” Zelensky said in a social media post.

The situation poses a serious threat to the local population that depends on earning from their crops. The threat of famine looms large as a long dry spell has destroyed crops; and locals have already consumed or disposed of their produce during the period. 
Livestock is the second source of income for many families but, at present, no fodder is available for millions of animals being reared in the region. 
For Tharparkar’s farming and herding communities, rainfall in mid-June and mid-August periods is necessary. The timely rainfall is their lifeline. Adequate amount of rain soaks the soil deep enough enabling the farming community to cultivate crops like guar, bajra, sesame, watermelon etc, besides growing fodder on grazing pastures. 

Growers, herders fear erratic or inadequate rainfall in coming days may invite natural calamity 

This year, clouds have reached the region late and the rainfall has also been inadequate as there were a few spells of light, patchy showers. The amount of rain remained far short of the required level.
Farmers fear that if several spells of heavy rains did not lash the whole region soon, both the Kharif crops and the grasslands will wither beyond recovery.
Most growers and herders fear that such a situation might expose the region to a natural calamity.
Khamiso Jhagoro, a grower and livestock owner, said in his recent observation that this year’s rainfall had barely soaked one foot of the upper soil layer which was not sufficient enough for cultivation. Thar needs at least three spells of heavy rain, ideally between mid-June and mid-August, to saturate the soil to a depth of four to five feet. 
Partab Meghwar, a farmer, said that erratic rains were often more harmful than no rain. “When scant showers fall, the seeds of grass in the soil begin to germinate. As the grass grows, livestock rush to the pasturelands and mow it down or trample over it. This leaves people and their livestock vulnerable once again,” he explained.
Once the germinated grass is trampled over, grazed or uprooted, it will not grow again until the next rainfall and its place is often taken over by toxic and useless bushes — harmful for animals’ health. Overgrazing also accelerates desertification, according to Meghwar.
Man Singh Bheel, a well-experienced herder, is of the view that consecutive droughts, changing rainfall patterns, illegal farming on pasturelands and overgrazing are destroying Thar’s ecology and land fertility. He observed that the region’s natural beauty, wildlife and grass cover had declined to an alarming level. He called for sustainable land management to prevent desertification and mitigate the risks and effects of drought.
Mubeen Saand, another prominent herder, said that until a few years back, fodder was available near his
village, but now he and his family had to travel long distances to bring the same. 
In his view, mechanical farming was harming Thar’s ecology. “For instance, cultivator, a commonly used farm implement, harms soil because its use increases erosion and land degradation by uprooting bushes and plants that once helped prevent erosion.

“Delay in adjudication carries severe macroeconomic and societal consequences: it deters investment, renders contracts illusory, and weakens the institutional legitimacy of the judiciary,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.
Justice Shah made the observation while heading a two-judge bench, also comprising Justice Ay­esha A. Malik, which was hearing an appeal filed by Abdul Salam Khan challenging the Peshawar High Court’s Nov 3, 2021 rejection of his plea.
The judge suggested introducing age-tracking protocols to automatically identify dormant cases, along with the judicious use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to assist in scheduling and triage, while preserving judicial discretion.

Justice Shah warns slow adjudication carries severe economic and societal consequences

“Such a system must, at a minimum, ensure: the early fixing of cases on a non-discriminatory basis; the elimination of “queue-jumping” and preferential scheduling; and the prioritisation of matters involving constitutional, economic, or national importance without compromising the timely resolution of individual claims,” Justice Shah emphasised.
The case arose from a challenge to the auction of an immovable property by a bank in execution of a money decree dated April 26, 2010. The auction was held in 2011. The petitioner filed objections the same year, which were dismissed. An appeal before the PHC remained pending for ten years, culminating in the 2021 decision. The matter reached the Supreme Court in 2022 and was taken up now, three years later, in 2025.
 
 

The court noted that the issue was not limited to the validity of the auction but extended to whether any meaningful relief could be granted after 14 years. Even if the petitioner’s claim had merit, the sands of time have all but eroded its potency, Justice Shah remarked.
Though the Supreme Court also rejected the appeal, it observed that a justice system’s credibility rests not only on the fairness of its decisions but also on the timeliness of those decisions. The matter, it noted, was not merely administrative but constitutional, with the right to access to justice guaranteed by articles 4, 9, and 10A of the Constitution.
This right, the court said, encompassed a fair and timely trial, and delays that render a remedy ineffective amount to a denial of due process.
“Justice, to be real, must be both just and timely,” Justice Shah stressed, adding that statistics speak for themselves.
Over 2.2 million cases are currently pending before courts across the country, including about 55,941 in the Supreme Court alone, despite the increase in the number of judges to 24.
These figures are not abstract; they represent disputes suspended in time. Delay in adjudication is not merely a by-product of docket congestion or lower-level inefficiencies but a deeper, structural challenge of judicial governance, Justice Shah said. The judiciary, as a matter of institutional policy and constitutional responsibility, must urgently move toward a modern, responsive, and intelligent case management framework.
The judgement noted that judicial systems worldwide have shown that delay is not an intractable inevitability but a solvable institutional challenge. Countries such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Estonia, Canada, China, Denmark, and Australia have implemented reforms combining technology, structural innovation, and procedural discipline to reduce backlog and improve efficiency.
Through tools such as e-filing, real-time dashboards, automated scheduling, and transparent digital oversight, these jurisdictions have evolved from passive custodians of dockets to active managers of justice delivery, the judgement said.
 
 

These international experiences underscore a basic truth: delays in justice are not inevitable; they are the product of institutional design and can be remedied with vision, planning, and resolve, it added.
Pakistan’s judiciary must draw upon these global lessons and commit to transformative reforms integrating technological innovation, administrative restructuring, and disciplined case management, so that courts become engines of timely, transparent, and citizen-focused justice, Justice Shah observed.

A two-judge bench of BHC, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Sardar Ahmad Halimi, issued the directives while hearing a petition challenging the government’s shutdown orders.
The petition was filed by Khair Muhammad Shaheen, chairman of the Balochistan Consumer Civil Society.
The Additional Chief Secretary for Home Muhammad Hamza Shafqat informed the court that public transport services were temporarily suspended.
The court found this justification for halting public transport services to be unreasonable and ordered the immediate withdrawal of the suspension order.
 
 

Regarding the mobile network shutdown, scheduled to last until Aug 31, the court instructed the government to reconsider its province-wide ban. The bench directed officials to restore services in all areas where specific security threats do not exist.
During the hearing, additional chief Secretary (home) and Advo­cate General (AG) Adnan Basharat acknowledged that security threats were concentrated in certain areas, not the entire province.
The hearing was adjourned until Aug 21.

• HRCP calls for strict action on hate speech
LAHORE: Dijikot police have registered two cases against 300 people on terrorism charges for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad, on the eve of Independence Day.
As many as 47 men were nominated, while 300 others remain unidentified in both cases. The cases were registered under Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and sections 295, 425, 446, 380, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
According to the FIRs, Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. The attackers gathered outside one of the larger Ahmadi worship places and pelted it with bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured.
The mob, under the cover of Independence Day processions, delivered hate speeches and incited violence against the Ahmadiyya community. At 275-Kartarpur, they targeted two Ahmadi worship places, tearing down the minarets and completely setting on them ablaze. These worship places had been built before 1984.
The attackers also targeted nearby Ahmadi homes, hurling stones that shattered windows and terrified families, injuring several residents.
Ahmadiyya community spokesperson Aamir Mahmood condemned the attacks, stating that community members had been celebrating Independence Day when the mob struck. “This is not the freedom Pakistan’s founders envisioned. Until those who commit such acts face justice, intolerance will grow. Authorities must act swiftly to protect all citizens,” he said.
He demanded strict action against the people involved in the attack and called for adequate protection for the Ahmadiyya community.
Faisalabad City Police Officer Sah­ibzada Bilal Omer was not available for comment.
 
 

However, another police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that 25 people had been arrested in the case and efforts were underway to arrest the rest.
The police official did not reveal the names of the arrested persons and confirm whether they were among the nominated suspects.
Just a day ago,  the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had deplored the recent derogatory remarks made by a cleric against places of worship belonging to non-Muslim communities, including Christians.
“We urge the state to ensure accountability for hate speech in all its forms by implementing the 2014 Supreme Court judgement and call on civil society to reject narratives that endanger peaceful coexistence and equal citizenship,” the statement concluded.

Addressing the main event held to mark Independence Day, which, for some undisclosed reason, was organised on the eve of Aug 14, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif invited “all” political parties to become part of the Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan, or the compact for Pakistan’s stability.
 
 

The latest in a series of ‘compacts’ sought by the political class, this agreement, according to the prime minister, would let the world know that “[political] differences have their own place but we are all one for the sake of our beloved Pakistan”. The prime minister wished for the country to move on from political divisions, leave aside personal interests and reject empty slogans to “adopt collective thinking for Pakistan”. These were noble thoughts, befitting an auspicious occasion.
If only the prime minister had not followed up with a thinly veiled diatribe against “fitnas” who “riot and vandalise” to “defame and curse and rebel against the state”. It seemed that the prime minister made an attempt to muster up magnanimity, but failed.
Two days earlier, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq set a much better example. In an attempt to mollify the opposition, which had been prepared to boycott another sitting of the National Assembly, the Speaker offered to facilitate talks between the government and the opposition.
To demonstrate good faith, he even nominated Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and PPP MNA Syed Naveed Qamar to the government team that would engage with the opposition. Stressing that dialogue was the only way to resolve political differences and bridge the divide between the two camps, he urged the opposition to continue engaging with the government on issues that mattered. To his credit, the law minister, too, echoed the Speaker’s words.
 
 

Meanwhile, the PTI had a rethink about its plans to turn Aug 14 into another day of protest. The party chairman, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, announced on Tuesday that the PTI would eschew its planned agitation in favour of celebrating the day of independence.
Though the announcement got lost somewhere in the noise, it marked a significant shift in the party’s narrative. The question naturally arises: why did the PTI forego a good occasion to make some fuss and decide to de-escalate instead?
There have been some rumblings about the impatience of influential quarters to see a political compromise being worked out. One can only hope the political class has realised it has been skating on thin ice. Civilians are, after all, civilians — quickly swept aside once they have served their purpose. It would be prudent, in such circumstances, for them to band together. Perhaps they should make a greater effort to come to a mutual understanding.

ACTIVISTS protest during the final day of negotiations on a global treaty on plastic pollution, at the United Nations offices in Geneva.—AFP

KARACHI: The 10-day negotiations towards a legally binding agreement to tackle global plastic pollution fell apart on Friday, a couple of days after the first draft of the treaty was rejected by 80 countries.
The new iteration, which was to be shared on Thursday, was adjourned in 43 seconds. It took another 16 hours for the plenary to be reconvened.
Talks chair Luis Vayas Valdivieso said the session had merely been adjourned rather than ended.
He told AFP that countries and the secretariat “will be working to try to find a date and also a place” for resuming the talks.
However, the process was a shambles, with many delegates being excluded from the final plenary.

Talks break down after most countries reject initial draft; Musadik Malik says text offers no clarity on financing or access to tech

“We remained outside the convention centre well after past midnight on Thursday, expecting the final plenary to take place, only to be told it would reconvene the following morning, without any indication of time.
Then suddenly, they rushed it through at 6am on Friday“ Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik told Dawn from Geneva.
He called the uncertainty deliberate; “it was designed so no one had time to read the revised text, reflect on it and analyse it properly.”
As negotiators took the floor, the room echoed with familiar rhetoric and recycled talking points.
 






Despite expressions of disappointment over unmet ambitions and underwhelming outcomes, there was broad consensus on one thing: plastic pollution remains a grave and escalating threat to both people and the planet.
The High Ambition Coalition, which includes the European Union, Britain and Canada, and many African and Latin American countries, wanted to see language on reducing plastic production and the phasing out of toxic chemicals used in plastics.
The cluster of mostly oil-producing states calling themselves the Like-Minded Group — including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia, Iran, and Malaysia — want a much narrower remit.
Hopeful
Still, many remained hopeful. Vietnam was heard saying: “It’s (the treaty) within our grasp”, while Sri Lanka found the new text “an improvement” from the one shared a day earlier.
Madagascar said countries needed to act “boldly and with strong political will” as did Tunisia calling for a more “courageous decision” from the countries.
But there were some who were brave enough to openly reject the second iteration too.
“We’ve been ignored in the treaty,” said the delegate from Paraguay, speaking on behalf of the land-locked developing countries (LLDCs).
She asserted that measuring them with the same yardstick as the plastic polluters was a “tremendous injustice” as they polluted the oceans the least, and announced her bloc was “rejecting” the second iteration of the treaty.
 


Pakistan criticised the process, finding it lacking transparency.
“There was a general sense among developing nations, including us, that they were sidelined. There was no clarity on financing nor on whether polluters would grant us access to technology. To me, even the language implied ‘you’re on your own’,” Dr Malik said of the earlier version that was shared by the organisers on Wednesday and quickly taken back.
“We were willing to meet them halfway, even take a few steps back to find common ground,” he said.
Break Free From Plastic, a global coalition of over 13,000 groups and individuals, said the talks had been “captured by the petrochemical industry.”
Despite the concerns raised by various developing nations, calling for stricter controls on plastic waste, progress remained elusive.
Subsequently, Friday’s meeting also ended without a clear agreement on the path forward.
For Dharmesh Shah — consulting senior campaigner on the Plastics Treaty at the Centre for International Environmental Law — it felt like “Busan all over again” having witnessed all the five previous rounds of negotiations.
“Better to continue talking than to go home with a bad agreement in hand,” he told Dawn over the phone from Geneva.

• Palestinian leaders oppose Tel Aviv ‘plan’ to relocate people from Gaza to South Sudan
• At least 23 dead in fresh Israeli strikes; number of aid-seekers killed since May at 1,760
ISLAMABAD / JERU­SALEM: Pakis­tan condemned Israeli statements that suggest the creation of a so-called ‘Greater Israel’ and a plan for the forced displacement of Pales­tinians, as the UN human rights office described new Israeli settlement expansion scheme as “a war crime”.
Foreign Office spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan, in a strongly worded statement on Friday, said that such rhetoric was a “blatant violation of international law, the UN Charter, and relevant United Nations resolution”.
The reaction came a day after Israeli far-right Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that work would start on a long-delayed settlement that would  divide the occupied West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, a move his  office said would  “bury” the idea of a Palestinian state.
Israel has long had ambitions to build on  the sensitive parcel of land east of Jerusalem known as E1, but the  plan has been frozen for decades amid international opposition.
Israeli settlements in the West Bank are  considered illegal under international law, while critics and the  international community have warned construction on the roughly 12  square kilometres would undermine hopes for a contiguous future  Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital.
In his statement, the FO spokesperson urged the international community to “outrightly reject these provocative” notions, warning that the actions were aimed at entrenching Israel’s illegal occupation and undermining peace efforts.
“These statements demonstrate the occupying power’s complete contempt for international efforts and reveal its intention to escalate instability in the region,” Mr Khan said.
He reiterated Pakistan’s support for a viable Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
 






‘War crime’
Separately on Friday, the UN human rights office said the Israeli plan to build thousands of new homes in the West Bank was illegal under international law and would put nearby Palestinians at risk of forced eviction, which it described as a ‘war crime’.
 
 

A UN rights office spokesperson said the plan would break the West Bank into isolated enclaves and that it is “a war crime for an occupying power to transfer its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”.
Most world powers say settlement expansion erodes the viability of a two-state solution. The plan envisages a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
Israel cites historical and biblical ties to the area and says the settlements provide security, viewing the West Bank as “disputed” rather than “occu­pied”. About 700­,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.7 million Pale­stinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Sudan settlement
Meanwhile, Reuters reported on Friday that South Sudan and Israel were discussing a deal to resettle Palestinians from war-torn Gaza in the troubled African nation, a plan that was quickly dismissed as unacceptable by Palestinian leaders.
Although no agreement had been reached, but talks between South Sudan and Israel were ongoing.
The plan, if carried further, would envisage people moving from an  enclave shattered by almost two years of war with Israel to a nation in the heart of Africa riven by years of political and ethnically-driven violence.
But the account appeared to contradict South Sudan’s foreign ministry which on Wednesday dismissed earlier reports on the plan as  “baseless”.
Arab and world leaders have rejected the idea of moving Gaza’s  population to any country. Palestinians say that would be like another   “Nakba” (catastrophe) when hundreds of thousands fled or were forced out during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948.
Gaza death toll rises
The UN human rights office said on Friday that at least 1,760 Palestinians had been killed while seeking aid since late May.
That marks a jump of several hundred from the 1,373 deaths it reported at the beginning of August.
“Since May 27, and as of August 13, we have recorded that at least 1,760 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid,” the agency’s office for the Palestinian territories said. It stated that most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.
Also on Friday, Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 23 people were killed by Israeli fire, including 12 who were waiting for humanitarian aid. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.

Raja Farrukh Qudoos, tehsildar of Patikka, was among the officials supervising the rescue and recovery operation in Nariyah Behak, part of Sarli Sacha village northwest of Muzaffarabad, where a cloudburst-induced flood in Jhugiyan Nullah had smashed around four houses on Thursday.
While occupants of other nearby houses had moved to lower areas a few days earlier, one house was still inhabited by a six-member family along with a guest.
According to Mr Qudoos, the guest managed to escape with fractures, but the family, comprising Muhammad Naveed, his wife, and their four children, was buried alive.

Hundreds of tourists stranded in Neelum Valley after Ratti Galli access severed

The rescue operation, suspended on Thursday evening due to heavy rain, resumed at dawn. Five bodies were recovered around 3:30am, Mr Qudoos said, while the body of the eldest daughter was found about 150 feet from the initial site at around 8:30am.

Giving an overview of the damage in Muzaffarabad, Saeed Qureshi, director operations at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), said a total of nine people had lost their lives across AJK — six in Muzaffarabad and one each in Jhelum Valley, Sudhnoti and Bagh districts. Four others were injured.
He added that 31 houses and 23 shops had been destroyed, while 23 more houses suffered partial damage. Infrastructure losses included two schools, 12 water mills, one main bridge and four pedestrian bridges, one mosque, four motorcycles, one car, a service station, five cattle sheds, and six electricity poles.
In Neelum Valley, more than 700 tourists — mostly women and children — and over 90 vehicles were stranded at the base camp of Ratti Galli lake on Thursday after rains and flooding damaged around one and a half kilometre portion of the already treacherous road.
 






AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed, who was present at the base camp, stayed overnight to reassure the tourists, announcing they would not be charged for meals or accommodation until their safe evacuation.
According to Akhtar Ayoub, district disaster management officer in Neelum Valley, the rescue operation began at 7am on Friday, and by afternoon, almost all stranded tourists were safely evacuated from the Ratti Galli base camp to Dawarian along the main Neelum Valley road.
The operation was jointly carried out by Rescue 1122, tourist police, traffic police, regular police, Pakistan Army personnel, and officials from the highways department, he said.
Video clips shared on social media showed rescue workers carrying children in their arms and guiding adults by hand across the raging torrent over hastily installed wooden planks.
“We are grateful to the people and government of Azad Kashmir. I am truly at a loss for words to express my gratitude for the way they have helped us,” one tourist said in one of the clips.
Mr Qureshi said that except for the Muzaffarabad-Mansehra Road, all other main roads across AJK were open for all types of traffic.

• Two excise officials targeted near Dera-Daraban bypass
PESHAWAR: Five people, including two personnel from the paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and two Excise Department officials, were martyred, while three militants were killed in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, official sources said.
Counter-Terrorism Department officials said their team ambushed a group of militants affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in an intelligence-based operation carried out in Regi Lalma, on the outskirts of the provincial capital, on Thursday night.
They said the CTD had been tracking the group, which was involved in 18 different attacks on police and citizens. These attacks took place along Peshawar’s northern border with Mohmand district, southern border with Kohat district, eastern border with Khyber district and western border with Nowshera district.
The ambush was based on technical surveillance, the officials said, adding that the militants’ identities were verified.
 
 

The officials said the group was planning an attack on the border between Peshawar and Khyber districts, adding that the militants opened indiscriminate fire when intercepted by a SWAT team. In the battle, CTD gunned down three militants while four others fled.
The officials said one of the killed militants was identified as Abdullah, alias Jawad, an Afghan national, confirmed through his Afghan citizenship card recovered from him. He was a wanted militant, while the identities of the other two are being determined.
The officials said technical investigations linked the group to at least 18 militant attacks in Peshawar. “Preliminary intelligence confirms the militants were part of a banned TTP-linked cell operating under foreign-based, foreign-funded handlers, with active plans to escalate attacks on security forces, public infrastructure, and pro-state individuals,” the officials said.
FC men martyred
In Lakki Marwat, two FC personnel and a civilian were martyred when three armed men targeted an FC official and his brother while they were returning home from a hotel on the Indus Highway in the Wanda Karim Khan area.
The FC official’s brother, Ihsanullah, initially survived but later succumbed to his injuries. He told police that his brother had returned to the village on leave a week ago and that they were walking home when armed men suddenly attacked them with assault rifles.
 
 

“We were injured and fell to the ground while the assailants fled,” he said, adding that his brother died upon reaching the hospital.
Police said another FC official also died in the attack, and his body was taken by relatives from the crime scene.
Police registered a case under relevant sections of law at Shaheed Haibat Ali Khan police station in Darra Pezu and launched an investigation.
Excise team targeted
In another militant attack in Dera Ismail Khan, two Excise Department officials were slain, and a hotel owner injured, when unidentified assailants opened fire near Hashim Hotel on the Dera-Daraban bypass on Friday.
According to police, excise and taxation officer Faridullah Khan reported that ASI Syed Ali Shah of the Excise Police Station South Region, along with volunteer Abideen, son of Amir Muhammad Banuchi from Bannu, had left for duty in an official vehicle.
While stopping at Hashim Hotel for breakfast and waiting for other staff, two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire. The ASI and volunteer died on the spot. The hotel owner, Hashim, 47, of Bhakkar, sustained injuries.
Police termed the incident an act of terror and said it was part of a recent wave of targeted assaults on law enforcement personnel. The area was cordoned off, and a search operation was launched to trace the assailants.

Hirschman (The Strategy of Economic Development, 1958).
ON Pakistan’s 78th independence anniversary, we have to ask ourselves a sobering question — why is the country that was born on the wings of hope, between promise and peril, and seemingly prospered for decades, in its current dismal state? Why are its human, social and economic development indicators competing with Afghanistan and sub-Saharan Africa? Why have numerous promised ‘game changers’ over the decades, from CENTO and SEATO membership to CPEC and SIFC, failed to deliver for the people? 
The answer is simple as much as it is uncomfortable. Pakistan is not organised as a polity for development, let alone inclusive development. It is organised for elite extraction, appropriation, expropriation and enrichment. And the two models are not just incompatible, they are mutually exclusive. 
A society is organised for development when its laws, institutions, cultural norms and incentives are deliberately structured to expand opportunity, raise productivity and channel resources towards the most optimal use for the widest common good. Economies that have successfully climbed the ladder of development, at least over the past five decades, display common characteristics. These include an emphasis on human capital development, high savings and investment rates, an equitable and non-discriminatory tax regime, responsible governance, high levels of transparency and accountability, institutional checks and balances against executive overreach as well as policy and regulatory capture. 

Pakistan’s current organising principle as a polity is incompatible with development.

This is in sharp contrast to how Pakistan has been configured as a polity. To adapt Lant Pritchett et al’s quote, countries such as Pakistan “look like a state” but do not exhibit the foundational characteristics.  
Pakistan has a Constitution but one that fails to restrain, to provide checks and balances; it has ‘law of the land’ without rule of law; governments without governance; buildings without institutions; projects without purpose; spending without impact; civil service without service; security agencies without security. Like many other Third World countries, Pakistan has been organised as a neocolonial project with local elites installed on behalf of former colonial powers. Two natural corollaries of elite capture are weakened institutional checks and balances, and extraction. 
The wages of extraction are evident in how the two broad groups of society — the elites versus the non-elites — have done over the course of Pakistan’s existence. The current state of these two broad segments are in stark contrast. The lived experience of ordinary Pakistanis is one of grinding poverty, unemployment, unpayable bills and taxes, state repression and waiting in endless queues to leave the country. 
On the other hand, the general elite as a broad cohort has never had it better. With over $17 billion of privileges accumulating to the elites each year via tax exemptions, concessions, land grants, budgetary allocations, etc, and an estimated siphoning off of around 30-40 per cent from public procurement and development budgets, an estimated annual capital flight of well over $10bn takes place. This has allowed ruling elites to accumulate vast offshore assets, as revealed in the various investigative leaks such as the Panama and Pandora Papers. 
Neither of the two realities and daily lived experiences is an ‘accident’. It is by design and a result of deliberate policy choices. The process of marginalisation, income and wealth redistribution and extraction via public policy has accelerated from 2008 onwards. Powerful social, economic and political groups such as political families, the military, landed and business elites and bureaucrats have begun to monopolise public resources, and shape policy to favour themselves, away from ordinary citizens at large.
This widening divergence between ordinary, disconnected Pakistanis and the wealth accumulation of the connected elite coincides with the use of public policy as a tool for extraction and redistribution from the bottom to the top. Two areas where public policy has made possible the largest transfer of resources in Pakistan’s history, and mortally damaged the economy, are IPPs and sugar. (Land allocation is a third area). 
The scale of the wealth transfer is staggering. As a crude indication, around 33 IPPs received contractual capacity payments of Rs8.3 trillion between 2014 and 2024, according to disclosure by the Power Division. According to the 2020 GoP inquiry report, the return on equity of a majority of the IPPs set up under the various power policies ranged from 40pc to 87pc in rupee terms. Against an initial investment of Rs110bn, IPPs set up under the 1994 and 2002 power policies alone earned net profits of Rs618bn. Investment payback periods of projects reviewed by the committee ranged from one to six years.
In the case of sugar, manipulation of data as well as government policy has regularly handed 90 millers, across the political spectrum, hundreds of billions of rupees in unearned rents. The rentier economy around sugar has destroyed Pakistan’s cotton economy, the mainstay of the country’s exports. And yet it continues unchecked.
Vested interests have begun employing the same template in wheat to earn enormous rents at the expense of the country’s 11.7 million farmers. More is in the pipeline, from rare earths and minerals extraction in KP, canals in Cholistan, and a crypto misadventure. Fire sales of state assets such as ports, airports and other vital infrastructure are also on the cards. This is institutionalised extraction. Institutions, budgets, laws, policies, markets and regulations have been increasingly structured around securing perpetual rents and privileges for the elites. 
In short, Pakistan is not organised for development. A self-interested ruling elite lacking ‘skin in the game’ with little or no incentives to develop the country has rigged the system for extraction. In its current configuration, Pakistan is set up as a system of spoils for this elite. Without a fundamental rethink and reformation of the state, no amount of copper and gold or rare earth mineral finds will secure Pakistan’s future.

The minister stated this during a meeting with Engro Fertilisers Chief Executive Officer Ali Rathore on Friday.
The discussion centred on guaranteeing consistent fertiliser supply nationwide, stabilising prices for farmers, and introducing forward-looking measures to strengthen the agriculture sector’s resilience.
Mr Hussain stressed that timely and affordable access to fertiliser is not merely a commercial matter but a critical pillar of Pakistan’s food security and economic stability.
He reaffirmed the government’s determination to protect farmers from market manipulation by eliminating hoarding, curbing black marketing, and enforcing strict adherence to national quality standards.
He emphasised that any disruption in the supply of fertiliser directly impacts crop yields and can jeopardise the livelihoods of millions of farming households.
The minister urged Engro Fertilisers to expand its distribution network, particularly in remote rural areas, and to align supply schedules with the agricultural calendar to avoid shortages during peak sowing periods. 
He also highlighted the importance of innovation in delivery systems, including farmer facilitation centres and mobile supply networks, so that small-scale farmers have equal access to quality inputs.

Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
A notification from the Finance Division, available with Dawn.com, stated that the new price of HSD was Rs272.99, while petrol would remain at Rs264.61. Additionally, the prices of superior kerosene oil and light diesel oil were slashed by Rs7.19 per litre and Rs8.2, respectively.
“The Government has decided to revise the petroleum product prices for the fortnight commencing August 16, 2025, in line with the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the concerned ministries,” the notification read.
Earlier this week, the per-litre HSD price was expected to fall by about Rs11.50, while petrol was expected to see an increase of Rs1.40 per litre for the next fortnight, driven by shifts in the global market and exchange rate movements.
International petrol prices inched up by 15 cents per barrel over the past fortnight, while diesel rates fell by about $4.5 per barrel. The rupee also appreciated slightly against the dollar.
On July 31, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif approved a cut in the prices of petrol by Rs6.17 per litre and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs10.86, respectively, for the next fortnight. The cuts in petrol and HSD prices were higher than previously estimated.
Petrol, used mainly in private cars, small vehicles, rickshaws and motorcycles, directly impacts the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-income groups.</p><small>2025-08-15 19:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619020-pakistan-seeks-friendly-relations-with-afghanistan-kp-governor-kundi' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks friendly relations with Afghanistan: KP Governor Kundi</strong></a><br><p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was not invited to the talks, and his European allies fear Trump might sell out Ukraine by essentially freezing the conflict and recognising — if only informally — Russian control over one fifth of Ukraine.
Trump sought to assuage such concerns as he boarded Air Force One, saying he would let Ukraine decide on any possible territorial swaps. “I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine, I’m here to get them to a table,” he said.
Asked what would make the meeting a success, he told reporters: “I want to see a ceasefire rapidly… I’m not going to be happy if it’s not today… I want the killing to stop.”
The US and Russian presidents are due to meet at a Cold War-era air force base in Alaska’s largest city at around 11am (12am PKT) for their first face-to-face talks since Trump returned to the White House.
Trump hopes a truce in the 3-1/2-year-old war will bolster his credentials as a global peacemaker worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize.
For Putin, the summit is already a big win that he can portray as evidence that years of Western attempts to isolate Russia have unravelled and that Moscow is retaking its rightful place at the top table of international diplomacy.
Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev described the pre-summit mood as “combative” and said the two leaders would discuss not only Ukraine but the full spectrum of bilateral relations, Russia’s RIA news agency reported.
Trump, who once said he would end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24 hours, conceded on Thursday it had proven a tougher task than he had expected. He said that if Friday’s talks went well, quickly arranging a second, three-way summit with Zelensky would be even more important than his encounter with Putin.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a three-way summit would be possible if the Alaska talks bore fruit, Interfax news agency reported. Peskov also said Friday’s talks could last 6-7 hours and that aides would take part in what had been expected to be one-to-one meetings.
Zelensky said the summit should open the way for a “just peace” and three-way talks that included him, but added that Russia was continuing to wage war on Friday. A Russian ballistic missile earlier struck Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, killing one person and wounding another.
“It’s time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,” Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
‘Smart guy’
The Kremlin said Putin would arrive in Alaska at 11am (12am PKT)  and would be met at his plane by Trump.
“He is a smart guy, been doing it for a long time, but so have I… We get along, there’s a good respect level on both sides,” Trump said of Putin. He also welcomed Putin’s decision to bring a lot of businesspeople with him to Alaska.
“But they’re not doing business until we get the war settled,” he said, repeating a threat of “economically severe” consequences for Russia if the summit goes badly.
One source acquainted with Kremlin thinking said there were signs that Moscow could be ready to strike a compromise on Ukraine, given that Putin understood Russia’s economic vulnerability and the  costs of continuing the war.
Reuters has previously reported that Putin might be willing to freeze the conflict along the front lines, provided there was a legally binding pledge not to enlarge NATO eastwards and to lift some Western sanctions. NATO has said that Ukraine’s future is in the alliance.
Russia, whose war economy is showing signs of strain, is vulnerable to further US sanctions — and Trump has threatened tariffs on buyers of Russian crude, primarily China and India.
“For Putin, economic problems are secondary to goals, but he understands our vulnerability and costs,” the Russian source said.
Putin this week held out the prospect of something else he knows Trump wants — a new nuclear arms control accord to replace the last surviving one, which is due to expire next February.
Common ground?
The source familiar with Kremlin thinking said it looked as if the two sides had been able to find some common ground.
“Apparently, some terms will be agreed upon… because Trump cannot be refused, and we are not in a position to refuse (due to sanctions pressure),” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity.
Putin has said he is open to a full ceasefire but that issues of verification must first be sorted out. One compromise could be a truce in the air war.
Zelensky has ruled out formally handing Moscow any territory and is also seeking a security guarantee backed by the United States. It is unclear how that guarantee could work.
Ukrainians who spoke to Reuters in central Kyiv on Friday were not optimistic about the summit.
“Nothing good will happen there, because war is war; it will not end. The territories — we’re not going to give anything to anyone,” said Tetiana Harkavenko, a 65-year-old cleaner.</p><small>2025-08-15 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619016-us-uk-france-mourn-lives-lost-in-northern-pakistans-deadly-flash-floods' target='_blank'><strong>US, UK, France mourn lives lost in northern Pakistan's deadly flash floods</strong></a><br><p>

At least 198 people lost their lives and several remained missing as flash floods wreaked havoc across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
 






“The prime minister directed the NDMA to continue its cooperation with the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the PDMA, to provide them with all possible support in the rescue and relief operation and to utilise all resources for this,” a statement issued by the prime minister’s office read.
NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik briefed the prime minister on the damage caused by cloudbursts, flash floods in the upper parts of the country, as well as the rescue and relief operation.
The prime minister directed the NDMA chairman to further coordinate with the KP provincial government for rescue and relief activities.
“Tents, medicines, food items and other relief materials should be delivered to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government immediately,” the prime minister directed.
The premier further ordered that relief materials should be sent through trucks on a priority basis immediately.
“People and tourists stranded in the flood-affected areas should be immediately taken to safe places.”
The prime minister was briefed on the progress of the rescue and relief operation, along with the assessment of the damage, during the meeting.
PM Shehbaz also had a telephone conversation with KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and expressed grief over the loss of precious lives due to the recent cloudburst and flash floods in KP. He told Gandapur that the federal government will provide all possible assistance to the provincial government.
The prime minister also held a telephone conversation with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
“Our sympathies are with the victims in this hour of difficulty,” the prime minister said.
Since late June, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country — especially KP and northern regions — by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Yesterday, over a dozen people were killed as rains and flooding ripped through the country’s northern parts, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
In Muzaffarabad, a massive landslide in Sarli Sacha village hit a home, leaving six members of a family buried and feared dead. Torrential rains claimed the lives of two more women in AJK’s Bagh and Sudhnoti districts.
In GB, flash floods killed at least eight people, with two still missing in the Ghizer district, while also devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.
Similarly, a spell of heavy downpour lashed various parts of Abbottabad district yesterday, triggering flash floods that severely disrupted traffic flow and caused damage to infrastructure.
At least 507 people, including 159 children, have died and 768 others have been injured since June 26 in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan, according to daily data from the NDMA.</p><small>2025-08-15 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618986-are-more-showers-expected-in-kp-upper-parts' target='_blank'><strong>Are more showers expected in KP, upper parts?</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has begun deporting documented Afghan refugees ahead of a September 1 deadline, a move the United Nations warns could force more than one million to leave.
The decision followed the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
A letter from the interior ministry, dated August 4, was sent to the chief secretaries and police chiefs of the four provinces, as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, detailing the implementation of the ongoing Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
Among those at risk are more than 2,000 Afghans approved for relocation to Germany under programmes for people deemed vulnerable under Taliban rule in Afghanistan.
The relocations have been put on hold, pending a review by Germany’s new conservative-led government as it tries to deliver on its election promise to curb migration.
Refugee group PRO ASYL and the Patenschaftsnetzwerk Ortskraefte, a non-profit supporting former local staff who worked for Germany, filed a criminal complaint with Berlin prosecutors against Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt.
By allowing Pakistan to deport Afghans already accepted into German resettlement programmes, they said, the ministers had committed “abandonment” and “failure to render assistance” to people at risk under Section 221 of the Criminal Code.
They said more than 400 people approved for relocation to Germany had been arrested in Pakistan in recent weeks and 34 people had already been deported. Deportees face grave risks under Taliban rule, including imprisonment, mistreatment or execution, the groups said.
Victoria Lies, a lawyer who represents several of those affected, said some of her clients had been separated from their families, and in one case, a girl had been sent back to Afghanistan alone.
The foreign and interior ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.
However, Wadephul said on Friday his ministry was in “high-level contact with the Pakistani government to ensure the protection of these people and to provide rapid assistance to those who have been deported or arrested in recent days”.
The interior ministry has said it cannot provide a timeline to determine the future of the admission programme but expects decisions soon.
The two NGOs’ complaint builds on a July 8 legal opinion commissioned by them, which said German officials could be criminally liable if they fail to prevent the deportations.
It adds to more than 80 lawsuits by affected Afghans seeking German government approval for their visas, with courts siding with them in some cases, though the interior ministry has appealed those rulings.</p><small>2025-08-15 12:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/15164201d0a9b53.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931054/us-pakistan-counterterrorism-talks-will-help-formulate-joint-action-plan-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>US-Pakistan counterterrorism talks will help formulate joint action plan: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Friday said that counterterrorism dialogue between Pakistan and the United States will help in formulating a joint action plan amid strengthening ties between the two countries.
According to a statement by the interior ministry today, Naqvi met with US Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Gregory LoGerfo. Both officials discussed bilateral relations and agreeed to increase cooperation in various fields, including counterterrorism, border security and counter-narcotics,
“The counterterrorism dialogue will help in formulating a joint action plan,” the statement quoted Naqvi as saying during the meeting. The minister hoped for “positive results of Pak-US cooperation in eliminating terrorism”.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, Acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker and the federal interior secretary were also present on the occasion, it added.
“There has been an extraordinary improvement in Pak-US relations after the coming to power of President Donald Trump,” Naqvi said.
He praised US President Donald Trump’s efforts for world peace and stated, “The elements of transparency, mutual trust and cooperation are prominent in Pak-US relations.”
“This is a great opportunity to promote mutual relations in every field,” he added.
The interior minister also welcomed the recent US decision to designate the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army and the Majeed Brigade as global terrorist organisations, terming the development as a “good step”.
The statement said that LoGerfo expressed condolences over the loss of lives in terrorist attacks and quoted him as saying: “Pakistan is a very important country in geo-strategic terms.”
On Tuesday, the US said that it was committed to combat terrorism in all its forms with Pakistan, as UN Special Secretary Ambassador Nabeel Munir and LoGerfo co-chaired the US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue.¶
The last US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue was held in May 2024, where both countries reaffirmed the continuation of counterterrorism cooperation to advance regional and global security and stability.
Last week, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir completed a visit to the US, terming the trip — the second in just one-and-a-half months — a “new dimension” in ties between both nations. He also visited the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with US President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have an official face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
The two had discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their “cordial” meeting in Washington. During the meeting, Trump had “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”.</p><small>2025-08-15 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618953-pakistans-nuclear-programme-meant-solely-for-defence-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's nuclear programme meant solely for defence: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>
