The upper house of India’s parliament has asked airport operators, air traffic controllers and airlines including Air India and IndiGo INGL.NS to take part in a comprehensive review of passenger safety, according to a memo drafted for the meeting and seen by Reuters.
The gathering comes after the June 12 Air India disaster that killed 260 people, including 241 on board, when a Boeing BA.N 787-8 jet crashed within a minute of take-off from India’s Ahmedabad. Investigators are still probing what caused the world’s worst aviation accident in a decade.
Though the memo did not mention the crash, R K Chaudhary, a lawmaker on the panel, told Reuters that it planned to discuss the matter internally and during the meeting.
 
 

“If we will not raise questions on it, they (airlines) will not become vigilant about these issues,” he said.
The Indian government has said data from the front recorder of the crashed plane was accessed by a team led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, with the US National Transportation Safety Board.
Air India has been getting warning notices for compliance lapses in recent days.
India’s aviation watchdog last month warned the airline over “repeated and serious violations” related to pilot duty scheduling. It has also warned Air India for breaching safety rules after three of its Airbus AIR.PA planes flew despite being overdue checks on escape slides.</p><small>2025-07-01 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01205650329412c.jpg?r=205926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921460/kazakhstan-bans-face-coverings-in-public-places' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakhstan bans face coverings in public places</strong></a><br><p>Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed a law on Monday prohibiting individuals from wearing clothing in public places that covers their faces, joining a trend in several Central Asian countries to restrict forms of Islamic dress.
The text of the law says clothing that “interferes with facial recognition” will be banned in public, with exemptions for medical purposes, in adverse weather conditions and at sporting and cultural events.
The legislation, one in a series of wider amendments signed into law on Monday, does not explicitly mention religion or types of religious dress.
Tokayev has previously praised the legislation as an opportunity to celebrate ethnic identity in Kazakhstan, a majority-Muslim country and former Soviet republic.
“Rather than wearing face-concealing black robes, it’s much better to wear clothes in the national style,” he was quoted by Kazakh media as saying earlier this year.
“Our national clothes vividly emphasise our ethnic identity, so we need to popularise them comprehensively.”
Other Central Asian countries have introduced similar laws in recent years.
Police in Kyrgyzstan have conducted street patrols to enforce their ban on the niqab face veil, according to local media reports. In Uzbekistan, violating the niqab statute carries a fine of over $250. Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon signed a ban on wearing clothing in public that is “alien to national culture”.</p><small>2025-07-01 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01203847c201aa9.jpg?r=203856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921459/barbora-krejcikova-gets-title-defence-off-to-stuttering-start' target='_blank'><strong>Barbora Krejcikova gets title defence off to stuttering start</strong></a><br><p>Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova survived a stiff examination from promising 20-year-old Filipina Alexandra Eala before finding her groove to triumph 3-6 6-2 6-1 on her return to Wimbledon’s Centre Court on Tuesday.
Czech Krejcikova, a shock winner as 31st seed last year and seeded 17th this time, came into the tournament short on form after a succession of injuries and initially had no answer to the confident, free-swinging Eala, who is the first woman from the Philippines to play at Wimbledon.
Eala turned 20 in May and was making her first Wimbledon appearance, but she immediately looked at home in the daunting surroundings of the sport’s most iconic court.
Krejcikova forced the first break in the third game; however, Eala hit straight back, swinging her lefty forehand freely and throwing in a beautifully disguised drop shot.
She then upped the ante, holding confidently and breaking again as her two-fisted backhand came to the fore and, from 2-1 down with a break against, Eala reeled off four games in a row.
Krejcikova struggled to find any consistency and was not helped by five first-set double faults and very cautious shot choices.
The champion just about held serve after six deuces, but Eala was not to be denied and served out to take the first set.
Krejcikova looked as if she had had a physical and mental reboot for the second set, where she showed much more energy and found her serving range.
Lightweight serve
With Eala also starting to lose her radar and with her lightweight serve being punished, the champion swept to a 5-0 lead and took the set 6-2.
Krejcikova grabbed an early break in the third with pounding returns, and though Eala had an immediate breakback opportunity, she could not take it and quickly trailed 3-0.
It was relatively straightforward from then, as a tired-looking Eala’s error count rose and Krejcikova raced home in ever-more confident style.
Krejcikova was quick to credit her opponent.
“I mean, what the hell she played in the first set?” she said. “She was smashing the ball and cleaning the lines, so wow, wow. She’s going to be really good in a couple of years.”
Krejcikova said she was “super happy” to even be back to defend her title after a back injury ruled her out of the Australian Open and a thigh problem curtailed her grasscourt build-up.
“Definitely six months ago, I was in a lot of pain with my back, and I didn’t really know how my career was going to go,” she said.
“So I’m super-excited that I can be here and that I can play and that I can play on such a great court.” She said she also took time before the match to inspect the trophy, with her name engraved from last year.
“I was definitely enjoying the moment,” she said. “Having that opportunity, that I can see my name there and that I can see the trophy and that I can just enter such a beautiful court, such a beautiful venue - it’s super, super special.”</p><small>2025-07-01 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011955178f564fa.jpg?r=195555' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921457/saudis-al-hilal-knock-man-city-out-of-club-world-cup-in-huge-shock' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi’s Al Hilal knock Man City out of Club World Cup in huge shock</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal sent English giants Manchester City crashing out of the Club World Cup on Monday, snatching a shock 4-3 victory in extra time in the biggest upset of the tournament so far.
The match finished 2-2 at full-time but at the end of an eventful extra-time Marcos Leonardo grabbed the winner and pulled off one of the greatest wins in Middle Eastern football history.
The Saudi club advances to the quarter-finals where they will face Brazilian club Fluminense, ensuring a non-European team will reach the last four.
City had taken the lead in the ninth minute in controversial fashion, Bernardo Silva finishing after Rayan Ait-Nouri’s cross.
Al Hilal players protested that Ait-Nouri had controlled with his arm in the build-up but the goal stood.
City had plenty of opportunities to extend their lead before the break but a combination of poor finishing and inspired goalkeeping from Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bounou kept the lead at a single goal.
Al Hilal offered several reminders of their threat on the break but City even more chances with Jeremy Doku volleying straight at Bounou, who moments later reacted superbly again to keep out a Bernardo effort.
City punished
The question as to whether City would live to regret not converting those chances was answered within a minute of the resumption.
Former City full-back Joao Cancelo’s low cross was parried out by Ederson, Malcolm pounced but saw his shot blocked by Ruben Dias only for the ball to loop to Marcos Leonardo to head home the equaliser.
Six minutes later and the City’s high defensive line was exposed by a long ball from Cancelo, which Brazilian Malcolm raced on to and he showed power and pace as he broke away before coolly slotting past Ederson.
The Saudi fans in the crowd went wild while Pep Guardiola responded immediately with a triple substitution with midfielder Rodri and defenders Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji introduced.
That brought some much needed stability to a shaky back line but City needed improvement at the other end too and it came, albeit in its scruffy circumstances.
The Al Hilal defence were unable to deal with a Bernardo corner and Erling Haaland pounced to steer home the lose ball and make it 2-2.
City piled on the pressure as they looked for the winner but yet again Bounou proved their nemesis as he denied Akanji and Ruben Dias and even when he was beaten by Haaland, substitute Ali Lajami produced a magnificent goal-line clearance.
Guardiola took off Haaland and introduced Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush as the game went into extra-time.
But for all City’s depth, Al Hilal had a deep well of spirit to draw upon and just four minutes into the opening period, Al Hilal regained the lead when Kalidou Koulibaly rose superbly to meet a Ruben Neves corner with a brilliantly angled header.
City responded with a goal of real quality when Rayan Cherki’s brilliantly floated ball towards the back post was poked home masterfully by Phil Foden, at full stretch and from the tightest of angles.
But incredibly Al Hilal responded again to restore their lead — Sergej Milinkovic-Savic’s header was saved by Ederson but Marcos Leonardo followed in to bundle the ball over the line.
As the celebrating Al Hilal fans poured out of the stadium, the Brazilian striker let his emotions pour out.
“I’ve had a difficult time in the last two months. My mother spent 70 days in the ICU,” he said.
“Today she’s fine, thank God. When I scored those two goals, I thought of her. She was able to watch the match”.
City skipper Bernardo Silva said his team had paid the price for being unable to deal with Al Hilal’s counter-attacking.
“We scored three and could’ve scored five, six. It was all about controlling when we lost the ball, controlling the transitions, don’t let them run, and they ran way too many times,” he said.
“With one, two passes there was always a feeling of danger coming from them. When we allow teams to run like this we always suffer a lot, and today was the case,” he said.
Inter Milan knocked out by Fluminense
Elsewhere, Inter Milan were eliminated by Fluminense on a day of shock results.
Champions League runners-up Inter were dumped out 2-0 by the Brazilian side in Charlotte.
German Cano headed home early on to give Fluminense the lead against Inter Milan and the Brazilian side survived an onslaught from the Serie A team to progress.
Substitute Hercules netted late on to seal their win, while a frustrated Inter hit the woodwork twice through Lautaro Martinez and Federico Dimarco.
The Rio de Janeiro outfit become the second Brazilian side to make the last eight after Palmeiras had already sealed their quarter-final spot.
“We knew they were not going to be easy opponents. Less than a month ago they were playing the Champions League final, but we played really well,” said 40-year-old ‘Flu’ captain Thiago Silva, once of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.
It is the latest victory for a Brazilian team against prestigious European opposition at the tournament in the United States, after Botafogo defeated PSG and Flamengo got the better of Chelsea in the group stage.
“This is a very important victory for our fans, for all of Brazil, for my country, for South America,” said Jhon Arias, the lively Colombian winger who was named man of the match.
Inter, who were thrashed 5-0 by PSG in the Champions League final, appointed Cristian Chivu to replace the departing Inzaghi ahead of the tournament.
They did not fully convince during the group stage despite topping their section and a furious Martinez criticised some of his teammates after the game.
“I want to fight for the major trophies, [so] anyone who wants to stay at Inter, fine, let’s fight, but anyone who doesn’t want to stay can leave,” said Inter’s captain.
“We need players who want to be here. We’re wearing an important shirt … we need a top-level mentality, or please leave.”</p><small>2025-07-01 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611913-pakistans-sweetest-gift-wins-global-hearts-in-abu-dhabi' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's sweetest gift wins global hearts in Abu Dhabi</strong></a><br><p>

Trump’s comments come after Musk, the world’s richest man, a day earlier renewed his criticism of Trump’s sweeping tax-cut and spending bill, vowing to unseat lawmakers who backed it after campaigning on limiting government spending.
“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
“No more rocket launches, satellites, or electric car production, and our country would save a fortune. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this?” he added, referring to the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
“Big money to be saved!!!” Trump wrote in capital letters.
In response to Trump’s post, Musk, on his own social media platform X, said “I am literally saying cut it all. Now.”
 






Trump previously threatened to cut Musk’s government subsidies and contracts when their relationship dissolved into an all-out brawl on social media in early June over the bill, which non-partisan analysts have said would add about $3 trillion to the US debt.
Musk’s businesses include rocket company and government contractor SpaceX, which has about $22 billion in federal contracts, and its satellite unit Starlink.
His rift with Trump also caused volatility for Tesla, with shares of the electric car company losing about $150bn of its market value on June 5, the largest single-day decline in the company’s history, though it has since recovered.
Tesla shares trading in Frankfurt tumbled 5 per cent on Tuesday.
 






After weeks of relative silence following his earlier feud with Trump over the legislation, Musk rejoined the debate on Saturday as the Senate took up the package, calling it “utterly insane and destructive” in a post on X.
 






On Monday, he said lawmakers who had campaigned on cutting spending but backed the bill “should hang their heads in shame!”
“And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,” Musk added.
 






Musk called again for a new political party, saying the bill’s massive spending indicated “that we live in a one-party country — the porky pig party!!”
 






Musk’s criticism marked a dramatic shift after the tech billionaire spent nearly $300 million on Trump’s re-election campaign and led the administration’s controversial DOGE cost-cutting initiative.
Musk has argued that the legislation would greatly increase the national debt and erase the savings he says he achieved through DOGE.
It remains unclear how much sway Musk has over Congress or what effect his opinions might have on the bill’s passage.
But Republicans have expressed concern that his on-again, off-again feud with Trump could hurt their chances to protect their majority in the 2026 midterm congressional elections.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0117062753f9a5f.jpg?r=171529' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921445/militant-attacks-see-slight-decline-in-june-think-tank' target='_blank'><strong>Militant attacks see slight decline in June: think tank</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).
The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.
These attacks injured 189 people, comprising 126 security personnel and 63 civilians — marking an 8 per cent decrease in attacks, a 12pc drop in fatalities, and pc increase in injuries compared to May 2025.
“In response to militant activities, Pakistani security forces intensified counterterrorism operations during the month,” the statement added.
According to Picss, security forces killed 71 militants, while two security personnel and two civilians also lost their lives in operations launched by the state. Additionally, ten militants and five civilians were injured, and 52 suspected militants were arrested during these operations.
The combined death toll from militant violence and security operations in June stood at 175 deaths, including 55 security personnel, 77 militants, 41 civilians, and two peace committee members.
The report noted that over the first half of 2025, Pakistan “experienced a worrying uptick in violence”.
Between January and June, Picss documented 502 militant attacks, which claimed 737 lives — including 284 security personnel, 267 civilians, 180 militants, and six peace committee members — and caused 991 injuries, affecting 492 security personnel, 472 civilians, 26 militants, and one peace committee member.
Compared to the first half of 2024, this represented a 5pc increase in militant attacks, a 121pc surge in fatalities, and an 84pc rise in injuries, it said.
The trend is even more alarming when compared to the last six months of 2024, showing a 17pc increase in attacks, 33pc increase in deaths, and 30pc increase in injuries.
The report noted that during counter-militancy operations conducted in the first six months of 2025, 688 militants were killed and 225 arrested, reflecting the state’s intensified efforts to curb militancy.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01184547d94373a.jpg?r=184706' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921423/jcp-nominates-chief-justices-of-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>JCP nominates chief justices of high courts</strong></a><br><p>The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Tuesday appointed the chief justices to the four high courts, a statement issued by the Supreme Court said.
Per the statement, the JCP held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.
Letters were subsequently issued to the prime minister’s principal secretary, informing the government about the nominations and requesting the forwarding of the same to the president for their appointment.
The letters said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court (BHC), Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court (SHC).
Pre­sident Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday had already formally decla­red Justice Dogar the “senior-most judge” of the IHC, following the issuance of a revised seniority list by the Ministry of Law and Justice.
The development followed a ruling by the Supreme Court on June 19, upholding the constitutionality of transferring three judges from other provincial high courts and referring the matter of seniority determination to the president.
On Friday, five IHC judges had challenged the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the transfer of three judges — Justice Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the SHC, and Justice Muhammad Asif from the BHC.
President Zardari had also declared that the status of the transfer of all three judges would be permanent.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0117095040894e3.jpg?r=174101' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921444/pakistan-calls-for-internal-reform-of-uns-counterterrorism-architecture' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for internal reform of UN’s counterterrorism architecture</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for the internal reform of the UN’s counterterrorism architecture with a balanced and rights-based global framework.
The country was appointed as the vice chair of the UN Security Council’s (UNSC) Counter-Terrorism Committee on June 4. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the appointment reaffirmed the international community’s trust in the country’s counterterrorism credentials.
A press release issued today by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the UN said that speaking at the UN headquarters a day earlier, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said that the counterterrorism architecture should be capable of addressing Prolonged conflicts, while eliminating injustice, oppression and violations of international law under the pretext of counterterrorism, and ending conditions conducive to terrorism.
“We must also clearly distinguish between terrorism and the legitimate struggle against foreign occupation and the right to self-determination,” he was quoted as saying.
“The UNOCT must also integrate respect for human rights and [the] rule of law to prevent abuse of counterterrorism actions by member states. The more we shy away from addressing these issues, the more prolonged our counterterrorism efforts will be.”
He further said that successful counterterrorism action requires concerted efforts, which were present in the framework of international law.
“He urged the international community to combat all forms of terrorism and take collective action without double standards or discrimination, prevent its exploitation for politically motivated agendas and shift public opinion away from the real challenges that we face today,” the press release read.
 






Ambassador Asim also called for adequate changes to the sanctions regimes to incorporate new and emerging threats and an end to the stigmatisation of Islam and Muslims, it added.
“While noting a surge in the emergence of right-wing, extremist and fascist movements in several countries, which are leading to terrorist violence, he (Asim) said that we see a strong inclination to see non-Muslim acts of terrorism as just violent crime,” it said.
Pakistan’s UN envoy highlighted that counterterrorism remained “one of the most important pillars to address threats to international peace and security”, saying that Pakistan has remained a principal victim of terrorism, with more than 80,000 lives lost and billions of dollars of losses to its economy in the war on terrorism.
He said that terrorism transcends boundaries and its evolution into new and emerging forms was being facilitated by modern ICTs in an increasingly globalised world, stressing the need for “effective and meaningful” counterterrorism efforts based on “consensually agreed-upon principles driven primarily by member states”.
“Ambassador Asim expressed Pakistan’s concern with the entry of norms, soft laws and ‘non-binding guiding principles’ into the global counterterrorism discourse by either the Security Council through its 1373 CTC and/or expert reports, which do not enjoy consensus of the wider membership,” the press release added.
 
 

He proposed the establishment of a “subsidiary body as an intergovernmental framework” under the General Assembly to oversee its universal consideration.
The UN Ambassador said that integrating the work of global compact entities such as Interpol and UN agencies with national law enforcement agencies can significantly enhance information and intelligence sharing relating to the movement of terrorists and terror financing.
“We must merge some of the UN entities or restrict their mandates to streamline UNOCT’s work. There are far too many agencies doing similar work, leading to duplication, including capacity building initiatives,” he was quoted as saying.
The UNSC Counter-Terrorism Committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.
Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01184451b6318de.png?r=184507' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921451/pakistani-bowler-sadia-iqbal-once-again-takes-top-spot-in-womens-t20i-rankings' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani bowler Sadia Iqbal once again takes top spot in Women’s T20I rankings</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan women’s left-arm spinner Sadia Iqbal took the top spot in the International Cricket Council Women’s Twenty-20 International (T20I) Bowler Rankings once again, cricket’s governing body announced on Tuesday.
Sadia was pivotal to Pakistan’s win in the recently concluded ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifiers in Lahore and was named in the team of the tournament for her nine scalps for an average of 16.
“Pakistan spinner Sadia Iqbal remains at the top of the list for T20I bowlers, but it’s tight at the top with just 44 rating point separating the top 10 players,” the ICC statement said.
The statement also said that England pacer Lauren Bell climbed two spots to a career-best place of fourth on the latest rankings.
Today’s announcement follows her ranking in May, where she also reclaimed the top position in ICC Women’s T20I Bowler Rankings.
Last year in the T20 World Cup, Sadia claimed three wickets for Pakistan as the Green Team beat Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka in their opening encounter of that tournament.
On the back of that match-winning performance, she subsequently became the first Pakistani woman bowler to top the ICC rankings.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01172352376cd2c.jpg?r=172721' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921420/sahiwal-police-arrest-3-for-allegedly-sharing-sectarian-content-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Sahiwal police arrest 3 for allegedly sharing sectarian content on social media</strong></a><br><p>Sahiwal police said on Tuesday they arrested three men in separate cases over the last 24 hours for allegedly sharing hate speech, blasphemous content and sectarian material on social media.
The Punjab government had ordered a crackdown on hateful content on social media alongside stringent security measures, such as army deployment, as the country gears up to observe Ashura (Muharram 10) on July 6.
“All suspects were arrested following the registration of three FIRs (first information reports),” Sahiwal District Police Officer (DPO) Rana Tahir said, referring to the three men booked in the past two days.
“The police are maintaining zero tolerance to such incidents,” DPO Tahir asserted.
 
 

“Our message to the youth is clear: they must exercise caution while using social media, especially in ways that could hurt sectarian beliefs or sacred symbols.”
The police officer stressed the urgent need to educate young people about the responsible use of social media platforms.
The arrests were made under sections 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 298-A (use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of holy personages) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), as well as section 11 (hate speech) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016.
The three complaints, two of which were filed on June 29 and one on June 30, detailed the content of social media posts in which remarks “inciting sectarian hatred” against the Shia community were made.
A FIR  filed at the City Sahiwal police station by Sub-Inspector (SI) Mohammad Azhar mentioned two Facebook posts shared by an account.
 
 

A second FIR filed at City Chichawatni Station on SI Mohammad Jaffar’s complaint mentioned a video posted on a Facebook page shared by a user.
The third FIR registered at the Ghala Mandi Station by SI Aakash Rohail was based on a WhatsApp status, a screenshot of which was printed and kept in police custody.
Days ago, Sahiwal’s Okanwala Bangla police booked two individuals in separate cases for allegedly spreading sectarian hatred and sharing blasphemous content on social media under sections 295-A and 298-C (person of Ahmadi community calling himself a Muslim or propagating his faith) of the PPC and section 11 of Peca.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01164423c4c4c78.jpg?r=164447' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921440/over-14-million-people-could-die-from-us-foreign-aid-cuts-study' target='_blank'><strong>Over 14 million people could die from US foreign aid cuts: study</strong></a><br><p>More than 14 million of the world’s most vulnerable people, a third of them small children, could die by 2030 because of the Trump administration’s dismantling of US foreign aid, research projected on Tuesday.
The study in the prestigious Lancet journal was published as world and business leaders gather for a United Nations conference in Spain this week, hoping to bolster the reeling aid sector.
The US Agency for International Development (USAID) had provided over 40 per cent of global humanitarian funding until US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.
Two weeks later, Trump’s then-close advisor — and the world’s richest man — Elon Musk boasted of having put the agency “through the woodchipper”.
The funding cuts “risk abruptly halting — and even reversing — two decades of progress in health among vulnerable populations”, warned study co-author Davide Rasella, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).
 
 

“For many low- and middle-income countries, the resulting shock would be comparable in scale to a global pandemic or a major armed conflict,” he said in a statement.
Looking back over data from 133 nations, the international team of researchers estimated that USAID funding had prevented 91.8m deaths in developing countries between 2001 and 2021.
That is more than the estimated number of deaths during World War II, history’s deadliest conflict.
HIV, malaria to rise
The researchers also used modelling to project how funding being slashed by 83pc — the figure announced by the US government earlier this year — could affect death rates.
The cuts could lead to more than 14m avoidable deaths by 2030, the projections found.
That number included over 4.5m children under the age of five — or around 700,000 child deaths a year.
For comparison, around 10m soldiers are estimated to have been killed during World War I.
Programmes supported by USAID were linked to a 15pc decrease in deaths from all causes, the researchers determined. For children under five, the drop in deaths was twice as steep, at 32pc.
 
 

USAID funding was found to be particularly effective at staving off preventable deaths from disease.
There were 65pc fewer deaths from HIV/AIDS in countries receiving a high level of support compared to those with little or no USAID funding, the study found.
Deaths from malaria and neglected tropical diseases were similarly cut in half.
Study co-author Francisco Saute of Mozambique’s Manhica Health Research Centre said he had seen on the ground how USAID helped fight diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.
“Cutting this funding now not only puts lives at risk — it also undermines critical infrastructure that has taken decades to build,” he stressed.
A recently updated tracker run by disease modeller Brooke Nichols at Boston University estimates that nearly 108,000 adults and more than 224,000 children have already died as a result of the US aid cuts.
That works out to 88 deaths every hour, according to the tracker.
‘Time to scale up’
After USAID was gutted, several other major donors, including France, Germany and the UK, followed suit in announcing plans to slash their foreign aid budgets.
These aid reductions, particularly in the European Union, could lead to “even more additional deaths in the coming years”, study co-author Caterina Monti of ISGlobal said.
But the grim projections are based on the current amount of pledged aid, so they could rapidly come down if the situation changes, the researchers emphasised.
 
 

Dozens of world leaders are meeting in the Spanish city of Seville this week for the biggest aid conference in a decade.
The United States, however, will not attend.
“Now is the time to scale up, not scale back,” Rasella said. Before its funding was slashed, USAID represented 0.3pc of all US federal spending.
“US citizens contribute about 17 cents per day to USAID, around $64 per year,” said study co-author James Macinko of the University of California, Los Angeles.
“I think most people would support continued USAID funding if they knew just how effective such a small contribution can be to saving millions of lives.”</p><small>2025-07-01 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611890-jcp-approves-new-chief-justices-for-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>JCP names new chief justices for high courts</strong></a><br><p>

Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently intensified their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a key perpetrator of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.
“Two terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,” Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.
 






“Fitna al Hindustan attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists’ firing,” the statement read.
The term “Fitna al Hindu­stan” is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
“The Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,” Rind asserted. An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces “encircled” the terrorists, he added.
Mastung Deputy Commissioner Athar Abbas Raja also confirmed the attack to Dawn.com, adding, “Heavy firing and blasts [were] heard in the small town at around 11am.”
 
 

Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while an “organised” clearance operation was also underway at the site of the incident, according to the government statement.
It added that search efforts to trace the facilitators of the attackers had also been initiated. The operation to “protect citizens and arrest terrorists” was based on intelligence input, Rind said.
“The immediate response by the security forces was effective in preventing further loss of lives,” the government official highlighted.
Uptick in terrorism
Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.
In one of the recent major attacks, a school bus in Balochistan’s Khuzdar was targeted on May 21, leaving eight children among 10 dead.
In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured as a blast targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.
Last month, security forces killed two “Indian sponsored terrorists” in Balochistan’s Duki district and another two in Kachhi.
 
 

On June 18, a man and a woman were shot dead when unknown gunmen opened fire at them in the Surgaz area, a locality on the outskirts of Mastung town. Another woman and a child sitting in the car were injured in the firing.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.

On a month-on-month basis, prices increased 0.2pc in June, reversing a 0.2pc decline in May.
The data comes after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept its key interest rate unchanged at 11pc in June.
The SBP said in its latest monetary policy statement that inflation was expected to show some near-term volatility but gradually stabilise within the 5-7pc target range.
The figures also come weeks after the unveiling of the annual budget, which included new revenue measures and subsidy cuts as part of efforts to secure a long-term loan programme from the International Monetary Fund.
Analysts have warned that higher energy and tax costs could stoke inflation in the second half of the year.

Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August last year, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government ordered a crackdown on protesters in a failed bid to cling to power.
Hasina fled to India at the culmination of the student-led uprising in August and has defied orders to return to Dhaka, where her trial in absentia opened on June 1.
Prosecutors have filed five charges against Hasina — abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder — that amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.
Defence lawyer Amir Hossain said Hasina has denied all charges, telling journalists that he would present “arguments to seek her discharge from these allegations”.
The ousted leader’s banned Awami League, in a statement issued in London, called it a “show trial” and said that the accused “categorically denies the charges”.
To illustrate the allegations against Hasina, prosecutors have drawn up a list of key examples from their bulky dossier.
They accuse her of incitement to violence, as well as ordering the use of lethal weapons, including from helicopters.
Chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said Hasina was driven by a desire to cling to power at all costs.
He pointed to her alleged push for people to “worship” her late father, the founding president of Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.
“Her father had the same obsession with holding on to power,” Islam said.
Prosecutors say Hasina holds overall command responsibility in three specific cases — the separate trials of which are ongoing — connected to the violent suppression of the uprising.
Those cases are the murder of a 23-year-old student protester Abu Sayeed, the killing of six others in the Chankharpul area of Dhaka, and the killing and burning of six people in Ashulia, another suburb of the capital.
Hasina is on trial with two other officials.
One of them, former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, who faces similar charges, is also a fugitive. The second, ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun, is in custody.
The trial continues.</p><small>2025-07-01 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01134528ebc088b.jpg?r=134925' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921417/govt-to-deploy-fc-troops-at-fazls-residence-in-di-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to deploy FC troops at Fazl’s residence in DI Khan</strong></a><br><p>The federal government has decided to deploy Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel outside the residence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan city due to security concerns, it emerged on Tuesday.
In a letter dated June 29 to the FC commandant in Peshawar, the interior ministry issued orders to deploy “one platoon” of FC personnel at the residence of the JUI-F chief “to avoid any untoward situation”.
The decision has been taken on the prime minister’s directives for security purposes and recent incidents involving the JUI-F’s chief son, Asjad Mahmood.
Earlier last month, Mahmood’s vehicle was intercepted on the main highway by armed men when he was on his way from DI Khan to Lakki Marwat.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently visited Fazl’s residence in Islamabad and expressed concern over the alleged attack and attempted kidnapping of the JUI-F chief’s son, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The prime minister expressed deep concern over the assault and foiled kidnapping attempt on Mahmood and inquired about his health, according to a statement from the PM’s Media Office.
PM Shehbaz issued immediate directives to arrest those involved in the attack and ensure swift legal action.
JUI-F leaders have come under attack in recent years in Balochistan and KP. On May 15, a powerful explosion targeted the vehicle of local JUI-F leader Maulana Noorullah near a seminary in South Waziristan.
Police said the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed. The JU-F leader was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.
On April 25, a local leader of the JUI-F and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near the Kalat district.
The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.
The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.
On March 14, a bomb exploded at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.
In another incident on March 2, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in Zehri area of Khuzdar district.</p><small>2025-07-01 11:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011237045269ce1.jpg?r=125541' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921408/psx-crosses-128000-barrier-on-first-day-of-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>PSX crosses 128,000 barrier on first day of FY26</strong></a><br><p>Bullish momentum continued at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday as the market crossed the 128,000 barrier on the first day of the new fiscal year 2025-26.
The KSE-100 index rose by 2,404.51 points, or 1.9 per cent, to stand at 128,031.82 points at 12:15pm, from the previous close of 125,627.31 points.
It then closed at 128,199.42 points, recording a gain of 2,572.11 points, or 2.05pc, from yesterday.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, attributed the rise to easing geopolitical tensions and the market “pricing in a gradual decline in interest rates alongside improving economic stability”.
“Investors are also anticipating a strong corporate results season and are rerating the market’s price-to-earnings ratio toward more normalised levels,” the analyst said.
 
 

He added that in his opinion, the market had entered phase two of the bull run, characterised by increasing public participation and a broad-based rally across a wide range of stocks.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said investors are increasing exposure in equities from fixed income due to the higher taxation rate imposed on fixed income in the recent budget, choosing high-dividend-yield stocks.
“Continuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in the limelight,” Ashraf said.
He anticipated that sectors benefiting from monetary easing and structural reforms, particularly related to the energy chain, would remain prominent.
Yesterday, the PSX ended the final session of the outgoing fiscal year on a bullish note, with the KSE-100 index soaring to a record high above 125,000. The rally was driven by aggressive buying at attractive valuations and strong year-end fund flows.
Also on Monday, the government projected a positive export outlook and a moderate rise in inflation to a range of 5-7 per cent for 2025-26, citing improved global economic conditions and domestic recovery trends.
 
 

In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the finance ministry said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan’s major trading partners — including the UK, US, Eurozone and China — were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.
The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. “The uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,” the report said.</p><small>2025-07-01 11:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611868-pakistan-india-exchange-lists-of-prisoners' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India share lists of prisoners in biannual exchange</strong></a><br><p>

The earthquake was recorded at 6:39am, with the epicentre 25 kilometres south-southwest of Lahore at a depth of 14 kilometres. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) spokesperson, tremors were felt in Kasur, Okara, Sheikhupura, Mureed and other districts of Punjab.
There have been no immediate reports of casualties. The respective administrations are inspecting buildings across the province for any sign of damage.
As per PDMA, the District Emergency Operation Centres across Punjab, including the Provincial Control Room of PDMA, have been placed on alert for the next 24 hours in case of any aftershocks.
PDMA has advised people to report damages to the 1129 helpline.
On June 30, another earthquake of 3.9 magnitude was recorded at 2:07pm, 35 kilometres west of Dera Ghazi Khan in Punjab at a depth of seven kilometres. The same day, Balochistan recorded a 4.8-magnitude earthquake at 11:11am, 40 kilometres southwest of Zhob at a depth of 20 kilometres.
Earlier on Sunday, a moderate 5.5 magnitude earthquake struck Musakhail, a remote district of Balochistan that borders Punjab, injuring five people and damaging dozens of mud houses. A day prior, low to moderate intensity earthquakes hit parts of Karachi and Pasni in Balochistan.
The country has experienced many low-intensity earthquakes over the past few months. Pakistan straddles the boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes.

The move will allow the US to maintain sanctions on Syria’s ousted former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, people linked to chemical weapons activities, the Islamic State and ISIS affiliates and proxies for Iran, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters in a briefing.
Assad was toppled in December in a lightning offensive by Islamist-led rebels and Syria has since taken steps to re-establish international ties.
Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said Trump’s termination of the Syria sanctions programme would “open door of long-awaited reconstruction and development,” according to a post by the foreign minister on social media platform X.
He said the move would “lift the obstacle” against economic recovery and open the country to the international community.
Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift US sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.
Some in Congress are pushing for the measures to be totally repealed, while Europe has announced the end of its economic sanctions regime.
“Syria needs to be given a chance, and that’s what’s happened,” U.S. Special Envoy for Syria Thomas Barrack told reporters in a briefing call. He described Monday’s move as “the culmination of a very tedious, detailed, excruciating process of, how do you unwrap these sanctions.”
The White House in a fact sheet said the order directs the Secretary of State to review the terrorism designations of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group that Sharaa led that has roots in al Qaeda, as well as Syria’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.
The White House said the administration would continue to monitor Syria’s progress on key priorities including “taking concrete steps toward normalising ties with Israel, addressing foreign terrorists, deporting Palestinian terrorists and banning Palestinian terrorist groups”.
Layers of US sanctions
A Reuters investigation published on Monday revealed the role of Syrian government forces in the killing of more than 1,500 Syrian Alawites over three days of massacres along the country’s Mediterranean coast in March. The Trump administration had no comment on the Reuters report.
It was not immediately clear if Washington was lifting the sanctions on any of the factions that Reuters found were involved.
Syrians hope the easing of sanctions will clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organisations working in the country, encouraging foreign investment and trade as it rebuilds.
In the aftermath of Trump’s announcement in May, the US Treasury Department issued a general license that authorised transactions involving the interim Syrian government as well as the central bank and state-owned enterprises.
However, the US has imposed layers of sanctions against Syria, some of which are authorised by legislation, including the Caesar Act. Repealing the measures is necessary for Syria to attract long-term investment without parties fearing the risk of violating U.S. sanctions.
“We are now, pursuant to the executive order, going to look at suspension criteria for the Caesar Act,” a senior administration official said.
Most of the US sanctions on Syria were imposed on Assad’s government and key individuals in 2011 after civil war erupted in the country.
The dismantling of the US sanctions programme on Syria includes terminating from Tuesday a national emergency declared in 2004 and revoking linked executive orders, according to the order signed on Monday.
The executive order also directs additional actions, including some with respect to waivers of export controls and other restrictions, the order read.</p><small>2025-07-01 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011318305be5a68.jpg?r=131834' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921415/cambridge-offers-students-free-resits-for-nov-exams-following-june-paper-leaks' target='_blank'><strong>Cambridge offers students free resits for Nov exams following June paper leaks</strong></a><br><p>Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) has offered students to resit exams in the November session free of charge if they were affected by any of the three exam papers leaked in the recent May/June session.

Just days prior to CIE’s admission of the leaks, a parliamentary panel was assured on that findings of the inquiry report over the issue of alleged paper leaks of O/A level would be shared after June 16.
In a post on its Facebook page on Monday, CIE shared an update for students  who sat one or more of the three affected papers in the June 2025 exam series: Cambridge International AS and A Level Mathematics Paper 12, Cambridge International AS and A Level Mathematics Paper 42, and Cambridge International AS and A Level Computer Science Paper 22.
 


“The results for these syllabuses will be released as normal,” CIE said.
“We’re offering free syllabus entry resits in the upcoming November 2025 exam series for students who sat one or more of the three affected papers in June 2025.
“We have sent a message to all candidates and their families through schools and will provide further information following the release of our June 2025 exam series results,” CIE added.
“Candidates are asked to contact their schools should they have further questions, and thank you once again to all students and families.”
While the May/June session was ongoing, students and parents had complained of several papers being scheduled on the same day and demanded a revision in the date, claiming pressure on candidates who had to sit two or even three exams in one day.</p><small>2025-07-01 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0112454817fcc1a.jpg?r=124606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921395/two-traffic-policemen-gunned-down-in-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Two traffic policemen gunned down in Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>Two traffic policemen were martyred as unidentified gunmen opened fire on them in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Tuesday, according to police.
“The traffic cops were on their way to Tajazai Adda for duty on motorcycles when they were fired at on Longkhel Road near Gulbaz Dehqan village,” read a statement by Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Shahid Hameed.
“The martyrs include Israel and Sanaullah, both of whom hailed from the Longkhel [area],” it added.
The police cordoned off the area and initiated an investigation.
 
 

Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Mohammad Jawad Ishaq specified that the four attackers were riding on two motorcycles and stole the policemen’s submachine guns.
DPO Ishaq further said, “The traffic personnel were dressed in civilian clothes when they were targeted.”
Lakki Marwat has seen a rise in attacks in recent months that reflect an increasing militant presence in the area, although unrest dates back to the early 2000s. Militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.
Last week, the leader of the Shahab Khel peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in Lakki Marwat.
In June, police said they destroyed several hideouts of terrorists in the forest located along the Kurram and Gambila Rivers in the district during a search and strike operation.
Earlier that month, three terrorists were killed while a cop was martyred in the district’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee.
2 suspected terrorists killed in Bannu
Meanwhile, two suspected terrorists were shot dead after an exchange of fire with police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel in KP’s Bannu district, a police officer said on Tuesday.
Police and CTD conducted a joint operation against the criminals in Bannu’s Domel tehsil, leading to an exchange of fire from both sides for over 20 minutes, a statement by Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan read.
“Resultantly, two terrorists were shot dead, while their accomplices managed to escape after taking advantage of darkness and nearby bushes,” the statement added.
The suspects were identified as Hussain Ahmed and Inaam alias Tooru, a resident of North Waziristan’s Haider Khel village.
“The slain terrorists were involved in several major attacks and IED (improvised explosive device) blasts,” RPO Sajjad added.
The police recovered two AK-47 rifles, four hand grenades, six magazines, 150 bullets, and two mobile phones from the suspected terrorists.
 
 

The alleged terrorist Inaam was wanted by the police and CTD in five different cases for attacking and killing police officers, while Ahmed was wanted in three different terrorist incidents.
RPO Sajjad noted that the Bannu police and the CTD had averted a possible major terrorist attack due to timely action. He said an operation to arrest the escaped suspects has been intensified.
He asserted that the CTD and police were determined to establish law and order in the area and completely eradicate terrorism.
Last month, several suspects were arrested and a cache of heavy weapons was seized during a joint operation carried out by the police, CTD, and the army in Bannu.</p><small>2025-07-01 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011213536b55521.jpg?r=121359' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921261/six-karachi-policemen-get-life-imprisonment-for-trafficking-drugs' target='_blank'><strong>Six Karachi policemen get life imprisonment for trafficking drugs</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A sessions court on Monday sentenced six policemen to life imprisonment after 77 kilograms of charas were recovered from their official police van as the contraband was being transported from Jamshoro to Karachi for illegal supply.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Abdul Hafeez Lashari found six police officials of CIA Jamshoro — Ghulam Abbas, Muhammad Yaqoob, Aijaz Ali Mallah, Abdul Hameed, Rahib Hussain and Ahmed Nawaz — guilty of possessing a total of 77kg of charas. He sentenced them to life imprisonment and awarded an additional two-year sentence under Section 155-C of the Police Order, 2002.
“Evidence available on record established that all the accused, were serving police constables, and they misused their official position, uniform, weapons, and a government-issued police mobile to transport a huge quantity of Charas. This act directly attracts the offence under Section 155(c) of the Police Order, 2002, which deals with misuse of authority by a police officer for wrongful gain or to cause wrongful loss to any person.
The investigation officer produced official documents showing that the accused were posted at CIA Centre Jamshoro and that the mobile used in the offence was officially allotted to the Incharge CIA. Furthermore, the contraband was recovered from the government vehicle, and the accused were in police uniforms at the time of arrest. These facts establish that the accused committed an offence under Section 155(c), as they clearly abused their lawful authority to engage in illegal drug trafficking,” the court noted.
The judge observed: “This case strikes at the very heart of public trust, when those sworn to uphold the law instead betray it, the damage reverberates far beyond the courtroom. Police officers are not merely enforcers of justice but they embody the covenant between the state and its citizens. Their participation in criminal acts fractures that covenant, eroding faith in institutions meant to protect society. 
It is a profound violation, for when guardians of law became agents of corruption, the belief of people in justice itself fades. This betrayal demands more than legal consequences. It calls for systemic reckoning. For a society to heal, institutions must not only punish the guilty but restore their own integrity through transparency, accountability, and an unrelenting commitment to the rule of law. Only then can the shattered trust begin to mend.”
The court also imposed a fine over 500,000 each, on default they would serve additional imprisonment.
According to state prosecutor Shakeel Ahmed Abbasi, in July 2021, the Boat Basin police had received a tip-off that a police mobile was transporting a large quantity of charas for illegal supply. Acting on the information, a patrolling team intercepted the vehicle and apprehended six policemen. Two sacks containing charas, weighing a total of 77 kilograms, were recovered from the official police van.
During the trial, the defence contended that the seized narcotics produced in court had melted and were not in their original condition. However, the court observed that this objection held no legal merit and noted that charas is a substance that can melt or deform due to heat or pressure.
The accused, in their statements recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, claimed they had been arrested by the Rangers personnel at the Jamshoro Toll Plaza. The court dismissed their claim, stating it lacked any supporting evidence.
The court noted that the prosecution presented consistent and credible evidence — including the FIR and witness testimonies — clearly establishing that the arrests were made near Khayaban-i-Sahil, opposite Sunrise Apartments in Clifton, as mentioned in the FIR.
A case was registered at the Boat Basin police station under Sections 6/9(C) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act.

The operating theatres of four private hospitals were also sealed. Action was taken after the death of 20 children at the District Headquarters Hospital, Pakpattan, as the authorities had the view that these children were brought to the hospital in critical condition from “outside”.
The private maternity hospitals which were sealed included Maternity Home (22/SP, Pul Bahmni), Al-Farid Medicare Hospital (DHQ Road), Bashir Maternity Home (Metti Stop, Hota Road), Dastagir Hospital (Chowk Ariayan) and Imran Maternity Home (Sikander Chowk). The facilities were operated by Sajida Sabir, Muhammad Pervaiz, Sitara (LHV), and Muhammad Imran, etc.
Deputy Commissioner Maria Tariq told Dawn that operating theatres of four hospitals- Doctor Hospital, Green Town, Shahid Hospital, Ali Hospital and MMC Hospital located at DHQ Hospital Road were also sealed.
On the other hand, Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhter Zaman said that there appeared to be no direct connection between the ‘missing facilities’ at the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) Pakpattan and the tragic deaths of 20 children reported last week. He noted that the deceased infants had arrived at the hospital in critical condition “from outside”.

“But we are examining all aspects with close scrutiny and professional depth,” he stated during his emergency visit to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Pakpattan on Monday. He said his visit to the city was in connection with the reported fatalities that occurred between June 16 and 22 at the pediatric ward of DHQ Hospital. The incident was initially reported by Dawn on June 27.
While addressing the media, the chief secretary said a five-member committee, comprising senior medical professionals, had already been constituted to investigate the matter and it would submit its findings within two to three days.
“I have directed the commissioner and the committee to personally reach out to the bereaved families, listen to their concerns and ensure that their statements are officially recorded.”
Mr Zaman noted that the chief minister was closely monitoring the situation and directed him to visit Pakpattan. He hinted that the CM herself might visit Pakpattan or meet with the families affected by the tragedy.
During the hospital visit, the chief secretary inspected various departments, including the pediatric ward, and reviewed the availability of medical equipment and staff. He directly interacted with several parents, assuring them that all deficiencies in the hospital’s infrastructure would be addressed in the near future.
Earlier, Deputy Commissioner Maria Tariq rejected the internal inquiry report of the 20 deaths produced by a three-member committee formed by Medical Superintendent Dr Adnan, which was led by Dr Muddasir, chief consultant pediatrician at the DHQ Pakpattan. The internal committee controversially cleared the pediatric staff of responsibility, recommending only ‘refresher courses’ on documentation practices. The ward’s death register reportedly disappeared during the finalisation of the report, raising concerns.
Following this, Commissioner Dr Asif Tufail had instructed the principal of the Sahiwal Medical College to assemble an external investigation committee headed by Dr Muhammad Shahid, associate professor and ICU head, along with Dr Muhammad Rizwan Ishaq, head of Medical Unit II, SMC.
Chief Secretary Zaman concluded his visit with a stop at Baba Farid shrine and reviewed arrangements of the 783 annual Urs. He was accompanied by Commissioner Dr Asif Tufail, RPO Mahboob Rasheed and other officers.

The explosion also injured 34, according to officials.
The government of Telangana, where the facility is located, has formed a five-member committee to probe the incident, the cause of which is yet to be disclosed by the company.
“We are still clearing the debris […] The building has collapsed and fabricated completely,” GV Narayana Rao, director of Telangana fire disaster response emergency, told Reuters.
“Once we are all done with the clearing, only then we will be able to assess if any other body is still remaining under the debris or if it is all clear,” he said.
On Monday, an explosion occurred at a chemical facility of Sigachi Industries leading to a fire, the police said.
Police officials said more than 140 people were working in the plant when the incident occurred. Twenty-five of the deceased were yet to be identified, district administrative official P Pravinya said.
Sigachi, which makes microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), caters to clients in the pharma, food, cosmetic and specialty chemicals sectors in countries ranging from the US to Australia.
MCC is primarily used to prevent the formation of lumps in food products, to maintain texture of cosmetic products, and as a fat substitute in low-calorie foods.
The plant contributes a little over a fourth of the company’s total capacity of 21,700 million metric tonnes per annum. Its shares dropped about 6 per cent on Tuesday and were headed for their sharpest two-day drop since listing in 2021.
The company did not say what led to the fire, but said it was halting operations at the facility for 90 days, citing damage to equipment and structures within the plant from the fire.
In a separate incident on Tuesday, five people were killed and four others injured in a massive fire at a crackers factory in the Sivakasi manufacturing cluster in the southern Tamil Nadu state, a fire department official said. The incident is the latest in a series of fire accidents in the area.</p><small>2025-07-01 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611828-cambridge-offers-free-november-resits-following-exam-papers-leak' target='_blank'><strong>Cambridge offers free November resits following exam papers leak</strong></a><br><p>

In online chats with Reuters on Sunday and Monday, the hackers, who go by the pseudonym Robert, said they had roughly 100 gigabytes of emails from the accounts of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan, Trump adviser Roger Stone and porn star-turned-Trump antagonist Stormy Daniels.
Robert raised the possibility of selling the material but otherwise did not provide details of their plans. The hackers did not describe the content of the emails.
US Attorney General Pam Bondi described the intrusion as “an unconscionable cyber-attack”.
The White House and the FBI responded with a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel, who said: “Anyone associated with any kind of breach of national security will be fully investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
“This so-called cyber ‘attack’ is nothing more than digital propaganda, and the targets are no coincidence. This is a calculated smear campaign meant to damage President Trump and discredit honorable public servants who serve our country with distinction,” cyberdefense agency CISA said in a post on X.
 






Halligan, Stone and a representative for Daniels did not respond to requests for comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not return a message seeking comment. Tehran has in the past denied committing cyberespionage.
Robert materialised in the final months of the 2024 presidential campaign, when they claimed to have breached the email accounts of several Trump allies, including Wiles.
The hackers then distributed emails to journalists.
Reuters previously authenticated some of the leaked material, including an email that appeared to document a financial arrangement between Trump and lawyers representing former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr — now Trump’s health secretary.
Other material included Trump campaign communication about Republican office-seekers and discussion of settlement negotiations with Daniels.
Although the leaked documents did garner some coverage last year, they did not fundamentally alter the presidential race, which Trump won.
The US Justice Department in a September 2024 indictment alleged that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards ran the Robert hacking operation. In conversations with Reuters, the hackers declined to address the allegation.
After Trump’s election, Robert told Reuters that no more leaks were planned. As recently as May, the hackers told Reuters, “I am retired, man.” But the group resumed communication after this month’s 12-day air war between Israel and Iran, which was capped by U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites.
In messages this week, Robert said they were organising a sale of stolen emails and wanted Reuters to “broadcast this matter”.
American Enterprise Institute scholar Frederick Kagan, who has written about Iranian cyberespionage, said Tehran suffered serious damage in the conflict and its spies were likely trying to retaliate in ways that did not draw more US or Israeli action.
“A default explanation is that everyone’s been ordered to use all the asymmetric stuff that they can that’s not likely to trigger a resumption of major Israeli/US military activity,” he said. “Leaking a bunch more emails is not likely to do that.”
Despite worries that Tehran could unleash digital havoc, Iran’s hackers took a low profile during the conflict. US cyber officials warned on Monday that American companies and critical infrastructure operators might still be in Tehran’s crosshairs.</p><small>2025-07-01 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611806-water-tanker-collision-kills-motorcyclist-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Water tanker collision kills motorcyclist in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>
