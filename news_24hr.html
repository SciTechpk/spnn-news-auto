Police have sought court orders for the exhumation of the deceased’s body to ascertain the cause of her death.
According to sources close to the investigation, as many as eight people, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary, the rickshaw driver who transported her body to the graveyard, her husband and family members including her brother, have been detained by police in connection with the case.
However, the police will charge them with murder and honour killing only in light of the postmortem report, which is expected after the exhumation of Ms Sidra’s body. The victim, 19, was married in February this year.
 







Seek court orders for exhumation of the deceased’s body to ascertain cause of death after making multiple arrests

Police initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of honour in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
 
 

As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered an FIR with the police under Section 496A.
Police sources said that the FIR was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow. However, the actual cause of her death will be determined after the exhumation.
“The purpose of registering the FIR for the woman’s abduction was only to avoid a murder investigation,” said a source.
In the FIR, the complainant stated that he was a resident of Pirwadhai and worked as a salesman at a cloth store in Bara Market, Rawalpindi.
He said he married Sidra Gul, 19, on January 17, 2025, and that she had been living with him since then.
On July 11, he claimed, a quarrel broke out between them over a petty issue after he returned home from work. He said he ignored the matter and went to sleep.
He further stated that after he went to sleep, his wife disappeared from the house, taking jewellery, clothes, and Rs150,000 in cash, without informing anyone.
After her disappearance, he said he inquired with her parents and searched for her, but could not find any clue to her whereabouts.
 
 

Later, he claimed he received information from local residents that his wife had a relationship with a man, had eloped with him, and was later illegally married to him, despite already being married.
He stated in the FIR that when he spoke to her family, they did not inform him about the alleged paramour and also refused to return his wife.
According to sources, shocking revelations emerged after the police began their investigation. The suspects had even erased the grave markers to cover up evidence.
Police have arrested around eight individuals in connection with the woman’s death, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary and relatives from both families.

The resolution, moved by Syed Zafar Ali Agha, a JUI-F MPA from Pishin, was adopted without opposition during the session presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai.
Speaking on the resolution, Mr Agha expressed concern that many private schools in the province follow curriculums that differ significantly from the Balochistan Textbook Board, which negatively affects student performance. He added that some institutions prioritise non-academic activities over education, depriving students of meaningful learning.
He also criticised the practice of collecting advance fees for vacation periods, particularly during the December to February winter break. “It is unjust to demand a three-month fee during the vacation, especially from students of low-income families,” he said.
The resolution urged the provincial government to ensure compliance with the Balochistan Textbook Board curriculum, ban non-academic activities and prohibit the collection of tuition fees during holidays — December to February in colder areas and May to July in warmer regions.

Resolution calls for end to fee collection during three-month vacations

It also called for the introduction of a standardised and reasonable fee structure up to the secondary level to ensure equitable access to quality education.
 
 

Responding to the resolution, Provincial Minister Raheela Hameed Khan Durrani said a unified national curriculum is being rolled out nationwide. “We have moved far beyond the ‘Alif, Anaar, Bay, Bakri’ level,” she said while referring to outdated teaching methods.
The minister acknowledged issues in matriculation exam marking and announced a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter.
Ms Durrani added that many previously closed schools had reopened and new teachers have been hired. She noted that government schools offer free education up to matriculation, while private institutions follow independent fee structures.
In his speech, Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti criticised mismanagement at the University of Balochistan. “New buildings are being constructed while staff salaries go unpaid,” he said.
Dr Abdul Malik Baloch of the National Party called for the establishment of catheterisation labs in provincial hospitals and proposed that the building of the Agricultural University be officially handed over to the university.
CM Bugti responded that the Agricultural College had earlier communicated that it did not require the building, citing low student numbers. It is currently in use by the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), though not under ownership.
He added that Balochistan’s youth could become a valuable workforce if properly trained and stressed the need to reform universities’ management structure.
“No one wants to see our teachers protesting on the streets,” he said, adding that 3,200 schools had reopened due to government policies and no school would be closed next year.
 
 

Provincial Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar acknowledged that healthcare in the province had historically been neglected and that doctors had not received promotions since 2013.
He said steps are now being taken to post doctors in rural areas to reduce patient overload in Quetta.
The minister also noted the lack of data within the health department and emphasised the need for doctors to serve in their home districts, including female doctors.
Provincial Minister Noor Muhammad Dummar addressed social media rumours regarding land allotments in Harnai and Ziarat, urging the assembly to present official records.
The speaker directed the Revenue Department to submit a complete record of forest land allotments in Ziarat from 2010 to the present.

President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Jawed Bilwani, said that borrowing costs in Pakistan are among the highest stifling business growth. He noted that interest rates in Vietnam stand at 6.3pc, followed by Cambodia at 3pc, Indonesia at 6pc, and India at 5.5pc.
He added that Pakistan’s competitiveness is further eroded by steep energy costs, with electricity tariffs hovering around 16 cents per unit compared to 9 cents in Bangladesh, 8 cents in Vietnam, 10 cents in Cambodia and Indonesia, 7.2 cents in India, and just 5 cents in Sri Lanka.
A reduction in interest rates to 5-6pc would provide vital relief to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are disproportionately burdened by high financing costs, he said.
Bilwani also highlighted that over 75pc of domestic credit is consumed by government borrowing, leaving less than 25pc for the private sector. “This imbalance must be addressed through proactive monetary policy,” he added.

Industrialists call for sharp cut in SBP policy rate

He warned that Pakistan remains uncompetitive not only due to high interest rates but also because of elevated electricity, gas, and water tariffs, steep taxation, and one of the highest minimum wages in the region — all while labour productivity remains low. “These elements must be rationalised to lower the cost of doing business,” he said.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry President Junaid Naqi, echoed the demand, pointing out that with inflation dropping to 3.2pc in June and the current policy rate at 11pc, there is no economic rationale for maintaining such a high interest rate.
“Industries are operating below capacity, new investments are stalled, and business confidence is at a low,” he said. “Persisting with outdated monetary policies will only worsen unemployment, depress investment, and cause revenue shortfalls.”
Vice presidents of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Amaan Pracha and Asif Sakhi, along with Faisal Moiz Khan of the North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry and Sheikh Mohammad Tahseen of the Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industry, also jointly urged the central bank to bring interest rates down to single digits to spur industrial expansion.
They noted that easing interest rates would reduce pressures on manufacturers and help restore economic momentum.President of the United Business Group (UBG), Zubair Tufail, also called for a 4-5pc reduction in the policy rate, arguing that monetary easing is essential for economic revival.
Offering a differing view, Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry  President Yakoob H. Karim urged an immediate rate cut from 11pc to 9pc  in the July 30 meeting, with a target of 5pc by end-2025 to support  long-term economic growth.

• Ex-State Dept official Elizabeth Horst made acting envoy to Pakistan
WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.
The meeting — the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years — is being considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US.
On the same day, the US named an acting ambassador in Islamabad.
 






In Washington, Mr Dar and Secretary Rubio held their first meeting since working together in May to negotiate a ceasefire that ended a dangerous military standoff between India and Pakistan.
In a post shared after the meeting, Mr Dar said he discussed bilateral relations with Secretary Rubio.
“We reaffirmed our commitment to the long-term Pakistan-US partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, IT/AI, and CT [counterterrorism] cooperation.”
 






Secretary Rubio, in a separate post, highlighted key economic and strategic aspects of the meeting.
“Met with Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister today to discuss expanding bilateral trade and enhancing collaboration in the critical minerals sector,” he said.
Both leaders mentioned discussions on regional developments, an apparent hint at the India-Pakistan relationship and clashes in May.
Mr Rubio said he thanked FM Dar for “preserving regional stability”.
 






In his post, Mr Dar hailed the “constructive role” played by the US in reaching the ceasefire.
According to a statement issued by the Pakistan embassy in Washington, Mr Dar said the US role “helped avert a potential nuc­lear confrontation and restored calm to a volatile region”.
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace and ongoing counterterrorism cooperation.
Secretary Rubio recognised Pakistan’s “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a “constructive actor” in efforts to ensure regional stability.
Trade and investment
The talks also addressed the future of bilateral trade and investment.
Both delegations — led by their respective foreign ministers and joined by senior officials — discussed opportunities in agriculture, energy, technology, and critical minerals.
Mr Dar described Pakistan as an “attractive destination” for American investors and voiced optimism about progress in the ongoing trade dialogue.
US engagement in South Asia
Mr Dar and Secretary Rubio also discussed cooperation at various global forums, including the UN Security Council.
The meeting “reaffirmed the importance of close coordination at multilateral fora, including at the UN Security Council,” and exchanged views on “key regional and global developments,” Mr Dar said.
 
 

Later, in a conversation with NBC News’ Dan De Luce at the Atlantic Council, Mr Dar outlined Islamabad’s regional outlook and addressed pathways for managing India-Pakistan tensions.
“For peace in South Asia, we need continued US involvement,” he said, calling for an “open-eyed” policy that “understands the risk of disengagement.”
Mr Dar highlighted the need for “a sustainable mechanism for conflict resolution” in the region, adding that there could be no peace unless India agrees to hold dialogue on all issues, including Kashmir.
He also revealed the US and Pakistan were close to concluding a deal for extracting minerals from Pakistan and an agreement could be finalised in “weeks and days, not months.”
 


Responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s incarceration, Mr Dar drew a parallel with the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, who has spent years in a US prison.
He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because “the Americans had followed their judicial system”.
Similarly, he said, Mr Khan was sentenced by Pakistan’s judiciary, which followed the due process of law.
“When the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,” he said.
When asked if Pakistan would continue to buy weapons from China, Mr Dar said the country would go for whoever offered a better deal.
New US envoy
Meanwhile, the State Department has appointed Elizabeth Horst as the acting US ambassador to Pakistan.
Ms Horst, a senior career diplomat currently serving as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to take charge of her position.
“I am back in Pakistan (where I started my diplomatic career 20 years ago), this time for a short stint as the acting ambassador,” she wrote in a social media post.
“What a joy to visit one of the most magical places in Punjab, the Lahore Fort. I saw how US support is helping preserve this magnificent monument and demonstrate our long-term partnership. The people-to-people ties and cultural bonds are what underpin our work.”
 



Ms Horst’s appointment, though temporary, is seen as both strategic and symbolic.
Her arrival signals Washington’s continued interest in maintaining high-level engagement with Islamabad, even as the Biden administration calibrates its broader South Asia policy.

As the global power axis pivots towards Asia, China’s role in South and Southwest Asia becomes central to advancing regional climate security and addressing shared environmental concerns. The urgency of this shift is underlined by the limited progress made under multilateral frameworks like the Conference of the Parties and the Paris Agreement. As COP30 convenes in Brazil this year and the Paris Agreement turns 10, millions remain vulnerable to rising climate threats with no immediate mechanisms to mitigate risks.
Climate change is multidimensional, the solutions multilateral, and the power dynamics multipolar. These three elements must align to secure a fair and sustainable future for all. This demands a strategic rethink and a policy reset prioritising ecological survival as the region’s foremost foreign policy challenge.
 
 

In this context, three countries — China, India, and Pakistan — and one issue — water — will shape the fate of the Third Pole countries.
China’s transformation since the 1980s from a closed agrarian society to a global powerhouse with advanced technology and robust human capital makes it the most influential player in the region. With a $19.23 trillion economy, China has lifted 800 million people out of poverty and made progress in other critical areas. As the uppermost riparian in the Himalaya-Karakoram-Hindukush (HKH) system, China commands a total reservoir capacity nearing 1tr cubic metres.

Political thinking must evolve to meet the existential threat of climate change.

India, with a population of 1.4 billion and an economy worth $4.37tr, has made significant progress since the 1990s. Although malnutrition remains a concern, it has lifted 171m people out of extreme poverty. As a mid-riparian country, India possesses many major reservoirs, with a water storage capacity of 170 days. It remains a critical player in regional water-sharing arrangements.
Pakistan, with 240m people, faces a shrinking resource base. The state has shown resilience during periods of sluggish economic growth and aims to transition to a middle-income country. However, mounting climate losses, unsustainable population growth, and rising inflation will make the task challenging. As a lower riparian, Pakistan relies on a single basin and one river with just 30 days of water storage capacity.
 
 

All three nations are nuclear powers, possess strong militaries, and are entangled in unresolved political disputes. Ironically, they choose to ignore a common threat — climate change — that is far more dangerous than any military adversary. Rapidly warming temperatures are destabilising the cryosphere, especially in the Third Pole, where snow and glacial melt sustain over a billion lives. The consequences of this ecological breakdown will be more destructive than any damage inflicted by the most advanced war machinery.
The future ‘climate wars’ will be multi-domain battles involving melting glaciers, collapsing cryospheres, rising sea levels, devastating floods, forest fires, extreme heatwaves and violent storms. Ignoring these escalating threats, while signs of carbon feedback loops manifest across ecosystems, is reckless.
A cooperative riparian governance mechanism is crucial for stabilising the hydrological regime in the HKH region. Failure to do so will deepen existing vulnerabilities and could spark tensions over diminishing resources. To move forward will require focusing on immediate threats that necessitate working together despite differences in other areas. Water security must be seen as the cornerstone and hydro diplomacy placed at the heart of regional security to avert a flashpoint situation.
As the world’s second-largest economy with growing technological capabilities and a rising middle class, China has the capacity to shape the 21st-century geopolitical landscape and must now extend that leadership to climate security. As the uppermost riparian, China could initiate a regional COP, followed by rotational country hosting focusing on the cryosphere.
Historically, China has used stability to fuel prosperity. Hosting a regional COP will not only unite HKH countries to develop joint strategies for risk reduction and sustainable water governance but also demonstrate leadership grounded in shared ecological interests, not political divisions.
A collective regional strategy to manage the Third Pole can bring key stakeholders to the table and foster an ecological coalition centred on natural systems and human well-being. This would provide a much-needed platform for collaboration, risk reduction, and long-term ecological sustainability among HKH countries. Without it, the region faces the dual risk of environmental collapse and political conflict.
 
 

Leadership in climate diplomacy would also align with the region’s civilisational values. Chinese philosophy has long revered water as the source of life. In the Analects, Confucius draws parallels between the nature of water and the qualities of wise people — fluid, adaptable and ever-changing. Water’s strength lies in its flexibility; so too must nations adapt to shifting circumstance.
It is time to heed this civilisational wisdom. Just as rivers must flow to sustain life, so too must political thinking evolve to meet the existential threat of climate change. A new climate security axis must emerge, rooted in cooperation, ecological stewardship and a shared vision for human security.
South Asia is in peril and needs a regional water accord for peace. Climate change is a non-traditional threat that cannot be resolved through tactical warfare. Nukes will not be able to stop hydrometeorological disasters, nor will tanks and fighter jets be able to rebuild shattered lives or restore fractured societies.
Talks, however, could avert conditions from becoming flashpoints of conflict and lead to solutions that work for all. This is a time for peace, not war.

As per PIPS, an independent Islamabad-based think tank, in 2024, terrorists martyred 140 policemen, 124 army officials, 78 FC and 13 Levies personnel. This recent shift in the terrorists’ targeting strategy, with greater emphasis on attacking police, indicated that to ensure public security, police capabilities must be enhanced, particularly in the two worst-affected provinces — KP and Balochistan — where almost 90 per cent of terrorist attacks and police deaths took place.
An analysis of the recent upsurge in terrorist attacks against police reveals three broad dimensions. Firstly, the steep increase in attacks has been going on consistently since 2020. In KP and Balochistan, these rose exponentially from 61 in 2020 to 416 in 2024 — almost 600pc. Secondly, the police targets hit by terrorists are many.
 
 

For instance, in KP, in 2024, the attacks ranged from targeting police personnel (47.8pc of attacks), police premises (39.8pc) and police transport (10.9pc), to attacks on police personnel’s families and residences, such as the setting on fire of the residence of a police officer in Lakki Marwat in April 2025, leaving his father severely injured. The same pattern exists in Balochistan and the other provinces.
Finally, the attacks have become more sophisticated and lethal. The terrorists are using more modern weapons, including night vision devices and sniper rifles, and adopting tactics such as launching full-scale armed attacks on police premises and even repeatedly using explosive-laden quadcopters to attack police stations in Bannu. More brazenly, in Balochistan, terrorists temporarily seized 20 police stations/posts, holding policemen hostage or killing them, and snatching their official weapons before leaving.
This increased focus on stepping up attacks on police is part of the terrorists’ overall strategy to project the state as weak by attacking police, which the militants see as a vulnerable state symbol. Tactically, these attacks weaken the police’s will to fight the terrorists and intimidate communities, drying up the main source of police intelligence against the terrorists. Not only that, this tactic aims at expanding terrorists’ influence in the locality by limiting police presence to certain areas due to security concerns, thus enabling terrorists to fill the vacuum by setting up their own ‘courts’, carrying out snap checking, increasing extortion demands, etc.
 
 

To address this threat, the general response of the provincial governments has been piecemeal, sporadic and under-resourced, leaving policemen largely vulnerable. The KP government, after losing hundreds of policemen in recent years, has announced a comprehensive police security plan for some of the districts costing Rs15 billion.
However, it has yet to cater for some dimensions of the threat, like the use of quadcopters. Going for some ad hoc measures, Balochistan is yet to come up with a comprehensive security plan. With almost half its police stations in insecure improvised buildings and roughly half the transport fleet needing to be replaced, the general security environment for police in Balochistan leaves a lot to be desired.

The plan to strengthen the police force against terrorism must be based on four broad pillars.

An analysis of public sentiments in KP and Balochistan on this issue brings out dissatisfaction with the existing response. There is widespread public opposition in KP against any military operation, as expressed in recent jirgas in Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Bajaur, Swat etc. These jirgas expressed confidence in the police and desired a greater role for them in countering terrorism and demanded their capacity building. Another demand by almost all these jirgas has focused on the ‘good Taliban’ vs ‘bad Taliban’ policy, which was making them more insecure. Similar sentiments exist in Balochistan, as evident from the many huge public gatherings protesting against the existing ‘missing persons’ policy. Needless to add, such public alienation vitiates the general security environment in the provinces.
The plan to strengthen the police force in its fight against terrorism needs to be based on four broad pillars:
Target hardening: Equipping police personnel with the latest weapons and protective gear, and making use of technology, is an essential prerequisite for enhancing public security. Instead of the existing piecemeal approach, we need comprehensive police vulnerability assessment reports at the provincial level, particularly in KP and Balochistan, to form the basis for a regular review of police security needs commensurate with the evolving terrorist threat.
Political will: This is essential not only for the timely allocation of funds for target hardening but also to plug the gaps in the existing counterterrorism response. For instance, in Balochistan, it is imperative to convert all ‘B’ areas into ‘A’ areas to prevent terrorists from using them as safe havens. Moreover, improving governance in KP’s newly merged districts requires a broader and more integrated approach to security, which can be done only at the political level.
Community support: Unlike the military, police have to live and work in the community to perform their lawful duties of crime control and law and order, making them highly vulnerable to terrorist attacks. This highlights the need to supplement the target-hardening measures with public support for police, which depends largely on the public’s approval of government policies generally. There is thus a need for provincial governments and police, specifically in KP and Balochistan, to strive to win over public support through inclusive development and responsive governance in order to improve the general security environment.
Institutional role clarity: Although the military’s role has been crucial in countering terrorism, the recent strong public opposition to its operations and tactics in KP and Balochistan signals a fundamental shift in ground realities. This necessitates a re-evaluation of the long-standing roles of the military and police in counterterrorism. In the light of these changes, a more nuanced approach, in accordance with current societal expectations, would mean gradually enhancing police capacity in both policymaking and field operations, sparing the military to intervene only when necessary.
Investing in police resilience and capability is thus a strategic necessity for any credible counterterrorism policy. Failure to realise that is likely to render the people, the military and police increasingly unsafe and vulnerable to the terrorist threat.

A tribal jirga representing the erstwhile Fata region and backed by religio-political parties wants the merger of the tribal areas with the province reversed.
The federal government, while willing to offer some concessions, is not in favour of that demand. Separately, the KP government has said a firm ‘no’ to any kinetic operations in the province. On the other hand, the country’s security establishment apparently wants it to be known that it can resort to any option regardless of what Peshawar wants.
 
 

The people of KP, too, stand opposed to kinetic measures; at the same time, they also strongly desire to be rid of the militant presence. With the vitiated state of national politics preventing different stakeholders from coming together and working out acceptable solutions to KP’s many issues, the province’s social fabric continues to fray and warp.
One wonders why the reversal of Fata’s merger with KP is being brought up now. The ‘mainstreaming’ of the region was a significant milestone that finally opened the door to its overdue development and modernisation. Previously ruled under colonial-era laws, Fata residents were finally able to gain representation in the KP Assembly and elect their own leaders. They also gained access to regular courts, police and public services, which was a marked improvement over being governed by the Frontier Crimes Regulation and relying on irregular tribal militias for their security needs.
Progress on the administrative end has indeed been slow, and funding shortfalls have hampered development plans, but these are not enough reasons to roll back the 25th Amendment. The residents of that region deserve to be considered and treated like all other citizens of Pakistan, and the government has done well to reject the tribal jirga’s main demand.
At the same time, the province’s deteriorating security situation, which disproportionately affects the erstwhile tribal areas, needs a mature response. The lack of political consensus may be attributed to the establishment’s persistent interference in civilian affairs, but the KP government also has questions to answer.
 
 

In the past, the PTI appeared sympathetic to the Pakistani Taliban. It may be recalled that there was even a drive to ‘settle’ hardened militants in KP while it was ruling in the centre. Today, the party is criticising the state for its policy of ‘good Taliban, bad Taliban’. Has it finally accepted its mistake in trusting militant outfits — a mistake which cost the country numerous lives? And if so, what is it doing to make amends?
If military operations are not an option, then, as a representative of the people, the KP government should propose alternatives. The centre must not impose a solution, but Peshawar also cannot just stand by and complain.

The Punjab government has banned bathing in rivers, canals and storm drains, warning of strict action against violators.
GB faces climate emergency
Meanwhile, the Gilgit-Baltistan government said on Friday that the region is in the grip of severe climate change impacts, as floods triggered by melting glaciers and cloudbursts continue to cause widespread devastation.
People in several areas faced shortages of drinking and irrigation water, electricity, internet, telephone services and road access, as floods, landslides and soil erosion damaged roads, water channels, irrigation systems, power infrastructure and optical fibre networks.
In a media briefing, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza confirmed that nine people, including two women and two children, have died since July 10, including eight in Diamer’s Babusar and Thor valleys and one in Astore.
 
 

He said many areas were cut off due to landslides and mudflows. The Karakoram Highway was blocked again at Chilas, after which C-130 flight operations were started to evacuate stranded tourists and patients to Islamabad. Four tourists were airlifted from Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat.
Floods destroyed 196 homes, damaged another 200 and swept away over 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, agricultural land and other infrastructure, including water channels and communication lines.
Mr Mirza said relief efforts are underway, with tents, food and emergency supplies being delivered. He acknowledged the growing frequency of cloudbursts and glacier melt, attributing the disasters to climate change.
Special flights from Skardu and Gilgit to Islamabad have begun, with 135 people, including 80 tourists, flown out so far. Search operations are underway for 10 to 12 missing tourists in Babusar Valley.
The GB government asked citizens to follow travel advisories and announced plans to review early warning systems, including the UNDP-funded Glof-II project.

• Approves Skill Impact Bond project to provide funds to educational and skill development institutes
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said the government is fully committed to implementing the agenda of economic digitisation, rightsizing public institutions, and ensuring merit-based appointments of experts in government departments.
The premier expressed this resolve while presiding over a mee­ting to assess progress on the appoi­ntment of technical experts across federal ministries and departments, and to discuss measures for enhancing foreign investment.
At the meeting, the Publ­ic-Private Part­nership Authority presented a detailed briefing on current initiatives and future plans aimed at streamlining exp­ert appointments and increasing investor confidence.
The prime minister highlighted institutional reforms as a top priority of the federal government.
 






While asserting that there will be no compromise on merit and transparency in the appointment of experts, PM Shehbaz said: “We are fully committed to implementing our agenda of economic digitisation, rightsizing public institutions, and ensuring merit-based appointments of experts in government departments.”
The meeting was earlier briefed that appointments had been made on 15 technical expert positions whereas appointment process was underway for 47 additional technical positions.
“Some 30 candidates have been shortlisted for the appointment of chief executive officers, chief fina­ncial officers, and managing directors in seven key ministries and departments,” the meeting was told.
 
 

The PM was further apprised that initial rounds of interviews for appointments in the petroleum division and national vocational and technical training commission had been completed.
Federal ministries have designated focal teams to formulate strategies for investment and sectoral roadmaps for investment.
Meanwhile, sectoral frameworks related to investment in food security, maritime affairs, minerals, tourism, industry, housing, and energy were in their final stages.
The prime minister was further informed that pitch-books for 18 economic sectors had been prepared to allocate projects for investment from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, Qatar and Kuwait.
Skill Impact Bond
PM Shehbaz also approved the country’s first Skill Impact Bond programme, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
Under the programme, funds will be provided to those educational and skill development institutions which will produce skilled professionals.
The initiative is designed to attract private investment for equipping the youth with market-relevant skills to foster sustainable employment.
Under this model, young people will receive training in contemporary skills aligned with industry needs, empowering them to actively contribute to national economic development.
He also instructed officials to offer opportunities for learning local languages of potential host countries, facilitating overseas employment for the Pakistani youth.
He said he would personally review progress of this project every two months.
 
 

The meeting was informed that so far 500,000 people have been registered under the digital youth hub whereas 1.7 million people downloaded the application.
The meeting was apprised that over 500 registered companies, around 47,000 job opportunities in Pakistan and approximately 100,000 in abroad in addition to that more than 2000 scholarships are available.
EU ambassador
Meanwhile, Amba­ssador of the European Union in Pakistan Riina Kionka paid a farewell call on the premier at Prime Minister’s House.
Underscoring the significance of the European Union as one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners, the premier reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the GSP Plus scheme, which had proved to be mutually beneficial for both sides.
 






Meeting with Dr Fouzia
Also, Dr Fouzia Siddiqui, sister of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, called on the prime minister, who assured her that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of Dr Aafia Siddiqui who is detained in the Unites States.
“The government is in no way negligent regarding the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui,” the PM said.
 






On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia.
Later, PM Shehbaz welcomed Nawabzada Mohsin Ali Khan, former provincial president of PTI into the PML-N ranks during a meeting at the PM Office.

• Emphasises institutional support for judges while expecting district judiciary to uphold diligence, humility, empathy, and discipline
• Terms ethical integration of AI in court systems top priority
ISLAMABAD: Describing the district judiciary as the most precious jewel in the crown of Pakistan’s judicial system, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Friday unveiled a road map for safeguarding the judges from external influences by empowering, protecting and providing institutional support to ensure independent discharge of their duties.
“It is my dream to see an aggrieved citizen walk confidently into the court of magistrate or a civil court in his own local town instead of being burdened to appr­oach the high court or the Supreme Court for seeking redressal of his grievances,” CJP observed while speaking at a symposium marking the International Day for Judicial Wellbeing under the theme ‘The Human Dimension of Responsive Justice’.
The event brought together judges of the superior and district judiciary, legal experts, development partners, and institutional stakeholders for a landmark dial­o­­gue on judicial wellbeing in Pakistan here at the Federal Judicial Academy (FJA).
In his keynote address, CJP underscored the urgent need to humanise judicial reforms by recognising the emotional, psychological, and institutional pressures faced by judges, particularly at the district level.
The judge who is institutionally supported is always fair, supportive and effectively responsive, the CJP observed but said when the wellbeing of the district judiciary was at the centre stage, it is expected that its members remain committed to the highest ideals of the public service.
 
 

The members of the district judiciary must be diligent, disciplined, respectful, polite, humble and empathetic toward the citizen they serve, he emphasised.
“These standards are not an additional burden but always for them to honour their role – a role that matters not so much to the judiciary but to the entire nation,” CJP observed.
Referring to the superior judiciary, Mr Afridi shared, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) was also seized with the issue and deliberating on how to protect judges from extraneous pressures.
Sharing a number of concrete short- and medium-term reform policies adopted by the National Judicial Policy Making Committee (NJPMC) — a committee comprising all chief justices of the high courts and headed by the CJP, he said a committee had been formed with the decision that each high court will formulate clear guidelines for members of the district judiciary to follow in case they face any extraneous influences.
Along with the defined response of the high court to counter such instance, he said he had also invited the chief justices of the high courts to consider incorporating the role of CJP in the response framework to ensure strong and unified institutional support.
The message must be clear to all that CJP will stand to support independent, honest and steadfast judicial officers,“ he said.
The CJP also recalled how issues such as the performance evaluation mechanism of district judges, standardisation of their recruitment process, parity in service conditions, and access to international exposure were raised during his meetings with district judiciary members on his visits.
 
 

“Instead of deciding their destiny from the Supreme Court, let the district judiciary deliberate and propose to the apex court what should be done,” he stated.
In this regard, Justice Rehmat Hussain Jaffery — a retired Supreme Court judge with experience in the district judiciary — has been nominated to head a committee, also including Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan as a member.
One of the most critical aspects of the justice system, the CJP emphasised, is the institutionalisation of arbitration. He revealed that 20 trained and expert judges are already available in the judiciary for this purpose.
He announced that one district from each high court’s jurisdiction will be selected to implement this arbitration mandate. Progress will be reviewed after three months, and if successful, the model will be expanded to other districts.
Ethical guidelines for AI use
The CJP recalled how NJPMC discussed on ethical guidelines for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
 
 

Undoubtedly given the rise of AI and its benefits, it is our top priority to integrate the concept into the justice delivery system, he said.
He added the the Supreme Court was in contact with the Supreme Court of Peoples Republic of China and that of the Constitutional Court of Turkiye to enter into memorandum of understanding for judicial cooperation for a period of five years.

• Warrants issued for Shibli in capital police attack case
• ATC extends Qureshi’s bail in May 9 cases till Sept 19
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Ale­ema Khan, the sister of former jailed PTI founder Imran Khan, has filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) accusing jail aut­horities of deliberately obstruc­ting her brother’s access to legal aid.
The petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, named the Adiala Jail superintendent and deputy superintendent as respondents.
The petition claimed jail officials had not returned power of attorney (PoA) documents submitted 10 days ago by Mr Khan’s legal team.
These documents are essential to authorise lawyers to file appeals in the Supreme Court against bail rejections, the petition noted.
 
 

The documents are critical as the deadline to file an appeal in the Supreme Court was approaching.
Any further delay would permanently bar Mr Imran from challenging bail denials, the petition argued.
It added that despite repeated requests by four senior advocates, jail officials neither processed the power of attorney nor communicat­ed updates with Mr Khan’s legal team.
The jail authorities’ “arbitrary, malafide, and unconstitutional” actions violated Mr Khan’s fundamental rights to legal representation under Articles 4, 9, 10A of the Constitution.
The petition claimed the delaying tactics were part of a broader pattern where the state instituted “politically motivated cases to suppress dissent”
Mr Khan’s sister requested IHC to order jail authorities to “facilitate Imran Khan’s signatures on the PoA before the limitation period expires, enabling appeals to the Supreme Court.”
Warrants out for Shibli
Separately, a judge in Lahore has issued non-bailable arrest warrants for PTI Senator Shibli Faraz and summoned Mr Khan in a case related to an alleged attack on Isla­mabad police outside Zaman Park.
The case dated back to March 2023, when Islamabad Police had arrived to arrest Mr Khan for skipping court hearings in the Toshakhana case.
However, the force failed to arrest Mr Khan.
The capital’s police lodged an FIR against Mr Khan, Mr Faraz and 150 other party workers for harassing and hurling life threats at the cops.
 
 

The FIR, registered at the Race Course police station, alleged Mr Khan, in connivance with Mr Faraz and other party workers, committed a crime by dodging and barring the Islamabad police from discharging their duty.
On Friday, the judicial magistrate at Cantonment Courts,  Sohail Rafiq, issued a written order regarding the proceedings of the case.
In its decision, the magistrate noted that Senator Faraz did not appear before the court and issued his non-bailable arrest warrant.
The magistrate summoned the PTI founding chairman in the same case for July 30.
Qureshi’s bail extended
The interim pre-arrest bail of PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi in seven cases linked to May 9 violence has been extended until Sept 19.
The cases include attacks on the Lahore Corps Commander House and Askari Tower, arson at the PML-N office and the burning of containers at Kalma Chowk.
ATC Judge Arshad Javed heard Mr Qureshi’s bail applications in five of the cases.
After the arguments, the judge extended the interim bail until the next hearing.
 
 

In the remaining two cases related to the Corps Commander House and Askari Tower attacks, ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill directed Mr Qureshi’s lawyers to present arguments at the next hearing.
All seven bail petitions were filed before Mr Qureshi’s arrest.
While his bail was earlier dismissed due to the detention, they were later reinstated following orders from the Lahore High Court.

• Senate unanimously adopts resolution condemning Israel’s sovereignty claim over occupied West Bank
ISLAMABAD: In a rare move, the attorney gereneral for Pakistan (AGP) has been summoned to appear before the Senate, after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns on Friday about alleged interference in House by judiciary, with some senators demanded immediate appearance of principal law officer in the lower house.
The issue was raised by former deputy chairman Senate and PPP leader Saleem Mandviwalla while Senator Shahadat Awan, also from PPP, was presiding over the session. Mr Mandviwalla voiced concern the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and Lahore High Court (LHC) had recently issued stay orders against proceedings of the Senate standing committees.
He said that throughout his legislative career, he had never witnessed such interference work of committees, which are extension of parliament.
Terming the development ‘alarming’, Mr Mandviwalla urged the chair to summon the attorney general and demand a serious expla­nation. “We have never interfered in court proceedings,” he remarked.
 






While acknowledging that the Constitution and rules do not bar parliament or its committees from discussing sub judice matters, he said such discussions are generally avoided out of respect for the judiciary. However, in this instance, he noted, stay orders were issued despite the absence of any pending court cases.
“This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees. The Attorney General must be summoned and asked what kind of joke this is,” he added.
When Mr Awan pointed out that the law minister was not present and suggested referring the matter to the attorney general via the secretariat for review of the case records, Mr Mandviwalla insisted that the attorney general, not the law minister, was the relevant authority.
 
 

Amid uproar with demands for immediate summoning of the attorney general, Mr Awan agreed to issue a notice to him to address the reservations of the House. “Let the Attorney General come to the House and brief it on the facts so that appropriate legal action can be taken,” he said.
However, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry proposed that the attorney general be called to the Senate chairman’s chamber.
Violation of Article 69
Referring to Article 69(1) of the Constitution, PPP Senator Zameer Ghumro said, “The validity of any proceedings in Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament) shall not be called in question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure.” He criticised the stay orders as violations of the separation of powers principle.
“Have we ever interfered in the working of any institution?” he asked.
Senator Dilawar Khan said the parliament was supreme and there was no justification for any instruction to meddle in its affairs.
PTI senator Saifullah Abro criticised Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar over passage of controversial amendments meant to make judiciary a “toothless body” and demanded that the attorney general be immediately summoned in the House.
JUI-F senator Kamran Murtaza also deplored the interference of judiciary in the matters of parliament and said displeasure should be conveyed to the judiciary.
Under Article 57 of the Constitution, the attorney general has the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of either House, or a joint sitting. It, however, remains a question if the attorney general would make a rare appearance before the House or not. Sources in the Senate said the secretariat would send verbatim of the proceedings to him and sought a report, which would then be placed before the Senate chairman who would then decide future course of action.
Resolution on Palestine
Separately, the Senate also unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the Israeli parliament’s decision to assert sovereignty over the occupied West Bank.
The resolution was moved in the House by Senator Palwasha Khan, terming the Israeli parliament’s resolution illegal, illegitimate, and null and void under international law, United Nations Security Council resolutions, and the Geneva Conventions.
Allegations against ex-minister
A contentious issue cropped up during Question Hour, when Dr Chaudhry, the minister for parliamentary affairs, claimed a former finance minister had increased the allocation for BISP Nashounuma Programme to around Rs 20 billion at a time when a company owned by him was the sole supplier of specialised nutritional food under the programme.
Mr Chaudhry claimed the company owned by Miftah Ismail was awarded the contract without following the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and food valuing Rs97bn had been procured.
He also claimed that no competitive bidding process, which is required under PPRA regulations, was undertaken at the time.
While senators questioned why no action was taken earlier, the presiding officer, Senator Irfan Siddiqui, referred the matter to a Senate standing committee for consideration.
Later, In a post on X, Mr Ismail challenged his former PML-N colleague, Dr Chaudhry, to bring present evidence for his claims and proceed against him in NAB or FIA.
“Ismail Industries has been supplying the World Food Program (WFP) for over twenty years. The BISP programme was started before I became a minister and continued after I left and continues to this day,” said Mr Ismail.
“Every packet that WFP buys from us is according to an international tender under UN protocols and guidelines and we supply to WFP at the same rate globally. Besides Pakistan we supply to many other countries.,” the former finance minister wrote.

The deputy prime minister arrived in Washington, DC, on Thursday night, on the second leg of his eight-day visit to the US. He had arrived in New York on Monday to attend “high-level signature events” of Pakistan’s United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.
A statement issued by the FO today said that Dar held his first meeting with Rubio. The two have previously talked over the telephone.
The FO said Rubio acknowledged Pakistan’s “everlasting sacrifices in the war on terror”.
“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the FO quoted the US secretary of state as saying.
The FO said that detailed discussions were held on bilateral relations and potential cooperation in various sectors.
“Discussions were held on promoting bilateral trade and economic relations, cooperation in important sectors, including investment, agriculture, technology [and] minerals. Counter-terrorism and regional peace were also discussed.”
 
 

FM Dar paid tribute to the efforts of President Donald Trump and the US leadership in promoting global peace, adding that their role and efforts regarding the recent Pakistan-India tension were “commendable”.
“Pakistan and the US seek further expansion and stability in bilateral relations,” he said.
The FO said FM Dar was optimistic about the positive progress in the ongoing trade dialogue between the two countries.
“Pakistan is an attractive destination for the American business community and investors. The two countries have a common approach and interests regarding regional peace. The Pakistani community in the US is playing a bridge role between the two countries,” the FO quoted him as saying.
Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to promoting bilateral relations and working together in various fields.
 






Dar said the two had a “comprehensive discussion on the full spectrum of bilateral relations”.
He added that both reaffirmed their commitment to the long-term bilateral partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, information technology, artificial intelligence and counter-terrorism cooperation.
We also exchanged views on key regional and global developments. I appreciated the U.S. constructive role in facilitating the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire.
“We reaffirmed the importance of close coordination at multilateral fora, including at the UN Security Council. With continued dialogue and mutual respect, I am confident we can build a more stable, prosperous, and mutually beneficial future for both our nations.”
 






Meanwhile, the US State Department said Rubio expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.
“The two also discussed prospects for deepening bilateral counterterrorism cooperation, including countering ISIS-K, and the upcoming US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue in Islamabad this August.
“The secretary underscored the importance of expanding mutually beneficial bilateral trade and exploring prospects for enhancing collaboration in the critical minerals and mining sectors.”
Dar is also scheduled to speak at the US think tank, The Atlantic Council, “sharing Pakistan’s perspective on regional and global issues as well as the future of Pak-US relations.”
 






Upon arrival in the US capital, FM Dar was received by Ambassador of Pakistan to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior embassy officials.
Dar’s visit comes as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan assumed the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
Addressing a reception hosted by Pakistan’s Mission in New York on Wednesday, Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world.
The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan’s leadership has been guided by “these very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure”.
The UNSC unanimously adopted Pakistan-sponsored Resolution 2788, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.
Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy.

“The chair appreciated the initiative, noting that it was long overdue and would play a vital role in facilitating access to financing for green projects in the country,” a statement issued by the Finance Division read.
During a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change and Environmental Coordination in March, State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad said the taxonomy will allow financial and non-financial companies to share a common definition of economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable.
The statement issued today noted that the ECC meeting was held under the chairmanship of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to deliberate on a range of important agenda items concerning industrial growth, environmental policy, skill development, housing finance, and telecommunications.
The meeting was attended by Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik, Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, along with senior officials from relevant ministries, divisions, departments, and authorities.
It added that the ECC reviewed and endorsed a report presented by the Ministry of Commerce on industrial competitiveness and export-led growth of the steel sector, in alignment with the National Tariff Policy 2025–30, aimed at reducing production costs and enhancing export competitiveness.
The committee also approved a summary by the Ministry of Commerce for filing an appeal in the Supreme Court against the decision of the Lahore High Court regarding the grant of gas and Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas tariff concessions to Ghani Glass Limited. The Committee found the appeal untenable in light of the fact that concessionary energy tariffs for five export-oriented sectors have already been withdrawn and are no longer available to any sector.
To support skills development through outcomes-based financing, the ECC approved a government guarantee of Rs1 billion for the issuance of the Pakistan Skill Impact Bond (PSIB), as moved by the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training.
In the housing sector, the ECC approved a markup subsidy and risk-sharing scheme for affordable housing finance, with the objective of expanding access to low-cost housing.
The committee also urged the ministry to develop a comprehensive, integrated database of the housing sector in coordination with relevant federal and provincial stakeholders, in order to ensure better targeting and effective implementation of the scheme.
The ECC was briefed by the Ministry of Industries and Production on the status of availability and pricing trends in the vegetable ghee and oil market. While noting the ministry’s assurance regarding adequate national stock levels, the committee expressed concern over the limited pass-through of declining international prices to domestic consumers.
It advised vigilant monitoring to prevent price distortions and potential cartelisation and emphasised the need for active coordination with the Competition Commission of Pakistan, National Price Monitoring Committee (NPMC), and provincial governments through the Ministry of Industries and Production.
The ECC also approved a proposal by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication for the revision of charges for Radio-Based Services (RBS). The committee directed the ministry to ensure periodic revision of RBS charges every three to five years, aligned with ongoing economic changes and technological advancements in the sector.
Furthermore, the committee endorsed a revised composition of the advisory committee overseeing the release of IMT spectrum, which is critical for improving next-generation mobile broadband services in Pakistan.
In conclusion, the ECC approved the formal declaration of ship breaking and recycling as a recognised industry, as recommended by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.
Last month, the government increased the price of gas by 50 per cent in an apparent move to meet the demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The ECC of the federal cabinet approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1.
The committee instructed the ministry to coordinate with the Power Division and share relevant data on power consumption patterns in the sector, to enable an accurate assessment of the implications of applying industrial power tariffs in place of the existing commercial rates.</p><small>2025-07-25 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2518521920172e3.png?r=190335' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926543/amid-epstein-furore-ghislaine-maxwell-seeks-relief-from-us-supreme-court' target='_blank'><strong>Amid Epstein furore, Ghislaine Maxwell seeks relief from US Supreme Court</strong></a><br><p>Even as an uproar over files relating to Jeffrey Epstein engulfs United States President Donald Trump and Congress, the US Supreme Court is due to wade into the controversy and decide whether to hear a bid by an associate of the late financier and convicted sex offender to overturn her criminal conviction.
The justices, now on their summer recess, are expected in late September to consider whether to take up an appeal by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence after being found guilty in 2021 by a jury in New York of helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.
Maxwell’s lawyers have told the Supreme Court that her conviction was invalid because a non-prosecution and plea agreement that federal prosecutors had made with Epstein in Florida in 2007 also shielded his associates and should have barred her criminal prosecution in New York. Her lawyers have a Monday deadline for filing their final written brief in their appeal to the court.
Some legal experts see merit in Maxwell’s claim, noting that it touches on an unsettled matter of US law that has divided some of the nation’s regional federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts.
Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, said there is a chance that the Supreme Court takes up the case and noted the disagreement among appeals courts. Such a split among circuit courts can be a factor when the nation’s top judicial body considers whether or not to hear a case.
“The question of whether a plea agreement from one US Attorney’s Office binds other federal prosecution as a whole is a serious issue that has split the circuits,” Epner said.
While uncommon, “there have been several cases presenting the issue over the years”, he added.
Trump’s Justice Department appeared to acknowledge the circuit split in a brief filed to the justices this month, but urged them to reject the appeal.
Any disparity among lower court rulings “is of limited importance”, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the brief, “because the scope of a plea or similar agreement is under the control of the parties to the agreement”.
If the Supreme Court opts to grant Maxwell’s appeal, it would hear arguments during its new term that begins in October, with a ruling then expected by the end of next June.
Mounting pressure
Trump and his administration have been facing mounting pressure from his supporters to release additional information about the Justice Department’s investigation into Epstein, who hanged himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell, an autopsy concluded, while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.
Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche, a former personal lawyer to Trump, met with Maxwell in Florida on Thursday in what her lawyer called “a very productive day”.
The administration reversed course this month on its pledge to release more documents about Epstein, prompting fury among some of Trump’s most loyal followers. The Epstein case has long been the subject of conspiracy theories, considering his rich and powerful friends and the circumstances of his death.
The Supreme Court’s 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump during his first term in office.
Whether the court would want to take on such a case that represents a political landmine is an open question. The justices hear relatively few cases — about 70 out of more than 4,000 appeals filed at the court each year — and have broad discretion to choose which ones will be on their docket. At least four of the justices must agree in order for the court to take up a case.
Epstein’s deal
Maxwell’s appeal focuses on a deal Epstein struck in 2007 to avoid federal prosecution in part by pleading guilty to state criminal offences in Florida of soliciting prostitution and soliciting minors to engage in prostitution. Epstein then served 13 months in a minimum-security state facility.
In 2019, during Trump’s first term as president, the US Justice Department charged Epstein in Manhattan with sex trafficking of minors. Epstein pleaded not guilty, but committed suicide before the trial at age 66.
Maxwell was arrested in 2020 and convicted the following year after being accused by federal prosecutors of recruiting and grooming girls to have sexual encounters with Epstein between 1994 and 2004.
Maxwell failed to convince a trial judge and the New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out her conviction based on the 2007 non-prosecution agreement, which stated that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”.
In the appeal to the Supreme Court, Maxwell’s lawyer David Markus said that in its reference to co-conspirators, the Epstein agreement had no geographic limit on where the non-prosecution agreement could be enforced.
“If the government can promise one thing and deliver another — and courts let it happen — that erodes the integrity of the justice system,” Markus told Reuters.
“This isn’t just about Ghislaine Maxwell. It’s about whether the government is held to its word,” Markus said.
The National Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers has urged the Supreme Court to hear Maxwell’s appeal, given the prevalence of plea agreements in the US criminal justice system and to ensure that the government keeps its promises.
The group represents thousands of private lawyers, public defenders, law professors and judges nationwide. It said in a filing to the justices that the lack of a geographic limitation means “no part of the Department of Justice may institute criminal charges against any co-conspirator in any district”.
Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman, an expert in criminal law, said it was unusual for the US attorney in Florida to include protection for co-conspirators in the agreement to not prosecute Epstein.
That peculiarity might be reason enough for the Supreme Court to avoid the matter, Richman said, as it renders the case a poor vehicle for resolving whether pleas in one court district bind actions in all other court districts.
“There were many strange things about this deal,” Richman said, which will cut against the Supreme Court’s interest in taking up Maxwell’s appeal.
Richman said he hoped the political fallout would not play into the Supreme Court’s decision on whether to hear Maxwell’s appeal. If it does, Richman said, taking up the case could allow Maxwell to avoid cooperating with the government and dodge responsibility.
“A decision that would allow Maxwell to protect herself probably would not be something they would be interested in,” Richman said of the Supreme Court justices.</p><small>2025-07-25 17:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/25163630c7e468b.jpg?r=165829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926531/iran-and-europeans-hold-frank-nuclear-talks-with-un-sanctions-looming' target='_blank'><strong>Iran and Europeans hold ‘frank’ nuclear talks with UN sanctions looming</strong></a><br><p>Iran said it would continue nuclear talks with European powers after “serious, frank, and detailed” conversations on Friday, the first such face-to-face meeting since Israel and the United States bombed Iran last month.
Before the meeting in Istanbul, Iran also pushed back on suggestions of extending the United Nations resolution that ratifies a 2015 deal, nearing expiry, that was designed to curb its nuclear programme.
Delegations from the European Union and so-called E3 group of France, Britain and Germany met Iranian counterparts for about four hours at Iran’s consulate for talks that the UN nuclear watchdog said could provide an opening to resume inspections in Iran.
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi said afterwards that both sides had presented specific ideas on sanctions relief and the nuclear issue.
“While seriously criticising their stances regarding the recent war of aggression against our people, we explained our principled positions, including on the so-called snapback mechanism,” he said.
“It was agreed that consultations on this matter will continue.”
The European countries, along with China and Russia, are the remaining parties to the 2015 deal — from which the US withdrew in 2018 — which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme.
A deadline of October 18 is fast approaching when the resolution governing that deal expires.
At that point, all UN sanctions on Iran will be lifted unless the “snapback” mechanism is triggered at least 30 days before. This would automatically reimpose those sanctions, which target sectors from hydrocarbons to banking and defence.
To give time for this to happen, the E3 have set a deadline of the end of August to revive diplomacy. Diplomats say they want Iran to take concrete steps to convince them to extend the deadline by up to six months.
Europeans want nuclear commitments from Iran
Iran would need to make commitments on key issues, including eventual talks with Washington, full cooperation with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and accounting for 400 kilogrammes of near-weapons-grade highly enriched uranium, whose whereabouts are unknown since last month’s strikes.
Before the talks, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson had said Tehran considered talk of extending UN Security Council Resolution 2231 to be “meaningless and baseless”.
IAEA head Rafael Grossi said he was optimistic that nuclear inspection visits might be able to restart this year and that it was important to discuss the technical details now.
“We need to agree on where to go, how to do it. We need to listen to Iran in terms of what they consider should be the precautions to be taken,” he told reporters in Singapore.
The United States held five rounds of talks with Iran prior to its airstrikes in June, which US President Donald Trump said had “obliterated” a programme that Washington and its ally Israel say is aimed at acquiring a nuclear bomb.
However, NBC News has cited current and former US officials as saying a subsequent US assessment found that while the strikes destroyed most of one of three targeted nuclear sites, the other two were not as badly damaged.
Iran denies seeking a nuclear weapon and says its nuclear programme is meant solely for civilian purposes.</p><small>2025-07-25 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/251530046522879.jpg?r=154910' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926508/gujar-khan-police-arrest-head-constable-for-allegedly-filming-women-in-hospital-toilets' target='_blank'><strong>Gujar Khan police arrest head constable for allegedly filming women in hospital toilets</strong></a><br><p>Gujar Khan police have arrested a head constable for allegedly recording women in the toilets of the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and have begun an investigation, officials said on Friday.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Assistant Superintendent of Police Syed Daniyal said, “The police received a complaint from a resident who said that the suspect — a serving head constable posted in Lahore office of Punjab Police — was allegedly involved in filming women while they were using the toilets in the hospital’s wards.”
The police arrested the suspect from the hospital and also recovered his cell phone, he said.
“It was during a preliminary investigation that police discovered that the suspect was a serving officer.”
Police said that several compromised videos of women using the toilets had been found on his cell phone, which have been sent for forensic verification.
ASP Daniyal later told Dawn.com that the aggrieved party has moved a cyber-inducement application against the constable. “The matter is already under process with the Federal Investigation Agency, which is the relevant forum for the case,” he added.
Gujar Khan Station House Officer Nazeer Ahmed Ghaeba told Dawn.com that police would investigate the case on merit and no favour or leniency would be exhibited.
The police have registered the case under sections 354 (Assault or use of criminal force to a woman and stripping her of her clothes) and 292 (Sale etc of obscene books, etc), and Section 509 (Insulting modesty or causing sexual harassment) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
When approached for comment, Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Medical Superintendent (MS) Dr Sarmad Kiyani said there were no cameras in the hospital’s restrooms.
“The only cameras in the hospital are in the corridors, not in the toilets. We don’t know what kinds of videos they found on his phone. It’s up to the police to investigate the matter,” he said.
ASP Daniyal also told Dawn.com that the suspect had previously been booked for rape, but the case was later dismissed.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the 2020 case, seen by Dawn.com, the suspect had allegedly raped a widow and was booked under Section 452 (House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), and Section 34 (Acts done by several persons) of the PPC.
However, he had reconciled with the victim, so the case was withdrawn and he was reinstated, per the ASP.
Meanwhile, residents have urged Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to take serious notice of such incidents in government hospitals.
In March, Swabi police arrested a TikToker for making videos and photos of women and girls while they were shopping and uploading them to his account.
A similar incident occurred in Khanewal in December, where a suspect  allegedly filmed women customers in the changing rooms of a garment retailer in Khanewal with his mobile phone. He was later sent on judicial remand.
Last June, police lodged a case against the owners and staff of a private girls’ hostel in Lahore’s Johar Town for recording videos of the residents through hidden cameras installed in washrooms, causing apprehensions that these clips may be sold and used on the ‘dark web’ or social media.</p><small>2025-07-25 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615763-fm-ishaq-dar-meets-us-top-diplomat-rubio-in-washington' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with FM Dar, US top diplomat praises Pakistan's sacrifices in war on terror</strong></a><br><p>

The PCB also said that Pakistan will play three T20 Internationals against the West Indies, scheduled on July 31, Aug 2 and 3, at the Central Broward Park and Broward County Stadium in USA’s Lauderhill.
“Salman Ali Agha will captain the T20I side, while fast bowlers Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali and Shaheen Shah Afridi return to the squad in this format,” the statement read.
It added that Pakistan will arrive in the USA on July 27 following the conclusion of the three-match T20I series in Bangladesh.

On Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Registrar Office put on hold the processing of the contempt of court notices issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.
IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for refusing to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.
“The government is in no way negligent regarding the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui,” the prime minister was quoted as having said by APP in a meeting today with Dr Fouzia.
On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government has previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a statement issued by the PM Office said.
“Furthermore, the prime minister not only wrote a letter to then-US president Joe Biden regarding this issue but also formed a committee headed by Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar to ensure further progress in the matter,” the statement added.
“The committee will remain in contact with Dr Fouzia and work to provide the necessary support in this regard.”
 






Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.
On July 12, the IHC expr­essed dissatisfaction over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented.
In February, the IHC was told that the proposal to exchange Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible.
The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that Dr Aafia’s American lawyer Clive Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.
Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had requested that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.
In a letter dated October 13, which has been seen by Dawn.com, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.
“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”
Consequently, the US State Department declined to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.
When a journalist inquired about the letter, spokesperson Vedant Patel had stated: “Certainly, we would not get into private diplomatic communications,” seemingly confirming receipt of the correspondence.</p><small>2025-07-25 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/251630455ae60bf.png?r=180506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926535/fire-continues-to-rage-at-tobacco-warehouse-in-kps-swabi-after-38-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Fire continues to rage at tobacco warehouse in KP’s Swabi after 38 hours</strong></a><br><p>Rescue 1122 firefighters on Friday are still working to bring under control a fire at a tobacco warehouse in the Azamabad area of Razaar tehsil in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swabi district that has been raging for 38 hours.
The fire, which broke out at 4am on Thursday morning, was still out of control today, forcing firefighters to continue their extinguishing efforts.
A Rescue 1122 official, Luqman Khan, said that the three-storey warehouse was filled with ‘white patta’ tobacco and its stems that were mainly used in snuff and cigarettes.
“The biggest problem for the firefighters was that no ventilator or exhaust were built,” the official said.
He said that the rescue team drilled holes in the walls from the outside to start the process of putting out the fire, adding that it was such a difficult task that “four firefighters fainted during the operation”.
According to the official, the intensity of the fire had compelled the district administration to contact Rescue 1122, requesting additional fire extinguishing vehicles and firefighters from the districts of Mardan and Nowshera as well as Swabi tehsil municipal administration staff.
The owner of the warehouse, Muhammad Bashir, said that he was not in a position to state how much was lost, but was extremely perturbed watching the fire rage.
“All my capital has turned into ashes. Now, I have to start again from zero. I don’t know what to do. It’s a strange situation,” he said.
He added that the huge building, which he had built, was also destroyed.
Bashir further said that the cause of the fire was unknown. However, he added, “This fire (was) not self-ignited; it was set off by someone else. I am fully confident in what I am saying.”
Rescue 1122 Swabi District Emergency Officer Owais Babar said: “We stand with the affected businessman till the last moment. Our team will remain on the spot until the threat of fire is completely eliminated.”
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
Last month, a huge fire erupted in Karachi’s Millennium Mall, ostensibly due to an electrical short circuit, and destroyed several hundred shops, causing substantial financial losses. It was brought under control after hectic efforts lasting several hours.
Also in June, a fire at a factory in Karachi Export Processing Zone near Landhi took 36 hours to bring under control, destroying three factories completely and leaving five people injured, including four firefighters.</p><small>2025-07-25 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615733-tiktoker-sumeera-rajput-found-dead-at-home-in-ghotki' target='_blank'><strong>TikToker Sumeera Rajput found dead at home in Ghotki</strong></a><br><p>

“Not the most sexy topic,” Jonathan Cathey, chief executive of collectibles company The Loyal Subjects, admitted at a panel titled “Toys, Tariffs, and Trade Wars” at the four-day convention in San Diego, California.
“But this ultimately affects you guys, it affects the end user,” he said.
“Prices will go up, and our rate of sales will go down.”
Toy companies have been fretting about the impact of Trump’s global tariff blitz on the industry, particularly when it comes to China.
Of over $17 billion worth of toys imported to the United States last year, more than $13bn came from China.
But a rollercoaster tariff row between Washington and Beijing has caused havoc for US businesses and their Chinese suppliers.
Panel moderator Daniel Pickett argued that the Trump administration is “imposing truly exaggerated, somewhat crazy, and frightening measures”.
He said Trump’s proposal to impose additional tariffs on imports “has only wreaked havoc on the entire industry”.
Trump recently dismissed warnings by toy giant Hasbro’s CEO Chris Cocks about rising prices if higher tariffs were imposed, defending his trade policy by emphasising it favours domestic production.
But Cathey argued the rhetoric doesn’t reflect American reality.
He said: “There’s like 480,000 manufacturing jobs … that aren’t even filled. So we’re going to do what, we’re going to bring a bunch of factory jobs back that nobody can fill.”
The business owner suggested that US value-addition lies in innovation rather than manufacturing.
“There are industries where tariffs make sense,” Cathey continued, highlighting the automotive and mining sectors.
“There’s a mechanism where tariffs make sense that actually protect jobs, American workers, and our national security. Barbie ain’t it.”
Brian Flynn of Super7, a collectables and action figures brand, said the Trump administration’s shifting tariff policies have caused chaos and uncertainty.
“Nobody knows what’s going to happen,” he said, adding that the triple-digit tariffs Trump has sometimes mentioned would “drive everyone out of the market”.
Flynn said the impact was already visible at Comic-Con, where he had to limit himself to a small concession stand rather than a larger exhibit space.
Consumers will feel the impact in their wallets next quarter, he warned. “And when it hits, that’s going to make a big difference for us.”</p><small>2025-07-25 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/25172223fb81523.jpg?r=173552' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926532/govt-urges-social-media-firms-to-block-accounts-run-by-terrorist-groups' target='_blank'><strong>Govt urges social media firms to block accounts run by terrorist groups</strong></a><br><p>The government on Friday called on global social media organisations to immediately block the accounts of proscribed terrorist groups disseminating propaganda on their platforms.
On Wednesday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had highlighted how a terrorist group was using WhatsApp channels to “disseminate hateful content and harmful narratives”, urging the platform and the global community to help Pakistan combat terrorism.
Addressing a joint press conference today in Islamabad alongside Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, Chaudhry said: “I want to request social media operators and platforms to cooperate with us on the blockage and removal of accounts, taking measures to stop mirror accounts and to share information of account holders who are operating these accounts.”
Chaudhry said terrorist groups and individuals, including those banned in the United States, the United Kingdom and sanctioned by the United Nations, were operating accounts on social media platforms such as X, Facebook and WhatsApp.
He said the National Action Plan (NAP) — formed in 2014 to take action against terrorists through a concerted national effort — requires taking action against those spreading propaganda on media and social media.
The agenda items of NAP include a ban on the glorification of terrorists and terrorist organisations through print and electronic media, and measures against the abuse of the internet and social media for terrorism.
He requested social media firms to block these groups; use artificial intelligence (AI) to prevent “mirror accounts”; and share information about their operators. He urged creating auto-detect and auto-block algorithms against such accounts.
Barrister Malik said authorities had unearthed 481 accounts associated with proscribed terrorist groups on various platforms and reported them to social media organisations.
He urged social media firms to share information about account holders to “amplify counterterrorism operations in dealing with this newer threat”.
He also requested them to implement strict measures, which include AI methods to discover more accounts. He invited them to establish their presence in the country and sought enhanced cooperation in the digital world.
Malik said Pakistan was at the forefront and had rendered sacrifices in the war against terrorism, but a new trend had surfaced on social media apps such as X, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram.
“We will welcome social media platforms to set up offices in Pakistan for better coordination,” he said. “We seek coordination between social media platforms and our law enforcement agencies on social issues and the presence of terrorist organisations on social media.”
He said terror groups such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Islamic State Khorasan Province, Balochistan Liberation Army and Balochistan Liberation Front had an active presence on social media platforms, noting they have been banned by the US and the UK as well.
“Pakistan remains steadfast and is committed to our resolve to combat terrorism. Apart from operating on the ground, we have seen new trends in the digital realm,” he said.
He said the state minister for interior also highlighted how terrorist groups were “working on social media, recruiting and actively disseminating propaganda” through WhatsApp and other platforms.
“These social accounts significantly enhance their social media presence, whether it through their real names of pseudonyms. It poses a threat to our nation, citizens and the rest of the world.”</p><small>2025-07-25 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615732-pm-assures-all-possible-support-in-dr-aafia-siddiquis-case' target='_blank'><strong>PM assures all possible support in Dr Aafia Siddiqui's case</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and defence collaboration, with initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is currently on an official visit to China. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement today that he held meetings with senior Chinese political and military leadership in Beijing.
“Chinese military leadership reiterated full confidence in the strength of the bilateral defence partnership and acknowledged Pakistan’s pivotal role in promoting regional peace,” it said.
COAS Munir called on Chinese Vice President Han Zheng and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the statement read.
“Discussions focused on the evolving regional and global political landscape, connectivity initiatives under the CPEC, and the need for coordinated responses to shared geopolitical challenges,” it added.
“Both sides expressed satisfaction over the depth of bilateral engagement and reiterated their shared commitment to sovereign equality, multilateral cooperation, and long-term regional stability.”
The statement continued that the “Chinese leadership lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia”.
 






The military engagement between both sides included “comprehensive exchanges on defence and security cooperation, including counterterrorism collaboration, joint training, defence modernisation, and enhanced institutional linkages”, THE ISPR said.
“Emphasis was placed on improving operational interoperability and strategic coordination to confront hybrid and transnational threats,” it added.
Field Marshal Munir held meetings with various Chinese military leaders, the statement read, adding, “Upon arrival at the  People’s Liberation Army Headquarters, the COAS was presented with a guard of honour, symbolising the longstanding camaraderie between the two armed forces.”
The COAS appreciated China’s “consistent support” and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to “further expanding military-to-military cooperation across all domains”, the ISPR stated.
The statement said that the visit “reflects the growing depth of politico-military ties between the two brotherly nations and underscores their shared resolve to advance regional security through sustained high-level dialogue and engagements”.
A day earlier, the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation signed a memorandum of understanding with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, in a move that is set to bring about a “major transformation” in the shipping sector.
Last week, Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar met with the Chinese foreign minister, where both sides reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability and development.</p><small>2025-07-25 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/25161732f06f409.png?r=162041' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926529/pm-shehbaz-lauds-sampp-ratings-upgrade-vows-to-acheive-sustainable-growth' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz lauds S&P ratings upgrade, vows to acheive sustainable growth</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday lauded S&P Global upgrade to the country’s sovereign credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ and vowed to achieve sustainable economic growth.
A day earlier, ratings agency S&P Global had raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ and placed it on a ‘stable’ outlook, saying the country’s finances and reserves had been stabilised by International Monetary Fund (IMF) support.
“S&P’s upgrade of Pakistan’s credit rating from CCC+ to B-, with a stable outlook, is a welcome development,” PM Shehbaz said in a post on X.
“It reflects growing confidence in our economic reforms and the macroeconomic stability we have been able to achieve,” he added.
 






He continued that his administration remained committed to sustaining the momentum of reform, fostering transparency, and deepening investor confidence, “so that the early signs of recovery translate into lasting prosperity for our people and translate into sustainable economic growth”.
In its statement, S&P had said: “The stable outlook reflects our expectations that continued economic recovery and government efforts to enhance revenue will stabilise fiscal and debt metrics.
“We also expect that sustained official financing will support Pakistan in meeting its external obligations, and that the country will continue to roll over its commercial credit lines over the next 12 months.”
Pakistan’s longer-dated international bonds rallied after the upgrade, with the 2051 maturity gaining 1.6 cents to be bid at 84.85 cents on the dollar, according to Tradeweb data.
Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had urged the leading US rating agency — Moody’s — to improve Pakistan’s credit rating and help its return to international capital markets at favourable conditions.
 
 

Moody’s had upgraded Paki­stan’s credit rating by one notch in August 2024 to Caa2 from Caa3 (downgraded in February 2023 due to suspension of the IMF programme) and changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions, including liquidity and external position from very weak levels.
Global ratings agency Fitch had upgraded Pakistan’s foreign currency credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ in April, citing increased confidence in the country’s progress on narrowing its budget deficits.</p><small>2025-07-25 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/25131916376cd2c.jpg?r=131926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926502/police-recover-abducted-minor-arrest-main-suspect-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Police recover abducted minor, arrest main suspect in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The main suspect involved in kidnapping a three-year-old girl in Karachi was arrested while the victim was recovered, police said on Friday.
According to a first information report (FIR) filed by the girl’s father, seen by Dawn.com, the incident occurred on July 23.
The girl went to a shop near her house and disappeared around 9pm, the FIR read, adding that the family tried to search for her but was unable to find her.
A case was registered at the Khawaja Ajmer Nagri police station under Section  364-A (kidnapping or abducting a person under the age of fourteen) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
“The police took prompt and effective action by not only recovering the girl safely, but also arresting the main suspect involved in the kidnapping,” a statement by the Central Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) spokesperson Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said.
“The police team, led by Station House Officer Khawaja Ajmer Nagri Sarfaraz, conducted a successful operation within 24 hours,” it added.
The statement cited police sources, saying that the operation was completed in a “confidential and professional manner” to prevent harming the victim.
“During interrogation, the suspect revealed that his brother is in jail in the custody of Manghopir police and he kidnapped the girl to get ransom money for his bail,” the spokesperson said, adding that the suspect belonged to the girl’s family.
Further investigation was underway to unearth the facts, the statement read.
 
 

Earlier this week, police arrested a couple and their son-in-law for their alleged involvement in kidnapping a school-age child, who was found begging outside a mosque in Shah Latif Town on Monday, several months after his disappearance.
In March, a teenage girl kidnapped from Surjani was recovered from a roadside in Scheme-33 with “multiple physical injuries”.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. A total of 1,204 cases were of abduction and 241 cases of missing children.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.</p><small>2025-07-25 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615720-pakistan-urges-global-tech-firms-to-block-accounts-linked-to-banned-outfits' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges global tech firms to block accounts linked to banned outfits</strong></a><br><p>

In January, Pakistan became the first country to launch a longer-term country partnership framework (CPF) with the WB, after the bank’s board of directors approved the 10-year programme and pledged to provide $20 billion to Pakistan.
According to a WB statement, the new framework for the country aimed to “support inclusive and sustainable development through a strong focus on building human capital”, in addition to fostering durable private sector growth.
In today’s meeting, held at Chief Minister’s House, Shah highlighted the strong collaboration between the Sindh government and the WB across multiple development sectors, with the bank’s total active portfolio in the province now standing at $4.012bn.
“The WB has been an essential partner in Sindh’s development journey,” said Shah. “Their timely support during the flood recovery period, and their sustained engagement across key sectors have been instrumental in helping us meet our goals.”
The meeting was attended by provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon, Azra Fazal Pechuho, Nasir Shah, Sardar Shah, Saeed Ghani and Jam Khan Shoro. Also present were Karachi’s Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Special Assistant to the CM Saleem Baloch, Principal Secretary to the CM Agha Wasif, Planning and Development Chairman Najam Shah, Secretary of Local Government Waseem Shamshad, and others.
The WB delegation, led by Regional Vice President for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (Menaap) Ousmane Dione, included Country Director Bolormaa Amgaabazar, Special Assistant to Regional Vice President Lobna Hadji, Regional Practice Director Faida M. Saadah, and Regional Practice Director Almud Weitz, among others.
 






Multi-sectoral engagement
The WB is currently supporting Sindh in a broad range of sectors, including Sindh people’s housing for flood-affected people, education, health, agriculture, rural water, sanitation and hygiene, Karachi urban infrastructure, energy, social protection, and post-flood reconstruction.
The CM emphasised the provincial government’s development priorities, particularly in sanitation, health, education, energy, and investment in human capital.
Despite the productive collaboration, Shah also flagged several challenges requiring urgent attention.
He noted the absence of a dedicated WB procurement specialist in Karachi following the untimely passing of Uzma Sadaf, who had provided critical support during project evaluations.
He said that this vacuum had led to significant delays and disruptions in procurement and evaluation processes, urging the bank to station a qualified procurement expert in Karachi to streamline project implementation.
Sindh people’s housing for flood affectees
In 2022, Sindh experienced devastating floods that affected over 12.36m people, damaged 2.1m houses and resulted in 1,100 deaths. The floods also caused extensive destruction to schools, roads, agriculture, and livestock.
In response, the WB and international partners committed to rehabilitation efforts, facilitating the construction of resilient housing, with validations for 2m of the planned 2.1m houses completed. Over 1.3m bank accounts have been opened for aid, and 600,000 houses have already been built.
The initiative promotes gender inclusivity, with 300,000 land titles awarded to women, and has created over a million jobs for those affected. As recovery continues, the collaboration between the government and international partners is vital for rebuilding communities and restoring livelihoods.
Strategy for climate-resilient development
The chief minister, discussing the safely-managed water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) project, announced a targeted, technology-led plan to serve rural communities based on local water availability and climate conditions.
“Each village deserves a solution tailored to its geography,” the CM said. “This strategy ensures sustainability, equity, and resilience.”
According to Shah, the findings show that 48pc villages can access groundwater sources, 38pc are near surface water (within 2,000 feet of canals), 23pc are close to left bank and right bank outflood drains, and 14pc still need a viable water solution.
The CM said that to bridge this gap, the province was divided into six WASH zones, including coastal, arid, agricultural, and flood-prone areas. He added that solutions were being designed using drone surveys, AI mapping, and geo-tagging, with support from partners.
The CM also said that a robust monitoring, operation and maintenance system was being developed, along with the reuse of treated wastewater for mini forests and livelihood initiatives.
“This is more than infrastructure,” he said. “It’s about creating climate-resilient, dignified living for every household in Sindh.”
Karachi mobility, sewerage improvement projects
Highlighting the importance of modern urban transport infrastructure, the CM reiterated his government’s request for additional financing of over $170m for the Karachi Urban Mobility Project (Kump). The WB has so far committed only $86m, falling short of the required funds to realise the project’s scope fully.
CM Shah also urged the bank to expedite the approval of the project operations manual for phase two of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Services Improvement Project (KWSSIP-II), saying that this is the only condition remaining for loan effectiveness.
He called on both the WB and project management to ensure completion before the deadline of August 21 2025, warning against any further extensions.
Select project, social protection unit
Under the Sindh Early Learning Enhancement through Classroom Transformation (Select) project, all school construction contracts have been signed. However, due to implementation delays, they cannot be completed by the original loan closing date of April 30, 2026.
The CM requested a one-year extension until April 2027 to ensure successful completion. The WB delegation agreed to extend the project after meeting the required formalities.
Meanwhile, he also talked about the the Strengthening Social Protection Delivery Systems in Sindh project, which is progressing well and now includes seven additional districts, is currently set to close in December 2027. Given the scale and recent momentum, the CM requested a one-year extension to fully realise project objectives.
The chief minister emphasised that Sindh remains committed to enhancing institutional capacity and transparency in project implementation. He thanked the WB for its continued support, and called for sustained collaboration and faster decision-making to ensure the timely delivery of critical development interventions across the province.
The WB delegation acknowledged the issues raised and assured the CM of their commitment to addressing the challenges and advancing mutual development priorities.
Yesterday, PM Shehbaz Sharif met with the WB delegation in Islamabad, appreciating the World Bank’s (WB) support for Pakistan’s position in light of India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
The prime minister also thanked the WB for its generous assistance during the 2022 floods, and especially thanked WB President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their pivotal role in advancing the new CPF for Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-25 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/25153023c0b47ff.jpg?r=153458' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926526/france-defends-move-to-recognise-palestinian-state' target='_blank'><strong>France defends move to recognise Palestinian state</strong></a><br><p>France defended its decision to recognise Palestinian statehood amid domestic and international criticism on Friday, including against the charge that the move plays into the hands of Hamas.
President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that his country would formally recognise a Palestinian state during a UN meeting in September, the most powerful European nation to announce such a move.
 






Macron’s announcement drew condemnation from Israel, which said it “rewards terror”, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it “reckless” and said it “only serves Hamas propaganda”.
Mike Huckabee, US ambassador to Israel, quipped that Macron did not say where a future Palestinian state would be located.
“I can now exclusively disclose that France will offer the French Riviera & the new nation will be called “Franc-en-Stine”, he said on X.
Hamas itself praised the French initiative, saying it was “a positive step in the right direction toward doing justice to our oppressed Palestinian people”.
But French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Friday argued that Macron’s initiative went against what the militant group wanted.
“Hamas has always ruled out a two-state solution. By recognising Palestine, France goes against that terrorist organisation,” Barrot said on X.
 






With its decision, France was “backing the side of peace against the side of war”, Barrot added.
Domestic reactions ranged from praise on the left, condemnation on the right and awkward silence in the ranks of the government itself.
‘Counter-productive’, ‘pointless’
The leader of the far-right National Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella, said the announcement was “rushed” and afforded Hamas “unexpected institutional and international legitimacy”.
On the other side of the political spectrum Jean-Luc Melenchon, boss of the far-left France Unbowed party, called Macron’s announcement “a moral victory”, although he deplored that it did not take effect immediately.
Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, a right winger whose relationship with Macron is tense, declined on Friday to give his opinion, saying he was currently busy with an unrelated “serious topic” linked to the “security of French people on holiday”.
But the vice president of his party, Les Republicains, Xavier Bellamy, blasted the decision as possibly “counter-productive” or, at best, “pointless”.
The move risked “endangering Israeli civilians” as well as “Palestinian civilians who are victims of Hamas’s barbarism”, he said.
Bellamy said that Macron’s move was a departure from the president’s previously set conditions for recognition of Palestine, which included a Hamas de-militarisation, the movement’s exclusion from any future government, the liberation of all Israeli hostages in Gaza and the recognition of Israel by several Arab states.
“None of them have been met,” he said.
While France would be the most significant European country to recognise a Palestinian state, others have hinted they could do the same.
Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced he would hold a call on Friday with counterparts in Germany and France on efforts to stop the fighting, adding that a ceasefire would “put us on a path to the recognition of a Palestinian state”.
Norway, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia all announced recognition following the outbreak of the Gaza conflict, along with several other non-European countries.
Once France follows through on its announcement, a total of at least 142 countries will have recognised Palestinian statehood.</p><small>2025-07-25 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/25142446b29b6af.jpg?r=151057' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926521/lahore-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-ptis-shibli-faraz-summons-imran-khan-in-islamabad-police-attack-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore court issues arrest warrant for PTI’s Shibli Faraz, summons Imran Khan in Islamabad police attack case</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore court on Friday issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Senate opposition leader and PTI leader Shibli Faraz as well as summoned his party’s founder Imran Khan in connection with a case involving an alleged attack on the Islamabad Police outside Khan’s residence in 2023.
In March 2023, the Islamabad police lodged a first information report (FIR) against PTI founder Imran, party leader Faraz, along with 150 other party workers, for harassing and hurling life threats at an Islamabad police team when it visited Zaman Park in Lahore to arrest the former premier for skipping proceedings in the Toshakhana case.
The FIR was registered by the Race Course police on the complaint of Islamabad Secretariat Station House Officer (SHO) Nadeem Tahir, who alleged that Imran, with the connivance of Faraz and 150 charged party workers, committed a crime by dodging and barring the Islamabad police from discharging their duty.
Today, Judicial Magistrate Sohail Rafique, presiding over the case, ordered a non-bailable arrest warrant for Shibli Faraz and issued a summons notice to Adiala Jail authorities asking them to present the incarcerated PTI leader to the court.
Imran — who is currently imprisoned in Adiala jail  — has been summoned to court on July 30.
According to a Dawn report, the Islamabad Police team had decided to call off the “operation” since PTI leader Faraz informed them that Imran was “not available”.
However, later in the day, Imran’s presence at his residence was confirmed as he spoke to supporters from the same location. In response, the Islamabad police said action would be taken against Senator Faraz for “misrepresenting facts” in the way of legal action.
Earlier this month, several PTI leaders were handed down decade-long sentences by two anti-terrorism courts in Lahore and Sargodha in connection with cases registered in the aftermath of the May 9, 2023, violence.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, an Islamabad district and sessions court sentenced 13 PTI supporters to six months in jail in cases pertaining to last year’s November “Final Call” protests.</p><small>2025-07-25 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615707-sindh-govt-abolishes-all-parking-fees-on-karachis-public-roads' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt abolishes all parking fees on Karachi's public roads</strong></a><br><p>

The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as the region experienced cloudburst-induced floods that claimed lives and damaged infrastructure. On Monday, floods triggered by heavy rain swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, leaving many stranded. Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, in a statement, confirmed that nine people have lost their lives in the floods and landslides across the region — including two women and two children — while the search for people swept away by the flood is still underway.
In his statement, he estimated that the “number of people swept away by floodwater could be around 12-14.” On the other hand, more than a dozen people were reported to be injured in the floods.
“Over 300 stranded tourists have been rescued so far,” he said, adding that rescue operations have been challenging as floods and landslides continue to ravage parts of the region.
Detailing the property damage caused by floods and landslides, he stated, “In total, more than 500 houses have been destroyed due to the floods and about 12 kilometres of roads have been destroyed as well.”
 
 

He went on to say: “A total of 27 bridges and 22 vehicles were also destroyed by the floodwaters across the region, along with countless shops, cattle sheds and logs of timber.”
Both the Pakistan Army and GB scouts played an active role in the rescue and search operation, he said.
“Efforts are also underway to provide water and electricity to thousands of people who are now deprived of these facilities as a result of damage to the water supply and electricity grids,” Faraq said in his statement.
Search for drowned teenager continues in Punjab
Meanwhile, a search operation was underway to find the body of 17-year-old Arman, who was swept away while crossing a nullah in Gujar Khan on Wednesday, a Rescue 1122 official said on Friday.
“Rescue divers have combed through an area 12 km from the site of the accident without any success”, District Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Rawalpindi Sibghatullah said in a statement.
“The heirs of the victim have expressed their satisfaction over the rescue efforts,” he added.
On Thursday, residents of the housing society where the teenager lived blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body.
The boy was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.
Two of his relatives jumped into the water to rescue him, but they told Dawn.com that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p><small>2025-07-25 07:30</small></div><hr>
