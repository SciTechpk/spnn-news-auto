The president is seen in what appears to be an AI-generated color image, with his right index finger pointed toward the sky, wearing papal regalia, including white robes, a gold crucifix pendant and the miter hat.
 


It comes after Trump joked to reporters this week that he would like to be the next pope, just days before cardinals are due to start the conclave to elect the successor of Pope Francis who died on April 21.
Asked who he would like to succeed Pope Francis, Trump said: “I’d like to be pope, that would be my number one choice.” Trump went on to say that he did not have a preference but said there was a cardinal in New York who was “very good”.
He appeared to be referring to the archbishop of New York, Timothy Dolan, a theological conservative and fiercely opposed to abortion.
Trump attended the funeral service of Pope Francis last week, his first foreign trip since returning to power.
About 20 per cent of Americans declare themselves Catholic, and exit polls indicated in November that they voted around 60pc in favour of Trump.
Pope Francis had arguably been one of the most powerful moral voices on the world stage critical of Trump.
When Trump first ran for president in 2016, Francis was unsparing on his signature promise to build a border wall to seal off Mexico.
Francis told reporters, “Anyone, whoever he is, who only wants to build walls and not bridges is not a Christian.” Cardinals will gather on May 7 in a conclave in the Vatican’s Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope</p><small>2025-05-03 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/6815514bd920a.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908099/hbl-psl-2025-maaz-babar-keep-peshawar-zalmis-playoffs-pursuit-alive' target='_blank'><strong>HBL PSL 2025 : Maaz, Babar keep Peshawar Zalmi’s playoffs pursuit alive</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Peshawar Zalmi ensured their pursuit for the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) playoffs stayed alive as debutant Maaz Sadaqat and skipper Babar Azam starred in a low-scoring encounter to give their team a six-wicket win over Islamabad United here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday night.
Zalmi are placed fifth in the standings — with two points separating them from Karachi Kings — but mathematically still in it with three games to go. United, however safe at the top, have lost their second match in a row after winning five on the trot.
They were poor with the bat against Zalmi, giving them 144 to chase, before Babar and Maaz — both scoring half centuries — combined for 100 runs in 60 balls to help Zalmi bounce back from a difficult start to chase down the target with 20 balls to spare.
 


Zalmi were reduced to 40-3 in the powerplay with Kyle Mayer striking on the second ball of the innings to get Mitch Owen, Ben Dwarshuis making Saim Ayub play on to his stumps and Mohammad Haris falling victim to a spectacular catch by Naseem Shah off Riley Meredith’s bowling.
Babar and Maaz initiated their response with caution, with only 20 runs coming in the next three overs, before Maaz pulled, and smacked Mayers straight down the ground for two sixes to take his team to 76-3 at halfway stage.
Maaz punished a wayward delivery by Naseem in the 12th over to bring up his 50 partnership with Babar before pulling Dwarshuis for another six and scored two boundaries off Saad Masood’s spin in the next over to reach his half century.
After the youngster creamed Meredith through long-off for another four, Babar (53 not out off 49, four fours and a six) joined the party, lifting the pacer over the same region for his first six. He brought up his half century and the 100-run partnership with Maaz with a four off Naseem in the 16th over.
The very over saw Maaz (55 off 33, four fours and three sixes) fall, but by that point, he had virtually won Zalmi the match.
Earlier, after winning the toss, United struggled to bat on a bowling friendly surface, before Dwarshuis’ late cameo helped them to 143-9.
Dwarshuis, coming in to bat with United reeling at 107-7 at the start of the 17th over, smashed three fours and two sixes in his knock of 33 off 17 balls.
He broke United’s shackles with a splendid four over midwicket, picking a slower shorter delivery by Ahmed Daniyal before clubbing the pacer over long-on.
After seeing Imad Wasim lose his wicket on the other end, Dwarshuis cleared long-on again, this time off Alzarri Joseph’s pace before getting a lucky boundary. He was helped by Babar’s misfielding at long-off for four more as United closed their innings.
The start of it saw openers Sahibzada Farhan and Mayers — playing his first match of the season — see off immense pace and movement by Joseph and Luke Wood to reach 49-0 in the powerplay.
Zalmi missed an opportunity for an early breakthrough when Farhan, after surviving an lbw appeal on the first ball of the match, played Wood straight into the hands of Babar at mid-off, only for the Zalmi captain to drop him.
Farhan, having celebrated his reprieve by bludgeoning three fours and a six in the first six overs, however, saw Babar eventually take him in the ninth over with Ahmed striking.
Mayers followed suit three balls later to give fast bowler Mohammad Ali his first wicket before Saim got Salman Ali Agha as Haris took a brilliant catch behind to wickets with the scoreboard reading 75-3 at the end of the 11th over.
The incoming Shadab Khan had hit two fours to end Saim’s wicket-taking over, but the all-rounder holed Joseph out to Maaz at midwicket before Ali (3-26) returned to get Colin Munro and Saad.
Azam Khan was next in line to lose his wicket, with Wood bouncing him out before Dwarshuis took over.

This article was originally published on Aug 14, 2022.

PAKISTAN lost its democratic direction soon after its birth. If one goes through the events from 1947 to 1958, it is not difficult to reach the conclusion that freedom of the press had been among the first casualties after the death of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The Constitution was another, followed by the judiciary.
The dream of Quaid’s Pakistan ended with the first martial law, imposed months after the sitting army chief at the time was made the defence minister as well. That appointment, in the words of former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lt-Gen Hameed Gul, was the original sin in the history of military intervention in Pakistan’s politics.
Roedad Khan, who belonged to the first batch that was inducted into the Civil Service of Pakistan (CSP), disclosed to me recently that subsequent governments “always wanted to control the press. That was one of the reasons why black colonial laws were retained”.
Journalist and author, the late Asrar Ahmad, in his book Walls Have Ears wrote about how the English weekly Freedom, published jointly by M.H. Syed, the former private secretary of Quaid-i-Azam, and Yusuf Afghan, a columnist from Karachi, had greatly irked the administration. The then administrator, Syed Hashim Raza, ordered that all of the weekly’s content be submitted for scrutiny and approval to the district magistrate before publication.

Freedom of the press has been consistently violated by both military and civilian-led governments, making a free press today a receding dream

Constant pressure was exerted on the press in the early years of Pakistan through ‘press advisories’, colonial laws and other coercive measures. Whether it was Jinnah’s historic first address to the Constituent Assembly on Aug 11, 1947, or the questions regarding the fitness of the ambulance in which Jinnah was taken to hospital in Karachi, or the assassination of prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan, the press could not report events in any way other than the official versions of the event.
 
 

Jinnah himself had been strongly against press curbs. He had not signed the Public Safety Act as he feared it would be used against the press. It only became law after his death, and was followed by dozens of other anti-press laws. With them, the bureaucracy started controlling the press with a classic carrot-and-stick approach.
The government, through the Ministry of Information, controlled advertisements and used them to bargain with newspaper owners. Most of the latter became organs of the state and turned the press into a commercial industry. Pakistani media houses were never allowed to grow enough to become the eyes and the ears of the people. Instead, most of them became mouthpieces of successive governments. In the process, we lost both our freedom as well as our independence.
A respected editor of his time, the late S. Manzarul Hasan, once said: “The process of curbing the freedom of the press began soon after the creation of Pakistan. The proprietors who started publishing newspapers after independence had no concept of the relationship between the press and the government in a free country. For them, publishing a newspaper was an industry. And to make this enterprise profitable, they needed government help and patronage. The government was too happy to treat it as an industry. In return for this help and patronage, the proprietors surrendered the freedom of the press.”
Whatever happened in the first 10 years of our national life was repeated in the next 10; till 1968. The first martial law brought the press under government control through a new law, the reviled Press and Publication Ordinance (PPO), 1960, and its amended version of 1963. Through these laws, the government took control of Progressive Papers Ltd and other media enterprises, and brought reputable papers, like Pakistan Times, Morning News, Mashriq and Imroz, under its thumb.
The travails of Pakistani media did not end in the third decade. If anything, they became worse as the overall situation grew worse. The 1970-71 crisis in East Pakistan was never reported as it should have been journalistically speaking. Either out of fear of the state, or out of their own judgement, no media house presented a picture close to the reality of what was happening in the East Wing.
 
 

The hopes that things will improve under the country’s first elected government, under prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, soon stood shattered. Bhutto had promised greater freedoms, but he retained the black laws, and used other laws, like Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, against journalists. Quite a few publications, both newspapers and weeklies, were banned.
Midway through the third decade, the country’s third martial law, under Gen Ziaul Haq, was a true nightmare for the press. For the first time, journalists, in addition to being put behind the bars, were also flogged in public.
Zia’s Information Secretary, the late Lt-Gen Mujeebur Rehman, had so much power in his hand that even after Mohammad Khan Junejo was elected prime minister in 1985, he censored a line from the prime minister’s inaugural speech, in which he had said, “Democracy and Martial Law cannot go together.” When Junejo came to know about the omission, he summoned Gen Mujeeb, confronted him, and promptly sacked him.
Junejo not only abolished the PPO, but also allowed civil liberties. The press got some freedom, but till then, most newspaper owners had already capitulated, wishing to keep their commercial interests above press freedoms.
The fourth military takeover, led by Gen Pervez Musharraf, was unlike the draconian periods of Ayub and Zia. He did not come down hard on the media even in his initial years. Subsequently, he opened up space for private television channels, believing that in the post-Kargil period, India had won the war of narratives through its media.
A divided house
Today, the national media, including print, electronic and digital, is a divided house beset with all kinds of challenges; from direct threats and intimidation, to a crisis of credibility arising from a constant decline in professionalism.
People in the profession are often heard wondering rhetorically as the sheer inability of a government to put restrictions ‘in the age of satellite and internet’. Yet, in the last 10 years, nearly a thousand notices have been issued by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to private television channels for one reason or the other. I personally have copies of 600 such notices.
 
 

Many channels have been taken off air for one reason or the other, journalists have gone missing, some have been killed, and the voice of dissent is something that is no longer acceptable.
While the future of professional media is uncertain, the social media, with its own dimensions and attractions is an entirely different proposition. Any individual with a smartphone considers himself better informed than everyone else. Whether the information getting disseminated is factually correct or not is the least of anyone’s concern.
We have now fully entered the era of fake news where disinformation is sometimes the only information available. It has taken the country by storm. Gone are the days of professional journalism, when old-timers would admonish us to, “Get the news first, but first get it right.”
Author of four books on journalism, the late Zamir Niazi, once said: “This is not the age of mass media education, but of mass media disinformation and misinformation. The [media] owners are ready to spend millions on machines and technology, but are not prepared to spare even a few thousand on training the people behind the machine.” That is a bit more true today.
Modern-day challenges
A new era of democracy has given some relief to the media, but the famed ‘hidden hands’ continue to monitor and target journalists. In the last 13 years of uninterrupted democracy, nearly 50 journalists have been killed. Some regressively anti-media laws, like the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016, have also been passed.
Not only journalists, but rights activists and bloggers, particularly those critical of state policy, have become Peca’s prime target. This law is still intact and is being used to harass journalists.
 
 

Jinnah, during a speech in 1936, had raised his voice against the Indian Press (Emergency) Act of 1931, due to which newspapers had ceased publication. The issue was a speech made by Pandit K.K. Malaviya, which a paper had reproduced.
Jinnah argued: “The freedom of speech gives me a right to publish it and that I am not punishable … We have complete freedom to make any speech that we like, express any opinion we like, and we are not liable to any action outside by any court, civil or criminal … it is the privilege of the newspaper to have the proceedings published and so long as they are true, fair and faithful, it is not liable to any action.”
We are nowhere near Jinnah’s vision regarding freedom of expression and independence of media. We could never find the direction we lost soon after independence. Cracks have now clearly appeared on the pillars of the state. The fourth of those pillars, too, cannot stay immune to the happenings around it. Though it has grown in size, it has gradually lost its credibility.
There is, thus, an urgent need to revisit the foundations of Pakistani journalism. Freedom is, and must remain, our cherished destiny because, without it, one can neither have true democracy nor the rule of law.

Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened by the tragic stampede” at Lairai Devi temple in the village of Shirgao in the early hours of Saturday morning.
“Six people died even before they could be brought to the hospital,” Sawant told reporters.
He visited the hospital and said that “all possible support” would be given to the families of those killed or injured.
Vishwajit Rane, Goa state health minister said “approximately 80” people were injured.
“Five are critical and on ventilator support, while the remaining are being treated in the specially created emergency ward,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s office expressed “condolences to those who lost their loved ones”.
The Lairai Zatra is a key Hindu celebration in Goa and is marked by a fire-walking ceremony.
Deadly stampedes are notoriously common in Indian religious festivals.

However, there are growing complaints of Sikh pilgrims about the Indian government making it harder for them to visit the Kartarpur corridor.
Sardar Ranbir Singh and Sardar Shan Singh, who crossed the border from Indian Punjab, talking to Dawn, said they had to go through difficult processes to come to Pakistan. They said the Indian government was trying to control the number of visitors crossing the border to visit Kartarpur. They said Sikh pilgrims were given respect in Pakistan that’s why they wanted to visit this country.
Sardar Vir Singh, another pilgrim, said he had come to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib for the third time through the Kartarpur Corridor. He said he could not understand why the Indian government was afraid of sending Sikhs to Kartarpur. He said there was propaganda about Pakistan in India by a particular group that had created panic.
Sardar Lal Singh and Singhara Singh said the founder of Sikhism Baba Guru Nanak was born in Pakistan and that the Sikhs living all over the world could never say “death to Pakistan”. They requested the Sikhs around the world to come to Kartarpur to pay for religious rituals.
The Sikh pilgrims expressed their solidarity with Pakistan and said, “We will stand by Pakistan in difficult times”.
WOMAN HELD WITH DRUGS: Sialkot police arrested a woman drug dealer and seized from her ice, heroin and other drugs worth Rs3.5m besides Rs1m cash.
A team raided a house near the Dhedowali railways crossing and arrested Shama Tauqir, a resident of Street Salo Gujar of Sialkot. Police recovered 6kg heroin, 6kg ice, 7kg hashish and 8kg of opium from her. Police also recovered more than Rs1m cash from the suspect.
District Police Officer Faisal Shahzad told Dawn that Police Station Saddar SHO Muhammad Razzaq was given the special task to break the network of drug dealers. He added that the woman had contacts with drug pushers in Peshawar and she was selling drugs in the Sialkot, Sambrial, Daska and Pasrur areas through her network.
Inspector Razzaq said the woman drug dealer recovered from the drug was worth Rs3.5m. He said the police would arrest her accomplices.

Modi was inaugurating a port in Kerala on Friday, and mocking the opposition when the Indian government also blocked access to the official YouTube channel of Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for users in India, invoking concerns over national security and public order, Kolkata-based Telegraph newspaper said on Friday.
It said the move was part of a wider crackdown on Pakistani digital content, following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam that left 26 civilians dead, most of them tourists.
Users trying to access PM Shehbaz’s YouTube profile are now met with a standard message: “This content is currently unavailable in this country because of an order from the government related to national security or public order.”
This is the most high-profile block since similar action was taken against the YouTube channels of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the paper said.
India’s ministry of information and broadcasting has invoked emergency provisions under the Information Technology Act to direct major social media platforms to geo-restrict several Pakistani accounts that were allegedly involved in spreading anti-India narratives and misinformation.
Officials say the restrictions are part of a “coordinated counter-disinformation effort” in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
A notable segment of the crackdown has been directed at high-profile Pakistani cricketers, whose social media accounts enjoy massive Indian viewership.
“The Instagram handles of current and former players including Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf have been blocked for Indian users,” according to the report.
Attempts to access these profiles in India, it said, now return a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.”
The YouTube channels of Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Akhtar, and Basit Ali have also been geo-restricted, making their content inaccessible to Indian audiences.
The action, officials say, is based on concerns that these public figures were either directly sharing or amplifying content that could be used to spread anti-India sentiment, particularly in the wake of the Kashmir attack.
Former players including Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Afridi (on Instagram) continue to have visible accounts, although, according to the report, more profiles could be under review.
Earlier, the YouTube channels of Shoaib Akhtar, Syed Muzammil Shah, and Arzoo Kazmi, channels such as Duniya Merey Aagay, Ghulam Nabi Madni, HAQEEQAT TV and HAQEEQAT TV 2.0 were also blocked for Indian users.
 
 

Olympic javelin silver medallist Arshad Nadeem’s Instagram account has also been blocked in India. The tenth edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), currently underway, is not being broadcast or streamed in India. Broadcasters Sony Sports Network and FanCode suspended telecast of the tournament following the Pahalgam strike, The Telegraph said.
The restrictions go beyond politics and sport. Earlier, the Instagram profiles of leading Pakistani actresses Mahira Khan and Hania Aamir were blocked for Indian users. Other celebrities, including Ali Zafar and Fawad Khan, have also faced similar action in recent days.
Officials in the ministry said that the government would continue to monitor and act against digital assets that pose a threat to India’s sovereignty, particularly in the context of terrorism, defence and foreign affairs.
IMF programme
Separately, India has also asked global multilateral agencies, including the IMF, to review funds and loans provided to Pakistan, as New Delhi seeks “to corner the neighbouring state diplomatically”.
“We will be asking all multilateral agencies to review the loans and support to Pakistan,” Reuters quoted a government source as saying.
 
 

Pakistan secured a $7 billion bailout programme from the IMF last year and was granted a new $1.3 billion climate resilience loan in  March.
Although the IMF and India’s finance ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, an adviser to Pakistan’s finance minister said the IMF programme is  “well on track”.
“The latest review has been done well and we are completely on  track,” Khurram Schehzad told Reuters, adding that Pakistan had  very productive spring meetings with financial institutions in  Washington.
“We did about 70 meetings … interest has been very  high for investing and supporting Pakistan as the economy turns around,”  Schehzad said.

Chaired by Chief Secret­ary Khushal Khan and attended by heads and representatives of key government departments, the meeting focused on evaluating the roles and responsibilities of departments and institutions in case of war-like developments and agreed on a series of precautionary measures to manage any eventuality.
The chief secretary directed all government departments and institutions to remain on high alert and ensure that relevant machinery, equipment, and personnel were ready for immediate deployment.
The Food Department, which normally maintains one month’s stock of food supplies in hard-to-reach areas including the LoC, was instructed to double the quantity of stock. The Health Department was directed to ensure uninterrupted availability of medicines and medical staff, with all ambulances kept in functional condition.

All govt depts, institutions asked to remain on high alert; all leaves previously granted cancelled

 
 

The SDMA was designated as the focal agency for coordinating emergency response. It was tasked with ensuring the availability of non-food and non-perishable items in accordance with district-level contingency plans.
The possibility of using educational institutions as temporary shelters for displaced persons was also discussed. In case of prolonged tensions, strategies to minimise academic disruption for students were considered.
The Highways Department was instructed to keep the road connecting Naran (in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) with Neelum Valley’s Surgan area via Noori Top open for emergency movement and relocation.
 
 

The departments of Health, Education, Civil Defence, Communication and Works, Electricity, SDMA, and Rescue 1122 were declared essential services. All previously granted leaves for employees in these departments were cancelled with immediate effect.
The meeting learnt that around 427,000 people lived within five kilometres of the LoC in all 13 constituencies of the AJK Legislative Assembly — from Neelum to the southernmost Bhimber district — and were known for their resilience.

• NA speaker praises journalists for demonstrating exceptional patriotism in post-Pahalgam incident situation
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Fede­ral Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has called upon the federal and provincial governments, to respect press freedom and freedom of expression, which are fast eroding in the country.
In a joint statement issued on the eve of Press Freedom Day, being observed the world over to­­day, PFUJ Acting President Khalid Khok­h­­ar and Secretary General Ars­h­­­­ad Ans­ari condemned the recent am­­endments made by the federal and Punjab governments to stifle the freedom of expression.
They said the am­­endments to the Prevention of Elec­tr­onic Crimes Act (Peca) 2025 made by the federal government and the Def­amation Law passed by the Punjab As­­­sembly were aimed at controlling the media.
The PFUJ leadership also regretted that the Journalist Safety Act, adopted by Parliament long ago, has still not been enforced as neither the commission has been constituted nor its rules framed by the government.
 
 

They also accused the government of issuing government advertisements — a vital source of revenue for media outlets — to only those media organisations that are toeing the government line. They noted that those organisations which are taking an independent stand are being denied official advertisements.
They pointed out that English language daily Dawn was also being punished for taking independent editorial stance by stopping the official advertisement to that newspaper, which was founded by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
‘Journalism is public service’
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has paid rich tribute to journalists, editors, photographers, and media workers across Pakistan and around the world on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day.
In a statement issued by the Bilawal House, the PPP chairman said that the World Press Freedom Day serves as a poignant reminder that journalism is not merely a profession — it is a public service, a shield against tyranny, and a lifeline for any democratic society.
 
 

“In every unjust silence, in every muffled truth, freedom itself is wou­nded,” he added.  Mr Bhutto-Zardari pointed out that the unanimously pas­sed Constitution of 1973, which guarantees the freedom of speech, expression, and the press, was a historic gift from Quaid-i-Awam Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the country’s first elected prime minister.
He lauded the PPP-led Sindh government for taking a pioneering step by passing the Sindh Protection of Journalists and Other Media Practitioners Act, 2021, and establishing the Commission for the Protection of Journalists and Other Media Practitioners under this law.
The PPP chairman saluted the courage of media professionals who risk their lives to uncover and report the truth. He said: “A society without a free press is a body without a soul. Let us honour those who speak when others stay silent. Let us protect those who write so that we may read the truth.”
In his message, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said that freedom of the press is pivotal for the promotion of democratic values. He paid rich tribute to journalists serving in Palestine, Indian-occupied Kash­m­­ir, and other war-torn regions, recogni­sing their courage and professionalism.
Highlighting the role of Pakistani media during recent Indian aggressive policies in the region, Speaker Sadiq praised the journalistic community for demonstrating exceptional professionalism and patriotism. Through fact-based reporting, the media played a key role in revealing the true face of India to the international community.
 
 

He added that the role of the journalistic community is of vital importance in promoting a positive image of the country and fostering an informed society.
He also appreciated the important role played by journalists in the Press Gallery of the parliament, who serve as a bridge between legislative proceedings and the general public.
NA Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah affirmed parliament’s unwavering belief in freedom of expression and its commitment to ensuring that journalists have timely and accurate access to information. He said the National Assembly has consistently pursued legislation aimed at the protection and welfare of journalists.

The protests, part of a broader political movement launched by the PTI following the arrest of its top leadership, escalated into confrontational demonstrations across several cities. Marked by road blo­­ckades, clashes with law enfo­r­cement and vandalism of public property, the events led to the registration of 24 cases under anti-terrorism and public order laws.
Presiding over the hearing, ATC Rawalpindi judge Amjad Ali Shah announced that 82 individuals who confessed to participating in the protests were each sentenced to four months in prison and fined Rs15,000.
Out of some 1,100 individuals named in the 24 FIRs, 568 appeared in court, while 1,049 failed to attend the proceedings. The court dismissed bail for all 1,049 absconding individuals and ordered the blocking of their national ID cards, the freezing of their bank accounts, and the issuance of arrest warrants.

In addition, the bail applications of 25 under-trial accused were also rejected, bringing the total number of bail dismissals to 1,074. The court expressed concern over what it described as a deliberate obstruction of legal proceedings by the absentees, as highlighted by prosecutor Zaheer Shah.
 
 

The court also issued a contempt of court notice to PTI MNA Shandana Gulzar. According to prosecutor Shah, Ms Gulzar falsely claimed to be acting as a lawyer in the proceedings while simultaneously drawing a salary as a member of the National Assembly. He accused her of repeatedly interrupting the court and undermining its authority.
Judge Shah reprimanded Ms Gulzar for her conduct, and a separate notice was issued under contempt provisions. The hearing was adjourned until the next date.
The November 2024 protests occurred during a period of heightened political tension in the country. The PTI had been mobilising mass protests in response to the disqualification of its founding chairman Imran Khan from contesting elections, and the arrest of senior party leaders on charges ranging from sedition to corruption.
The PTI and its supporters mai­n­tained that these actions were politically motivated and part of a broader crackdown on dissent.
The protests turned violent in several cities, including Islam­a­b­­ad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Pesha­w­­ar and Karachi, resulting in injuries to law enforcement personnel and widespread public unrest.
In response, the government invoked the Anti-Terrorism Act to arrest and charge hundreds of PTI activists, drawing condemnation from human rights organisations and international observers.

According to sources, a group of armed men obstructed the national highway, intercepting numerous vehicles. They searched several vehicles, including passenger buses and private cars, halting all types of traffic along the route.
The sources said the armed group entered the Mongochar bazaar and took control of several government buildings, including the offices of Nadra, Judicial Complex, and National Bank of Pakistan, and set them on fire. The buildings suffered significant damage due to the fire.
The armed men fled the scene before security forces arrived.
Officials said that an operation was launched in the area, and traffic on the highway was restored late in the night.
In a separate incident, a group of armed men on motorcycles attacked a Levies check post near Kot-Langove, opening fire and killing a Levies official, identified as Haq Nawaz Langove.
 
 

Levies officials also reported a powerful explosion under a bridge on the Quetta-Karachi National Highway near the Rahimabad area of Kalat district, which slightly damaged a portion of the bridge. No casualties were reported.
Meanwhile, six people, including a woman and two children, were injured in a firing at a passenger coach in the Khudkocha area of Mastung.
Mastung Assistant Commissioner Akram Harifal said the injured were shifted to Ghous Bakhsh Memorial Hospital.

The fatal incident sparked public outrage as an angry mob set the water tanker on fire.
The police said that the driver responsible for the incident managed to flee.
DIG-Traffic Pir Mohammed Shah told Dawn that at around 10:10am, a loaded water tanker, driven recklessly by an unidentified driver, struck a motorcycle. As a result, Mushtaq, 52, and his wife Rehana, 48, were critically injured.
They were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where Rehana died during treatment. The condition of her husband was reported to be out of danger.
The DIG claimed that initial findings suggested reckless driving by the tanker driver was the main cause of the accident. However, he said, a preliminary technical assessment also indicated negligence on the part of the motorcyclist, who overtook the tanker from the left side, which is considered a blind spot for heavy vehicles.
Truck hits bike
A man was killed and another injured when a truck hit a motorcycle on National Highway on Friday, police said.
Bin Qasim SHO Tahir Qadri said that the pillion riders were hit by the truck near Ghaghar Phatak. As a result, the rider, identified as Sawab Khan, 30, died on the spot while Manzoor Khan, 25, was critically injured. The police had arrested the errant driver, Naseer Ahmed, and seized the truck, the SHO added.
Preliminary inspection revealed that the trailer had no documents such as fitness certificate or transport permit.
Meanwhile, a passenger died after a Datsun van collided with a stationary trailer on M.M. Alam Road in the Malir Cantonment area.

Khawar Hassan — a man in his 30s who goes by many aliases, but is most well-known as Fadi Gujjar — is unlike many other Pakistani smugglers. While others tend to boastfully advertise illegal routes to Europe online, he is more careful, advertising his services through word of mouth.
His online presence is limited to highly edited videos of his travels and almost all clients BBC Verify identified were local to his town of Jaurah, in Gujrat. In fact, two people he was close to — cousins Sufian Ali and Atif Shahzad — were among those who were beaten to death on a deadly boat journey he put them on.
Their uncle, Ahsan Shahzad Chaudhry, confirmed that his nephew Sufian was indeed friends with Fadi Gujjar.
The three men can be seen together in a TikTok video, posted to Fadi’s account, filmed at a beachside restaurant in Mauritania’s capital Nouakchott.
Within a month of this video being posted online, Ali and Shahzad were dead. Meanwhile, Fadi is on the run, wanted by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for his role in the Mauritania boat tragedy, which claimed the lives of at least 43 Pakistanis, among others.
According to the BBC, his current location on Facebook is set to Istanbul.
 
 

But it is Mauritania, on West Africa’s Atlantic coast, which is said to be the nerve-centre of his operation, and the place from which the migrant boat started its perilous journey. The route is deadly. IOM data shows that 170 people — including 14 children — have died or gone missing on it this year.
Pakistani authorities have named Fadi as one of ten smugglers involved in the tragedy and arrested some members of his family — his mother and one of his brothers — for collecting money on his behalf from people buying routes to Europe.
BBC Verify geo-located his most recent TikTok posts to Baku, Azerbaijan – although it cannot be said for certain if he is still there.
When contacted through WhatsApp via a number shared by survivors, Fadi Gujjar refused to address the allegations against him, claiming that his name was being misused, and that he “left everything up to Allah”.

• RSF notes ‘alarming deterioration’ of US press freedom under Trump
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to cut public funding for NPR and PBS, accusing the news outlets of being biased in his latest attack on traditional media.
Trump has long had an antagonistic relationship with most mainstream news media, previously describing them as the “enemy of the people”.
A notable exception is the powerful conservative broadcaster Fox News, some of whose hosts have taken on major roles in his administration.
National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) are only partly funded by US taxpayers through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and rely heavily on private donations.
Trump in his executive order instructed the CPB board of directors and all executive departments and agencies “to cease federal funding” for NPR and PBS.
He added that “neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens”.
The CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027, which raises questions about the scope of Trump’s order. Politico magazine described the order as “the White House’s biggest escalation yet in its assault on the media” and said it would likely be challenged in court.
‘Subsidisation of biased media’
The White House published on Thursday a fact sheet titled “President Donald J. Trump Ends the Taxpayer Subsidisation of Biased Media”.
It said that NPR and PBS “have fuelled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars, which is highly inappropriate and an improper use of taxpayers’ money”.
 
 

To support this accusation, the document listed a number of claims about the two media outlets, which it said receive “tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funds each year”.
For example, that “over a six-month period, PBS News Hour used versions of the term ‘far-right’ 162 times, but ‘far-left’ only six times”, the White House said.
It cited research — from an unnamed source — that showed that congressional Republicans have received far more negative media coverage than Democrats.
The fact sheet also listed an NPR feature about “queer animals”, and on PBS the appearance of a “drag queen” on a kid’s show and a movie “which celebrates a transgender teen’s transition”.
‘Alarming deterioration’ of press freedom
Meanwhile, media rights group RSF warned on Friday about “an alarming deterioration in press freedom” in the United States under Trump as well as “unprecedented” difficulties for independent journalists around the world.
Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, which has been tracking press freedom for the last 23 years, said its main index had fallen to its lowest-ever level.
“For the first time in the history of the index, the conditions for practising journalism are poor in half of the world’s countries and satisfactory in fewer than one in four,” an annual review of media freedom globally by the charity concluded.
 
 

RSF editorial director Anne Bocande highlighted the role of economic pressures in undermining fact-based reporting, with many independent outlets having to close because of funding difficulties.
Although spending on online advertising was still rising — hitting $247.3 billion in 2024, according to RSF — a growing share is captured by online giants Facebook, Google or Amazon rather than media companies.
“When journalists are impoverished, they no longer have the means to resist the enemies of the press — those who champion disinformation and propaganda,” Bocande said in a statement.
‘Authoritarian shift’
RSF highlighted how Trump had made difficult conditions worse by axing US financial support for state-backed broadcasters such as Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), as well as US foreign development aid that assisted media outlets overseas.
 
 

After a fall of 11 places in 2024, the United States declined another two to 57th place on the 2025 World Press Freedom Index, one behind formerly war-torn Sierra Leone in west Africa.
The index, calculated according to the number of violent incidents involving journalists and other data compiled by experts, was topped by oil-rich Norway for the ninth year in a row. Estonia and the Netherlands were second and third.
“In the United States, Donald Trump’s second term as president has led to an alarming deterioration in press freedom, indicative of an authoritarian shift in government,” RSF said. “His administration has weaponised institutions, cut support for independent media, and sidelined reporters.”
RSF also again highlighted the plight of Palestinian journalists seeking to report on Israel’s devastating bombardment of Gaza. Israel meanwhile had dropped a further 11 places to 112th and “continues to repress its own news media”.
Published in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025</p><small>2025-05-03 04:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/681564ca59849.jpg?r=092355' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908144/cartels-and-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>Cartels and consumers</strong></a><br><p>IN March this year, the Competition Commission of Pakistan issued an emphatic statement that it would take ‘strict action’ against ‘cartelisation’ in the sugar industry.
This was neither unusual, nor the first against the industry. Since commencing operations in 2007, the CCP has issued several orders punishing cartels in different sectors of the Pakistani economy. In fact, in 2021, it had found a cartel in the sugar industry and had imposed an aggregate penalty of Rs44 billion on the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association and 81 of its member sugar mills.
But what exactly are cartels? For the history buff, the mention of a cartel may evoke recollections of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its 1973 oil embargo against selling oil to the US.
 
 

A cinephile, however, might conjure images of Pablo Escobar running a drug cartel in Colombia and terrifying Colombian citizens and law-enforcement authorities alike. While both these scenarios are versions of cartels, the ones that the CCP goes after are more prosaic, more rampant, and, most importantly, more damaging to the Pakistani economy and the Pakistani consumer.
In simple terms, a cartel is an agreement. It means that sellers of a product, who should ordinarily be competing with each other for our business, instead join hands. For instance, they may agree to charge the same price for their products throughout the market, or they may agree to allocate regions among themselves so that they can all get a share of the market, or agree to only produce specific quantities so that they can charge a higher price for these products. The common factor in all such agreements is that they are designed to profit the sellers rather than the consumer or the economy.

While the CCP has certainly exercised its power to impose necessary fines on cartels, it has had much less luck in recovering them.

The harm that we, the consumers, suffer from such agreements is self-evident. For instance, we have no possibility of getting a better price for the product we need. Whether it is a bag of cement or fertiliser that we need, we will be faced by the same higher price wherever we go. This not only limits our choices in the market but also leaves less money in our pockets to buy other things we may require. In economic terms, this means that money from the consumer is transferred to the seller and while his profits have increased, our surplus or welfare has declined.
 
 

It is tempting to argue that though cartels may harm consumers, they are good for the economy because they allow sellers to make more money. However, this argument is flawed. Without the pressure to compete, members of cartels have no incentive to innovate to improve their products or their processes. In producing less than they can, they waste already limited economic resources. They also make it difficult for new entrants that are not members of the cartel to enter the market. Worse of all, they undermine trust in the economy. In time, this not only erodes investor confidence, it also stunts economic growth.
It is for these reasons that competition authorities around the world are particularly strict with cartels. For instance, the European competition regime, on which the Pakistani regime is based, declares that once the competition authority has discovered the existence of an agreement — whether or not it has been formally executed — which fixes prices, allocates markets, fixes quotas, etc, it will declare it illegal and punish all those who participated in it. It does not require any proof of the actual effect of the agreement on competition in the market and does not accept any defences that cartel members may raise.
 
 

However, the difficulty is that cartels are notoriously difficult to detect. People or companies seeking to enter an illegal and economically damaging arrangement are not likely to write these down or leave an evidence trail. Detection becomes nearly impossible in the digital economy, which can achieve consensus through algorithms.
Competition authorities have, therefore, introduced leniency regimes. These encourage whistleblowers to come forward on the promise that if they provide relevant information, they may reduce, if not entirely avoid, heavy cartel penalties.
Cartel investigations in Pakistan have often centred around trade associations, including associations representing newspapers, cement manufacturers, LPG importers, travel agents, poultry growers, jute, vanaspati, flour and sugar mill owners, ship’s agents, and authorised dealers of automobile manufacturers. Although associations have historically been formed to address legitimate industry-wide concerns or share best practices, the CCP has often found that companies have used the readymade association platform to engage in cartel activities.
Under the Competition Act, the CCP has the power to fine cartels in the sum of Rs75 million, or 10 per cent of the company’s annual turnover, as it deems fit. While the CCP has certainly exercised this power to impose necessary fines on cartels, it has had much less luck in recovering them.
 
 

Aggrieved companies have not only challenged CCP’s orders, but also its constitutionality and power to ask for information. The CCP has also suffered due to the delay in establishing the Competition Appellate Tribunal, which is required by law to hear appeals on CCP’s orders before they can be heard by the Supreme Court.
However, a light emerged in CCP’s otherwise gloomy skies in October 2020, when Justice Ayesha Malik, then still at the Lahore High Court, upheld the constitutionality of the Competition Act. This light became brighter with Justice Jawad Hassan’s November 2024 order clarifying that CCP’s showcause notices cannot be challenged before the courts, and the Competition Appellate Tribunal’s April 2025 order confirming the CCP order fining the vanaspati association for anti-competitive activities.
We, as consumers, can only hope that the government and the courts continue to play their part in ensuring that the CCP’s efforts to deliver for us and the economy, remain on track.

• CEO says most Apple products for sale outside US will still be made in China
SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Thursday reported first-quarter profit above expectations but warned that US tariffs could cost the company and were disrupting its supply chain.
Apple expects US tariffs to cost $900 million in the current quarter, even though their impact was “limited” at the start of this year, chief executive Tim Cook said on an earnings call.
Cook said he expected “a majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,” adding that Apple’s products were exempt from Trump’s most severe reciprocal tariffs for now.
“We are not able to precisely estimate the impact of tariffs, as we are uncertain of potential future actions prior to the end of the quarter,” Cook said.
“Assuming the current global tariff rates, policies and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added, we estimate the impact to add $900 million to our costs.”
Tit-for-tat exchanges have seen hefty US levies imposed on China, with Beijing setting retaliatory barriers on US imports. High-end tech goods such as smartphones, semiconductors and computers received a temporary reprieve from US tariffs.
Although completed smartphones are exempted from Trump’s tariffs for now, not all components that go into Apple devices are spared, said independent tech analyst Rob Enderle.
“The more components are crossing borders, the most cost flows through to the device,” Enderle explained.
“In the end, this all adds up to an expensive mess,” he said of the tariff situation.
Canalys research manager Le Xuan Chiew said Apple built up inventory ahead of the tariffs going into effect.
“With ongoing fluctuations in reciprocal tariff policies, Apple is likely to further shift US-bound production to India to reduce exposure to future risks,” he said.
While iPhones produced in mainland China still account for the majority of US shipments, production in India ramped up toward the end of the quarter, according to Canalys.
Cook said Vietnam would be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and AirPod products sold in the US.
 
 

China will continue to be where most Apple products are made for sale outside the US, he insisted.
“What we learned some time ago was that having everything in one location had too much risk with it and so we have, over time with certain parts of the supply chain, opened up new sources of supply,” Cook told analysts.
“You could see that kind of thing continuing in the future.”
Sales slip in China
Apple’s revenue of $95.4 billion in the recently ended quarter was driven by iPhone sales, with the company reporting $24.8bn profit for the quarter.
“Apple saw strong growth in the Americas and Japan,” said CFRA Research equity analyst Angelo Zino, noting part of the reason could have been ramped up orders to get ahead of US tariffs.
“China revenue declined three per cent, but the hope was for growth as subsidies were put in place to help stimulate demand in the region.”
Apple shares were down more than three per cent in after-market trading.
“The real story is in Tim Cook’s plans to navigate these unprecedented trade challenges,” said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne.
Apple’s plan to shift manufacturing to India “raises pressing questions about execution timeline, capacity limitations, and potentially unavoidable cost increases that will shrink margins, be passed to consumers, or have a mix of consequences,” Bourne added.

The Maltese government and Cypriot rescuers said they had responded to a distress call from the vessel, while Malta said all crew members were safe and made no mention of an alleged attack. The activists said they suspected Israel could be behind the attack, and Cyprus’s rescue agency said it had been informed by the island’s foreign ministry of an Israeli drone strike.
“At 00:23 Maltese time, the Conscience, a Freedom Flotilla Coalition ship came under direct attack in international waters,” the group said in a statement.
“Armed drones attacked the front of an unarmed civilian vessel twice, causing a fire and a substantial breach in the hull. “Israeli ambassadors must be summoned and answer to violations of international law, including the ongoing blockade and the bombing of our civilian vessel in international waters.” Asked whether the group believed Israel was behind the attack, a spokesperson said they “suspected” that was the case.

Kitchens warn food will run out in days after two months of Israeli blockade

“While we cannot confirm 100 per cent, we suspect it’s Israel,” Hay Sha Wiya said, calling the country “the primary entity interested in keeping us and any aid out of Gaza”.
Israel is known for conducting covert operations beyond its borders, including several during the Gaza conflict that it only acknowledged later. The activists said the strike appeared to target the boat’s generator.
Following the distress call, the Malta Vessel Traffic Services body dispatched a tugboat and offered support. “The tug arrived on scene and began firefighting operations. By 0128 hrs, the fire was reported under control,” the Maltese statement said.
‘Two weeks of supply left’
The American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), a US-based organisation running one of the community kitchens in Gaza, warned that the few dozen remaining food kitchens are set to close in days, the BBC reported.
The organisation’s warning comes amid Israel’s two-month long blockade of all food supplies from entering Gaza. “The coming days will be critical. We expect we have two weeks’ supply, maybe less”, said Sami Matar, who leads the Anera team, reported by the BBC.
On 2 March, Israel shut all crossings to Gaza — preventing all goods, including food, fuel and medicines from entering — and resumed its military offensive two weeks later, ending a two-month ceasefire with Hamas. It said these steps were meant to put pressure on Hamas to release the prisoners it still holds.
“People rely on our meals; they have no source of income to buy what’s left in the local markets and many foods are not available”. “In the past we used to cook rice with meat — with protein. Now, because of the closure, there’s no type of meat, no fresh vegetables,” said Matar.

“All the options are [on the table], including raising it in the Security Council. We will take the decision at the appropriate time,” said Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, at a news conference at the UN headquarters on Friday. He was responding to a question from the president of the UN Correspondents Association (UNCA).
Ambassador Evangelos Sekeris of Greece made his remarks on Thursday while briefing UN reporters in New York on the Security Council’s work programme under Greece’s month-long presidency.
“We are in close contact … but this is something which might happen, I would say, sooner rather than later. We will see, we are preparing. It’s the first day of our (UNSC) presidency,” Sekeris said.

Envoy to UN says Guterres, heads of General Assembly and Security Council, OIC Group in New York have been briefed on Pakistan’s position

He noted that a formal request had not yet been submitted but emphasised the value of such a discussion.
“Of course, if a request comes for a meeting, then… I think this meeting should take place because, as we said, maybe it’s also an opportunity to have views expressed and this might help to diffuse a bit tensions. We will see.”
Pakistan’s envoy warned that the current crisis could escalate rapidly.
“In this politically motivated and highly provocative environment created by India’s irresponsible and destabilising actions in the wake of the Pahalgam attack … as we speak, there is reasonable intelligence indicating towards imminent threat of kinetic action by India against Pakistan.”
 
 

He said Islamabad had already briefed key international stakeholders: “We have briefed the UN Secretary-General, Presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council, the OIC Group in New York, and fellow members of the Security Council. We have also shared our position and concerns with various other international partners.”
Should India initiate hostilities, he said, “Pakistan will exercise its inherent and legitimate right to self-defence, as enshrined in the UN Charter”.
At the same time, Ambassador Asim condemned terrorism in clear terms. “Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Nothing justifies targeting of innocent civilians. We are concerned over the loss of lives in the Pahalgam attack, and we extended our condolences.”
He also criticised India’s reported move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). “Holding of IWT in abeyance is unilateral and illegal. There are no such provisions in the Treaty. India’s unilateral and unlawful actions are bound to undermine regional peace and stability with catastrophic implications.”
Ambassador Sekeris acknowledged the seriousness of the situation. “I have to tell you that we are also seriously concerned with the growing bilateral tension in the atmosphere, which has been evolving between India and Pakistan.”
“We are also joining others who are calling for de-escalation and dialogue so that the situation does not spiral out of control,” he added, noting that larger member states were in contact with both sides.
On the Pahalgam incident, Sekeris said, “It’s an issue which is very pertinent. As I said before, as a position of principle, we strongly condemn any act of terrorism and this is what we did” on the “heinous terrorist attack” in Pahalgam in which innocent civilians died.
He added, “Both India and Pakistan are far larger than Greece. So the size and volume are of a different nature. We also join calls for de-escalation and dialogue so that the situation does not spiral out of control”.

The assailants, who accused the men of being responsible for terrorism, vandalised their stall and ordered them to leave town.
For over two decades, Dar made a living selling embroidered Pashmina shawls in this town. But his Kashmiri identity has now made him a target.
“They told us we didn’t belong here,” Dar said from  his home in India-held Kashmir, where he returned out of fear. “We left everything  behind — even goods worth thousands of dollars. We’re too  scared to go back.”
Footage of the assault quickly spread online, prompting police to  arrest three men. But they were released hours later with a fine and an  apology. By then, Dar and dozens of other Kashmiri traders had already  fled.
The backlash reflects a growing pattern of harassment targeting Kashmiris across India following the attack in Pahalgam.
In Indian Punjab, Ummat Shabir, a nursing student, said  her neighbour called her a “terrorist who should be thrown out”.
“My classmate was thrown out of a  taxi after the driver found out she was Kashmiri,” she said. The two  returned to India-held Kashmir after a three-day journey, fearing for their safety.
Even in Mussoorie, where Dar and his colleague Shafi Subhan had worked peacefully for decades, the atmosphere has changed.
“After the Pulwama attack in 2019, there was tension, but no one touched us,”  said Subhan, who has sold shawls in the town for 20 years. “This time,  no one stepped in to help us. People just watched. It hurt us physically — but emotionally, a lot more”
The violence  in Pahalgam — one of the deadliest attacks on civilians in recent years —  sparked widespread anger in India. Politicians across the spectrum  called for strong retaliation and many reports have emerged of  Kashmiri vendors and students facing threats and abuse in cities like  Delhi, Jaipur, and Chandigarh.
 
 

In response to the attack, Indian security forces launched a sweeping crackdown in held Kashmir, detaining thousands, sealing off tourist sites, increasing troop presence, and demolishing homes allegedly linked to Kashmiri fighters.
Rights groups and some local leaders have criticised the government’s response, calling the demolitions a form of collective punishment.
“Don’t let innocent people become collateral damage,” occupied Kashmir  Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said. His predecessor, Mehbooba Mufti,  warned authorities to distinguish “between terrorists and civilians”.

The observation came in response to the assertion of senior counsel, Hamid Khan, who cited the 2016 Quetta carnage inquiry by the Justice Qazi Faez Isa-led commission, and the 2011 Memo Commission inquiry, to lend strength to his argument that a judicial commission could probe the election disputes.
When the senior counsel, who was connected via a video link, said he had placed the additional documents related to the commissions on record, Justice Aminuddin reminded him that the matter was taken up by the court on a suo motu, a facility which may not be available now.
The counsel then referred to the 10-judge bench decision regarding the 2011 Memo Commission, in which there was a detailed discussion about taking cognizance of the issue on part of the Supreme Court.

Justice Mandokhail questions Hamid Khan’s plea seeking formation of judicial commission to probe rigging in Feb 8 polls; asks how an alternative forum can be created when election tribunals already exist

However, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail remarked that the counsel was referring to cases in which an alternative judicial remedy was not available.
“When there is an alternative judicial forum [available in the present case], how the constitutional bench can create a new forum on its own,” he said.
He reiterated that an alternative judicial remedy — election tribunals — was available under the Constitution to adjudicate electoral disputes.
Before returning the petition, which was filed by Mr Khan and his party, the constitutional bench at a previous hearing ordered removal of the objections raised by the registrar’s office.
Fallout on tribunal cases
During the proceedings on Friday, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar asked the counsel about number of election disputes pending before tribunals. He reminded the counsel what his client was seeking “may halt the entire process since all the cases before the tribunals will end”.
The counsel explained that no decisions had been made by election tribunals despite the lapse of a year.
When Justice Mandokhail asked him to advance arguments and identify errors in the objections by the registrar, the counsel requested for adjournment so that he may satisfy the court about the office objections.
Justice Mandokhail, however, said another adjournment was just not possible as the previous hearing, too, was postponed on the request of the counsel. “The case cannot be fixed again and again,” the judge remarked.
The counsel alleged that the registrar’s office had turned a blind eye to the petitions, which have political implications, while raising objections.
Objections overturned
Justice Aminuddin, after consulting with other judges overturned the objections of the registrar’s office with a direction to the office to allot case number to the petitions without assigning any next date for the case.
In his petition, the PTI sought immediate suspension of all consequential acts of forming governments at the federal and the Punjab levels until the findings of the judicial commission was made public.
The petition regretted that a political party having elected members in the national and provincial assemblies could not be deprived of the reserved seats.
A judicial commission, constituted in 2015 to probe PTI’s allegations of rigging in the 2013 general elections, concluded that polls were in large part conducted fairly and in accordance with the law. That commission was formed under a presidential ordinance on April 3, 2015 after months of a tug of war between the PTI and the PML-N in which it had recorded testimonies of 69 witnesses, including politicians, government and judicial officers and journalists.
In its fresh petition, the PTI emphasised that the courts could not turn a blind eye to the allegedly “obvious and apparent acts of high handedness, cruelty, oppression, suppression and violation of fundamental rights” on part of the caretaker government and the “illegitimately installed governments” at the federal and provincial levels.

The attacks came hours after Russian strikes on the southern city of Zaporizhzhia wounded more than two dozen people.
Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian areas have killed dozens of people in recent weeks despite the United States talking with both sides in a bid to end Moscow’s three-year invasion.
“The number of wounded in the massive attack on Kharkiv by Shahed UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) has increased to 35 people,” Kharkiv governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on Telegram.
He earlier said a private house, a high-rise building, a shop and a car park were damaged in the drone strikes.
Kharkiv lies close to the Russian border and has been relentlessly attacked throughout Moscow’s invasion.
The attacks come after Kyiv and Washington signed a landmark deal for the extraction of minerals in Ukraine.
Russia has announced a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine next week that coincides with World War II celebrations in Moscow.
Kyiv has denounced it as a “manipulation” that is “just for a parade” that the Kremlin holds on Red Square every year.</p><small>2025-05-02 21:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602889-pakistan-considers-unsc-meeting-when-appropriate-over-kashmir-fallout' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan considers UNSC meeting 'when appropriate' over Kashmir fallout</strong></a><br><p>

Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin on Wednesday ordered the internal investigation to determine whether there had been any judicial “failures”, according to a letter of assignment seen by AFP on Friday.
Results are expected by the end of July.
Dominique Pelicot, 72, was sentenced to 20 years in jail for raping and organising for dozens of men to rape his then wife Gisele Pelicot from 2011 to 2020 while she was drugged.
The case, which shocked the world and turned his ex-wife into a feminist hero, was uncovered after police caught him filming up women’s skirts at a supermarket in 2020.
During the months-long trial, it emerged that Dominique Pelicot had also been arrested a decade earlier in a shopping centre for the same offence and that police had taken a sample of his DNA.
Investigators identified a “link to an unknown sample collected in a previous probe opened after an attempted rape” in 1999, as well as a connection to a second case of rape and murder dating back to 1991, the letter said.
Despite this, they do not appear to have further pursued these leads in 2010. Dominique Pelicot was only charged in both cases in January.
He has admitted to the 1999 attempted rape, but denied involvement in the 1991 rape and murder case.
Similarities in the two cases include both the victims having been young real estate agents aged 23, who were visited by a man under a false name to view an apartment.
In a separate case, Dominique Pelicot’s daughter, Caroline Darian, in March filed a legal complaint accusing her father of also drugging and sexually abusing her.</p><small>2025-05-02 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02194729f041957.jpg?r=195546' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907990/highly-anticipated-video-game-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-postponed-to-may-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Highly anticipated video game Grand Theft Auto VI release postponed to May 2026</strong></a><br><p>The creative team behind the popular Grand Theft Auto videogame series postponed the launch of the latest instalment by several months to May 2026, hitting shares of parent Take-Two Interactive.
Grand Theft Auto VI was originally due to be released later this year, with a trailer having shown that it would be set in a Miami-like Vice City and would feature a playable female protagonist for the first time.
 


“We are very sorry that this is later than you expected,” publisher Rockstar Games said in a statement.
“With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception,” it said.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.”
Its predecessor, GTA V, was released in 2013 and sold more than 200 million copies.
Strauss Zelnick, chief executive of Take-Two, supported the move in a statement released by the parent company.
“While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence,” Zelnick said.
The first trailer for GTA VI appeared in December 2023 and has been seen more than 250m times on Rockstar’s YouTube channel.
Set to the Tom Petty song “Love Is A Long Road,” it opens with a female character named Lucia being released from prison in what appears to be a fictionalised version of Florida.
Near the close of the one-minute-and-30-second clip, she tells her male partner in crime: “The only way we are going to get through this is by sticking together, being a team.”
The pair go on to burst into a store with pistols drawn and bandanas covering the lower halves of their faces.
Fans saw the scene as confirmation that rumours of a “Bonnie and Clyde” type crime couple are coming true.
Along with its wild success, the GTA series has faced criticism over its violent content.
Critics have from the beginning accused Grand Theft Auto of glorifying violence and encouraging players to engage in criminal behaviour — allegations rejected by New York-based Take-Two Interactive.
GTA players sell drugs, fight, rob, go on car rampages and more. Gameplay options also included assaulting sex workers and going to strip clubs, raising the ire of activists.</p><small>2025-05-02 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602876-pakistan-will-strike-if-india-attempts-block-indus-river-warns-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will strike if India attempts to block Indus River, warns Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>

Relations between the two neighbouring countries turned hostile following an April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
In the aftermath of the attack, India suspended the Indus Water Treaty, and the two countries closed their airspace to each other’s airlines.
Pakistan secured a $7 billion bailout programme from the IMF last year and was granted a new $1.3bn climate resilience loan in March.
The IMF Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new arrangement, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing bailout programme, the global lender said earlier this week.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Shehzad said that the programme was “completely on track” and the review was “done well”.
He said that they conducted “very productive meetings” with the IMF, World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other International Financial Institutions.
“While in the spring meetings in DC, we did about 70 meetings within (a) span of six days,” he said, adding that interest was very high for investing and supporting Pakistan as the economy turned around and raters gave a positive outlook while upgrading the ratings as well.
Separately, India raised concerns with the IMF on its loans to Pakistan, asking for a review, a government source told Reuters without elaborating.
The IMF and India’s finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment by Reuters.
The programme is critical to the $350bn economy and Pakistan said it has stabilised under the bailout that helped it stave off a default threat.
The soaring tensions between the two countries have drawn global attention and calls for cooling tempers.
US Vice President JD Vance said yesterday that Washington hoped Pakistan would cooperate with India to hunt down the assailants.
“And we hope, frankly, that Pakistan, to the extent that they’re responsible, cooperates with India to make sure that the terrorists sometimes operating in their territory are hunted down and dealt with,” Vance had said.</p><small>2025-05-02 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/02191532e4638e5.jpg?r=203908' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907995/pahalgam-tensions-army-leadership-warns-of-decisive-response-against-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pahalgam tensions: Army leadership warns of decisive response against any Indian attempt to impose war</strong></a><br><p>The army’s top brass on Friday warned India of a “sure and decisive” response should it attempt to impose war, as relations deteriorated between Islamabad and New Delhi amid rising tensions after last week’s attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to the military. As Pakistan, in the early hours of Wednesday, said it expected an Indian incursion within 24–36 hours, diplomatic channels have been engaged to prevent conflict.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir warned a day ago that “any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response.”
A press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the army chief presided over a special session of the Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi today in which the military brass conducted a comprehensive review of the prevailing geo-strategic environment, with particular emphasis on the current Pakistan-India standoff and the broader regional security calculus.
“While reaffirming Pakistan’s abiding commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity, the forum made clear that any attempt to impose war will be responded to, surely and decisively and aspirations of people of Pakistan shall be respected at all costs,” the ISPR said.
“The forum reaffirmed the unflinching resolve of the Pakistan Armed Forces to uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country against any aggression or misadventure,” it added.
The ISPR said the army’s top brass reiterated that Pakistan’s path to peace and development would not be deterred by terrorism, coercion or aggression — whether directly or through proxies.
“Deliberate destabilisation efforts by the Indian government will be confronted and defeated with resolve and clarity,” the statement said.
The ISPR said COAS Munir lauded the military’s “unwavering professionalism, steadfast morale and operational preparedness”, saying that it stood in unity with the nation to defend the homeland at all costs.
The army chief also highlighted the critical importance of “heightened vigilance and proactive readiness” across all fronts amid the situation.
 
 

The statement said the CCC participants expressed grave concern over the “intensification of Indian atrocities” in occupied Kashmir in the attack’s aftermath, as well as the continued targeting of innocent civilians along the Line of Control by Indian occupation forces.
They reiterated that such “inhumane and unprovoked acts” served only to escalate regional tensions and would be met with a “resolute and proportionate response”.
“The forum noted, with serious concern, India’s consistent pattern of exploitation of crises to achieve political and military objectives. They have been following a predictable template — whereby internal governance failures are externalised. These incidents have often coincided with unilateral moves by India to alter the status quo, as seen in 2019 when India similarly exploited the Pulwama incident to unilaterally alter the status quo of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, through revocation of Article 370.
“In the latest instance, the Pahalgam episode appears to be part of a deliberate strategy to divert Pakistan’s focus away from the western front, as well as ongoing national efforts for economic revival; the two fronts where Pakistan is decisively and sustainably gaining grounds. Such diversionary tactics aimed at providing operational breathing space to Indian terror proxies will never succeed.
“In the same vein, the forum expressed serious concern that India is now exploiting the Pahalgam incident to undermine the longstanding Indus Waters Treaty, seeking to usurp Pakistan’s legitimate and inalienable water rights. This constitutes a dangerous attempt to weaponise water, threatening the livelihood and sustenance of over 240 million Pakistanis and escalating strategic instability in South Asia,” the ISPR said.
 
 

It added that the CCC members also “voiced deep alarm over credible evidence of direct Indian military and intelligence involvement in orchestrating terrorist activities” inside Pakistan.
The ISPR said these state-sponsored actions were in blatant violation of international norms and were universally unacceptable.
The statement said the meeting concluded with the COAS expressing “complete confidence in the operational readiness, deterrence posture and morale of all formations and strategic forces to defend the nation across the entire threat spectrum”.
Morale is high thanks to our army chief: Khawaja Asif
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said morale was high among the armed forces and the public under COAS Munir’s command,
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the defence minister lauded the army chief for his “high resolve” following today’s corps commander meeting, calling his command “befitting”.
“Over the past five days, the way he (the army chief) has met troops in the various cantonments, the LoC and the working boundary has contributed to high morale among the armed forces and the people,” Asif said. “God willing, the situation will be just like the communique after the corps commander meeting.”
The defence minister reiterated that India’s allegations held no credibility and that Indians were turning against Modi’s narrative.
“After the attack, they filed an FIR and levelled allegations, raising a hue and cry,” Asif said. “Reports are emerging that there were preparations for the attack and that allegations would be made against Pakistan.
“Till now, there is not a shred of evidence,” he added. “They carried this out for their political gains. Otherwise, there is no credibility.”
 
 

The defence minister highlighted that “no country in the world” believed India’s version of events or supported them following the incident.
“Nobody is believing their story, even his (Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s) people and media are not standing behind it,” Asif said, noting: “He’s a desperate man, you can expect anything from him, but this is a major defeat against the narrative he has tried to create.”
Asked about an interview with a former indian intelligence chief, Asif said he saw the interview and noted that his diction indicated Modi’s credibility.
“If you base your politics on lies on such a heightened pitch … then you will ultimately fall flat on your face, and they have,” Asif said.
In response to a question about the potential suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and weaponisation of water, Asif said Pakistan would pursue legal action against India’s suspension of the treaty.
“They can’t deny us our rights [under the treaty],” Asif said. “Based on what I know of geography, the Chenab and Jhelum flow from Kashmir. Its location does not allow for them to be diverted.
“Architecturally, practically, this is not possible,” the defence minister said. “This is an established treaty … violating it is not easy.”
Asked if any diversions of waterways counted as an act of war, Asif said, “Absolutely. If they construct any structure to divert water, then we have the right to strike it; it is an act of war.
“For the time being, we are approaching all fora — including the IWT — and pursuing action.”</p><small>2025-05-02 16:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/021920101eab40e.jpg?r=192138' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907988/pm-shehbaz-urges-saudi-arabia-gulf-allies-to-help-ease-tensions-in-region' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz urges Saudi Arabia, Gulf allies to help ease tensions in region</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday urged Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies to impress upon India to de-escalate and defuse tensions in South Asia in the wake of plummeting ties between the two countries following last week’s militant attack in occupied Kashmir, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults on civilians in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership have rejected the accusation and called for a neutral probe.
As tensions continue to simmer in light of the attack, Pakistan on Thursday had engaged a host of friendly nations, including China, to seek their support for de-escalation measures between the nuclear states and to take them into confidence regarding the ‘weaponisation’ of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.
A press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz continued his engagements with other countries over the current political climate in the region.
“He urged brotherly countries, including Saudi Arabia, to put pressure on India to reduce tensions in the region. He reiterated Pakistan’s desire for peace and stability in South Asia,” the PMO statement said of his meeting with Saudi Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Maliki.
The premier made a similar request in a separate meeting with Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi. PM Shehbaz also met Ambassador of the State of Kuwait Nasser Abdulrahman Jasser.
While sharing Pakistan’s stance with the ambassadors on the recent situation in South Asia following the Pahalgam incident, the prime minister said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.
“It had rendered great sacrifices in its counter-terrorism efforts over the years. This was done not only to protect Pakistan but the entire world,” the prime minister said.
 
 

He outrightly rejected “baseless Indian accusations” linking Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident without any evidence and reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral international investigation into the incident.
Emphasising the government’s complete focus on consolidating the hard-earned economic gains of the past 15 months, the prime minister said it was “inconceivable for Pakistan to act irresponsibly to jeopardise its achievements and derail the country from the path of economic progress” or take such an action that could imperil regional peace and security.
The prime minister thanked the Saudi leadership and people for always standing in solidarity with Pakistan through thick and thin.
The Saudi ambassador thanked the prime minister for sharing his views on this important issue and said that Saudi Arabia wanted to work with Pakistan for peace and security in the region.
During the meeting with the UAE ambassador, the prime minister thanked the UAE for its unwavering support to Pakistan, saying it “bore testament to the historic, deep-rooted, fraternal ties between the two countries”.
The UAE ambassador thanked PM Shehbaz for sharing Pakistan’s position and said that the UAE would work closely with Pakistan to maintain regional peace and security.
PM Shehbaz shared that Pakistan was reaching out to other friendly countries to present its position on the current crisis.
During the meeting with the Kuwait ambassador, the prime minister noted the strong, historic, brotherly relations between Kuwait and Pakistan.
The premier said that he looked forward to the visit of Crown Prince Sheikh Sabah Al-Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah at the earliest possible time.
The Kuwaiti ambassador thanked PM Shehbaz for sharing Pakistan’s position and affirmed that Kuwait shared Pakistan’s vision for regional peace and security.
PM Shehbaz had contacted Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong a day ago regarding the situation.
 
 

The Gulf states — traditionally viewed as friendly toward India due to strong economic ties and the presence of a large Indian diaspora — have chosen a measured, noncommittal approach amid the tensions. Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar have all issued statements emphasising de-escalation and peaceful resolution.
These responses were less about backing India’s position and more about protecting their own strategic interests.
Meanwhile, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also continued his engagements and held a telephonic conversation with Panama FM Javier Eduardo Martinze-Acha Vasquez.
Dar briefed him on the current regional situation, including India’s “inflammatory propaganda and its illegal unilateral actions against Pakistan”, including holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty in a clear violation of international law, according to a Foreign Office press release.
FM Vasquez emphasised that both sides should exercise restraint.
Being non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to international peace and security.
Dar also held a similar talk with Denmark FM Lars Løkke Rasmussen, briefing him on the evolving regional situation and the measures taken by the National Security Committee in response to India’s actions.
He strongly rejected India’s decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, saying it was a clear violation of treaty provisions and international law.
Dar underscored Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty and national interests, while contributing to regional peace and security.
Expressing concern over the escalation, FM Rasmussen emphasised the importance of both sides exercising restraint.
“The two leaders agreed to maintain close contact on regional and global developments, particularly at the UNSC, as non-permanent members.
“They also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation, especially in areas of economy and investment, as well as promoting high-level exchanges,” the FO said.</p><small>2025-05-02 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602852-army-vows-to-respond-surely-decisively-to-any-indian-attempt-to-impose-war' target='_blank'><strong>Army vows to respond 'surely, decisively' to any Indian attempt to impose war</strong></a><br><p>
