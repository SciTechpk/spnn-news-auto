The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Tehran since Israel first struck Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently denied the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top commanders, scientists and hundreds others. Both countries have traded wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.
Critics, analysts and key US lawmakers have debated the legality of Trump’s decision to strike Iran without prior approval from Congress.

What authority does the president have to launch such a strike?
According to Article II of the US Constitution, the president has the authority to order the use of military force to defend the US and US persons against actual or anticipated attacks, as well as advance other important national interests.
Previous US presidents — both Democratic and Republican — have deployed US forces and ordered the use of military force without congressional authorisation on numerous occasions, according to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).
In addition to the powers granted to the president in Article II, Article I of the US Constitution gives Congress the authority to “declare War.”
However, this authority has never been interpreted — either by Congress or the executive branch — to require congressional authorisation for every military action that the president could initiate.
Should Trump have obtained congressional authorisation to strike Iran?
The War Power Resolution of 1973 curbed the president’s war-making powers.
While the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and can order attacks, his decisions must be within the guidelines of what is authorised by Congress, according to Al Jazeera.
However, the president can order the military in the case of a “sudden attack” or to respond to emergencies.
With regard to whether or not congressional authorisation is required as a matter of law, both Republican and Democratic presidents have generally preferred, for political and legal reasons, to seek congressional authorisation— or say that they are acting under previous authorizations — for any substantial or prolonged use of military force, CFR states.
President George H. W. Bush sought and received congressional authorisation for the Gulf War in 1991, and President George W Bush sought and received authorisations in 2001 and 2002 to use force against the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks and against former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein.
How did US lawmakers react to the strikes?
Key progressive Senator Bernie Sanders was speaking at a rally in Oklahoma when Trump announced the attack.
“It is so grossly unconstitutional,” he said. “All of you know that the only entity that can take this country to war is the US Congress; the president does not have that right.”
 






US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Trump has “impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations,” adding that his decision was “absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.”
She also emphasised that bombing Iran was a “grave violation” of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers.
 






US Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib echoed the same sentiment, saying: “The American people do not want another forever war.”
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, applauded the operation but cautioned that the US now faced “very serious choices ahead”, according to Reuters.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, said: “This war is Israel’s war, not our war, but Israel is one of our strongest allies and is disarming Iran for the good of the world.”
Risch added: “This is not the start of a forever war. There will not be American boots on the ground in Iran.”
US House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said: “President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorisation for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East.”
“Donald Trump shoulders complete and total responsibility for any adverse consequences that flow from his unilateral military action,” Jeffries said.
 






Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia said the US public “is overwhelmingly opposed to the US waging war on Iran” and said Trump displayed “horrible judgment.”
When was the last time the US formally declared war?
In 1942, during World War II.
Since then, the US has gone to war in Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, Afghanistan and Iraq, while carrying out strikes and interventions in numerous countries — Serbia, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, to name a few, according to Al Jazeera.

India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) claimed the two suspects were from the Pahalgam area, where gunmen killed 26 people two months ago.
“The two men had provided food, shelter and logistical support to the terrorists, who had… selectively killed the tourists on the basis of their religious identity,” a statement by NIA said.
The agency identified the two men as Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar, claiming the duo “have disclosed the identities of the three armed terrorists involved in the attack”.
New Delhi accused Pakistan of backing the attack without making public any evidence — an allegation that Islamabad denies.
The April 22 killings triggered a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures by the nuclear-armed countries and led to intense exchanges of missile, drone and artillery fire. The four-day conflict left more than 70 people dead on both sides.</p><small>2025-06-22 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/221059494aea641.jpg?r=105957' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918823/protests-erupt-against-power-outages-in-kp-amid-heat-wave' target='_blank'><strong>Protests erupt against power outages in KP amid heat wave</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: As the heat wave persists, different localities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are experiencing prolonged power outages daily.
In Peshawar, the power consumers, including women on Saturday held protest meetings in different areas against the power outages and demanded smooth power supply to their areas.
The main Charsadda road remained blocked for some time, which also affected the traffic flow. The protesters said the situation was even worse in rural areas, where sixteen to twenty hours of power outages have become order of the day.
“It is very difficult to spend even an hour without electricity in such extreme heat,” one Mushtaq Khan of Bakhshipul said.
Criticising the Peshawar Electric Supply company (Pesco), he said whenever complaints were logged with the relevant authorities; they stated due to power theft, the area has been marked as a high-loss zone.
“But since we pay our bills regularly, why are we being deprived of electricity?” he questioned, urging Pesco to avoid power outages in their areas.
Likewise, residents of Pejagi, and other localities complained about prolonged power outages. A Pakistan People’s Party provincial office-bearer said that power outages had made their lives extremely miserable.
They said power outages on the pretext of high-loss feeders are injustice to those who are neither involved in electricity theft nor avoid paying their bills.
It may be mentioned that Pesco had disconnected the power supply to tube-wells in Shaheen Muslim Town, Gulbahar, and other city areas, resulting in a severe water shortage as well.
“If this issue isn’t resolved promptly, it may lead to confrontation between operators and the public, as the preparations are underway for protests on Phundoo Road. Despite paying bills, water supply closure is deemed an act of oppression,” they said.
Residents of Haji Camp, Sethi Town, and surrounding areas have been without electricity since morning. “We regularly pay monthly bills, even then Pesco resorts to prolonged power outages,” a consumer Hassan Ali commented.
Another consumer, Sahibzada said that those living in the main city areas were experiencing extreme heat and humidity, severely affecting the health, work and routine activity.
According to reports, the people in Mardan, Pabbi Nowshera and Charsadda are also facing severe problems due to heat wave. The prolonged power cuts, frequent tripping and low voltage have also caused shortage of water.
A Pesco spokesman, however, said that in some areas power suspension (power shutdown) from 6am to 12 noon was due to routine maintenance work while the heat wave was also multiplying the problems. He said the current demand of electricity was 4000 megawatt while supply was 2800 MW, a gap of 1200 MW.

Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Donald Trump, calling Washington’s move a “bold decision”.
In a video message, he said, “Congratulations, President Trump. Your bold decision to target Iran’s nuclear facilities with the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history… History will record that President Trump acted to deny the world’s most dangerous regime the world’s most dangerous weapons.”
 






Iran’s Abbas Araghchi calls US strikes a ‘grave violation of UN charter’
“The United States, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has committed a grave violation of the UN Charter, international law and the (nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) by attacking Iran’s peaceful nuclear installations,” Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said in a post on X.
“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences. Each and every member of the UN must be alarmed over this extremely dangerous, lawless and criminal behavior.”
In accordance with the UN Charter and its provisions allowing a legitimate response in self-defense, Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people,“ the statement read.
 






UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ‘gravely alarmed’
“I am gravely alarmed by the use of force by the United States against Iran today. This is a dangerous escalation in a region already on the edge — and a direct threat to international peace and security. There is a growing risk that this conflict could rapidly get out of control — with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region, and the world.
“I call on Member States to de-escalate and to uphold their obligations under the UN Charter and other rules of international law. At this perilous hour, it is critical to avoid a spiral of chaos. There is no military solution. The only path forward is diplomacy. The only hope is peace.”
‘Recourse to dialogue, diplomacy’ only viable path to resolve crises, says Pakistan
Reacting to the US attacks, Pakistan stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.
“We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,” the Foreign Office said.

Condemning the US attacks as a violation of international law, Iran said it was “resolved to defend Iran’s territory, sovereignty, security and people by all force”.

Key developments:

US strikes Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites
Iran warns of ‘everlasting consequences’, says US betrayed diplomacy
Pakistan condemns attacks, voices support for Tehran’s right to defend
Democrats criticise decision ‘without Congress approval’


The US president had stepped up his rhetoric against Iran since Israel first struck Iran on June 13, repeating his insistence that it could never have a nuclear weapon. Tehran has consistently denied the claim, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
Israel had launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top commanders, scientists and hundreds others. Both countries have traded wave after wave of devastating strikes since then.
In a televised address to the nation from the White House earlier today, Trump warned that the United States would go after more targets if Iran did not make peace quickly.
 


The intervention by a US president who had vowed to avoid another “forever war” in the region threatens to dramatically widen the conflict, with Iran having said it would retaliate if Washington got involved.
“Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success,” said Trump, adding that they targeted the crucial underground nuclear enrichment plant of Fordo along with facilities at Natanz and Isfahan.
“Iran’s key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated. Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” said Trump.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu congratulated Trump on the strikes, saying that “the awesome and righteous might of the United States will change history”.
 






Trump spoke to Netanyahu after the attacks, while the US also gave Israel a “heads up” before the strikes, a senior White House official told AFP.
Not long after, sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and explosions were heard from Jerusalem as Iranian state TV announced a fresh salvo of missiles launched.
Tehran said there were “no signs of contamination” after the US attacks and Saudi regulators said “no radioactive effects were detected” in the Gulf region.
Iranian media confirmed that part of the Fordow plant, as well as the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites, were attacked.
Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity show that five to six “bunker-buster” bombs were dropped on the deep-underground Fordow facility, while 30 Tomahawk missiles were fired against other nuclear sites.
US B-2 bombers were involved in the strikes, a US official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Earlier today, there were reports that US B-2 bombers — which carry so-called “bunker buster” bombs — were headed out of the US.
Tehran had threatened reprisals on US forces in the Middle East if Trump attacked.
Iran warns of ‘everlasting consequences’; Pakistan condemns attacks
Denouncing the US attacks as “lawless and criminal”, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said his country has a right to defend its sovereignty.
“The events this morning are outrageous and will have everlasting consequences,” he posted on X.
“Iran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty, interest, and people.”
 






In a statement issued by its foreign ministry, Iran strongly condemned the “United States’ brutal military aggression against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities”.
It said the US actions — “carried out in collusion with the genocidal Israeli regime— once again laid bare the depth of depravity that governs American foreign policy and revealed the extent of hostility harboured by the US ruling establishment against the peace-seeking and independence-loving people of Iran”.
“The world must not forget that it was the United States that, in the midst of a diplomatic process, betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal and lawbreaking Israeli regime to impose a war of aggression on the Iranian nation,” the ministry said.
 






Iran called for an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to condemn this “criminal act of aggression”.
It also urged the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which it accused of “evident bias in favour of warmongering parties”, to “carry out its legal responsibility” as Iran’s nuclear facilities were under the agency’s safeguards and monitoring.
It highlighted that the US attacks violated the UN Charter and UNSC’s Resolution 2231 from 2015 on Iran’s nuclear issue, also terming it a “devastating blow” to the global non-proliferation system.
“Silence in the face of such blatant aggression would plunge the world into an unprecedented level of danger and chaos,” the statement added.
Pakistan also condemned the US attacks, saying it was “gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region”.
“We reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,” a statement by the Foreign Office said.
 






“The unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran, is deeply disturbing. Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond,” it warned.
It stressed that “recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, remains the only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region”.
“We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end. All parties must adhere to international law, particularly International Humanitarian Law,” the statement asserted.
Surprise attack
Trump had said on Thursday that he would decide “within two weeks” whether to join Israel’s campaign, in a move that many saw as a window of diplomatic opportunity.
But the Republican’s decision to strike Iran came far sooner.
Flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump said that future attacks would be “far greater” unless Iran reached a diplomatic solution.
“Remember, there are many targets left,” he said.
Trump, however, made no mention of regime change, despite having warned last week that Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was an “easy target”.
The US contacted Iran diplomatically yesterday to say the strikes are all the US plans and it does not aim for regime change, CBS News reported.
The raid on the Iranian nuclear sites was carried out by B-2 stealth bombers that dropped so-called “bunker buster bombs”, along with submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles, US media reported.
Trump said earlier on his Truth Social site that a “full payload of bombs” was dropped on Fordow, adding that “all planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors”.
 


“There is not another military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace!” he said.
In another post, the US president called it a “historic moment for the United States of America, Israel, and the world”. “Iran must now agree to end this war,” he wrote.
 


Iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its programme is for civilian purposes only. The IAEA last week Tehran was in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years.
However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a report from CNN released on Tuesday said.
Israel, which is not a party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian had warned yesterday of a “more devastating” retaliation should Israel’s nine-day bombing campaign continue. He said Tehran’s right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme “cannot be taken away … by threats or war”.
Pictures posted by the White House showed Trump in a red “Make America Great Again” cap meeting with top national security officials in the Situation Room, shortly before the strikes were announced.
 






After the address, Trump warned Iran against “any retaliation”.
However, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard announced earlier today that “suicide drones” had been launched against “strategic targets” across Israel.
Iran and other armed groups have previously attacked US military bases in the region, including in Iraq.
Iran’s Houthi allies in Yemen had yesterday threatened to resume their attacks on US vessels in the Red Sea if Washington joined the war.
MAGA split adds to Democrats’ criticism
The US military strikes on Iran also threaten to cause political tensions at home for Trump.
Speaker Mike Johnson and Senator John Thune voiced their support for Trump’s decision.
 
 

However, the issue has opened a split in Trump’s “MAGA” movement, with many key Republican supporters calling on Trump to avoid embroiling the United States in another foreign war.
Trump’s first 2016 election victory in particular came on the back of his promises to get America out of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene said, “There would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.”
Pointing out that Israel was a nuclear-armed nation, she wrote on X: “This is not our fight.”
“Every time America is on the verge of greatness, we get involved in another foreign war,” Greene said.
 






Democrats also assailed him, with several accusing him of bypassing Congress to launch a new war.
Jim Himes, a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, highlighted that Trump’s decision “without Congressional approval is a clear violation of the Constitution”.
“We also don’t know if this will lead to further escalation in the region and attacks against our forces, events that could easily pull us even deeper into a war in the Middle East,” he said in a statement.
 






Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also noted there was no authorisation from Congress and termed it a “disastrous decision”.
“He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment,” she asserted.
 






Leading US Democrat Hakeem Jeffries said Trump risked US “entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East”. He added that the US president had “failed to deliver” on his promise of bringing peace to the Middle East.

Muharram is a month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide. It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.
On Saturday, the Punjab government imposed Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10 to ensure peace and religious harmony.
Federal Power Minister Awais Leghari, in a letter addressed to the officials of Discos, said, “Since the holy month of Muharram is falling in the month of July and heat waves are expected.
“It is very much imperative that all necessary measures are taken to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to facilitate religious gatherings and avoid any inconvenience to the public. “
He instructed the Discos to take a series of measures to ensure uninterrupted supply.
This included conducting thorough inspections of all transmission and distribution networks, particularly in areas where majalis and processions are expected. The letter further instructed to ensure the repair of faulty equipment.
It also instructed regarding ensuring keeping emergency response teams on high alert throughout the month and in particular on Muharram 9 and 10 (Ashura).
Leghari also instructed to ensure the availability of standby generators and UPS systems at sensitive locations to provide backup power in case of any unforeseen grid issues.
“Ensure that a sufficient number of transformers and other materials are available in each subdivision, and inventory in this regard should be updated,” the letter read.
The letter further instructed Discos to ensure communication and coordination with local authorities and the public.
“The sanctity of Muharram demands our utmost commitment to serving the public with diligence and respect. Any negligence in this regard will be viewed seriously,” the letter concluded.
Separately, five companies of Pakistan Army and six companies of Rangers will be deployed in Rawalpindi to help the administration and police to maintain peace during Muharram.
Arrangements have been finalised for 4,374 majalis and 1,003 processions to be held in the Rawalpindi division.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said earlier in the week that ensuring a peaceful Muharram was a major challenge for his force due to the prevailing security situation in the region.</p><small>2025-06-22 09:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2210403121bd40e.jpg?r=104115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918800/punjab-to-plant-42m-trees-says-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab to plant 42m trees, says CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government will plant 42 million trees on 50,869 acres under the CM Plant for Pakistan Initiative.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said on Saturday that large-scale tree plantation and environmental projects were being launched under the Punjab Green Programme.
She said around 1.375 million trees were being planted on 3,790 acres of forest wasteland under the Agroforestry Initiative.
She said the scope of the Green Pakistan Programme had been expanded to plant 466.4 million more trees on 251,000 acres. Plantation of 5m trees in rows on 10,223 avenue miles along canals of Punjab had been initiated, she added.
She said the provision of world-class facilities for promotion of eco-tourism at the Lal Suhanra National Park and Salt Range were being ensured.
 






She said wireless network, digital cameras, GPS devices and CCTV cameras were being provided for eco-tourism.
She said, “Construction of an eco-friendly LEED certified multi-storey building has been started to establish a protected nature area and modern facilities are being provided for the staff.”
She said the shielding summits programme for disaster prevention in the mountains of Murree and Kahuta, recruitment of 600 fire watchers, provision of fire vehicles and watchtowers were being ensured. She said that a modern GIS-based protection system had been introduced. She said immediate detection of fire and encroachment was possible with drone, satellite and LIDAR technology.
The CM said that digital tree enumeration in the form of rows and GIS-based survey had been started in Punjab.
She said. “Modern machinery has been purchased for forestry work, the process of plantation and forestry operations has been accelerated. Establishment of 104 Forest Command & Control Centers for 24-hour monitoring across the province is significantly increasing the capacity for forest protection.”
Meanwhile, the CM announced that poor widows living in villages would get buffaloes and cows.
“Some 11,000 rural women will be given buffaloes and cows with a budget of Rs2bn in 12 districts of southern Punjab. As many as 4,870 cattle will be given in the first phase of the programme,” she said. She said the Livestock Assets Programme aimed to increase milk production and provide employment to rural women at home.

With President Donald Trump’s order of strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, the United States — like Israel, which encouraged him — has brought the conflict into the open, and the consequences may not be clear for some time to come.
“We will only know if it succeeded if we can get through the next three to five years without the Iranian regime acquiring nuclear weapons, which they now have compelling reasons to want,” said Kenneth Pollack, a former CIA analyst and supporter of the 2003 Iraq war who is now vice president for policy at the Middle East Institute.
 
 

US intelligence had not concluded that Iran was building a nuclear bomb, with Tehran’s sensitive atomic work largely seen as a means of leverage, and Iran can be presumed to have taken precautions in anticipation of strikes.
Trita Parsi, an outspoken critic of military action, said Trump “has now made it more likely that Iran will be a nuclear weapons state in the next five to 10 years.”
“We should be careful not to confuse tactical success with strategic success,” said Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
 
 

“The Iraq war was also successful in the first few weeks, but President Bush’s declaration of ‘Mission Accomplished’ did not age well,” he said.
Weak point for Iran
Yet Trump’s attack — a week after Israel began a major military campaign —came as the Iranian state is at one of its weakest points since the 1979 Islamic revolution toppled the shah.
Since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, Tel Aviv — besides obliterating much of Gaza and being accused of genocide — has decimated Lebanon’s Hezbollah, a militant group that would once reliably strike Israel.
 
 

Iran’s main ally among Arab leaders, Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, was also toppled in December.
Supporters of Trump’s strike argued that diplomacy was not working, with Iran standing firm on its right to enrich uranium.
“Contrary to what some will say in the days to come, the US administration did not rush to war. In fact, it gave diplomacy a real chance,” said Ted Deutch, a former Democratic congressman who now heads the American Jewish Committee.
“The murderous Iranian regime refused to make a deal,” he claimed.
Top Senate Republican John Thune pointed to Tehran’s threats to Israel and language against the United States and said that the state had “rejected all diplomatic pathways to peace.”
Israel possesses around 90 nuclear warheads, according to the US-based Centre for Nuclear Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. There are multiple United Nations (UN) resolutions concerning Israel’s nuclear arsenal, including UN General Assembly Resolution 41/93 (1986) , which urged Tel Aviv to renounce its weapons and place its facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.
Abrupt halt to diplomacy
Trump’s attack comes almost exactly a decade after former president Barack Obama sealed a deal in which Iran drastically scaled back its nuclear work —which Trump pulled out of in 2018 after coming into office for his first term.
Most of Trump’s Republican Party and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long seen Iran as an existential threat, attacked Obama’s deal because it allowed Tehran to enrich uranium at levels well beneath weapons grade and the key clauses had an end date.
But Trump, billing himself as a peacemaker, just a month ago said on a visit to Gulf Arab monarchies that he was hopeful for a new deal with Iran, and his administration was preparing new talks when Netanyahu attacked Iran.
This prompted an abrupt U-turn from Trump.
“Trump’s decision to cut short his own efforts for diplomacy will also make it much harder to get a deal in the medium and long runs,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, which advocates restraint.
“Iran now has no incentive to trust Trump’s word or to believe that striking a compromise will advance Iran’s interests.”
 
 

Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on social media that Trump’s strikes could either entrench the Islamic Republic or hasten its downfall.
“The US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities is an unprecedented event that may prove to be transformational for Iran, the Middle East, US foreign policy, global non-proliferation and potentially even the global order,” he said.
“Its impact will be measured for decades to come.”</p><small>2025-06-22 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2211582009c02bc.jpg?r=122118' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918984/what-are-the-key-sites-in-irans-nuclear-programme' target='_blank'><strong>What are the key sites in Iran’s nuclear programme</strong></a><br><p>The US military attacked three sites in Iran on Sunday — Natanz, Isfahan and the mountain-buried Fordow, all key parts of Tehran’s nuclear programme, which it maintains is purely for civilian purposes.
American planes launched a “very successful attack”, US President Donald Trump said, claiming Iran’s main nuclear enrichment facilities had been “completely and totally obliterated”.
 






Trump has said Tehran must never get a nuclear weapon, and ally Israel has claimed its attacks on Iran have set back the country’s nuclear weapons progress by several years.
Iran has always denied any ambition to develop nuclear weapons and maintained its right to a civilian nuclear programme.
Iran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme in recent years, after a landmark deal with world powers curbing its nuclear activities in exchange for sanction relief began to unravel in 2018 when the United States under Trump unilaterally withdrew.
As of mid-May, Iran’s total enriched uranium stockpile was estimated at 9,247.6 kilograms — or more than 45 times the limit set out in the 2015 deal — according to the latest report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
 
 

Among its stockpiles, Iran has an estimated 408.6 kilograms (901 pounds) enriched to up to 60 per cent — just a short step from the 90pc needed for a nuclear warhead, as per IAEA.
 
 

Below is a list of Iran’s key nuclear sites, which are subject to regular inspections by the UN nuclear watchdog:
Uranium enrichment plants
Natanz: About 250 kilometres (150 miles) south of Tehran, Natanz is Iran’s heavily bunkered main uranium enrichment site, whose existence was first revealed in 2002.
An exiled Iranian opposition group revealed in 2002 that Iran was secretly building Natanz, igniting a diplomatic standoff between the West and Iran over its nuclear intentions that continues today, reported Reuters.
Natanz operates nearly 70 cascades of centrifuges at its two enrichment plants, one of which is underground. A cascade is a series of centrifuges — machines used in the process of enriching uranium.
In April 2021, the site was damaged in an attack that Iran said was an act of sabotage by Israel.

Israel said its recent strikes had hit the “heart of Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme”, targeting the atomic facility in Natanz and nuclear scientists.
IAEA head Rafael Grossi confirmed the Natanz site was “among targets”.
Fordow: Secretly built in violation of United Nations resolutions under a mountain near the holy central city of Qom, Fordow was first publicly revealed in 2009.
Initially described as an “emergency” facility built underground to protect it from potential air attacks, Iran later indicated it was an enrichment plant capable of housing about 3,000 centrifuges.
In 2023, uranium particles enriched up to 83.7pc were discovered at the Fordow plant, which Iran claimed were the product of “unintended fluctuations” during the enrichment process.

Trump has called it “the primary site”.
Uranium conversion and research reactors
Isfahan: At the uranium conversion facility at Isfahan in central Iran, raw mined uranium is processed into uranium tetrafluoride (UF4) and then into uranium hexafluoride (UF6), a feed gas for centrifuges.
The plant was industrially tested in 2004 upon its completion.
The Isfahan centre also harbours a nuclear fuel fabrication facility, which was inaugurated in 2009 and produces low-enriched fuel for use in power plants.

In July 2022, Iran announced plans to construct a new research reactor there.
Four of its buildings have been hit by Israel since June 13, including a uranium conversion plant.
Arak: Work on the Arak heavy-water research reactor on the outskirts of the village of Khondab began in the 2000s, but was halted under the terms of the 2015 deal.
Iran has meanwhile informed the IAEA about its plans to commission the reactor by 2026.

The research reactor was officially intended to produce plutonium for medical research, and the site includes a production plant for heavy water.
Tehran: The Tehran nuclear research centre houses a reactor that was supplied by the United States in 1967 for the production of medical radioisotopes.
Nuclear power plant
Bushehr: Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr was built by Russia and began operating at a lower capacity in 2011 before being plugged into the national power grid in 2012.
Russia continues to deliver nuclear fuel for the plant, which remains under IAEA control.

A German company began construction on the plant with a 1,000-megawatt nominal capacity until the project was halted in the wake of the 1979 Islamic revolution. Moscow later completed it.
Darkhovin and Sirik: Iran began construction in late 2022 on a 300-megawatt power plant in Darkhovin, in the country’s southwest.
In early 2024, it also began work in Sirik, in the Strait of Hormuz, on a new complex of four individual plants with a combined capacity of 5,000 megawatts.

According to the UN body, a strong pre-monsoon surge is expected in late June, with above-normal rainfall forecast along the Indo-Pakistan border.
The weather system is likely to continue into early July, followed by near-normal rainfall throughout the rest of the month.
Meanwhile, anomalous rainfall is predicted in the desert regions of both nations from July to September, according to a report released by the FAO on Friday.
The monsoon season is exp­e­cted to be strong and prolonged with precipitation falling to near-normal levels in October.
November will be dry before the wet weather returns in December.
The report said early and abundant summer rains are likely to create favourable conditions for small-scale breeding of locusts in eastern Pakistan and Rajasthan, India.
However, the breeding activity is expected to disappear when monsoon rains retreat in November.
PMD forecast
The Pakistan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has forecast normal to above normal rainfall from July to September 2025.
According to the PMD, the Indian Ocean Dipole is in a neutral phase but is expected to transition to negative during the season.
Meanwhile, the El Niño Southern Oscillation is projected to remain in a neutral phase throughout the season.
Given these conditions, the department forecast normal to slightly above normal rainfall across the central to southern parts of the country.
The most rainfall is expected in the northeastern parts of Punjab and Ka­­shmir. In contr­ast, the northern regions, inc­luding northern Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, are likely to experience normal to slightly below-normal rainfall during the forecast period.
There is also a likelihood of near-normal rainfall in southern Punjab, Sindh and southeastern Balochistan.
Northern Punjab, southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and nor­thern and southwestern Baloch­istan may receive above-normal rainfall during the monsoon season.

Water supply for irrigation purposes to both KP and Punjab had already been suspended around a month ago.
According to Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the reservoir level stood at 1918 feet on Saturday which is significantly below the conservation level of 1980 feet and alarmingly close to the dead level of 1910 feet. The inflow into the dam has declined to just 29 cusecs while the outflow is being maintained at 106 cusecs.
 
 

With the plummeted water level, water sports activities in the dam have declined to the lowest level of the year. During high temperatures the dam becomes a favourite tourist destination. Wapda authorities said presently civic agencies of Islamabad and Rawalpindi were receiving only 50 cusecs of water, which was also at the risk of being halted.

Officials are hopeful that onset of monsoon rains will help replenish reservoir

Khanpur Dam reaches optimal levels during and after the monsoon season. However, changing weather patterns, prolonged dry spells and glacial melt mismanagement have resulted in erratic inflows. In June last year, the reservoir level stood around 1935 feet, with more than double the current inflow.
Officials were however hopeful that the onset of monsoon rains later this month will help replenish the dam’s reserves.
On the other hand, hydrologists blame climate variability, poor catchment management and increased urban demand for the current state of water stress. “This is not just a seasonal anomaly, it is a structural problem that needs long-term planning,” said an irrigation department official.
Khanpur Dam is a primary source of drinking water for Islamabad and Rawalpindi, in addition to irrigating agricultural lands in Haripur district and parts of Punjab. With water storage levels hitting a historic low for mid-June, residents may soon experience interrupted supply, reduced water pressure and increased dependence on tankers.
“Water shortages are already being felt in low-lying areas, where supply hours have been reduced,” said an official of the Capital Development Authority (CDA). “We may have no choice but to initiate emergency water conservation protocols if the situation doesn’t improve in the next two weeks.”
Authorities have appealed to the public to reduce water consumption and avoid unnecessary wastage. Water-intensive activities such as car washing, lawn watering and unnecessary pipeline flushing are being discouraged. At the same time, government agencies are under pressure to review water release protocols and launch public awareness campaigns.

Yet, this relationship is also one of the most controversial — a pairing that is often viewed by various (mostly non-Western) countries as the source of destabilisation, especially in the Middle East.
The US provides Israel billions of dollars worth of sophisticated military equipment and plays a leading role in the United Nations to negate any effort to call out Israel as an aggressor. It unquestioningly toes Israel’s line that it is a victim in most cases and not the perpetrator. 
To some analysts, though, US-relations seem to have gone beyond the pragmatism that usually shapes relations between nation-states. These analysts insist that the ‘blind support’ that Israel gets from the US is due to certain economic and strategic compulsions that do not come in the ambit of pragmatism alone. 
 
 

In January 1982, The Washington Post reported that, “Israeli intelligence agencies have blackmailed, bugged, wiretapped and offered bribes to American government employees in an effort to gain sensitive intelligence and technical information.” 
Then there are those who often take a more ‘Manichaean’ route to understanding US-Israel relations. They see the West and Israel as a dark ‘Judeo-Christian’ nexus working to extinguish the light of Islam. Of course, such manner of Manichaean thinking emerges from a conspiratorial mindset that views complex issues through the lens of myth and fantasy.

While often presented as a longstanding alliance forged by shared values, US-Israel relations are, in reality, a pragmatic, policy-driven marriage — a marriage that is now straining under growing international criticism and domestic misgivings in the US

The US wasn’t always as much of a supporter of Israel as it is today. The American president Woodrow Wilson (1913-21) was sympathetic towards Zionism but, according to the American professor of law John N. Moore, Wilson wasn’t willing to go beyond providing anything more than just lip-service. US president Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-45) wasn’t even willing to provide any lip-service. In fact, according to the American political scientist Dr Robert Freedman, Roosevelt was opposed to the creation of a Zionist state in Palestine. 
This was because, in the 1930s, Roosevelt had struck a relationship with the newly created (and oil-rich) Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Securing sources of oil was far more important to the US than championing the cause of Zionism. Freedman quoted a close aide of President Roosevelt as saying that Israel would not have been created had Roosevelt not passed away in 1945.
Nevertheless, the US under president Harry S. Truman (1945-53) became one of the first countries to recognise Israel when it emerged in 1948. This, despite the fact that Truman was advised against doing this by his Secretary of State and Defence Secretary. However, Truman imposed an arms embargo on Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israel War. 
The American attitude towards Israel during the Dwight D. Eisenhower presidency (1953-61) was largely lukewarm. According to Freedman, in the 1950s, Israel received most of its military supplies from France, not the US. President Eisenhower wanted to deter Arab countries from joining the ‘Soviet/communist bloc’ and to achieve this he kept Israel at an arm’s length. 
 
 

In 1956, the Arab nationalist regime in Egypt, headed by Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal and British economic interests in the country. As a response, Israel, British and French forces invaded Egypt. Eisenhower was livid. He immediately asked Britain, France and Israel to withdraw their troops or face sanctions. They withdrew. 
It wasn’t until 1962, during the John F. Kennedy presidency (1961-63), that the US began to sell some weapons to Israel — even though Kennedy too remained somewhat cautious towards the Zionist state, because America’s oil-rich Arab allies were anti-communist but also anti-Israel. However, according to the political scientist Vaughn P. Shannon, it was during the Kennedy presidency that the US began to imagine Israel as a possible US ally that could be used against the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle East. 
 


In 1967, the US under President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to restrain Israel from attacking Egypt. But Israel went ahead and defeated the combined forces of Egypt, Syria and Jordan within six days. Egypt and Syria were being backed by the Soviet Union. This is when the US began to see Israel as a strong actor in the Middle East and a ‘special ally.’ 
In the 1973 Egypt-Israel War, when Egyptian forces succeeded in winning some major battles, Israel requested US president Richard Nixon to provide it with additional weapons. Fearing that an Egyptian victory would increase Soviet influence in the region, Nixon agreed. The war ended in a stalemate. The US was then able to convince Egypt to accept Israel’s existence and sign a peace agreement. Egypt slid into the US orbit. 
US political, financial and military support for Israel grew manifold from the 1980s and both worked to eliminate anti-Israel/anti-US regimes in Libya, Iran, Syria and Iraq, and also the left-leaning Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). Sometimes, far-right Islamist groups were facilitated to achieve this. 
Yet, on certain occasions, the US also stopped the sale of weapons to Israel: in 1981, when Israel attacked Iraq, and in 1982, when Israel-backed militias, using American weapons, massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. 
In the 1990s, much to the chagrin of far-right Zionists, US president Bill Clinton succeeded in brokering a peace deal between Israel and the PLO. However, after the 9/11 attacks, US aid to Israel increased. During the Barack Obama presidency (2008-2015), US-Israel relations began to slide a bit when Obama tried to stop far-right Israelis from settling on land snatched from Palestinians. 
US-Israel relations were reinvigorated by the first Donald Trump presidency, and then during Joe Biden’s tenure as president. The US sees Israel as a key player in maintaining ‘stability’ in the Middle East, particularly in countering threats from countries such as Iran and groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. 
Two of the most powerful pro-Israel lobbies in the US, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) and Christians United for Israel, have significant influence on US policy. 
But recently, Israel’s ‘unilateral’ and indiscriminate actions against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran through brute force have put the US in a wait-and-see position. Israel is going all-out to wipe out these ‘enemies’ but public opinion is becoming more critical of Israel. In a Gallup survey taken in March 2025, only 46 percent of Americans expressed support for Israel. 
Israeli actions have become unhinged and are likely to leave the Middle East more unstable than ever. America in Trump’s second term seems unsure of exactly how to deal with an unhinged partner that claims to have a large part of the US economy in its pocket. US-Israel relations might be in for a reset, depending on the fallouts of Israel’s recent actions.

Remember he was suggesting no hostilities were likely to break out till the round of indirect talks in Oman between the US and Iran on ‘Sunday’ (a week ago) and Israel struck by stealth a couple of days earlier on Friday, killing the top tier of the Iranian military leadership and nuclear scientists mostly with their spouses and children in their Tehran flats.
Wielding influence and policy control over the US is one thing, but it is impossible Israel would have attacked Iran without the knowledge and approval of President Trump. So, Tehran must ask itself if his stance was part of the Israeli deception possibly meant to lull the Iranians into believing they still had a couple of days to bunker down before Tel Aviv’s shock, criminal campaign.
The massive US military build-up in the region can generate its own momentum. The one thing that the US says would immediately draw it into the conflict is an attack on any American target. With US bases dotting Iran’s Arab neighbours, with thousands of ground troops and air assets, and with American naval ships including aircraft carrier groups converging on the area, there would be ‘targets’ galore.

One misstep, a misfired missile, or worse still a false flag operation, and boom! the region would go up in flames.

One misstep, a misfired missile, or worse still a false flag operation, and boom! the region would go up in flames. This, apart from the usually well-informed American journalist Seymour Hersh’s assertion that his sources in the US administration have informed him that the US will join hands overtly with Israel in attacking Iran over the weekend.
From Rafael Mariano Grossi, chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which had oversight of Iran’s nuclear programme, to US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, to Iran itself — all have asserted that Tehran was nowhere near acquiring a nuclear weapon. (The only irritant was Iran’s uranium enrichment levels, which was being thrashed out, with talks on the verge of a breakthrough when Israel struck. Iran was insisting that the agreement must also lead to the lifting of decades-old sanctions.)
 
 

Israel’s was the lone voice saying otherwise. Soon, its European backers and predictably the US president, all of whom have materially, politically and diplomatically supported the apartheid state unconditionally in its Gaza genocide and also in its Greater Israel project, started to echo Tel Aviv’s stance, in an endorsement of the ‘Global North’ of Israel whose real objective seems to be tied to how the West wishes to shape the future of the Middle East, which today supplies 20 per cent of the world’s oil.
Look up the JCPOA accord inked in 2015 during the Obama administration and unilaterally scrapped by Trump in 2018 to see for yourself if the nuclear programme was the real issue.
The real issue seems to be to get Israel to police the Middle East and have trading partnerships and amiable relations with the Arab nations as long as they don’t challenge its primacy or raise the issue of the occupation of Palestine or the Gaza genocide in any meaningful way. And it is abundantly clear they won’t. Iran was seen as the only obstacle, or let’s say, irritant, with its now more or less defunct Axis of Resistance, and needed to be brushed out of the way.
This ‘brushing away’ of Iran now appears underway. Iran will resist and exact some toll on Israel but, with the military backing of the West and all their aerial assets in play, in all likelihood it will be made to pay a heavy price for its ‘intransigence’.
Whether the West and Israel’s desired regime change happens or not, the Global North will try and ensure Iran loses its ability to offer resistance. The West’s exercises in regime change and nation-building have often left countries in ruins with mass-scale devastation, piles of bodies, civil strife and externally induced divisions.
Things could be headed that way in Iran too. Only a couple of mitigating factors might alter the course of events, and history for that matter. The first is Europe’s self-preservation instinct, despite its commitment to the apartheid state. Any turmoil in Iran will see a flood of refugees heading towards Europe, giving grist to the racist/ far-right mill and further destabilising their societies, already on the brink of a fascist takeover. Then there is the opposition of Trump’s MAGA base at home.
Another is Trump’s generous Gulf Arab friends. They have spoken out and decried the Israeli aggression against Iran. Since many of them host US forces, they might be wary of missile retaliation and the havoc that can be wreaked on the oil and gas infrastructure in case the US openly joins the military action.
Ergo, it will be pertinent to ask if Pakistan is a small, no matter how tiny, part of the huge jigsaw. You will have guessed the reference here is to President Trump’s White House lunch invitation to Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The lunch which was scheduled to last 45 minutes extended to 135 minutes. After the lunch meeting, Trump told reporters “they [the Pakistani leadership] are unhappy over it [the situation in Iran] as they know Iran better than most”. He stopped and said no more. But had he said enough by then?
Could Pakistan, supported by Saudi Arabia for example, have briefed the US leader on the likely negative consequences on his country and the region of a direct involvement and suggested dialogue as a more effective means of settling the matter? I know it is a stretch and an implausibly long one. But Trump’s two-week statement followed. So ask one must. Even if there are no answers.

He was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
During the meeting, the FM Dar underscored the profound importance that Pakistan accords to its enduring bilateral relations with Turkiye. Both the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further deepen and diversify the longstanding brotherly cooperation between the two countries.
 






The leaders expressed strong condemnation of the continued Israeli attacks in blatant violation of fundamental principles of international law, reiterated support for Iran’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and its right to self-defense under the UN Charter, agreed to continue diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation, and urged the international community to play its part in restoring peace and stability in the region.
Both sides emphasised the urgency of galvanising efforts to bring an immediate halt to the Israeli aggression in Gaza and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the besieged people.

The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, carried out a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill 2025 — a departure from previous years when only one or two sessions were typically held. The committee also reviewed amendments to the Islamabad Capital Territory (Tax on Services) Ordinance 2001, and recommended their approval by the National Assembly.
A major proposal endorsed by the committee is the reduction of the income tax rate from 2.5pc to 1pc for salaried individuals earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2m annually. Additionally, the committee supported a 0.5pc cut in the super tax on the corporate sector.
Cash withdrawal limit
In banking, the committee approved increasing the daily cash withdrawal limit for non-filers from Rs50,000 to Rs75,000, while raising the withholding tax on such withdrawals from 0.6pc to 0.8pc. It also supported withdrawing the tax exemption on deposits held for less than six months in Special Convertible Rupee Accounts. Similarly, foreign investors will lose exemptions if their funds remain in special accounts for less than a year, as per the State Bank.

Committee rejects income tax on teachers, imposes 5pc tax on pensions above Rs10m

In digital commerce, the committee approved a 2pc withholding tax on cash-on-delivery (COD) transactions and a 1pc tax on domestic online purchases made through bank transactions. It further recommended collecting data from banks on individuals whose banking activity exceeds their declared income in wealth statements. FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said a computerised algorithm would flag such cases, with banks required to share only CNIC numbers.
The committee also approved the deployment of FBR personnel in designated business zones but rejected a proposal to penalise unregistered online sellers. It instead recommended retaining tax exemptions for online sales up to Rs5m annually to support small-scale digital businesses.
Among other approved measures were increased sales tax on offshore digital payments — from 5pc to 15pc — and a 15pc tax on digital ads placed on platforms like Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
Rejects tax on teachers
The committee rejected a proposal to impose income tax on teachers and researchers, a measure reportedly pushed by the IMF. Chairman Langrial said the Fund repeatedly refused to yield, and exemptions for educators will end in the upcoming fiscal year. Similarly, the IMF also declined Pakistan’s request to remove sales tax on stationery items.
Further, the committee backed a 5pc income tax on annual pensions exceeding Rs10m and endorsed tax relief measures for the real estate sector. Non-profit organisations will retain tax-exempt status, but must now submit financial statements every three years.
Tax exemptions for Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Technology Zones were also approved to continue through 2035.
The committee also reviewed and recommended minor amendments to the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025, and endorsed most proposed revisions to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, with further technical corrections.
The changes mark a shift toward widening the tax net, promoting digital compliance, and providing targeted relief, while resisting some IMF-driven proposals considered detrimental to education and small businesses.

• Says taxes should be imposed reasonably and without discrimination
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Saturday barred the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from arresting or initiating criminal prosecution to recover tax due from defaulters without prior determination of their tax liability.
“We have no hesitation to conclude that without investigative audit or issuance of show-cause notice or providing opportunity to explain the matters, registration of FIR, initiation of criminal proceeding and arrest of registered person is without jurisdiction and lawful authority,” observed Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi in a judgement he authored.
Justice Abbasi was a member of a three-judge SC bench, which was seized with a number of appeals against judgements of Lahore, Sindh and Islamabad high courts.
The controversy at hand revolves around determining the legality of pre-trial steps including arrest and detention of individuals pursuant to registration of FIR on the charges of tax fraud as well as ascertaining the legal scope and application of Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
Since the LHC judgement was the first on the relevant legal issues, the SC decided to examine the facts giving rise to filing of a large number of petitions before the high court involving criminal prosecution for alleged offence of tax fraud against 134 persons along with other beneficiaries.
 
 

In its order the LHC had held that unless the sales tax liability of taxpayers was determined in accordance with Section 11 of the act, these penal provisions cannot be invoked, therefore, the criminal proceedings initiated by the sales tax department, the registration of FIRs and arrest made pursuant to FIRs, was illegal and without lawful authority. Accordingly, the same were quashed for being unconstitutional, violative of fundamental rights, and ultra vires to the act.
The facts involved in the LHC judgement suggested unearthing of a cartel by the additional director, Intelligence and Investigation (FBR), Regional Office, Lahore consisting of fraudsters involved in the issuance of fake sales tax invoices for the purposes of generating illegal/inadmissible input tax adjustments.
Accordingly, criminal prosecution was initiated against some persons, which further led to unearthing of a mega scam of sales tax evasion of Rs7.5 billion involving 144 dummy suppliers and fake sales tax invoices.
The March 26, 2011 FIR suggested that this gang of fraudsters issued fake invoices to various registered persons who claimed input tax on the basis of the same causing a huge loss to the exchequer.
The SC judgement explained that the act does not authorise tax officials to presume any tax liability in the absence of assessment proceedings and to proceed against a registered person or any person within the supply chain.
The judgement explained that under the democratic system of government, run by the elected representatives of the people, unbridled powers and authority to impose tax arbitrarily, without having any rationale or reason was now being regulated under constitutional restraints, whereby taxes were to be imposed reasonably, without discrimination and in such a manner that those may not encroach upon the fundamental rights of a person as guaranteed under the Constitution.
The art of taxation is regarded as the art of plucking a goose so as to gather the largest amount of feathers by causing least squealing, the judgement explained.
Before invoking or adopting coercive measures for the recovery of tax amount due, the judgement contended, determination of tax liability through process of assessment or adjudication has to precede before initiating criminal proceedings, which otherwise depend upon wilful default, mens rea and commission of an offence of tax fraud with an intent to cause loss of tax involved or due.
Without determination of sales tax liability and the amount of tax allegedly evaded or short paid, through process of assessment/adjudication, recourse to initiation of criminal proceedings on the allegation of tax fraud, including registration of FIR and arrest of a registered person or any person within the supply chain, amounted to pre-empting the assessment of tax liability.
Whereas, in the absence of lawful demand of sales tax pursuant to assessment of tax due, the penal provisions including Section 33 read with Sections 37A and 37B cannot be invoked.
Therefore, the penal provisions including registration of FIR and arrest of any person on the above allegations is without jurisdiction and lawful authority, the judgement said while allowing the petition.

Of all entities in the world, Pakistan’s government has nominated US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.
The intent behind this surprising move lands with all the subtlety of a marching band. There is a long history of Mr Trump expressing bitterness over not having received a Nobel prize, especially since his primary rival, Barack Obama, got one early into his presidency.
Mr Trump appears to have convinced himself that his exclusion from the list of Nobel laureates stems from the prize committee’s supposed “liberal bias” rather than the inconvenient fact that he has yet to deliver durable peace anywhere in the world.
But that does not matter to the Pakistani state. The ruling elite here has long understood that flattery, particularly of powerful men with fragile egos, is a very dependable strategy for courting their favour.
Indeed, it is a shame there is no office for ‘king of the world’, or Mr Trump might very well have been nominated for that instead, given the Pakistani government’s gratitude for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” in the recent skirmishes with India.
Ordinary Pakistanis, however, are considerably less enthused. Mr Trump’s nomination for the Nobel prize has come in the midst of the ongoing slaughter of innocents in Palestine, which has been enabled by his government’s relentless supply of arms to the genocidal Israeli government.
It has also been announced on what appears to be the eve of yet another unjustified and potentially catastrophic American war in the Middle East. Many citizens have expressed dismay and embarrassment over this symbolic capitulation to the US presidency.
The concerns about Mr Trump’s candidature also go beyond Palestine. In his own country, he is being criticised for dismantling protections related to race, gender and immigration.
His administration’s policies have triggered widespread protests. He routinely attacks the free press, labelling it “fake news” and “the enemy of the people,” even as he embraces conspiracy theorists and far-right provocateurs.
Abroad, his rhetoric towards weaker nations has been offensive and demeaning, even as he courts authoritarian leaders with open admiration. That such a figure is being nominated for a prize meant to symbolise peace is, of course, an international absurdity. It is unfortunate for Pakistanis to bear this embarrassment.

The cops repulsed the attack and managed to gun down the terrorist commander, who was later identified as Fatah.
District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmad Sahibzada and Sadar SP later led a search operation to apprehend the remaining suspects.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa IG Zulfiqar Hameed lauded the D.I. Khan police for their action. He also announced commendations and rewards for the personnel.
Balochistan clashes
In Balochistan, four security personnel, including a senior CTD officer, were martyred in attacks and operations against terrorists.
In a bomb attack in Mongochar area of Kalat, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured.
Officials said a bomb disposal team was sweeping the area near Sheikh Haji post to clear landmines when an improvised explosive device, planted in the area, was remotely detonated, a senior official confirmed.
In a separate attack in Kalat, a CTD officer was gunned down by unknown armed men.
The victim, identified as Sub-Inspector Fida Ahmed, was targeted near his home.
In another firing incident in Mastung, unknown armed men gunned down two persons, including a police official.
The victims were identified as Shakeel Ahmed Bangulzai and Adnan Ahmed Dehwar.
Levies station attacked
Officials said a group of armed men attacked a Levies station in Kirdgab area of Mastung late on Saturday night.
The attackers managed to overcome the Levies’ personnel after a heavy exchange of fire.
The armed men damaged official vehicles and looted weapons before escaping towards nearby mountains.
Unknown armed men also attacked the house of the Khuzdar district council chairman Salahuddin Zehri late on Friday night.
They hurled hand grenades at the house, damaging its walls.
Mr Zehri, who belonged to PPP, was not at home at the time of the attack. No casualties have been reported.
A roadside bomb blast also took place in Gandawah, Jhal Magsi on Saturday. No casualties were reported in the attack.
Meanwhile, a CTD spokesman confirmed five terrorists belonging to a banned outfit were killed in Qila Abdullah on Saturday.
The CTD, after receiving intelligence reports about the presence of wanted terrorists, launched an operation in the Jungle Piralizai area, the spokesman said.
After a heavy gun battle, five terrorists were killed. The spokesperson claimed arms, ammunition and maps of sensitive installations were recovered from the terrorists’ hideout.
The terrorists were allegedly involved in attacks on security forces.

Islamabad Judicial Mag­istrate Shahzad Ah­med anno­unced the verdict after reserving it earlier in the day, accepting the acquittal applications filed in case numbers 425 and 498 registered with the Karachi Company Police Station. The protest in question was organised on April 26, 2024, and moved from the office of PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen towards the Karachi Com­pany, reportedly in violation of Section 144 and other legal provisions.
During the proceedings, PTI leaders Shoaib Shaheen and Muhammad Ali Bukhari appeared before the court, while exemption pleas on behalf of Barrister Gohar and Omar Ayub were submitted and duly accepted.
The defence counsel argued that the case had no legal basis as the FIRs were filed by unrelated parties and that eight individuals arrested at the scene had already been discharged during the investigation.
The magistrate questioned the non-appearance of co-accused Amir Dogar and Amir Mughal.
The defence requested the court to decide their cases on merit, similar to the other accused. The court was also informed that Murad Saeed, who had previously faced related charges, had been acquitted in other cases despite his prolonged non-appearance.
After hearing all arguments, the court acquitted Barrister Gohar, Omar Ayub, Ali Bukhari, Shoaib Shaheen, Malik Rafique, Amir Dogar, Amir Mughal and others.
Bail for Qureshi
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore granted post-arrest bail to Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the Shadman Police Station attack case during the May 9 riots.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced a verdict reserved on the bail petition of Mr Qureshi and allowed the bail subject to surety bonds of Rs100,000.
The judge deferred till June 26 a decision on another bail petition of the PTI leader in a case relating to the burning of police vehicles near Lahore Corps Commander House.
Qureshi’s counsel had argued that the PTI leader was not even present in Lahore on May 9 — the day of the alleged attack — and was in Karachi with his wife for her medical treatment.
The counsel stated that the allegation of conspiracy against Mr Qureshi regarding the May 9 attacks was not proven. He said the petitioner should be granted bail, as many co-suspects in the same case had already been allowed bail.
Earlier, former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema also filed a bail petition in the same Shadman Police Station attack case.
The judge allowed the prosecution more time to present the record of the case and adjourned the hearing till June 24.

• Tax exemptions sought for individuals earning Rs1.2m annually
ISLAMABAD: As the government struggles to balance its revenue and expenses, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue has recommended a 50 per cent increase in government employees’ salaries, raise in pensions, removal of import duties on solar panels and a significant cut in levies on small vehicles.
The committee, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, has put forward more than 200 recommendations, including 48 general proposals, 133 changes to the Finance Bill 2025 and 21 related to the Public Sector Development Programmes.
The recommendations were presented in the upper house on Saturday and subsequently forwarded to the National Assembly for consideration. The recommendations only have an advisory value and the government is not bound to follow them.
Recommendations
The Senate committee has proposed a 50pc salary increase for government employees, instead of 10 pc, proposed in the budget.
The panel also recommended a 20pc inc­r­e­­ase in pensions for retired employees, aga­inst the government-proposed hike of 7pc.
Additionally, the minimum monthly wage has been proposed to be increased from the existing Rs37,000 to Rs50,000, and doubling the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution pension to Rs23,000 from its current of Rs11,500.
The committee also recommended the im­­­mediate regularisation of all daily wage workers, emphasising the need for job security.
The committee has further recommended income tax exemption to salaried individuals earning up to Rs1.2 million annually.
The government has proposed a 1pc tax rate on income from Rs600,000 to Rs1.2m.
The Senate panel has recommended abolishing the 18pc sales tax on solar panels to promote renewable energy adoption and reduce costs for consumers.
Additionally, it rejected the government’s proposed carbon levy, suggesting that it instead be restructured as a tax.
The distinction would allow provinces to get a share of tax revenue. In contrast, the federal government gets to keep 100pc of the levies collected on goods.
Reduced duty on cars
According to the parliamentary committee’s recommendations, the sales tax on vehicles under 850cc should be reduced from 18 to 10pc.
Additionally, a 10pc tax has been proposed on agricultural income exceeding Rs5 million annually and imposing the tax on landholdings exceeding 12.5 acres.
The committee also suggested waiving the circular debt surcharge on monthly electricity consumption of up to 200 units, no tax on stationery items and cutting the sales tax on homoeopathic medicines from 18pc to 1pc.
It was recommended to eliminate the 3pc additional tax on grand chicken, introduce sales tax on dyes and chemicals under the Export Facilitation Scheme, reduce the excise duty on beverages and juices by 15pc and remove the 2pc income and sales tax on online purchases.
The committee proposed a wide array of fiscal and structural reforms, including a 15pc reduction in the Federal Excise Duty (FED) on the formal juice industry and equalising tax rates for both property buyers and sellers.
It recommended fixing the withholding tax between 1.2pc and 2pc for the construction sector and increasing the monthly conveyance allowance for disabled workers from Rs6,000 to Rs10,000.
A 50pc reduction was recommended across indirect taxes such as GST, customs duty and sales tax to alleviate the financial burden on consumers.
Additionally, the committee urged the withdrawal of tax exemptions for the elite class to ensure a fairer taxation structure.
The committee called for an end to the designation of construction contractors as withholding agents and proposed allowing up to 40pc of contract values to be transac­t­­ed in cash without additional requirements.
It was recommended that essential commodities, such as flour, pulses, and medicines, be exempted from GST entirely.
The committee also called for increasing the Higher Education Commission’s grant to Rs80 billion and reducing the sales tax on local and imported tractors to 5pc.
Another key recommendation called for placing surplus cash reserves of public entities under the administrative control of the Finance Division, ensuring their effective deployment for public welfare initiatives and improved macroeconomic management.
The committee also urged the government to extend concessional withholding tax rates to print media.

ISLAMABAD: Under fire from parliamentarians and business leaders over a clause allowing tax officers to detain suspected evaders, Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb told the Senate on Saturday that more safeguards have been added to the law to prevent misuse of authority.
Speaking during the Senate debate on the Finance Bill 2025, Mr Aurangzeb said that detailed consultations were held with Senators Saleem Mand­viwalla and Farooq H. Naek, resulting in clearer and more balanced provisions, which will be shared during his upcoming speech in the National Assembly.
The rollback follows strong push-back from business lobbies and both parliamentary committees, which argued that the original clause — allowing officers to detain suspects without external approval — would lead to harassment.
For instance, in a letter to the finance minister earlier this week, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) voiced serious concerns over proposed amendments in the Finance Bill 2025-26 related to Section 37AA of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
 
 

The chamber criticised the proposal for granting sweeping arrest and prosecution powers without proper checks and balances, warning that such measures could enable misuse of authority and lead to harassment of businesses.
Turning to relief measures, Mr Aurangzeb informed the Senate that income tax on individuals earning between Rs50,000 and Rs100,000 per month will be reduced to one per cent from the previously proposed 2.5pc.
“This symbolic and practical step shows the state does not want to overburden this segment,” he said, expressing hope that the measure would increase disposable income and rebuild trust in the taxation system.
The minister also confirmed that the proposed 18pc tax on imported solar panels, aimed at supporting local manufacturers, has been lowered to 10pc. The tax will apply only to the 46pc of solar panel parts that are imported, which he said would result in a modest 4.6pc increase in prices.
Mr Aurangzeb condemned reports of hoarding and profiteering ahead of the tax’s implementation, warning that legal action would be taken against those stockpiling imported panels to exploit consumers.
He insisted that the government had demonstrated “seriousness and flexibility” in light of the discussions in both houses of parliament and the suggestions by lawmakers. Relief and social protection measures in the budget reflected the government’s sense of responsibility, he said, highlighting an increase in the Benazir Income Support Programme’s budget from Rs592 billion to Rs716bn.
He expressed the government’s commitment to take the country towards inclusive and sustainable economic growth, where everyone gets equal opportunities to make progress.
Regarding overall federal expenditure, the minister noted it would rise by only 1.9pc in the next fiscal year, compared to increases of 10pc to 12pc in previous years.
He hoped that, like the previous year, over 50pc of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee of Finance would be included in the final budget.
‘Economy being run on loans’
However, at the start of the proceedings, Leader of the Opposition Syed Shibli Faraz criticised the government for failing to share the committee’s final report, questioning how members could claim ownership of recommendations they had not seen.
“We have no idea how many of the recommendations we gave were included in the report,” he said.
He argued that the committee’s chair should come from the opposition to ensure proper oversight and lamented that the budget had imposed a heavier tax burden without cutting government spending.
“The economy is being run on loans, which is unsustainable,” he said. “The budget lacks vision, relies entirely on borrowing, proposes no new revenue streams and has no clear plan to reduce poverty.”
PTI parliamentary leader Senator Ali Zafar called for adhering to Article 73 of the Constitution. He was of the view that under the spirit of the Constitution, the recommendations of the Finance Committee should be shared with members at least a day in advance, so that they could thoroughly examine them before the stage of adoption of the report by the House.
He pointed out that presently, this article was not followed and the members were not given a report of the committee before the sitting. “The responsibility under the article should be fulfilled as the Senate can only give recommendations for which its relevant committee does the exercise, but it can’t approve them. These are to be adopted by the House,” he said.

The Regional Refer­ence Laboratory for Polio Era­dication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) tested sewage samples from nine districts, of which seven were found positive for the presence of poliovirus.
A sewage sample from an area is the basic parameter used to identify the presence of the virus in an area.
It determines if polio vaccination campaigns were resulting in the desired immunity among children.
An NIH official said wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was detected in sewage samples collected from Gwadar, Quetta, South Waziristan Lower, South Waziristan Upper, Rawalpindi, Larkana and Mirpurkhas.
 
 

The two negative samples were collected from Pishin and Lahore.
The official explained that if the virus is found in sewage, it is called a positive sample and whenever a child is paralysed with the virus, it is called a positive case.
After the virus is detected in sewage samples, polio campaigns are held in the area to eradicate the virus, the official said.

Delhi unilaterally suspended its participation in the 1960 IWT, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. The accord remains dormant despite a ceasefire agreed upon by the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month following their worst fighting in decades.
“No, it will never be restored,” Shah told The Times of India earlier today. “We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.”
 
 

The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet, reveal Delhi’s intentions as Islamabad hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.
Responding to Shah’s comments, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said they reflected “a brazen disregard for the sanctity of international agreements” and noted that the IWT is an apolitical agreement without provisions for unilateral action.
“India’s illegal announcement to hold the treaty in abeyance constitutes a clear violation of international law, the provisions of the treaty itself, and the fundamental principles governing inter-state relations,” the FO stated.
 






“Such conduct sets a reckless and dangerous precedent — one that undermines the credibility of international agreements and raises serious questions about the reliability and trustworthiness of a state that openly refuses to fulfil its legal obligations.”
The FO added that “weaponising water for political ends” is irresponsible and contrary to the behaviour of a responsible state. It demanded that India immediately restore the full implementation of the IWT.
“For its part, Pakistan remains firmly committed to the treaty and will take all necessary measures to protect its legitimate rights and entitlements under it,” the statement concluded.
Addressing a crowd of supporters on Friday night, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had said that New Delhi must accept the IWT, warning that if it refused to honour the treaty, “we will fight another war and take all six rivers. We know how to defend our rivers.”
 
 

Earlier in the month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned India’s unilateral suspension of the IWT, describing it as a “blatant violation and act of water aggression”, and warned that Pakistan would give a befitting response in line with decisions made at the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held on April 24.
 


Last month, Reuters reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.
The FO did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comments, but it has said in the past that the treaty has no provision for one side to unilaterally pull back, and that any blocking of river water flowing to Pakistan will be considered “an act of war”.
Islamabad is also exploring a legal challenge to India’s decision to hold the treaty in abeyance under international law.
FM Dar slams India’s ‘provocative and inflammatory’ statements
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar slammed Shah’s “provocative and inflammatory” comments on the IWT, warning that stopping Pakistan’s water will be considered an act of war.
“Pakistan is taking all necessary steps to ensure regional stability,” Dar told the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting hosted by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
“The provocative and inflammatory statements being made by the Indian leadership, as well as India’s unilateral and illegal actions, especially its decision to hold the IWT in abeyance, represent an intent to further destabilise the region,” he said.
“Let me state categorically that Pakistan will not allow India to stop water for our people. It will be treated as an act of war.”
Held Kashmir’s CM opposes diverting waters to other states
Indian-held Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Friday opposed diverting the state’s waters to Punjab and other neighbouring states now that the IWT with Pakistan stands suspended, asking why they should get more water when they already have three rivers while parts of the Union Territory are facing an acute water shortage, India’s  Telegraph reported.
“Nobody will take it. At least I will not allow it as of now. First allow us to use our water, then we will talk about others. There is a drought-like situation in Jammu. There is no water in taps,” Abdullah told reporters.
Abdullah was reacting to the purported central government move to conduct a feasibility study for constructing a 113km-long canal to direct the surplus flow from the three western rivers of the Indus water system, the report said.
“Why should I take water to (Indian) Punjab? There are already three rivers with Punjab (and the other two states) under the Indus Waters Treaty. Did they give us water when we needed it?” he was quoted as having said.
Omar referred to (Indian) Punjab’s purported refusal to share water during disputes over the Ujh multipurpose project and the Shahpur Kandi barrage in Jammu in the past. “We were in dire straits then but they kept us waiting for years…. After years, some work was done on the Shahpur Kandi barrage,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-22 02:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610338-dpm-dar-sends-trump-peace-prize-nomination-to-nobel-committee' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar sends Trump peace prize nomination to Nobel Committee</strong></a><br><p>

“Eight fatalities and 13 survivors,” Governor Jorginho Mello said on X.
 






Videos taken by bystanders and carried on Brazilian television showed the moment when the balloon erupted in flames above the coastal town of Praia Grande. The weather conditions were clear. The basket carrying the passengers plummeted dozens of meters to the ground in flames.
“We still have no information” about the condition of the survivors, a spokeswoman for Santa Catarina firefighters told AFP.
Praia Grande, on the Atlantic coast, is a popular destination for hot-air ballooning in Brazil.

The survivors were being treated in area hospitals, firefighters said. An investigation was launched to determine the cause of the accident.
“I want to express my solidarity with the families of the victims,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in a statement.
The pilot told officials that the fire was sparked by a blowtorch in the basket, Tiago Luiz Lemos, a police official in Praia Grande, told local media.
The pilot tried to bring the balloon down as soon as the fire erupted, “and once it was close to the ground, he told the passengers to jump from the basket. But some of them couldn’t do it and the fire grew,” the official said.
One witness told the Razao newspaper that he saw “two people falling, they were on fire, the basket broke off and the balloon fell”.
It was the second fatal balloon accident in the country in just a few days. Less than a week ago, a woman died during a ride in southeastern Sao Paulo state.</p><small>2025-06-21 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610318-malala-pledges-daily-fight-for-122-million-out-of-school-girls' target='_blank'><strong>Malala pledges daily fight for 122 million out-of-school girls</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement issued today, the authority’s spokesperson said: “Ogra has confirmed that the country currently holds sufficient stocks of petroleum products to meet existing demand.
 
 

“However, in view of anticipated future requirements and the prevailing market situation, Ogra has formally advised all oil marketing companies (OMCs) to ensure the maintenance of their mandatory 20-day stock levels, in line with the conditions stipulated in their respective licences.”
The spokesperson said Ogra remained committed to monitoring the situation closely and would continue to take proactive steps to ensure national energy security.
A high-level meeting on Monday reviewed petroleum products prices and supply dynamics in response to the evolving geopolitical situation following Israel’s recent attack on Iran and the resulting volatility in the international oil markets.
The committee was constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with a task to monitor petroleum product pricing and supply dynamics. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the first meeting of the committee in the Finance Division.
An official announcement said that the committee meeting was attended by senior representatives from key federal ministries, regulatory authorities, and energy sector experts. The formation of this committee reflects the government’s proactive approach to safeguarding national energy interests and ensuring market stability during a time of heightened international uncertainty.
During the meeting, the members assessed the global and domestic petroleum market situation. The committee expressed satisfaction that Pakistan currently held adequate stocks of petroleum products and there is no immediate risk of supply disruption.
However, members emphasised the need for continued vigilance given the rapidly changing regional context.
To ensure timely response and effective coordination, a working group will monitor developments on a daily basis, and the full committee will meet weekly to review the situation and submit recommendations to the prime minister.
The committee has been entrusted with the tasks to closely monitor the forward/futures prices of petroleum products and the predictability of supply chain in view of the current conflict in the region. IT will also determine Forex implications of price volatility for the short and medium term.
According to the terms of reference of the committee, it will suggest a plan (if required) to ensure that there are no supply disruptions and the market is well supplied and carry out detailed analysis of the fiscal impact, in the event of a protracted conflict.
The Petroleum Division has been designated to provide secretarial support and ensure effective implementation of the committee’s mandate.
The government remains fully committed to maintaining energy security, stabilising markets, and protecting the national interest during this critical time, added the announcement.</p><small>2025-06-21 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610288-pakistan-slams-indias-iwt-stance-as-reckless-violation-of-international-law' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan slams India's IWT stance as 'reckless violation of international law'</strong></a><br><p>

The development adds on to NAB’s previous actions against Riaz, who is also an absconder in the £190 million Al Qadir Trust Case.
According to the order — dated June 19 and seen by Dawn.com — 457 immoveable properties belonging to various individuals and entities have been frozen under Section 12 (power to freeze property), read with Section 34A (delegation of powers) of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), 1999.
Referring to an investigation against “accused persons”, the order read: “It transpired that accused persons in active connivance with each other have usurped the government land admeasuring 16,896 acres situated in District Malir, Karachi,” stating that they violated Section 9A (the offence of corruption and corrupt practice) of the NAO.
According to the order, five properties owned by Bahria Town in DHA Rawalpindi; two properties owned by Ahmed Ali Riaz in Islamabad; and 18 properties owned by Bahria Town in Islamabad have been frozen, making a total of 25.
Two properties owned by Riaz’s son-in-law, Zain Malik, were also listed.
The order will remain in place for 15 days, though it will “continue to subsist until the accountability court adjudicates upon the same as held by the honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan in its judgment reported as 2019 SCMR 1106”, the document read.
Earlier this month, an accountability court on issued non-bailable warrants for the arrest of controversial property tycoon Malik Riaz, his son and others in the Bahria Town Karachi (BTK) land grab case.
NAB had filed a reference a few months ago against the owners of Bahria Town, senior PPP leaders and government officials for allegedly converting, exchanging, and transferring government land to Bahria Town for its BTK project.</p><small>2025-06-21 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/21171157ff478af.jpg?r=171339' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918726/tarar-stresses-exemplary-punishment-for-sana-yousufs-killer' target='_blank'><strong>Tarar stresses ‘exemplary punishment’ for Sana Yousuf’s killer</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that social media influencer Sana Yousuf’s killer should receive an exemplary punishment and that this should be a “test case” so that no such crime occurs in the future.
Islamabad Police arrested Umar Hayat, the main suspect in the 17-year-old’s murder, on June 3, nearly a day after she was gunned down in her house in the federal capital. Police claimed the man murdered Sana because she repeatedly refused his advances. An Islamabad court on Friday extended Hayat’s physical remand for another three days.
Tarar visited Yousuf’s home and extended condolences to her family, telling them that the prime minister and the interior minister had taken strict notice of the murder. He noted that the police arrested the suspect within hours of the incident and lauded the investigation.
“The culprit should get the strictest punishment to make an example,” Tarar told reporters outside the house, adding that the family has a “good legal team” and a strong case.
“The important thing now is to ensure there are no gaps in the prosecution or trial process and that everything moves forward smoothly,” the minister added. “Our lawyers and the Lawyers’ Forum will go with their legal team and provide support.
“I was here not just to express my grief, but also to give the family hope,” Tarar said.
 






Responding to a question, the information minister said that social media platforms should be used responsibly and their negative use should be discouraged, given that they can have “damaging impacts”.
“Girls can get blackmailed and harassed, or even fall victim to violence,” he stated. “It is time for legislation to protect young girls. We have to provide a forum for their protection and awareness.”
In a post on X, he said: “Those making videos on this tragedy must also stand with the family and the state in court during proceedings.”
 






The incident had sparked widespread outrage across the country, including from citizens, celebrities and President Asif Ali Zardari’s daughter, MNA Aseefa.
“Sana was just a girl — with ambition, with dreams, with a life ahead of her,” Aseefa said in a statement. “She had every right to live freely and safely. What happened to her wasn’t just an act of violence — it was a punishment for saying no. And that should horrify every one of us.”</p><small>2025-06-21 13:38</small></div><hr>
