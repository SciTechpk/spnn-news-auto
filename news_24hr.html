While Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari believed the report to be “completely accurate and fully aligned with the facts”, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram asked the PPP and the PML-N to refrain from the “agenda-driven” campaign against ex-PM Imran Khan and his spouse.
He said the campaign through “concocted stories” was nothing but an effort to divert public attention from disastrous policies that had devastated the country “politically, morally, socially and economically”.
 
 

According to the PTI leader, the government had exhausted every tactic and committed every act over the past three years to remove the PTI founding chairman from the political arena, but all these measures proved counterproductive, and his popularity continued to flourish with each passing day. He predicted that the days of incumbent governments were numbered, and they were now frantically searching for escape routes.

Meanwhile, the Punjab information minister quipped that after the revelations about PTI founder Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi’s actions were now making headlines in the international media.
In a statement here on Sunday, she said that the report had exposed the “deception of the fake spiritual setup and the so-called mysticism that concealed darker intentions”.
“The man who used to threaten his opponents, saying he won’t spare them, himself believed that the manipulated information fed to his wife was some form of spirituality,” she stated.
Commenting on the publication’s report, Ms Bokhari said that for four years, the ‘coach’ and ‘spiritual guide’ misled the PTI founder. Despite claiming to champion change and end corruption, Bushra Bibi was facilitating a new form of “legitimised corruption”.
“A country and its economy cannot run on sorcery, spells, or fraudulent spiritual practices. The so-called spirituality of those who wanted to bury their opponents metaphorically has already been dead for three years,” she added.
Last week, The Economist published an article covering Mr Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister.
‘The mystic, the cricketer and the spy: Pakistan’s game of thrones’, written by Owen Bennett Jones and Bushra Taskeen, claimed Bushra Bibi wielded an “absolute” influence and “upset crucial friends and allies”. The article also quotes a former driver of Mr Khan, alleging that Bushra Bibi used to practice ‘black magic’.
“Accepting his wife’s claim that she could read faces, he would ask for photographs of potential candidates, which would be sent to Bushra Bibi for a decision. She also got involved in pettier matters,” the article went on to say.
The article also shed light on her alleged ties with the intelligence community.
“According to the rumours, the officer would, for example, give one of Bushra Bibi’s pirs advance notice about which politician was about to be arrested. Bushra Bibi would then tell Khan that she had received a revelation about the future. When the event she predicted came to pass, Khan would be amazed at his wife’s perspicacity and conclude she did indeed have a direct line to God,” it claimed.

• Shift from cotton to sugarcane blamed for water depletion, soil degradation, and rising water table
LAHORE: Persistent violations of crop-zoning rules for sugarcane and the unchecked establishment of new sugar mills have drastically reshaped Rahim Yar Khan — once Pakistan’s largest cotton-producing district — where sugar-milling capacity is rapidly expanding both within the district and along the Punjab — Sindh border.
Sources say almost 40 per cent of the country’s total sugar-milling capacity is now concentrated in Rahim Yar Khan and its border belt alone — a shift that experts fear is accelerating the decline of cotton, straining water resources, and degrading soil.
 
 

Six sugar mills currently operate in Rahim Yar Khan with a combined crushing capacity of 135,000 tonnes per day, the highest for any single district in the country. One of these mills is reportedly adding another 10,000 tonnes per day to its capacity this season.
The sources added that two powerful industrial groups, after being denied permission for additional mills within the district, have set up new units just across the Punjab–Sindh border — one with a capacity of 16,000 tonnes per day and the other 19,000 tonnes.
A Sindh-based political family already operates a 16,000-tonne unit there, while another influential group is said to be relocating a major mill from interior Sindh to the same border belt. This relocated mill, sources claim, will become operational during the current crushing season, potentially triggering a further shift from cotton to sugarcane.
Pakistan, which until a few years ago ranked as the world’s fourth-largest cotton producer, has seen its output collapse from around 15 million bales in 2014-15 to barely 5.5m bales in 2024-25, largely due to the unchecked spread of sugarcane in designated cotton zones.
The extraordinary expansion in sugarcane cultivation is not only responsible for a massive drawdown of irrigation resources — with millions of acre-feet of water wasted — but is also raising the water table to levels that threaten to render vast tracts barren.
Concurrently, pollution from sugarcane processing is harming fibre quality, pushing textile mills to imp­ort high-grade cotton to meet export commitments, Cotton Ginners For­um Chairman Ihsanul Haq tells Dawn.
Recalling the “crop transformation”, he says that until a few years ago, Rahim Yar Khan was Pakistan’s single largest cotton-producing district, cultivating the crop on 800,000 acres and yielding 1.3–1.4m bales annually. Across Bahawalpur division’s three districts, cotton output exceeded 4m bales.
During the 2024-25 cotton year, however, the same region produced just 1.5m bales, with expectations of an even lower harvest this season.
Sindh outperforms Punjab
He notes that for the first time in the country’s history, Sindh outperformed Punjab in cotton output during 2024-25 — 2.8m bales in Sindh versus 2.7m in Punjab. This marks a stark reversal from 2014-15, when national output peaked at 15m bales, with Punjab contributing 11m bales compared Sindh’s 4m.
“The ratio has steadily eroded,” he says, adding that preliminary assessments suggest Sindh will again surpass Punjab this year, despite Punjab having planted cotton on 1.4m hectares, more than double Sindh’s 630,000 hectares.

The UNIFIL protested that Israeli forces “fired on UNIFIL peacekeepers from a Merkava tank from near a position Israel has established in Lebanese territory,” adding that heavy machine gun rounds hit about five metres from their personnel.
Sunday’s incident was not the first in which UNIFIL accused Israel of endangering its troops. “Yet again, we call on the IDF to cease any aggressive behaviour and attacks on or near peacekeepers,” the force said.
Lebanon’s army, meanwhile, accused Israel of “violating Lebanese sovereignty, causing instability and obstructing the full deployment of the army in the south”.
The army is meant to deploy to the area alongside UNIFIL as part of the ceasefire agreement. It said it was “working, in coordination with friendly countries, to put and end to the continuous violations”.
The UNIFIL said the peacekeepers this time managed to “leave safely 30 minutes later” after the tank withdrew inside the Israeli position.
However, the Israeli military blamed ‘poor weather conditions’ for the shooting.
Israel denied it had deliberately targeted UN troops. In a statement, the Israeli military said “two suspects were identified” in the El Hamames area of southern Lebanon.
“The troops subsequently fired warning shots, and the suspects distanced themselves. No injuries were reported,” it said.

Israel blames poor weather, says it mistook blue helmets for ‘suspects’

“After a review, it was determined that the suspects were UN soldiers who were conducting a patrol in the area and were classified as suspects due to poor weather conditions. No deliberate fire was directed toward UNIFIL soldiers.”
UNIFIL has been working with Lebanon to consolidate a truce between Israel and Hezbollah reached last year. It said the Sunday shooting “represents a serious violation of UN Security Council resolution 1701”, which ended a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, and also formed the basis of last November’s truce.
Under the deal, Israel was to withdraw its forces from south Lebanon, but it has kept them at five areas in violation of the ceasefire agreement. It has also carried out regular strikes on targets in Lebanon.
About Sunday shooting, the Israeli military said the incident was under examination.

Netanyahu spoke two days after Israel’s key ally the United States and many Muslim-majority nations endorsed a draft UN resolution backing President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan, saying the process offered a route to Palestinian statehood.
The 15-member UN Security Council began negotiations on Nov 7 on the draft, which would mandate Trump’s proposal for a “Board of Peace” transitional administration in Gaza to address issues including post-war reconstruction and economic recovery.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military on Sunday killed four Palestinians, three in Gaza and one in the West Bank.

Israeli troops kill four Palestinians in Gaza, occupied West Bank

According to Al Jazeera, Israeli troops shot dead three Palestinians in southern Gaza while one Palestinian was killed in the West Bank city of Nablus on Sunday.
Trump’s 20-point plan includes a clause saying that if there were reforms within the Palestinian Authority, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognise as the aspiration of the Palestinian people”.
That point infuriated Israeli far-right leaders who had opposed the Trump-brokered October ceasefire in Gaza, testing Netanyahu’s awkward governing coalition of conservatives and ultra-nationalists.
On Saturday far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich called on Netanyahu to denounce the idea of a Palestinian state. Ben-Gvir threatened to leave the governing coalition if the prime minister did not act.
Netanyahu reiterates opposition to Palestine state
Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday: “Our opposition to a Palestinian state in any territory has not changed. Gaza will be demilitarised and Hamas will be disarmed, the easy way or the hard way. I do not need affirmations, tweets or lectures from anyone.” A far-right walkout could bring down Netanyahu’s right-wing government well before the next election, which must be held by October 2026.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar also issued statements on X against a Palestinian state on Sunday, without mentioning Netanyahu.
 






Trump’s Gaza plan ended major fighting between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas after two years of war that devastated the Palestinian enclave and triggered spillover conflicts across the Middle East.
Netanyahu embraced Trump’s plan during a visit to the White House in September but until Sunday had made no new statement on the Palestinian statehood issue.
Ahead of his White House visit, Netanyahu said he would respond to a number of major Western nations including France that formally recognised a Palestinian state in September, angering Israel, but has not followed up with any diplomatic actions.
Smotrich had on Saturday accused Netanyahu of failing to live up to his promise and called on him to formulate a response immediately: “Two months have passed in which you have chosen silence and political disgrace.”
He urged Netanyahu to “make clear to the entire world (that) a Palestinian state will never arise on the lands of our homeland.” Two years of inte­nse Israeli bombardment and ground offensives in the Gaza Strip killed more than 69,000 people, according to local health authorities.
Published in Dawn, November 17th, 2025</p><small>2025-11-17 03:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/170808109f4434b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955562/a-stablecoin-future-for-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>A stablecoin future for Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>While the risks of increasing stablecoin adoption initially seemed distant, if not invisible, the recent news of a $12.9 million seed investment in the founders of Sadapay’s new stablecoin venture, Zar, increases the urgency for regulation and an undisputed regulator. It is necessary to provide founders with incentives to build freely and commercially to sustain innovation, jobs, and opportunities in Pakistan, without compromising guardrails that safeguard the national interest.
This comes against the backdrop of a recent report by KTrade, authored by its Associate Director Equity Research, Muhammad Faran, highlighting the key economic risks of stablecoin adoption — a use case Zar is tapping into to broaden access to capital inflows, primarily remittances.
Zar raised its seed funding from leading dollar investors following its previous $7m pre-seed round — both rounds led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), often ranked as the company with the most assets under management amongst venture capital management firms globally.
Other notable investors include Coinbase Ventures, Endeavour Catalyst, as well as VanEck, who wrote in an investor note from the previous round that “trust in local currency is gone”. This note, reiterated by a local expert who read it as a threat, begs an evolved question: Does national interest trump commerce?

Sadapay’s new stablecoin venture Zar, could potentially broaden access to capital inflow, primarily remittances

Aatiqa Lateef, a Dubai-based policy expert who has previously served as Director of Policy at Rain, the Middle East’s first licensed cryptocurrency exchange, says that she reads that note as “investor soundbite, not a policy reality”, while a senior source inside Zar distances Pakistan from that framing as they think VanEck’s comments reflect “a global macro view of dollar demand in high-inflation economies”.
They further add that the “rupee has shown remarkable stability” as inflation fell sharply from over 30 per cent in 2023 to “around 4–5pc in 2025”.
 
 

But stablecoins can pose risks to stable currencies too. “The Bank of England governor has warned that significant stablecoin adoption may pose risks to financial system stability,” says Mr Faran, as more and more countries are exploring their own digital currencies to fight against this risk to traditional banking. This is because of the uniquely accessible and centralised nature of stablecoins being pegged to a currency, which creates an environment where national interests of different countries intersect and often clash.
“This is why regulation is important,” as Ms Lateef says, “Stablecoins do warrant bespoke oversight because they behave like short-term money. The answer isn’t prohibition, it’s transparency and convertibility under supervision.” That supervision includes licensing, daily reserve reporting, segregation of client assets, service-level agreements for the redemption service, and caps that gradually increase as compliance maturity improves.
According to Ms Lateef, “If on/off-ramps clear through regulated PSPs [Payment System Providers] and settle locally in rupees, the central bank preserves visibility and mitigates dollarisation risk.”
It is also understood that Zar does not ‘aim’ to facilitate local transactions via digital dollars. A senior source from within opines that “people will want to save dollars, not use them to pay for things locally”. However, when asked if the app will feature functionality to support such transactions, the source says that while their “main aim is for savings”, users could still technically use their US-issued Zar Visa cards locally, though it would be “quite expensive to do so”.
Ms Lateef says domestic peer-to-peer (P2P) foreign currency stablecoins should remain restricted because that accelerates crypto dollarisation. Zar currently boasts around 200,000 users on its waitlist across 100+ countries, and its initial focus will be on Pakistan, according to VanEck’s initial investor note.
With that in mind, she further highlights that if a digital currency is truly rupee-denominated and settled domestically through licensed on/off-ramps with State Bank (SBP), then P2P does not need to remain ‘restricted’ beyond a phased, tier-limited rollout. “The start should be with ‘capped wallets’ and limits can be raised as operational/consumer-protection tests are met,” she says.
So, as we regulate crypto to enable innovations like these and the digital rupee to address some of its risks, a question remains unanswered: where should the line be drawn between commercial and national interests?
Ms Lateef says, “promote anything that improves financial inclusion, lowers cost, and increases transparency, provided it is auditable and reversible where needed, and inside SBP oversight.” She adds that a line needs to be drawn at products that create unhedged foreign exchange (FX) exposure, opaque leverage, or unchecked data and consumer-protection risks.
In short, commercial freedom should exist within measurable public-interest outcomes, managed through regulations adopted without commercial conflicts of interest.
Cautioning of another risk, Mr Faran highlights, “Fintechs can profit from offering faster, cheaper cross-border payments and dollar exposure to their customers.” However, with the potential of diverting “deposits and transaction flows away from the regulated banking system, ultimately reducing the local currency demand”.
Commenting on this risk, Ms Lateef says, “Without any constraints, a venture-backed stablecoin model can disintermediate bank deposits, compress net interest margins, and shift liquidity into non-bank balance sheets.” This raises questions for liquidity coverage, net stable funding, monetary policy transmissions and FX leakages. She adds, “The objective isn’t to protect ‘middlemen’, it’s to protect intermediation.”
According to her, the policy answer is to let banks compete on-chain: enable tokenised deposits, allow banks to serve as custodians/issuers under clear reserve and redemption rules, and impose graduated caps for non-bank issuers that rise with compliance performance. Paired with granular reporting to the SBP and rupee settlement for the onshore leg, Ms Lateef says that this system can “keep competition and efficiency, without sacrificing macroeconomic control”.

Borrowing from President Donald Trump’s vocabulary, he described the relationship as having “never been so good looking” in recent memory, while acknowledging that it still requires more substance.
The envoy was speaking at a symposium, organised by Pakistani students at Georgetown University, which covered a wide range of topics and featured several speakers from diverse backgrounds.
 
 

Most speakers attended the discussions in person, while some participated via video link.
Ambassador Robin Raphel, a former head of the State Department’s Bureau of South Asian Affairs, said President Trump had removed the “emotionalism” that previously hindered US efforts to rebuild ties with Pakistan.

“Now is the time to strengthen the relationship with a country that remains strategically important,” she added, pointing to Pakistan’s proximity to some of the world’s most sensitive regions.
Ambassador Shaikh also highlighted Pakistan’s potential as “a large country with the fifth-largest population and many things to offer”, adding that the Trump administration viewed Pakistan as a country with its own identity, rather than solely in reference to Afghanistan or India.
Former US ambassador Maleeha Lodhi outlined five key areas likely to dominate Pakistan’s foreign policy in the years ahead.
These areas include managing relations with China and the United States amid the US-China confrontation, addressing challenges in Afghanistan, maintaining an adversarial stance towards India, and balancing ties between strategic ally Saudi Arabia and neighbour Iran.
 
 

She described the situation in Kabul as a major security and foreign policy challenge, calling it “a severe policy dilemma” for Islamabad.
“There are obvious limits to a coercive approach and military response, as a total breakdown in relations with Afghanistan is not in Pakistan’s interest — especially given the already fraught ties with India,” she said.
Former senator Mushahid Hussain reflected on Pakistan’s evolving relationship with the US, urging Islamabad to leverage the current focus on economic and strategic engagement to rebuild its economy.
 
 

He emphasised Pakistan’s role as a regional security provider in the Middle East, asserting that only a strong and stable Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital, can bring lasting peace to the region. His remarks were met with warm applause from the audience.
Prof Akbar S. Ahmed highlighted the challenges in the country’s tribal areas, praising the wisdom of local communities and warning about Balochistan, which makes up over 40 per cent of Pakistan’s total area. He urged that the mistakes of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) should not be repeated.
He said no state can be sustained without justice, fairness and generosity. “We must consider the factors that truly support democracy,” he added, stressing that a functioning democracy is impossible without education.
Other speakers highlighted the critical role of Pakistan’s young population, with a median age of just 23, in shaping social and political movements.
Dr Mehlaqa Samdani, who leads a group lobbying for Mr Khan’s release from prison, sought permission to address Ambassador Shaikh, but the session ended before she could speak.

Asia states
• Afghan traders say Islamabad still shortest, cheapest route to seaports
• Uzbek president proposes new bloc
AFGHANISTAN is seeking to significantly bolster trade with the oil-rich countries of Central Asia as it attempts to end its economic dependence on Pakistan, which has historically been Kabul’s biggest trading partner.
However, experts warn that geography, high costs, and political constraints will hinder efforts by Afghanistan’s cash-strapped and unrecognised Taliban government to shift trade to Central Asia, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty report.
Kabul’s attempts to find new trade partners come after the worst outbreak of hostilities with Islamabad in years. The neighbours exchanged military attacks last month, killing dozens of people and leading to Pakistan closing its border with Afghanistan.
The month-long border closure has inflicted some $200 million in losses for Afghan traders, who rely on Pakistani seaports to access international markets.
Similarly, Pakistan had been exporting fresh fruits, cement, medicines, surgical items, agricultural tools, fabrics, shoes, plastic pipes and sanitary items, cosmetics, and a variety of other locally manufactured products valued at around $100–200m per month to the neighbouring country.
‘Trade alternatives’
Senior Taliban officials have urged Afghan traders and investors to end their activities in Pakistan and find new business and trade opportunities in Central Asia. “We are actively working with our northern neighbors to find reliable trade alternatives,” Taliban Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi said last week.
Abdul Ghani Baradar, a Taliban deputy prime minister, accused Islamabad of using trade as a “tool of political pressure” and framed the ongoing border closure as evidence that Kabul must reduce its reliance on its neighbour.
Swiss-based Afghan expert Torek Farhadi said the Taliban’s new emphasis on trade with Central Asia is “largely political posturing”.
Central Asia is landlocked, and Afghanistan must rely on long-distance overland corridors to reach markets. The region’s tariff structures impose high costs on many Afghan exports, especially agricultural goods. The logistics of handling, storing, and transporting perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables remain underdeveloped.
“To make the northern route commercially viable, Afghanistan would need to remove tariffs and offer incentives to its Central Asian partners,” Mr Farhadi told RFE/RL.
“But for the government in Kabul, customs revenue is one of their primary income sources.”
Meanwhile, several railway projects, crucial for scaling cross-border trade, remain unfinished or lack financing.
The Taliban’s lack of international recognition also prevents it from accessing funds from global institutions like the World Bank and IMF, limiting investment in the infrastructure needed to support northbound trade, Farhadi said.
Those factors have ensured that Afghanistan’s trade with Central Asia, although growing, has remained modest.
Trade between Afghanistan and the five Central Asian states — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan — has grown steadily, reaching nearly $1.7 billion, according to Afghan officials.
Still dependent
Despite Afghanistan’s growing trade with Central Asia, Kabul remains dependent on Pakistan as Islamabad has long provided its neighbor with the fastest and most affordable access to global markets.
The border crossings at Torkham and Chaman remain the backbone of Afghanistan’s commercial lifelines, but the repeated skirmishes in recent months caused frequent border closures. The most recent closures following armed clashes between Pakistani and Taliban forces left thousands of trucks stranded for weeks.
But for Afghan traders, few alternatives can match Pakistan’s proximity or port infrastructure. Shifting trade away from those routes means higher transport costs, longer transit times, and increased logistical risks, experts say.
“The reality is that Afghanistan’s shortest and cheapest route to seaports as well as India and other South Asian markets is through Pakistan,” said Azarakhsh Hafizi, the former head of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce.
“We need all transit routes to remain open. It would benefit not only Afghanistan and Pakistan, but it is also important for the regional economic integration,” said Hafizi, who previously held membership in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Saarc.
Regional bloc proposed
Uzbek President Shavkat Mirzi­yoyev proposed on Sunday forming a regional co-operation organisation he called the “Community of Central Asia”, in what he said was a bid to promote economic integration in the region of more than 80 million people, Reuters reported.
In a speech at a meeting in Tashkent of the leaders of the five post-Soviet republics of Central Asia, as well as Azerbaijan, Mirziyoyev suggested transforming regular meetings between the leaders of the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia into a formal regional bloc.
He also stressed the need to boost economic, security and environmental cooperation.
There was no immediate indication of the other countries’ response to the Uzbek proposal, but all five countries have in recent years said they want greater regional integration, where ties were sometimes testy in decades past.
All five leaders visited Washington in unison for talks with US President Donald Trump earlier this month.
Two of the countries, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, earlier this year settled a longstanding border conflict that had claimed hundreds of lives.

For now, it is difficult to predict the future trajectory of economic ties between the two neighbours. However, there are growing indications that the Taliban regime in Kabul is steadily reducing its reliance on Pakistan and actively seeking alternative markets and routes for both its exports and transit trade.
Last week, Afghanistan’s deputy prime minister for economic affairs, Mulla Abdul Ghani Baradar, ordered all Afghan traders to settle their contracts within three months, advising them to explore new markets for their goods and trading routes.
“If Pakistan wants the routes to be opened, it will do so with firm and credible guarantees that they will not be closed again under any circumstances or conditions,” he said. The message is unmistakable: Kabul is prepared to sever economic ties unless Islamabad commits to ensuring unobstructed commerce in the future.

If links with Afghanistan remain closed, an estimated 90pc of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s industry could shut down, triggering large-scale unemployment

The ultimatum comes after several rounds of peace talks in Doha and Istanbul collapsed, largely because the Taliban regime refused to curb Pakistan-focused militant groups operating from Afghanistan or prevent their fighters from infiltrating into Pakistan to carry out attacks against civilians and security forces. A ceasefire was agreed in talks and is holding. But border trade remains closed as of Oct 11.
The closure has halted both bilateral and transit trade, leaving thousands of cargo containers stranded across Pakistan. Islamabad maintains that the closure has curbed militant movement.
The current standoff follows the worst violence between the two countries since the Taliban seized power in Kabul after the abrupt withdrawal of US forces in 2021.
A Reuters report points out that Afghanistan is increasingly making use of Iran’s tariff and other concessions to shift freight to its Indian-backed port of Chabahar, bypassing Pakistan to avoid recurring border and transit disruptions and reduce dependence.
Afghan officials say incentives from tariff cuts and discounted storage to faster handling are drawing more cargo south. “In the past six months, our trade with Iran has reached $1.6 billion, higher than the $1.1bn exchanged with Pakistan,” Abdul Salam Jawad Akhundzada, a spokesman for the commerce ministry, was quoted by Reuters.
“The facilities at Chabahar have reduced delays and given traders confidence that shipments will not stop when borders close. Iran has installed updated equipment and X-ray scanners, while offering Afghan cargo a 30 per cent cut in port tariffs, 75pc off storage fees and 55pc off docking charges,” he said.
A report in this paper has quoted Pakistani officials and traders saying that Pakistan has already lost over 65pc of the Afghan market to Iran, Central Asian States, Turkiye and even India due to “hostile and aggressive trade policies dictated by security issues since the installation of the Taliban regime in Kabul in August 2021”.
Undoubtedly, as a recent research report by JS Global suggests, Afghanistan, which relies on Pakistan for 41pc of its exports and 14pc of its direct imports (excluding transit trade), will suffer the most — at least in the near to medium term — if trade between the two countries remains suspended for a prolonged period or is stopped permanently.
Yet, analysts and traders warn that Pakistan too cannot remain insulated from its fallout. At stake for Pakistan are thousands of low-paid jobs and the survival of numerous small industrial units in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that rely on uninterrupted cross-border commerce with Afghanistan, significant export revenues and taxes, as well as access to Central Asia.
It is therefore no surprise that business leaders from the province have urged Islamabad to reconsider the weeks-long border closure, which has already inflicted significant losses on traders on both sides and left thousands of cargo trucks stranded at the crossing.
The JS Global report, which studies the potential impact of the Pak-Afghan border closure and the resulting suspension of trade if the situation persists through the remainder of CY25, says the overall impact on Pakistan trade remains insignificant — 0.5pc or approximately $150-169 million loss of exports from a three-month trade suspension.
But, the report stops short of commenting on long-term implications of complete termination of trade ties with Kabul as it sees “little likelihood of long-term closure of the borders due to a sharp increase in import demand from Afghanistan amid the mass return of Afghan refugees from Iran and Pakistan and heavy reliance on Pakistan for its exports and imports”.
Islamabad says the Afghan decision to stop trade with and through Pakistan would cause no economic harm to the country, or so told Defence Minister Khawaja Asif to a TV channel.
Speaking with Dawn, Zahidullah Shinwari, a former president of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said bilateral trade between the two sides peaked at around $3bn in 2014, making Afghanistan Pakistan’s third-largest export market after the US and the EU, despite the absence of any preferential or free trade agreement.
However, volumes later began to decline, and after the withdrawal of Nato forces, bilateral trade fell to about $600–700m, largely because of Afghanistan’s weak economic conditions.
Pakistan’s major exports to Afghanistan include industrial goods such as cement, steel products, textiles, footwear and sugar. In addition, agricultural commodities like flour, poultry and fruit also make up a significant share of shipments. A sizable portion of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s labour and transport sector is also tied to this bilateral trade. “In Peshawar’s Hayatabad area, modern hospitals, hotels, restaurants and even schools have long depended on Afghan clients, visitors and traders. But the ongoing travel restrictions have sharply reduced Afghan footfall, hurting these businesses as well,” he points out.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s industry is also heavily dependent on trade with Afghanistan, according to him. “Most industrial units in the province struggle to compete with manufacturers in Punjab and Sindh and therefore cannot sell their products competitively in the domestic market.
The Afghan market has long offered them a crucial advantage. If this market closes, an estimated 90pc of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s industry could shut down, triggering large-scale unemployment — particularly in the merged tribal districts, where up to 95pc of livelihoods are linked to this trade.”
Mr Shinwari warns that such a collapse would not only devastate the province’s economy but also hit the national economy hard. “The government currently collects taxes equivalent to roughly 30pc of the value of traded goods, amounting to about Rs300m a day. Moreover, an annual loss of $1.2–1.3bn in exports is no small matter for a country already compelled to follow stringent International Monetary Fund diktats to secure external financing.”
He says Iran and the Central Asian republics have already snatched away from Pakistan a significant share of the Afghan market, largely because of recurring border closures. If we do not reopen the borders immediately, there is a real risk that Pakistan will lose whatever share it still retains, he contends.

The resolution for a vote of no confidence against Mr Haq was submitted to the Assembly secretariat on Friday afternoon. Sho­rtly afterwards, Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar summoned the Assembly to meet at 3pm on Monday.
While the PPP had already secured the supp­ort of the required 27 law­makers, its chairman Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari had stressed at a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) should not only support the no-trust move to ensure a “thum­ping majority” but also join the next coalition setup.
 
 

However, the PML-N leadership announced that it would back the no-confidence motion but would not take any share in a PPP-led government. Cons­equently, the party’s two senior AJK leaders Shah Ghulam Qadir and Raja Farooq Haider signed the resolution along with the 23 PPP legislators.
On the other hand, the five-member PTI, which currently holds the office of Leader of the Opposition, as well as the two single-seat parties — Muslim Conference and Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) — have announced that they will stay away from the process.
On Sunday, two more PTI ‘forward-bloc’ lawmakers — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur, raising its own support base to 29.
“We will get the no-confidence motion through with a wide margin,” said Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, a senior PPP figure and cabinet member in the Haq-led coalition government. “The PML-N will also support us in this regard,” he added.
 
 

It was, however, yet to be seen whether the movers of the no-trust motion, who have accused Mr Haq of causing “serious damage to the constitutional, ideological and democratic framework of the state through his governance style, political narrative and confrontational conduct”,  would defend their position through speeches in Monday’s session.
Ironically, neither had any of the movers stepped down on their own, nor had Mr Haq mustered the courage to remove them in response to their allegations.
Referring to these accusations in an interview with a private TV channel, Mr Haq termed them “childish” and “frivolous”, adding that those who drafted them did not themselves appear to understand what they had written.
“The charge sheet against me leaves one wondering whether the allegations were even understood before being made. If my cabinet colleagues had difficulty writing in Urdu, they could have asked me; I would have drafted the accusations against myself in better words,” he remarked.
Mr Haq claimed he had broken the “status quo” and ensured cabinet involvement in all decisions.
Responding strongly to the allegation of “confrontational conduct” in the no-confidence text, the embattled prime minister asserted that his speeches, videos and public statements over the past two and a half years were on record, and that a disruptive mindset did not — and could not — exist in him. “The person who wrote this phrase should at least know what he was writing,” he said.
Under the AJK Constitution, a vote of no confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution. Once the motion succeeds, Mr Rathore will stand elected as the new prime minister, fourth in the sitting assembly since its installation in 2021.
Mr Majeed said the new premier was likely to take the oath of office on Tuesday before President Barrister Sultan Mahmood.
PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is also expected to attend the swearing-in ceremony, among other dignitaries, he added.

Anecdotally, it often seems that people aren’t too satisfied with the products and user experience, especially in areas like onboarding, dispute resolution, and overall seamlessness.
Yet, one look at the payments report suggests none of it is really deterring the uptake. Almost every data point exhibits a high growth trajectory, even if people may not appreciate its extent at times. As of FY25, Pakistan boasts more than 123 million registered digital platform users across mobile, internet, branchless and other wallets. For context, that’s slightly more than half of all registered deposit-taking accounts in the country.
This is not a mean feat by any stretch of the imagination, because not too long ago, Pakistan ranked at the bottom of most rankings. Usage has been even more explosive, with mobile banking alone processing a throughput of Rs83.2 trillion in FY25, up 80 per cent over the previous year.
More importantly, it processed 1.8 billion transactions during the year, outpacing ATMs, internet banking, point-of-sale, and e-commerce combined. And remember, it’s not even the biggest driver of digital payment: that mantle belongs to branchless wallets, which recorded volumes of 4.2bn, albeit worth a much smaller Rs14.2tr.

In FY25, 21.7pc of all retail transactions processed through scheduled banks were digital — a record increase of 8.21 percentage points compared to the previous year

While the underlying growth rates differ across channels, the trend is unambiguously upwards. Internet banking throughput, despite being a distant second, also jumped 62pc to Rs38.1tr while volumes rose 24pc to 276.5m. Similarly, point of sale, probably the oldest truly digital channel in the country, saw a happening year, marked by aggressive efforts from new entrants and pricing pressures.
As a result, it finally crossed the benchmark of Rs2tr, closing FY25 at Rs2.1tr, up 37pc year-on-year. Volumes reached 377.7m, rising 39pc. There was a notable uptake on the infrastructure as well, with payment cards hitting 59.3m and the number of terminals reaching 195,849 across 159,284 merchants.
However, e-commerce, or better a subsection of it, remains a perennial disappointment. Card-based transactions did manage to cross 50m at least, reaching 51.8m in FY25 — up 30pc and finally above FY22 levels. Throughput grew at a similar pace to Rs249.7bn, from Rs194.3bn in FY24. This happened despite some expansion in acquiring infrastructure, with bank-registered merchants reaching 9,584 and electronic money institutions’ networks growing to 16,635 by June.
Limiting e-commerce to just cards is a little stupid, though, considering how Pakistan’s payments mix is largely accounts-based. Therefore, it shouldn’t really come as a surprise that branchless wallets processed a far more impressive 683.9m online merchant transactions worth Rs662.7bn during FY25. An even larger chunk of throughput surely sits within mobile banking fund transfers, though no one has figured out a way to measure it yet.
 
 

Though valuable in their own right, these numbers have one big problem: they are stripped of any context. After all, absolute values are almost guaranteed to increase in double digits, if not more. This warrants a couple of questions. First, what really constitutes “high growth”? Are we talking in reference to our own past or the peer markets?
Some percentage increase in the value of a certain variable doesn’t really tell much in itself. Say a developing economy manages to raise output by 2pc: would you consider it good or bad? In regular circumstances, not great, but if the same performance was shown during the pandemic when the rest of the world was seeing significant declines, the same figure appears impressive.
Secondly, what’s the base we are comparing against? Let’s assume we see a 4x jump in digital transactions to 30bn next year. On paper, that would be phenomenal, but what if it accounts for just 2pc of the overall exchange of money between people and businesses? How would you perceive that?
In the first case, I don’t really have an answer ready because it would take quite some time and resources to do a thorough comparative analysis of Pakistan’s payment systems with peer markets. For the second, we have at least tried to offer some context, though it’s far from perfect. For the last few years, Data Darbar has been calculating a simple “retail digitisation percentage” that measures the share of retail transactions from scheduled banks that are digital. Unlike the SBP, we don’t incorporate ATMs.
Moreover, for now, the branchless banking universe is not included in it either because of issues with consistency in data reporting. While the SBP has now made adjustments to its methodology, we don’t yet have the standardised numbers for more than three years. With these disclaimers out of the way, now let’s look at the results.
As per simple methodology, almost 60.8pc of retail scheduled banking transaction volumes had been conducted through digital channels in FY25, up from 52.5pc and broadly in line with its growth trajectory. The bigger problem had always been throughput, where both the scale and the pace of digitisation were much smaller.
And that’s where we finally had a breakout change: in FY25, 21.7pc of the retail throughput through scheduled banks was digital, witnessing a record 8.21 percentage point increase over the previous year. The challenge is how we capitalise on this and accelerate the momentum further. Because, unlike the fund transfers side, where minimum effort is enough to drive high usage, the universe of business-to-business payments would require sustained effort, not just from the central bank and its regulated entities, but also from the tax authorities.

• Calls from IMF, armed forces, others to re-balance transfer of resources to provinces go unheeded
• Centre ‘backs off’ from changes to award after deal with PPP
ISLAMABAD: The inaugural session of the National Finance Commission (NFC), constituted three months ago, is not in sight, as the proposed date of Nov 18 has also been postponed amid a downward revision in the economic growth forecast by up to 0.7 per cent to 3.5pc for the current fiscal year.
Informed sources said told Dawn that Prime Minister Shehbaz  Sharif wanted to set the ball rolling at the political level on key Centre-provincial matters before opening the debate for financial rearrangements at the technically-constitutional forum of NFC.
The 11th NFC was constituted on Aug 22 to give a fresh award for the sharing of federal divisible resources among the Centre and the provinces.
The first meeting was originally called for Aug 27 and then delayed to Aug 29 for unannounced reasons. The meeting was postponed again on the request of Sindh government due to floods.
The 7th NFC award delivered in 2009 thus remains in place for over 15 years against its five-year constitutional term.
As a result, repeated calls from various quarters, including the finance ministry, the armed forces, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to re-balance the transfer of a larger chunk of divisible pool resources to the provinces under the 7th NFC award have gone unaddressed.
 
 

The Constitution promises that provincial shares in each NFC award cannot be reduced. The NFC award has to be achieved with consensus of five parties — the Centre and the four provinces.
Under the 7th NFC award, the four provinces are collectively entitled to 57.5pc of divisible pool taxes, besides the revenue from income tax, wealth tax, capital value tax, general sales tax, customs duties and federal excise.
The provincial governments receive their horizontal shares on the basis of population, poverty, revenue collection, and inverse population density.
This allows Punjab to obtain a share of 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc, and Balochistan 9.09pc.
Political bargain
The sources said the provinces had been conveyed the date of Nov 18 for the inaugural meeting early this month, although without issuing a formal notification.
They added that the Prime Minister’s Office called for postponing the meeting and for not communicating a new date to the provinces before the premier could take up the matter with the coalition partners.
The prime minister has officially no role in the NFC engagements after the commission is constituted by the president.
The revision in the NFC parameters was originally part of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment as the Centre wanted to reduce the financial shares of the provinces and take back some of the devolved subjects like education, population, etc.
However, the federal government stepped back in a political bargain with its main coalition partner, the PPP, for amendments relating to the armed forces and the judiciary.
Nevertheless, the prime minister has been hinting at continuing dialogue with the PPP for the NFC.
While the Centre had already crafted a major revenue source — petroleum development levy (PDL) on various products instead of the NFC –it has also secured about Rs1.5tr cashback from the provinces outside the award.
Revenue sources outside NFC
The combined impact of the two — PDL and provincial cash surplus — work out to be around Rs3 trillion for the current fiscal year — almost 2pc of the GDP.
On top of this, the Centre has secured Rs2.5 billion each for the current and last fiscal years on account of State Bank of Pakistan’s profits as a consequence of record-high interest rates.
The provincial cash surplus could be impacted by the shortfall in Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) tax collection, which has already amounted to Rs275bn in the first four months and is likely to grow as the year progresses amid lower than the budgeted economic growth rate.
The GDP growth rate has a direct bearing on the FBR’s tax collection and as a consequence on the NFC shares of the provinces and then their commitments to provide cash surplus to the Centre under the National Financial Pact orchestrated outside the Constitution under the dictats of the IMF to ensure healthy finances to the federation.
The lower GDP growth could, however, be partly compensated by higher inflation that generate greater sales tax receipts.
Flood devastation
Recently, the finance ministry told the National Assembly that a report compiled by the planning ministry based on data available as of Sept 30 showed that flood “devastation has led to a projected reduction in FY2026 GDP growth by 0.3-0.7pc, lowering the growth outlook from 4.2pc to a range of 3.5-3.9pc”.
The planning ministry had estimated economic loss of Rs822bn, equivalent to approximately $2.9bn, it said.
The finance ministry said the floods had exerted upward pressure on inflation.
In the first two months of FY2026 — July and August — inflation remained at 4.1pc and 3pc, respectively; however, in September, it surged to 5.6pc, mainly driven by higher food prices, it added.
The agriculture sector, with damages of Rs430bn (crops losses at Rs422.7bn), alongside significant infrastructure losses of Rs307bn (road infrastructure losses at Rs187.8bn), have been a primary driver of this downturn, the finance ministry said, adding that “due to the crops damages, the growth of agriculture sector is projected at 3pc-3.8pc against the target of 4.5pc.
 
 

The finance ministry further said the annual targets for key macroeconomic variables were approved by the National Economic Council.
“These targets remain intact; however, internal assessments are carried out to evaluate the impacts of changing domestic and external conditions,” it added.
“Amid the recent floods, considering the estimated economic loss of Rs822bn, the overall GDP growth is projected to decline for FY2025- 26 based on lower growth in agriculture due to extensive crop damages while growth in industry and services may also suffer due to linkages with agriculture.”
Moreover, it warned that the rice exports could also suffer while imports of raw cotton, wheat, pulses, and construction materials could increase, thereby widening the trade deficit and straining foreign exchange reserves.
However, higher expected workers’ remittances might offset the adverse impact of floods and keeping the current account deficit in check. Likewise, there is a risk of inflationary pressures, particularly on food and essential items, due to crop losses, supply chain disruptions, and higher input costs.

“Iran is a brotherly, friendly country. Pakistan is always in favour of finding peaceful resolutions of issues through dialogue and diplomacy, and we appreciate the offer of mediation of our brotherly country, Iran,” Andrabi told Dawn upon a query about reports that Tehran was working to convene a regional meeting for mediation between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban.
“We believe that Iran can play an important role. We would not shy away from any mediatory role by Iran. Mediations are always welcome,” Andrabi said, adding that Pakistan had a “very strong case”.
He further stated: “Generally, mediations are resented by a country or a side which is on a weak legal or a political case. Pakistan’s case on this issue, on terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, is very strong. So, obviously we will not shy away from mediation.”
Pakistan, which has been grappling with the problem of terrorism for long, has been demanding that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But, the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
Earlier this month, a third round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators from Turkiye and Qatar, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to prevent cross-border terrorism. The talks had followed deadly border clashes between the two neighbours in October.
The border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on the night of October 11 and continued into the next morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm or deny whether it was behind the strikes, but maintained that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on the evening of October 15, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
But on November 7, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban have suspended trade ties with Pakistan.
Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Iran and Russia called for continued dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan to resolve their ongoing disputes on cross-border terrorism.
Previously on Nov 9, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had spoken with his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul.
According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi had also expressed Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries.
The same day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to suffer casualties among its security forces and civilian population in terror attacks, which authorities link to Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-11-17 02:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16224610aa21e67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955465/pilgrims-with-certain-diseases-health-conditions-to-be-barred-from-performing-haj-in-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Pilgrims with certain diseases, health conditions to be barred from performing Haj in 2026</strong></a><br><p>The Saudi government has imposed a restriction on pilgrims with certain health conditions, including chronic and infectious diseases, from performing Haj next year, according to a notice on the Ministry of Religious Affairs website.
The notice, citing the Saudi health ministry, lists organ failure such as kidney diseases requiring dialysis, heart diseases in cases where patients are not capable of even slight exertion, chronic lung disease with patients requiring intermittent or continuous oxygen and liver failure or liver cirrhosis as conditions that do not meet the criteria for Haj.
The list also includes those suffering from neurological or cognitive disorders that affect memory, dementia and severe physical disability. Moreover, aged individuals with Alzheimer’s or suffering from tremors, as well as pregnant women in their last trimester or with those with complicated pregnancies, would also face restrictions.
Furthermore, those with infectious diseases that pose a risk to others in large gatherings, such as whooping cough, open pulmonary tuberculosis and viral haemorrhagic fever, would also be barred from performing Haj.
The list further includes patients suffering from advanced stages of cancer and undergoing chemotherapy, biological or radiological treatment.
The religious affairs ministry in Pakistan urged doctors to issue health certificates to the pilgrims after proper verification to avoid legal action and warned that in case of any false and incorrect declarations about health, the relevant pilgrim would have to return from Saudi Arabia at their own expense.
In case any of the above-mentioned illnesses were detected in an individual while getting vaccinated, medical officers at the Haj camp would be authorised to stop them from travelling, the notice stated.
Saudi monitoring teams would verify the validity of the pilgrims’ fitness certificates at the entry and exit points and locations of Haj to ensure that only those meeting the health criteria participate in the pilgrimage, the notice said.</p><small>2025-11-16 20:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1610433994d91f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955436/hyderabad-fireworks-explosion-death-toll-climbs-to-9-fir-registered-against-factory-owner-and-others' target='_blank'><strong>Hyderabad fireworks explosion death toll climbs to 9; FIR registered against factory owner and others</strong></a><br><p>Police have registered a case against multiple suspects, including the owner of an allegedly illegal firecracker factory in Hyderabad, where an explosion occurred yesterday. As a result of the explosion, at least nine people have died so far.
The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered yesterday on the complaint of B-Section Station House Officer (SHO) Niaz Panhwar.
It invoked Sections 322 (punishment for intentional murder), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 286 (negligent conduct with respect explosive substance), 336 (punishment for mutilation or dismemberment of a limb), 336-B (punishment for hurt by corrosive substance), 337-H (punishment for hurt by a rash or negligent act) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Factory owner Asad Yousafzai and his alleged accomplices, Rashid Khan, Dilshad Khan, Arshad and Shakeel Punjabi, have been nominated as suspects in the FIR.
The FIR quoted SHO Panhwar as saying that he received information about the explosion and resultant fire at the factory at 4.03pm. He further stated in his complaint that police, fire brigade and rescue officials rushed to the spot, where he found some bodies upon his arrival. The injured, he added, were taken to the hospital in Edhi ambulances.
The SHO said three of the deceased could not immediately be identified.
According to him, factory owner Asad Yousufzai and his accomplices had set up the factory illegally in the riverine area of Hyderabad’s Latifabad. Human lives were lost when the explosion occurred at the site, and human limbs were found at the spot, he said.
Separately,  Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Adeel Chandio told Dawn that police had arrested some of the suspects, but prime suspect Yousufzai remained at large and raids were being conducted to hunt him down.
Death toll
The seventh death as a consequence of the incident was reported earlier today after another body was pulled out from the rubble of the explosion.
Rescue officials confirmed to Dawn the recovery of one more body from the rubble, which was pulled out late on Saturday.
Later today, Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital’s medical superintendent (MS), Dr Khalid Bukhari, told Dawn over the phone that two of the injured brought to the facility in Karachi had succumbed to their injuries.
They had suffered severe burns, he said, adding that one of the injured, who had full-thickness burns and whose left leg had been amputated, died today morning and another died in the evening.
Hyderabad’s Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) administration had been informed of the deaths, the MS said.
Dr Roshan Chandio, the registrar at the LUH burns ward, also confirmed to Dawn that two patients who had been shifted to Karachi’s Civil Hospital due to their critical condition had died.
Meanwhile, Hyderabad Deputy Commissioner Zain Ul Abedin Memon told Dawn that he had approached Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Vice Chancellor Dr Ikram Din Ujjan and LUH MS Ershad Kazmi regarding the identification of four of the bodies.
“The severely burned bodies have been claimed by their heirs, but DNA tests are required to confirm their identities,” he said, adding that he had written letters to Dr Ujjan and Kazmi, asking them to conduct the bodies’ DNA tests at the earliest.
He added that he had instructed that the heirs should be facilitated throughout the process and not be charged for the tests or other related formalities, considering the humanitarian aspect of the case.
‘Illegal factory’
Yesterday, Latifabad Assistant Commissioner Saud Lund had confirmed that firecrackers at the factory were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence.
However, the Hyderabad senior superintendent of police said: “Initial findings show that the factory owner actually got a licence for some other spot, but he was manufacturing firecrackers at the present location.”
He said that the owner was absconding, and details of the factory’s licence were being verified
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed the relevant authorities to determine the cause of the explosion and conduct a comprehensive audit of the factory’s safety measures.

Electing to bowl first at Doha’s West End Park, Pakistan’s disciplined attack triggered a spectacular Indian collapse, bundling out the opposition for 136 in 19 overs after a promising start.
Teenage sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi, 14, lit up the innings with a fiery 45 off 28 balls (five fours and three sixes), smashing boundaries at will against Ubaid Shah and Shahid Aziz. Partnering with Naman Dhir (35 off 20, six fours and a six), Suryavanshi added 49 for the second wicket, propelling India to 81-2 by the ninth over.
But Sufiyan Muqeem’s left-arm wrist spin turned the tide, dismissing Suryavanshi caught at long-on in a contentious decision upheld after multiple replays.
Captain Jitesh Sharma’s scratchy five precipitated a middle-order meltdown; India lost eight wickets for just 35 runs in the final 10 overs.
Maaz (2-12) and Saad Masood (2-31) choked the scoring with clever variations, while Shahid (3-24) mopped up the tail with yorkers and slower balls. Harsh Dubey’s late 19 off 15 offered brief resistance, but India’s total — the tournament’s lowest a day after their 297 against UAE — proved inadequate.
Shaheen’s chase began aggressively, Maaz and Mohammad Naeem (14 off 10) racing to 51-0 in five overs thanks to Gurjapneet Singh’s wayward spell (. Yash Thakur provided a breakthrough, with Dhir’s diving catch at mid-off, but Maaz exploded; a half-century off 31 balls included audacious sixes off Dhir’s off-spin and Suyash Sharma.
Dropped on 56 by Suryavanshi at point, Maaz unleashed fury, sealing victory with Mohammad Faiq (16 not out off 14) via a pull for six in the 14th over.
India’s fielding woes — missed chances and misfields — compounded bowling errors, as Pakistan’s required run rate dipped below four.
Scores in brief:
INDIA ‘A’ 136 in 19 overs (V. Suryavanshi 45, N.

Pacers Haris Rauf and Mohammad Wasim Junior (3-47) and left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram (2-42) starred with the ball before contrasting half centuries by Fakhar Zaman (55 off 45) and Mohammad Rizwan (61 not out off 92) guided Pakistan to the 212-run target with 32 balls remaining.
It was Pakistan’s second successive ODI series triumph after their 2-1 win over South Africa earlier this month, with focus now shifting to the T20I tri-series featuring the hosts alongside Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.
After Pakistan won the toss and opted to field, Haris, Wasim and Faisal struck at regular intervals through the innings, preventing Sri Lanka from building momentum at any stage.
A flurry of crisp strokes on a batting-friendly pitch by Sri Lankan openers Patthum Nissanka and Kamil Mishara gave the visitors a flying start before the in-form Haris forced Nissanka to play one onto his stumps. Sri Lanka nevertheless reached 57-1 by the end of the first 10 overs.
First-drop Kusal Mendis carried the momentum, flicking two full deliveries by Haris for boundaries in the 11th over. But Sri Lanka suffered another setback when Mishara poked at an outswinger by Wasim to get caught behind in the next over.
The dismissal slowed down the run-rate, with Kusal and Sadeera Samarawickrama taking Sri Lanka to 99-2 by the 20th over, which featured a successful DRS review saving Samarawickrama after an lbw decision by spinner Faisal.
With the boundary drought stretching — 47 balls to be precise — pressure mounted on the batters, culminating in another breakthrough for Pakistan and another for Wasim, who seamed one in to castle Kusal through the gate as the Islanders slipped to 117-3 at the halfway mark.
Faisal, who had kept things tight in his five overs, returned to remove Kamindu Mendis off his own bowling in a soft dismissal, pushing Sri Lanka deeper into trouble. Janith Liyanage followed next, chopping Faheem Ashraf’s medium pace onto his stumps.
Faisal then produced a superb delivery in the 36th over, spinning one back sharply into the right-handed Samarawickrama to bowl him for 48.
Maheesh Theekshana fell soon after to a searing yorker by Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, with DRS upholding the lbw call. Another pinpoint yorker saw Wasim uproot Jefferey Vandersay’s middle stump.
After Pavan Rathnayake threatened a late rally by launching Haris over long-off for six, his partner Pramod Madushan succumbed to a fierce bouncer, the ball flying off his gloves into the hands of wicket-keeper Haseebullah Khan.
Rathnayake was the last to fall, courtesy of a sharp throw by substitute Saim Ayub that found him short of his crease.
Pakistan’s start with the bat proved tricky as opener Haseebullah perished attempting to clear the infield off Maheesh Theekshana but ended up holing out to Eshan Malinga at mid-on in the fourth over.
Fakhar responded to the early wicket with a firm whip through midwicket off Pramod Madushan for his second boundary, before Babar Azam punched Theekshana for two crisp drives through the off side in the next over.
Fakhar heaved Theekshana over his head for another four as Pakistan reached 46-1 by the end of 10 overs.
Fakhar and Babar raised their fifty stand in the 12th over, the latter caressing Madushan for a cover boundary before the former punished a wide delivery by medium-pacer Liyanage for four.
Fakhar notched his 19th ODI half-century by smacking Jeffery Vandersay through the on side in the 14th over. But he departed soon after — for 55 off 45 — finding a diving Kamindu Mendis at deep midwicket off Vandersay.
Just as Pakistan crossed 100 in the 20th over, Vandersay delivered a brilliant googly to deceive Babar (34 off 52) and shatter his stumps.
The leg-spinner struck again in the 25th over, trapping Salman Ali Agha lbw, the third umpire overturning the on-field decision as Sri Lanka sensed an opening at the halfway stage.
Rizwan, at the other end, responded with an exquisite cover drive off Malinga in the following over.
But as the pitch’s sluggishness increasingly came into play, Rizwan and incoming Hussain Talat opted for caution, relying on hard running rather than strokeplay.
The next boundary arrived after more than 12 overs when Rizwan placed a full toss by Malinga behind square with ease. The former Pakistan captain brought up his second successive fifty off 84 balls in the 42nd over.
He was dropped on 55 in the 44th over, but Pakistan needed only nine more runs by then.
Four came off a straight drive by Rizwan against Madushan before Hussain (42 off 57) struck another boundary to seal the match.</p><small>2025-11-16 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/162112011983575.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955463/jaffar-express-targeted-again-escapes-bomb-attack-in-balochistans-nasirabad-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Jaffar Express targeted again, escapes bomb attack in Balochistan’s Nasirabad: officials</strong></a><br><p>The Jaffar Express, which has been targeted multiple times in the recent past, escaped a bomb attack in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district on Sunday, police and railway officials said.
According to police officials, unidentified attackers had planted an explosive device on the railway track in the Shaheed Abdul Aziz Bullo area to target the Peshawar-bound train that was travelling from Quetta and later detonated it.
However, the train passed the area safely, and no loss of life was reported, the officials said.
Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police Ghulam Sarwar told Dawn that police and other security forces had reached the site soon after the blast, cordoned off the area and initiated an investigation.
“A search operation has also been launched to trace the elements involved in the bomb attack,” he said.
Separately, railway officials told Dawn a portion of the track was damaged due to the blast, as a result of which railway traffic between Quetta and the rest of the country was suspended. Meanwhile, the officials added that the Jaffar Express continued its journey to Peshawar after reaching Jacobabad in Sindh.
The railway officials said Jaffar Express had resumed operations today after a suspension of four days. The train’s operations were suspended due to security concerns, they said.
With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Jaffar Express has been attacked frequently since March 11, when  Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Consequently, the security forces initiated an operation that lasted two days.
Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the Jaffar Express clearance operation launched a day after the train’s unprecedented hijacking, was complete. He added that all terrorists, 33 in total, at the site of the attack had been killed.
On June 18, the detonation of a remote-controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks derailed four bogies of the Jaffar Express near the cattle market in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident, but the attack was reportedly claimed by the banned Baloch Repu­blican Guards in a statement.
On August 7, the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped disaster when a bomb planted near the track close to Sibi Railway Station exploded just after the passenger train passed.
Later that week on August 10, no loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of Jaffar Express. Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told Dawn: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train.“
On September 23, at least four people were injured as a blast derailed six bogies of Jaffar Express near Spezand town in the Dasht tehsil of Balochistan’s Mastung district.
On October 7, at least seven people were injured after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district.
Shikarpur Deputy Commissioner Shakeel Abro told Dawn, “A blast had occurred on the train tracks at 8:15am. The incident occurred at a distance of 1km from the Sultan Kot railway station.”
Later that month, on October 29, the train service escaped a rocket attack in the Notal area of Nasir­abad district.
“Armed men fired four rockets from a distance to target the passenger train,”  Nasira­bad SSP Ghulam Sarwar told Dawn, adding that none of the rockets hit the train.</p><small>2025-11-16 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16201134ff2cf64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955460/accomplice-of-delhi-car-blast-suicide-bomber-arrested-indian-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>Accomplice of Delhi car blast ‘suicide bomber’ arrested: Indian authorities</strong></a><br><p>Indian authorities claimed on Sunday that a deadly car blast in New Delhi earlier this week was an attack carried out by a “suicide bomber”, announcing the arrest of an accomplice.
The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the country’s counter-terrorism body, said the attacker and the second suspect were both from India-occupied Kashmir, where police have carried out sweeping raids in recent days.
Announcing “a breakthrough” in the investigation, the NIA said it had arrested Amir Rashid Ali, describing him as an accomplice of the “suicide bomber” under whose name “the car involved in the attack was registered”.
He had come to Delhi to “facilitate the purchase of the car which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to trigger the blast”, the counter-terrorism agency said in a statement.
It identified the car’s driver as Umarun Nabi, a resident of occupied Kashmir who was an assistant professor in general medicine at a university in the northern state of Haryana.
The explosion on Monday took place near a busy metro station close to the landmark Red Fort in the capital’s Old Delhi quarter, where the prime minister delivers the annual Independence Day address.
A hospital official said the blast killed 12 people. It was unclear whether Nabi was included in the toll. The NIA’s statement said the attack “claimed 10 innocent lives and left 32 others injured”.
The NIA claimed it had seized another vehicle belonging to Nabi.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the attack a “conspiracy”, and his government vowed to bring the “perpetrators, their collaborators and their sponsors” to justice.</p><small>2025-11-16 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16210526f4bc4d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955462/us-house-speaker-says-nothing-to-hide-in-epstein-files' target='_blank'><strong>US House speaker says ‘nothing to hide’ in Epstein files</strong></a><br><p>US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday that he believed the approaching vote on releasing Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein should help put to rest allegations that President Donald Trump had any connection to the late sex offender’s abuse and trafficking of underage girls.
“They’re doing this to go after President Trump on this theory that he has something to do with it. He does not,” Johnson, the Republican leader in the House, said on the ‘Fox News Sunday’ programme.
“Epstein is their entire game plan, so we’re going to take that weapon out of their hands,” Johnson said of Democrats. “Let’s just get this done and move it on. There’s nothing to hide.”
 


Though Trump and Epstein were photographed together decades ago, the president has said the two men fell out prior to Epstein’s convictions. Emails released last week by a House committee showed Epstein believed Trump “knew about the girls,” though it was not clear what that phrase meant.
Trump has since instructed the Department of Justice to investigate prominent Democrats’ ties to Epstein.
The battle over disclosure of more Epstein-related documents, a subject Trump himself campaigned on, has opened a rift with some of his allies in Congress.
Trump, late on Friday, withdrew his support for US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, long one of his staunchest supporters in Congress, following her criticism of Republicans on certain issues, including the handling of the Epstein files.
In an appearance on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ program on Sunday, Greene said she did not believe as-yet-unreleased files would implicate the president, but she renewed her call for further transparency.
“I don’t believe that rich, powerful people should be protected if they have done anything wrong,” she said.

The army chief also underscored the “strong defence partnership” between Pakistan and the Hashemite Kingdom — the royal family of Jordan — during a visit of Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein at the Tilla Field Firing Ranges near Jhelum, a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The Jordanian king, who arrived in Pakistan for a two-day official visit on Saturday, also visited Global Industrial and Defence Solutions, the state-owned conglomerate involved in the export and marketing of military, industrial and technological products and services. He was accompanied by Princess Salma bint Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein and a delegation of Jordanian civil and military officials and was received by Field Marshal Munir and other officials, according to the ISPR.
 






The ISPR statement said that during his visit to GIDS, the Jordanian king was given a comprehensive briefing on the structure, capabilities, and product portfolio of the conglomerate.
“The briefing showcased Pakistan’s progress in indigenous defence production, technological innovation, and potential avenues for bilateral defence cooperation between Pakistan and Jordan,” the statement added.
Later, it said, King Abdullah visited Tilla Field Firing Ranges, where he was joined by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “Vugar Valeh oglu Mustafayev, minister of defence industry of the Republic of Azerbaijan, was also amongst the distinguished guests at the firing ranges.”
At the firing ranges, the “distinguished guests witnessed a joint fire and manoeuvre exercise”, the ISPR statement said, adding that the “exercise demonstrated multi-domain operations, including conventional and air firepower, coordinated manoeuvres, spectrum warfare capabilities supported by multi-purpose drones employed in various configurations and roles”.

“King Abdullah II appreciated the high standards of training, professionalism, and operational capabilities and preparedness demonstrated by the participating troops and aircrews,” it further stated.
Moreover, PM Shehbaz expressed “Pakistan’s deep respect and affection for His Majesty King Abdullah II and the people of Jordan, noting that the visit reflects the enduring friendship, mutual trust and a shared desire for peace and development”.
Earlier, the ISPR statement said, King Abdullah conferred upon the COAS the Order of the Military Merit of First Degree, “in recognition of his outstanding service and significant contributions to strengthening military cooperation between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Pakistan”.
The statement highlighted that the Jordanian king’s visit to Pakistan “marks a significant milestone in reinforcing the historic bonds of fraternity and brotherhood between Pakistan and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan”.
Highest civilian award for Jordanian king
Separately, the Government of Pakistan also conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan, the country’s highest civilian award, upon King Abdullah II of Jordan
during a special Investiture ceremony at the Presidency in Islamabad today.
The accolade was presented to the king, who is on a two-day visit to the country, by President Asif Ali Zardari. In response, King Abdullah conferred the Order of the Bejewelled Grand Cordon of Al-Nahda, one of the kingdom’s highest honours, upon President Zardari.

PM Shehbaz and other federal ministers were present at the ceremony, while PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari were also in attendance.
“His Majesty, King Abdullah II … is a visionary leader and a statesman of exceptional statesmanship who has championed the cause of moderation, justice and dialogue amongst nations,” the citation for the award said.
“Under His Majesty’s sagacious leadership, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has emerged as a beacon of stability, tolerance and prosperity in the region,” it added. “His unwavering advocacy for a just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question and his efforts towards reaching the Gaza peace agreement have earned him profound international acclaim and recognition.
“His Majesty has been a steadfast friend of Pakistan. By virtue of his personal engagement, the bilateral relations between Pakistan and Jordan have been significantly strengthened across diverse fields encompassing political and economic cooperation, defence collaboration, educational partnerships, cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts.”
It continued: “These developments serve to reinforce the enduring foundation of the historic friendship and brotherhood between the two nations, while concurrently fostering new avenues of cooperation.
“The people and government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan deeply value His Majesty King Abdullah II’s … commitment to strengthening bilateral relations and consistent solidarity with Pakistan.
“In recognition of his remarkable statesmanship and enduring contributions for further cementing Pakistan-Jordan relations, coupled with promotion of regional and international peace, the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has been pleased to confer … the award of Nishan-i-Pakistan as a symbol of profound respect, admiration and friendship from the people and Government of Pakistan.”
The prime minister and Jordanian king also held a bilateral meeting on Saturday at the PM House after the latter arrived in Pakistan.
During the meeting, both leaders affirmed “zero-tolerance” for any displacement of Palestinians from the besieged Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the devastating military onslaught by Israel in the territory.
King Abdullah II also praised Pakistan’s consistent support for Jordan’s role in regional stability and humanitarian efforts during the Gaza conflict, as well as for the territory after the ceasefire.
Both dignitaries also witnessed a ceremony on the exchange of memorandums of understanding in the fields of media, culture and education.</p><small>2025-11-16 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633906-constitution-will-reflect-parliament-and-people-not-judges-talal-chaudhry' target='_blank'><strong>Constitution will reflect parliament and people, not judges: Talal Chaudhry</strong></a><br><p>

The army chief made these comments to the Urdu newspaper during a luncheon held in honour of King Abdullah II of Jordan, who arrived in Islamabad yesterday for a two-day visit.
“During the war with India, Allah helped us raise our heads high,” Field Marshal Munir said. “When a Muslim puts their trust in Allah, He turns the dirt thrown at the enemy into missiles.”
The COAS added that he performs his duties according to the command of Allah and said it was by God’s grace that Pakistan defeated its enemy.
“This army is an army of Allah and our soldiers fight in His name,” the field marshal added.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched the retaliatory ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul last month, Field Marshal Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.”
Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.“</p><small>2025-11-16 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161821126d3a0d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955438/karachi-may-face-water-shortage-due-to-power-breakdown-at-dhabeji-restoration-expected-by-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi may face water shortage due to power breakdown at Dhabeji; restoration expected by tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Karachi could face a shortfall of 100 million gallons of water per day (MGD) due to a power breakdown at the Dhabeji Pumping Station, which is expected to be fully repaired by tomorrow, the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) said on Sunday.
The Dhabeji Pumping Station is a key pumping station operated by KWSC, Karachi’s sole water utility, that serves the city’s major areas. Past breakdowns at the facility have impacted supply to the East and Central districts, including areas like Nazimabad, New Karachi, Landhi and Korangi.
In a statement today, a KWSC spokesperson said the “major” power breakdown in the second phase of the Dhabeji station was reported at 6:35am.
“Due to the sudden power suspension, 72-inch line No. 5 has been affected, while four pumps of the phase shut down,” a later statement by the KWSC said, adding that the issue “severely damaged” the water supply system.
“According to initial estimates, the city could face a shortage of 100 million gallons of water due to the pumps’ shutdown and the line being impacted,” the KWSC cautioned.
It said water supply to the city was resumed by restoring power supply to two pumps of the station’s second phase at 9am. The other two pumps will also be made functional again as soon as the repair work on the affected pipeline is complete, the utility added.
 
 

The repair work of the affected line had been initiated on an “emergency basis” on the directives of KWSC Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Ali Siddiqui, the statement noted.
It assured the citizens that KWSC’s technical teams were “utilising all resources in making every effort to restore the water supply from the affected line”.
According to the statement, the restoration work is expected to be completed by Monday, after which the entire system of the Dhabeji Pumping Station will be operational again as usual.
The KWSC asserted that repair work of the affected line “will be completed on an emergency basis”, and assured citizens that the utility’s management was making every effort to complete the repair work in a timely manner.
“As soon as the repair work has been completed, Dhabeji Pumping Station’s system will return to routine,” the utility added.
The statement recalled that electricity at the Dhabeji station had remained suspended for “many hours” on November 5, November 11 and November 13 due to a “cable fault of K-Electric in the second phase, fourth phase and the K-III Pumping House”.
The KE said on November 14 (Friday) that power on 20 of the 22 pumps had been restored. The utility blamed “leakages” in the KWSC’s water pipelines for damaging the underground electricity cables.
 






The Dhabeji Pumping Station, which is the city’s primary water intake point, is highly dependent on uninterrupted electricity. Even brief outages result in immediate service disruptions.
The station has been facing multiple problems related to poor maintenance and technical issues for a decade, with multiple breakdowns this year alone, leaving residents in many areas grappling with a water crisis.
 
 

Karachi faced a shortfall of 100MGD in January after “two water pipelines burst due to a power outage” at the Dhabeji station. The facility also remained without electricity for at least three days in late June, causing a shortfall of 350MGD.
Last month, one pump at the Dhabeji station was taken offline for maintenance-related needs, while the North East Pumping Station already faced a power breakdown.
Due to persistent water shortages across the city, people mostly rely on water tankers.

Pakistan is home to about 13,000 glaciers. According to a 2023 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), Hima­layan glaciers, which provide critical water to nearly two billion people, are melting faster than ever before due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters.
The minister made the remarks at the sidelines of COP30, at an event titled “Cryosphere Adaptation & Disaster Risk Reduction”, where he delivered the keynote address via video, the Press Information Department (PID) said on Saturday.
Malik told the participants that “climate-induced glacier melt is occurring at an unprecedented pace,” calling for the “urgent need” to protect the HKH cryosphere, which he described as the “white rooftops of the world” and the “primary lifeline of millions across South Asia.”
 


As per the PID statement, the event — organised by the Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination in collaboration with the ICIMOD — featured interventions from Deputy Ministers of Türkiye and Azerbaijan, the Director General of ICIMOD, and senior representatives from Nepal, Bhutan, UNESCO, UNDP, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
“Pakistan hosts 13,000 glaciers, which feed the Indus River system and sustain the country’s agricultural, ecological, and economic foundations,” the press release quoted Malik as saying.
He informed the audience that climate-induced glacier melt was “resulting in severe losses and damages, including Glaicial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs).”
A Glofs refers to a rush of water from a glacial lake, which could lead to severe flooding downstream.
Terming it an issue of “justice and rights”, Malik said: “Seventy per cent of the world’s carbon emissions come from just ten countries, yet these same countries receive 85pc of global green finance.“
“He urged countries with historic emissions responsibility to contribute their fair share toward adaptation and resilience in vulnerable mountain regions, calling on the global community to elevate the cryosphere agenda at COP30,” the press release read.
Malik, in his address, also noted that Pakistan had “demonstrated leadership through its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC 3.0)”.
As per the 2023 ICIMOD report, glaciers in the HKH region are a crucial water source for around 240m people in the mountainous regions, as well as for another 1.65bn people in the river valleys below.
Based on current emissions trajectories, the glaciers could lose up to 80pc of their current volume by the end of the century, said the Nepal-based ICIMOD.</p><small>2025-11-16 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633894-karachi-to-face-water-shortage-as-power-breakdown-hits-dhabeji-pumping-station' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to face water shortage as power breakdown hits Dhabeji pumping station</strong></a><br><p>

Thousands marched on the capital’s historic main public square, the Zocalo, in a demonstration fueled by young Mexicans with ties to a global wave of Generation Z protests as well as supporters of the domestic “Sombrero Movement,” which emerged after the recent assassination of a mayor known for his fight against organised crime.

AFP observed participants of all ages taking part in the rally in front of the National Palace, where President Claudia Sheinbaum lives and works.
Several protesters, some wearing balaclavas, toppled the metal barriers protecting the palace and threw paving stones at riot police, who responded with tear gas, according to AFP journalists.
“For many hours, this mobilisation proceeded and developed peacefully, until a group of hooded individuals began to commit acts of violence,” Pablo Vazquez, Mexico City’s security chief, told reporters.
Twenty protesters and 100 police were injured, with 40 officers hospitalised for cuts and bruises, he added.
Police arrested 20 people for theft and assault, Vazquez said, and had also launched an investigation into the assault of a journalist from La Jornada newspaper, who alleged that police officers were behind the incident.
Inspired by murdered mayor
Sheinbaum, in power since October 2024, maintained approval ratings above 70 per cent in her first year in office but faced growing criticism of her security policies in the wake of several high-profile murders.
“This is one of the most corrupt governments we’ve ever had,” said Valentina Ramirez, a student interviewed by AFP. “It’s a corrupt narco-government that wants to defend the corrupt and the cartels instead of the people.”
On Saturday, several protesters wore sombreros similar to the style of hat made famous by Carlos Manzo, a mayor in western Michoacan state who was assassinated on November 1. He had been known for his crusade against drug-trafficking gangs in his hometown Uruapan.
 
 


The assassinated mayor’s widow, however, distanced her husband’s movement from the demonstration on Saturday.
Bernardo Bravo, a leader of lime producers in the same region, had also been shot dead in late October.
Earlier this week, Sheinbaum questioned the motivations for the demonstration and said at her regular morning news conference that the protest was “inorganic” and “paid for”.
“It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,” she said.
Demonstrators displayed banners bearing messages such as “We are all Carlos Manzo” alongside the iconic pirate flag from the Japanese manga One Piece, which has become a symbol of youth protest around the world, from Madagascar to the Philippines and Peru.
“You should have protected Carlos Manzo like this!” some protesters shouted at security forces, who responded with fire extinguishers and tear gas.</p><small>2025-11-16 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161604414ee7f4e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955449/tallal-chaudhry-says-parliament-can-bring-another-constitutional-amendment-for-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Tallal Chaudhry says parliament can bring another constitutional amendment for ‘stability’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on Saturday said the ruling coalition could introduce another constitutional amendment if needed to “maintain stability” in the country.
His remarks come just three days after the 27th Amendment was signed into law after passage from the National Assembly and the Senate, amid strong opposition by the opposition parties.

Insisting that the 26th and 27th Amendments brought “stability” to the country,  Chaudhry said, “If another amendment is needed to maintain this stability, we will definitely bring it together with other parties.”
“The parliament will bring amendments whenever it wants, and the parliament should do them. The parliament should be seen as a parliament,” the PML-N leader said while addressing a media briefing in Punjab’s Faisalabad.
Responding to a query, Chaudhry termed the recent resignations of superior court judges as “political”.
On November 13, the day the 27th Amendment was enacted into law, the Supreme Court’s then-senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah resigned, censuring the legislation as an “assault” on the Constitution and as weakening the judiciary.
A day later, Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza quit the Lahore High Court, also citing the 27th Amendment as the reason, and the Islamabad High Court might also see some departures.
The state minister asserted that making amendments to the Constitution was the parliament’s right.
“Judges take oath under the Constitution; they are not a political party that they will resign if the Constitution is amended,” the PML-N leader said. “The Constitution will not be as per their (judges’) wishes, but of the parliament and the people of Pakistan,” he asserted.
“Their (judges’) every single thing — from their salaries to their decisions — is decided by the parliament,” the state minister said.
He further accused the senior judges who resigned of being “biased” and of handing “political” judgments.
“There have been many extensions of ‘good to see you’, but the environment is not the same anymore,” Chaudhry quipped, referring to the renowned remark made by former Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial in May 2023, when he said “good to see you” to ex-premier Imran Khan upon his court appearance.
 
 

The PML-N leader lamented the judges’ alleged excessive use of suo-motus — the SC’s power to take notice of matters of public importance but has now been revoked under the 27th Amendment — to “send prime ministers home” and assail the government on a whim.
On the PTI’s decision to boycott the upcoming by-elections in Faisalabad, Chaudhry said the party did not want to contest wherever there was considerable opposition.
By-elections on two NA seats (NA-96, NA-104) and three provincial ones (PP-98, PP-115, PP-116) in Faisalabad district are set for November 23.
The PML-N is likely to win all five seats up thanks to the PTI’s boycott, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) being in no condition to contest due to the recent ban on it, and the PPP fielding no candidate.</p><small>2025-11-16 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16155207647991e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955451/asylum-overhaul-in-uk-to-impose-20-year-wait-for-permanent-settlement' target='_blank'><strong>Asylum overhaul in UK to impose 20-year wait for permanent settlement</strong></a><br><p>Britain said it would make refugee status temporary, and the wait for permanent settlement would be quadrupled to 20 years under the country’s most sweeping overhaul of policy on asylum seekers in modern times.
The Labour government has been hardening its immigration policies, above all on illegal small-boat crossings from France, in efforts to stem the soaring popularity of the populist Reform UK party, which has driven the immigration agenda.
The government said it would take inspiration from Denmark’s approach, one of the toughest in Europe  — where growing anti-immigrant sentiment has led to increased restrictions in many countries  — and widely criticised by rights groups.
Temporary status subject to review
As part of the changes, the statutory duty to provide support to certain asylum seekers, including housing and weekly allowances, will be revoked, the Home Office (interior ministry) said in a statement issued late on Saturday.
The department, led by Shabana Mahmood, said the measures would apply to asylum seekers who can work but choose not to, and to those who break the law. It said that taxpayer-funded support would be prioritised for those contributing to the economy and local communities.
The Home Office also said that protection for refugees would “now be temporary, regularly reviewed and revoked” if the home country was deemed safe.
“Our system is particularly generous compared to other countries in Europe, where, after five years, you’re effectively automatically settled in this country. We will change that,” Mahmood told Sky News on Sunday.
She added that under the changes, a refugee’s status would be reviewed every two-and-a-half years, during “a much longer path to permanent settlement in this country of 20 years”.
Mahmood said she would provide further details of the changes on Monday, including an announcement on Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
The government has said it wants to stay in the ECHR but change how the Article 8 provision, covering the right to a family life, is interpreted.
Mahmood said it was being “applied in a way that is designed to frustrate the removal of those that, under our immigration rules, would not have the right to be in this country.”
The government’s tougher approach has drawn criticism. More than 100 British charities wrote to Mahmood, urging her to “end the scapegoating of migrants and performative policies that only cause harm”, saying such steps are fuelling racism and violence.
Polls suggest immigration has overtaken the economy as British voters’ top concern. Over the summer, protests took place outside hotels housing asylum seekers at public expense.
A total of 109,343 people claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending March 2025, a 17 per cent rise on the previous year and 6pc above the 2002 peak of 103,081.
Mahmood said the government would look to open more “safe and legal” routes for asylum seekers, as she believed Britain should play its part in helping those fleeing danger.
UK govt inspired by Denmark, other European countries
The Home Office said its reforms would look to “match and in some areas exceed” the standards of Denmark and other European countries, where refugee status is temporary, support is conditional and integration in society is expected.
Asylum seekers are granted temporary residence permits under Denmark’s approach, usually for two years, and they must reapply when these expire. They can be repatriated if their home country is deemed safe, and the path to citizenship has also been lengthened.
The Home Office said Denmark’s more restrictive immigration policies had reduced asylum claims to a 40-year low and resulted in the deportation of 95pc of rejected applicants.
Denmark’s reforms, implemented while it remains a signatory to the ECHR, have drawn sharp criticism. Rights groups say the measures foster a hostile climate for migrants, undermine protection and leave asylum seekers in prolonged limbo.
Britain’s Refugee Council said on X that refugees do not compare asylum systems while fleeing danger, and that they come to the UK because of family ties, some knowledge of English, or existing connections that help them start anew safely.</p><small>2025-11-16 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1615241280ecd7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955450/three-suspects-arrested-for-allegedly-attacking-cricketer-naseem-shahs-house-in-kps-lower-dir-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three suspects arrested for allegedly attacking cricketer Naseem Shah’s house in KP’s Lower Dir: police</strong></a><br><p>Police in Lower Dir have arrested three suspects in connection with the attack on Pakistani cricketer Naseem Shah’s residence in the Mayar area earlier this month, officials said on Saturday.
The attack had occurred in the early hours of November 10, when unidentified gunmen opened fire on the main gate of the cricketer’s house at around 1:45am, leaving bullet marks on doors, walls, and windows. The attackers had fled immediately, leaving the family shaken but unharmed.
A special police team, led by Superintendent of Police (SP) Investigations Rashid Ahmed Khan, and comprising Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Jandol Circle Alim Khan, Station House Officer (SHO) Mayar police station Idrees Khan, and Chief Information Officer (CIO) Hayat Muhammad Khan, investigated the case.
Reviewing CCTV footage and other evidence from the vicinity, the police said they identified and arrested the three suspects after Naseem’s father, Zafar Shah, nominated them in the case.
During interrogation, all three confessed to their involvement in the attack, the police claimed, adding that the motive behind the attack appeared to be tied to a recent land dispute between two local families.
“A few days before the incident, a disagreement over land had escalated. On the day of the attack, one party was cultivating wheat on the disputed land when the other party allegedly opened fire. As the relatives of Naseem’s mother were connected to one of the rival families, the cricketer’s house was targeted,” an official explained.
He added that further investigation into the case is underway, while authorities have enhanced security around the cricketer’s residence to prevent any further incidents.
Residents described Naseem Shah’s family as respected and law-abiding, expressing relief at the swift police action. “The arrests have brought some peace to our community,” a relative said.</p><small>2025-11-16 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161425068354d20.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955448/victim-of-sexual-assault-accuses-djinn-for-influencing-alleged-rapist-fir' target='_blank'><strong>Victim of sexual assault accuses ‘djinn’ for influencing alleged rapist: FIR</strong></a><br><p>A 40-year-old woman registered a case against her son-in-law in Punjab’s Bhadar village on Thursday, in which she accused a ‘djinn’ of taking over him and forcing him to commit sexual assault.
According to the first information report (FIR) filed with the Kakrali police, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the case was registered under section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The victim alleged that her 18-year-old son-in-law had sexually assaulted her multiple times, but claimed that he was being possessed by a djinn and controlled into doing so.
“A djinn named Adil is in love with me,” she claimed according to the FIR, adding that whenever he “gains control” of the suspect, he “does not become normal until he has sex with [her]”.
 
 

The victim added that the incidents had “destroyed” her home life and requested legal action to be taken against the suspect.
Reports of ‘djinns’ being responsible for criminal activity are uncommon, but not unheard of in Pakistan. In September, the Lahore High Court summoned the Punjab inspector general of police (IGP) in a petition seeking the recovery of a woman who had gone missing six years ago and was still unrecovered; according to the complainant and the police, the victim’s in-laws insisted she had been kidnapped by a djinn.</p><small>2025-11-16 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/161248033cdd8d3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955440/state-must-ensure-every-woman-receives-her-rightful-share-in-inheritance-sc' target='_blank'><strong>State must ensure every woman receives her rightful share in inheritance: SC</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the state must ensure every Pakistani woman gets her share in inheritance and called for a mechanism to assist them in securing this “divinely bestowed” right.
The observation came in a seven-page judgment released on Saturday, authored by Justice Athar Minallah for a case heard by him and Justice Irfan Saadat Khan on August 29. It may be noted that the verdict was authored before Justice Minallah resigned as a judge on November 13, criticising the newly passed 27th Amendment that has practically replaced the SC with the Federal Constitutional Court as the country’s apex judicial platform.
“It is incumbent upon the state under the Constitution and the clear
Injunctions of Islam, to ensure the effective and unfettered realisation of women’s right to inheritance,” the order read.
 
 

In its verdict, the SC bench dismissed an appeal filed by Abrar Hussain against a March 3, 2023, order of the Sindh High Court (SHC). The high court had rejected his plea challenging a 2021 order that had also refused his appeal against a 2019 trial court decision.
The case pertained to a property dispute between Hussain and his sister Bibi Shahida, who had filed a complaint in March 2015. Shahida said she repeatedly demanded her share after her father passed away in 2002, as well as her two other siblings later on, but Hussain refused to give it.
Hussain “took exclusive possession of the property; thereby depriving the other legal heirs of their lawful shares”, the SC judgment observed.
“The petitioner (Hussain) had no case on merits and yet persisted in litigation, thereby prolonging the deprivation of his siblings of their lawful inheritance, which devolved upon them on 1.1.2002, the date of their father’s demise,” Justice Minallah wrote.
“The challenge before this court was nothing more than an attempt
to delay and frustrate the rights of the other legal heirs, amounting to
a mere abuse of process,” he noted.
 
 

The state had a constitutional duty to ensure that “every woman is informed of, and enabled to claim her rightful share in inheritance without delay, fear or dependence on lengthy litigation”, the judgment read.
It added that the state must establish a “proactive and accessible mechanism through which women can be identified, reached out to,” and assisted in securing their lawful entitlements.
“Furthermore, those who, through coercion, deceit, or undue influence, deprive women of this divinely bestowed right must be held accountable under the law and made answerable,” Justice Minallah stressed.
The judgment also referred to the Federal Shariat Court’s (FSC) landmark ruling in March this year, wherein it declared that any custom — such as of ‘Chaddar’, ‘Parchi’ or ‘Haq Bakhshwai’ — that deprived women of inheritance right was “un-Islamic” and had no legal standing whatsoever.
The SC judgment observed that the right to inheritance was “not a concession granted by human law but a divinely ordained command, explicitly declared in the Holy Quran”. “Any denial or obstruction of this right is, therefore, not merely unlawful but a transgression against Divine Will,” it stated.
 
 

The ruling, echoing the FSC’s verdict, emphasised that “cultural or societal practices that deprive women of their rightful inheritance are rooted neither in faith nor in justice”.
It termed such customs “remnants of ignorance which the
message of Islam came to abolish”, and noted that the state bore a “sacred
constitutional duty to uproot such practices”.
“A society that turns a blind eye to deprivation of inheritance rights to its women defies the spirit of Constitution and express Command of Almighty Allah,” the ruling stated.
“A state that fails to safeguard the inheritance rights to its women fails in its duty to uphold the principles of equity, faith and justice.”
The SC in its short order had imposed a cost of Rs500,000 on Hussain, which was to deposed with the SC registrar within seven days. “It is directed that the
amount so deposited shall be distributed amongst the legal heirs
declared by the trial court,” the SC judgment reiterated.
The property dispute
In her 2015 complaint, Shahida alleged that Hussain “was in illegal possession of the property and had rented out a portion of it without the consent of the other legal heirs, while retaining the rent without distributing it according to their respective shares”, the judgment recalled.
It noted that the remaining siblings supported the assertion made by Shahida and consented to her suit.
On the other hand, Hussain contested the suit claiming that the “predecessor-in-interest had gifted the property to him during his lifetime out of love and affection and that possession had been handed over to him”.
In October 2019, a trial court decreed Shahida’s 2015 suit, declaring Shahid, Hussain and other siblings as the legal heirs. It ordered that the property be partitioned, or sold, and its proceeds be divided if the former was not possible, and also directed Hussain to pay mesne profit to other legal heirs from the rent received by him.
Hussain challenged that decision in an appellate court, but his petition was dismissed in January 2021. A second appeal was also dismissed by the SHC in an order dated March 3, 2023.</p><small>2025-11-16 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633866-islamabad-suicide-bomber-attempted-to-attack-faizabad-checkpoint' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad suicide bomber 'attempted to attack Faizabad checkpoint'</strong></a><br><p>
