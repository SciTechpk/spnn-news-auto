Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. He has issued a nationwide protest call, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases.
However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur appeared to disrupt the nationwide protest plans and sow confusion by introducing a new 90-day timeline for what he described as ‘a final push’. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik later voiced her reservations about his announcement.
The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters.
In a post today on his X account — which is not operated by Imran himself — a message said to be sent on his behalf stated: “Let me make this absolutely clear: every member of the party must immediately set aside all internal differences and focus solely on the movement planned for August 5th. I do not see any meaningful momentum building behind this initiative at present. I am waging a battle against a 78-year-old system, and my greatest success is that despite unprecedented oppression, the public stands firmly with me.”
The message said the people had expressed their trust in the PTI by voting for it in the general elections, even in the absence of an electoral symbol.
“After such a clear mandate, it is the moral and political responsibility of every party member to become the voice of the people. It will be nothing short of disgraceful and condemnable if PTI leaders waste time on internal conflicts at this critical juncture.
“Anyone found engaging in factionalism within the party will be expelled. I am fighting for the future of our generations and every sacrifice I make is for that cause. To create rifts within the party at this time would be a direct betrayal of my mission and vision,” the message warned.
 






Lashing out at the government, the message said it had “crippled the judiciary” through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
 
 

“The way biased judges are now delivering blatantly unjust verdicts under these courts is visible to the entire nation. We must launch a robust campaign to liberate the judiciary, for no nation can survive, let alone progress, without judicial independence.”
The message claimed “inhumane conditions” were being imposed upon Imran’s spouse and former first lady Bushra Bibi while the PTI founder’s conditions were themselves not good.
“I am enduring the harshest prison term in the country’s history solely for the supremacy of the Constitution and in service of my nation. The level of oppression and authoritarianism is such that even the water I have for ablution is filthy and contaminated with dirt, unfit for any human being.”
Separately, a post from PTI’s central deputy information secretary said the nationwide protest would be led under the banner of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP).
“All provincial organisations will follow their respective plans of action based on their circumstances.”
 






Addressing a press conference with other TTAP leaders, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said the first step of the protest movement would be an all-party conference in Islamabad on July 31 and the decisions taken then would shape the future plan of action.
Imran’s sons continue US engagements
Meanwhile, Imran’s sons continued their engagements in the United States, where they currently are before visiting Pakistan for their father.
They met Republican Congressman Joe Wilson of South Carolina who had introduced a bipartisan bill in the US House of Representatives in March, calling for sanctions on Pakistani state functionaries over alleged human rights violations, including the “persecution” of their father.
 






They also met US Congressman Brad Sherman.
“I am concerned to hear that Khan remains isolated from his family, friends, attorneys and doctors. His sons also shared that his physical health may be deteriorating. The people of Pakistan deserve to have their leaders be treated fairly under the law,” he said in a post on X about the meeting.

Blasphemy is an incendiary charge in Pakistan, where even unsubstantiated accusations can incite public outrage and lead to lynchings.
Last week, the IHC gave the federal government 30 days to constitute a commission to investigate misuse of blasphemy law, giving the order during the hearing of a case seeking such a commission’s formation. IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan ordered that the commission should complete its work within four months, while allowing the possibility for an extension.
Rao Abdur Rahim, a lawyer from the Legal Commission on Blasphemy Pakistan, and others had filed an intra-court appeal against Justice Khan’s verdict. The case was heard today by Justices Khadim Hussain Soomro and Azam Khan.
Advocate Kamran Murtaza and others appeared before the court on behalf of Rahim. Asked how they felt about the decision, Murtaza argued that they had not been given a full hearing.
“There are four hundred cases and some cases are beyond the jurisdiction of this court,” Murtaza said. “Can a commission be formed in this case?”
He added that the court was giving orders “as though it was above the Supreme Court”.
The bench subsequently suspended last week’s order and issued notices to the parties.
 
 

During last week’s hearing, Justice Ishaq expressed concern over the disappearance of a woman named Komal Ismail, the elusive central figure linked to an ongoing blasphemy-related case.
During the proceedings of this case, Ismail had been identified as ‘Iman’, a shadowy figure who was allegedly involved in ‘trapping’ a number of those accused of blasphemy.
Earlier this month, the judge had ordered her CNIC to be blocked over her failure to appear before the court.</p><small>2025-07-24 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24145233fe33da6.jpg?r=145411' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926261/deaths-from-gb-flash-floods-rise-to-6-as-search-for-missing-tourists-continues-official' target='_blank'><strong>Deaths from GB flash floods rise to 6 as search for missing tourists continues: official</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district rose to six on Thursday as a search for missing visitors was underway after heavy rains battered the region, an official said.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five on Tuesday, after four lost their lives and 15 went missing on Monday.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that rescue teams recovered another body in Babusar valley, taking the total number of deaths to six. “The search operation to locate the remaining tourists at Babusar is underway,” he added.
According to Rescue 1122, GB’s Ghanche district experienced floods in various areas. Flash floods in Kandos villages damaged a dozen homes, a dispensary, mosques, agricultural land and crops, it said.
Rescue 1122 also stated that flash floods in Sikarkoi damaged several houses and other infrastructure in Dass Mohallah and the surrounding areas in Gilgit.
Retired colonel’s body found in Rawalpindi
Separately, rescue teams on Thursday recovered the body of a retired colonel who went missing after his car was swept away by floodwaters and slipped into a drain in Rawalpindi last week, while a search for his daughter continues, rescue officials said.
Rescue efforts have been underway since Tuesday, when Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years, and his 25-year-old daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by rainwater.
District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah said, “The body of Ishaq had been found near the Soan River bridge, while rescue operations are underway to look for his daughter.”
Earlier today, Sibghatullah had said that rescue operations had entered a third day to search for the duo, while parts of their car had been found.
“Rescue 1122 found the bonnet and a door of the car under the Soan River bridge,” he said.
According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station on Tuesday, the duo were in a grey Honda vehicle and were residents of Defence Housing Authority’s Phase 5.
“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” the police statement had said.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Last week, Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in 24 hours.
Residents block GT Road protesting failure to recover teenager’s body
On the other hand, residents of a housing society blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body of a teenager who had drowned a day earlier.
On Wednesday afternoon, a 17-year-old boy drowned while crossing a nullah near the Metro City Housing Society. He was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.
Two of his relatives jumped in the water to rescue him, but they told Dawn.com that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.
Gujar Khan assistant superintendent of police and assistant commissioner also reached the spot and called the Rescue 1122 team, who were unable to retrieve the body as of the filing of this report. The residents of the area blocked the GT Road, citing the “inaction and incapacity of Rescue 1122 in recovering the victim’s body after many hours”.
40 people trapped in Attock canal rescued
Separately, Rescue 1122 said its personnel safely evacuated 40 people trapped in a canal at Shinka in Punjab’s Attock district.

“According to details, 40 people were trapped in a canal due to high water level in the Indus River at Shinka in Hazro Tehsil,” Rescue 1122 said in a statement.
“All people were safely evacuated in a rescue operation that lasted for five hours,” it added, noting that teams reached the spot under DEO Ali Hussain’s supervision.</p><small>2025-07-24 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/241915335dfbcc1.jpg?r=191607' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926272/islamabad-courts-sentence-13-pti-supporters-to-6-months-in-jail-over-nov-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad courts sentence 13 PTI supporters to 6 months in jail over Nov protests</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad district and sessions courts on Thursday sentenced 13 PTI supporters to six months in jail in cases pertaining to last year’s November “Final Call” protests, while acquitting one person.
Meanwhile, 12 of the convicts, along with one other person, were discharged by an Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) in a separate protest case from October 2024.
Ex-premier Imran Khan had called for nationwide protests on November 24, demanding the “restoration” of the PTI’s electoral mandate and the reversal of the 26th Amendment.
Following a state crackdown, the party claimed a dozen deaths of its supporters, which the government officially denied, while four Rangers personnel and a cop were martyred during the protests.
Judicial Magistrates Ahmad Shahzad Gondal and Mureed Abbas today heard three separate cases filed under the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order (Papo) Act, which had been passed just two months prior to the protests.
 
 

One first information report (FIR) was registered at Islamabad’s Tarnol police station on November 24, while two were filed at the Ramna station on November 26 (FIRs 976 and 977). All 12 convicts were ordered to be sent to Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, according to the court orders, which are available with Dawn.com.
Three people — Banaras Khan, Hazratullah Saeed and Irfanullah Shahwali — were sentenced to six months of “simple imprisonment” in FIR 976 case heard by Judge Gondal. The case was registered under Section 8 (conditions for assembly) of the Papo Act and Section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The convicts were already in custody, had pleaded not guilty to the charges and had not produced any witnesses in their defence, according to the order.
“The object of this protest was against the law and Constitution of Pakistan,” the judgement observed, noting PTI’s “deliberate choice of prohibited venues and its defiance of administrative directives”.
A similarly worded judgement was issued in the FIR 977 case, in which Banaras and five others — Waheedullah Zahid, Fazalur Rehman, Ibrahim Bakhtiar, Khurram Shahzad and Rafiullah Darwash — were handed six months of “simple imprisonment” under the Papo Act and PPC’s Section 188.
Hammad Aziz, who was on bail, was acquitted.
 
 

“This protest involve [sic] incitement, disruption of public life and unlawful conduct,” both court orders by Judge Gondal noted.
In the Tarnol police station case, Judge Abbas sentenced Muhammad Danish, Muhammad Essa, Ijaz Hussain, Muhammad Ishaq and Shahab Khan to six months in prison under Section 8 of the Papo Act.
Other offences they were convicted for and handed down six months of imprisonment were Sections 148 (rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from duty) of the PPC. The sentences were to run concurrently.
However, the judge ruled that the complainant police was not empowered to add Sections 186 (obstructing public servant) and 188 of the PPC, hence they were not convicted under those.
ATC discharges 13 men from Sangjani protest case
Separately, Islamabad ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Zulqarnain discharged 13 people from a case filed at the Sangjani police station over the Oct 5, 2024 protest for allegedly attacking the police.
A dozen of the individuals were those convicted in the November cases today while Asad Khan was the 13th person.
The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, noted: “Nothing incriminating could be collected against accused persons present before the court that could even remotely connect them with the instant occurrence.”
 
 

The suspects were presented before the court upon the completion of their four-day physical remand, the order noted, with Judge Zulqarnain dismissing the police’s request for further 15 days of custody.
During the hearing, the judge questioned the police’s lack of progress, saying: “I cannot comprehend what the police is doing? What is the Islamabad IG doing?”
Islamabad ATC suspends arrest warrant for Omar Ayub
Separately, an Islamabad ATC suspended a bailable arrest warrant for National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub in a case related to a protest in October last year.
PTI protesters and the Islamabad police clashed on Oct 4, 2024, as hundreds of party activists defied security measures and road blockades to gather at multiple locations days before the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. Over 100 PTI supporters, along with ex-premier Imran Khan’s two sisters, were taken into custody.’
ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra had issued the arrest warrant earlier today as he heard a case filed at the Shahzad Town police station last year.
Advocates Sardar Masroof Khan, Zahid Bashir Dar, Murtaza Toori and Mirza Asim were among the lawyers present on the PTI leaders’ behalf.
During the hearing, Judge Sipra issued a bailable arrest warrant for Ayub and ordered that any previous bail granted to suspects who were absent today be cancelled.
 
 

However, the judge accepted Senator Azam Swati’s plea seeking exemption from attendance, which was filed yesterday, according to Masroof. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till July 30.
Later in the day, former law minister Babar Awan appeared as Ayub’s counsel and submitted an application seeking exemption from attendance, along with a medical report.
Awan contended that his client had not received a notice of summons from the court.
The application, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said the PTI lawmaker was unable to appear in court due to “ill health” and was advised bed rest.
“The non-appearance of the applicant is neither deliberate nor intentional,” the application stated.
Subsequently, Judge Sipra suspended Ayub’s arrest warrant.
In a video statement yesterday, Advocate Masroof lamented the “speed with which these cases are being heard”.
He noted that some suspects had come from faraway areas such as Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan, having no place to stay overnight in Islamabad to attend today’s hearing.
“If these trials will be bulldozed in such a manner and you won’t give them a fair trial, then it will become very difficult for you to fulfil the requirements of justice,” the lawyer said, requesting courts to punish those guilty but not convict those who were not involved.
Today’s development comes within days of two ATCs sentencing PTI bigwigs to as many as 10 years in jail in cases related to the violent May 9, 2023 countrywide riots.
A Lahore ATC handed down at least eight leaders 10-year rigorous imprisonment, while acquitting six others. A Sargodha ATC also convicted as many as 32 accused, including MNA Ahmad Chattha and Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.
In May, the Islamabad police’s prosecution nominated the PTI’s top leadership — including Ayub, Chairman Gohar Khan, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Barris­ter Muhammad Ali Saif — in another case over the October 4 protests filed at the Koral police station.
 
 

Earlier this month, a Lahore ATC also declared PTI’s Hammad Azhar and Rana Shahbaz Ahmed as proclaimed offenders in two cases related to an alleged attack on Punjab police during a simultaneous protest as party workers reached Minar-i-Pakistan despite the government’s security measures.
Other cases over the clashes had also been registered at the Noon and Ramna police stations in the federal capital.</p><small>2025-07-24 16:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2412581446b8648.jpg?r=130024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926266/plane-crash-in-russias-far-east-kills-nearly-50-people' target='_blank'><strong>Plane crash in Russia’s far east kills nearly 50 people</strong></a><br><p>A passenger plane carrying nearly 50 people crashed in a remote area of Russia’s far eastern Amur region on Thursday, killing all on board, authorities said.
The plane, a Soviet-made twin-propeller Antonov-24, went down in remote, thickly forested terrain, leaving a column of smoke pouring from the crash site and no signs of survivors, according to state media and videos published by investigators.
The Angara Airlines flight was headed to the town of Tynda from the city of Blagoveshchensk when it disappeared from radar at around 1pm local time (0400 GMT).
A rescue helicopter later spotted the burning fuselage of the plane on a forested mountain slope about 15 kilometres south of Tynda’s airport.
 






Videos published by Russian investigators showed smoke rising from the crash site and what appeared to be fragments of the plane strewn across the forest floor.
A search and rescue team arrived only hours after the crash at the remote, hard-to-reach site and found no evidence of survivors, according to the state news agency TASS.
Investigators did not say what caused the crash.
Weather conditions at the time of the incident were poor, Angara Airlines CEO Sergei Salamanov told Russia’s REN TV channel.
“The commander made the decision to carry out the flight,” he was quoted as saying.
Tynda, home to around 30,000 people, lies in an area of thick taiga forest about 200km from the Chinese border.
At least one Chinese national was on the flight, state media in China reported.
Chinese President Xi Jinping sent a message of condolence to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
“I would like to express my deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the families of the victims,” Xi said, according to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV.
The plane dropped from radar while attempting a second approach to land at Tynda, regional prosecutors said.
The forest terrain complicated search efforts, a rescuer told the TASS agency.
“The main search operations are being conducted from the air,” it said.
Angara Airlines, a small regional carrier based in the Russian city of Irkutsk, did not immediately release a statement on the crash.
Five children
Russia’s aviation watchdog has not yet given a definitive number of people on board.
The Amur region’s governor, Vasily Orlov, said the plane was carrying 43 passengers and six crew members.
Among the passengers were five children, he said.
The TASS agency cited emergency services as saying the plane was carrying 40 passengers and six crew.
Aviation authorities have opened an investigation.
The plane appeared to have been manufactured almost 50 years ago, during the Soviet era, according to civil aviation database Russianplanes.net.
In 2021, the aircraft’s airworthiness certificate was extended until 2036, data from the site showed.
AFP was not able to immediately verify this information.
The Antonov-24 is a popular, Soviet-designed turboprop plane that first entered into service in 1959.
Russia has taken steps to switch from Soviet aircraft to modern jets in recent years, but ageing light aircraft are still widely used in far-flung regions, with accidents frequent.
The incident comes just days after a Bangladesh air force training jet crashed into a college and school campus in the capital, Dhaka, on Monday, killing 31 and injuring more than 170 people.</p><small>2025-07-24 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2413561135d4e2b.png?r=135959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926262/at-least-11-civilians-killed-as-thailand-f-16-jet-bombs-cambodian-targets-after-border-clash-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>At least 11 civilians killed as Thailand F-16 jet bombs Cambodian targets after border clash escalates</strong></a><br><p>Thailand scrambled an F-16 fighter jet to bomb targets in Cambodia on Thursday after artillery volleys from both sides killed at least 11 civilians, as border tension boiled over into rare armed conflict between the Southeast Asian countries.
Both blamed each other for starting a morning clash at a disputed area of the border, which quickly escalated from small arms fire to heavy shelling in at least six locations 209 kilometres apart along a frontier where sovereignty has been disputed for more than a century.
Thailand positioned six F-16 fighter jets in an uncommon combat deployment, one of which was mobilised to strike a Cambodian military target, among measures Cambodia’s foreign ministry called “reckless and brutal military aggression”.
Thailand’s military said the use of air power was to strike with precision.
The worst fighting between the countries in 13 years came after Thailand on Wednesday recalled its ambassador to Phnom Penh and expelled Cambodia’s envoy, in response to a second Thai soldier losing a limb to a landmine that Bangkok alleged had been laid recently by rival troops.
The two countries have been braced for conflict since the killing of a Cambodian soldier late in May during a brief skirmish, with troops reinforced on both sides of the border amid a full-blown diplomatic crisis that brought Thailand’s fragile coalition government to the brink of collapse.
Thailand said there were 12 fatalities in three Thai provinces, 11 of them civilians, including an eight-year-old boy. Authorities said 31 people were injured on Thursday. The number of Cambodian casualties was unclear.
“We condemn this — using heavy weapons without a clear target, outside of conflict zones … the use of force and did not adhere to international law,” Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai told reporters.
“We remain committed to peaceful means and there should be discussions, but what happened was a provocation and we had to defend ourselves.”
‘Premeditated military aggression’
Thailand’s Health Minister Somsak Thepsuthin told reporters a hospital was hit by shelling in Surin province, an attack he said should be considered “a war crime”.
Cambodian government, defence and foreign ministry officials at a press conference gave no indication of fatalities sustained or any estimate of the number of people evacuated.
In a letter to Pakistan, the current president of the United Nations Security Council, Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet urged the body to convene a meeting to stop what he called “unprovoked and premeditated military aggression” by Thailand in violation of international law.
As clashes spread to different border areas, Thai villagers, including children and the elderly, fled to concrete shelters fortified with sandbags and car tires.
“How many rounds have been fired? It’s countless,” an unidentified woman in Surin province told the Thai Public Broadcasting Service while hiding in the shelter as gunfire and explosions were heard in the background.

Video footage showed a plume of thick black smoke rising from a gas station in the neighbouring Sisaket province, as firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze.
 


Thailand has evacuated more than 40,000 people from border areas, moving many to temporary shelters, where elderly people and small children gathered on floor mats as authorities prepared meals and unloaded food and bottled water from trucks.
“I’m worried about my children,” said Suphap Wongwai, an evacuee in Surin province. “My children are scared and crying.”
Decades of disputes
Thailand and Cambodia have bickered for decades over jurisdiction of various undemarcated points along their 817km land border, with ownership of the ancient Hindu temples Ta Moan Thom and the 11th century Preah Vihear central to the disputes.
Preah Vihear was awarded to Cambodia by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1962 but tension escalated in 2008 after Cambodia attempted to list it as a Unesco World Heritage site.
That led to skirmishes over several years and at least a dozen deaths.
Cambodia in June said it had asked the ICJ to resolve its disputes with Thailand, which says it has never recognised the court’s jurisdiction and prefers a bilateral approach.
Thailand’s use of a fighter jet underlines its military advantage over Cambodia in terms of size and range of defence hardware.
The clashes have caused jitters in the region, with the Philippines and Vietnam calling for restraint and China expressing willingness to play a role in promoting de-escalation.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, of which Thailand and Cambodia are members, said he would speak to leaders of both countries.
“The least we can expect from them is to just stand down and hopefully to try and enter into negotiations,” Anwar said.
The clashes erupted hours after a downgrade in diplomatic relations between the two countries following a series of landmine injuries to Thai soldiers patrolling border areas.
Thailand accused Cambodia of placing the mines recently, which Phnom Penh dismissed as baseless.
De-mining groups estimate as many as 4-6 million landmines remain in Cambodia following years of civil war.
Landmines
The clashes began early on Thursday near the disputed Ta Moan Thom temple along the eastern border between Cambodia and Thailand, around 360km from the Thai capital Bangkok.
“Artillery shell fell on people’s homes,” Sutthirot Charoenthanasak, district chief of Kabcheing in Surin province, told Reuters, describing the firing by the Cambodian side.
“Two people have died,” he said, adding that district authorities had evacuated 40,000 civilians from 86 villages near the border to safer locations.
Thailand’s military said Cambodia deployed a surveillance drone before sending troops with heavy weapons to an area near the temple.
Cambodian troops opened fire and two Thai soldiers were wounded, a Thai army spokesperson said, adding that Cambodia had used multiple weapons, including rocket launchers.
A spokesperson for Cambodia’s defence ministry, however, said there had been an unprovoked incursion by Thai troops and Cambodian forces had responded in self-defence.
Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai said the situation was delicate. “We have to be careful,” he told reporters. “We will follow international law.”
An attempt by Thai premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra to resolve the recent tensions via a call with Cambodia’s influential former prime minister Hun Sen, the contents of which were leaked, kicked off a political storm in Thailand, leading to her suspension by a court.
Hun Sen said in a Facebook post that two Cambodian provinces had come under shelling from the Thai military.</p><small>2025-07-24 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/241842113bed5e1.jpg?r=184223' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926314/pakistan-to-play-three-test-matches-against-england-next-year' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to play three Test matches against England next year</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Thursday that the national team will face England in a three-match Test series next year during the World Test Championship.
In a press release, the PCB said that the test matches will be played in August and September 2026.
“The first Test will begin at Headingley in Leeds on August 19, while the action will move to the Lord’s Cricket Ground in London for the second Test of the series from August 27. The two teams will lock horns in the third and final Test from September 9 at Edgbaston in Birmingham,” the statement read.
“This will be Pakistan’s fourth Test tour of England since 2016 and overall 29th bilateral Test series between both teams since they first faced each other in 1954,” it said.
The PCB also said that the team was currently touring England for a three-match 50-over and two-match three-day series.
 






On Sunday, the International Cricket Council announced that England would host the next three World Test Championship finals.
“We are absolutely delighted that England and Wales has been chosen to host the next three ICC World Test Championship finals,” said England and Wales Cricket Board CEO Richard Gould.

In April, India held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting that the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension.
In a meeting with the WB’s regional vice president for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan (MENAAP), Ousmane Dione, in Islamabad, the premier acknowledged the institution’s principled support for Pakistan’s legitimate position on India’s “unilateral and unlawful actions”, which undermined “important international agreements” such as the IWT.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to upholding international law, achieving prosperity, maintaining regional peace and reiterated the country’s resolve to resolve all issues through dialogue.
 






The prime minister further thanked the WB for its timely and generous assistance during the devastating floods of 2022, which helped Pakistan initiate immediate relief efforts and begin reconstruction and rehabilitation activities.
He especially thanked World Bank President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their pivotal role in advancing the new country partnership framework (CPF) for Pakistan.
In January, Pakistan became the first country to launch a longer-term CPF with the WB, after the bank’s board of directors approved the 10-year programme and pledged to provide $20 billion to Pakistan.
 
 

According to a World Bank statement, the new framework for the country aimed to “support inclusive and sustainable development through a strong focus on building human capital”, in addition to fostering durable private sector growth.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the strategic role of the CPF in supporting Pakistan’s development priorities, particularly in the areas of energy, human capital, climate change, and governance reforms.
Dione expressed gratitude to the premier for the warm hospitality extended during his visit to Pakistan.
 






He reaffirmed the WB’s commitment to deepening and expanding its longstanding partnership with Pakistan and enhancing collaboration in key sectors of the economy.
Dione appreciated Pakistan’s ongoing macroeconomic recovery and praised the prime minister’s government for steering the country toward financial stability and sustainable growth.
He particularly commended the current administration’s reform agenda, noting the premier’s strong leadership in advancing institutional reforms, restoring investor confidence, and promoting inclusive economic development.
PM Shehbaz and Dione expressed a shared commitment to further strengthening cooperation in the coming years, to achieve long-term development goals and build a prosperous future for the people of Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-24 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615602-army-officer-among-two-martyred-in-mastung-anti-terror-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Army officer among two martyred in Mastung anti-terror operation</strong></a><br><p>

“The stable outlook reflects our expectations that continued economic recovery and government efforts to enhance revenue will stabilise fiscal and debt metrics,” S&P said in a statement on the move.
“We also expect that sustained official financing will support Pakistan in meeting its external obligations, and that the country will continue to roll over its commercial credit lines over the next 12 months.”
Pakistan’s longer-dated international bonds rallied after the upgrade, with the 2051 maturity gaining 1.6 cents to be bid at 84.85 cents on the dollar, according to Tradeweb data.
The 2031 and 2036 maturities also gained around 1 cent, while shorter-dated maturities posted smaller gains.
Last week, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb urged the leading US rating agency — Moody’s — to improve Pakistan’s credit rating and help its return to international capital markets at favourable conditions.
Moody’s had upgraded Paki­stan’s credit rating by one notch in August 2024 to Caa2 from Caa3 (downgraded in February 2023 due to suspension of the IMF programme) and changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions, including liquidity and external position from very weak levels.
Global ratings agency Fitch had upgraded Pakistan’s foreign currency credit rating to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’ in April, citing increased confidence in the country’s progress on narrowing its budget deficits.</p><small>2025-07-24 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/241631494f88865.jpg?r=163715' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926312/australian-women-win-right-to-sue-qatar-airways-over-forced-strip-searches' target='_blank'><strong>Australian women win right to sue Qatar Airways over forced strip searches</strong></a><br><p>Five Australian women who say they were pulled from a Qatar Airways flight by armed guards and strip-searched have won the right to sue the airline, after a court on Thursday overturned an earlier decision to throw out the case.
Women on 10 Qatar Airways flights, including 13 Australians, were subjected to invasive examinations to see if they had recently given birth after a newborn baby was found abandoned at Doha’s Hamad Airport in October 2020.
The incident made headlines around the world, sparked outrage in Australia and strained diplomatic ties with Qatar.
A group of five women on a Sydney-bound flight launched legal proceedings in 2022 against Qatar Airways, the operator of Doha Airport Matar, and Qatar’s Civil Aviation Authority.
They brought claims under the Montreal Convention, which covers airline liability, as well as negligence, assault and false imprisonment.
The women sought damages for the impact on their mental health, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, stemming from the “unlawful physical contact”.
After being escorted off their flight by armed Qatari authorities, some women claimed they were made to take off their underwear and subjected to non-consensual gynaecological inspections by a nurse in ambulances on the tarmac.
Federal Court Justice John Halley dismissed the claims against Qatar Airways last year, finding they had no reasonable prospect of success, and that Qatar’s Civil Aviation Authority amounted to a foreign state immune from Australian law.
On Thursday, the full federal court overturned the ruling on Qatar Airways saying the issue was too complex to be dismissed summarily.
“Whether or not the claims come within the scope of [the Montreal Convention] is a matter of some complexity,” the summary judgment said.
“It is therefore not an issue apt to be decided at the stage of summary dismissal.”
The judgement allows the women to continue their lawsuit against Qatar Airways and Matar. Both companies were ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.
“Our clients endured a traumatic experience on that night in Doha, and they deserve to have their day in court and compensation for their suffering,” said Damian Sturzaker, the lawyer from Marque Lawyers representing the women.</p><small>2025-07-24 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615599-ihc-halts-implementation-of-order-to-form-blasphemy-law-commission' target='_blank'><strong>IHC halts implementation of order to form blasphemy commission</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting, hosted by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), comes ahead of the Asia Cup tournament, scheduled to be hosted by India in September.  The tournament remains in limbo amid strained India-Pakistan ties following a military encounter in May.
On Wednesday, Hindustan Times reported that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), reversing an earlier decision, would attend the Asian Cricket Council’s annual meeting virtually. The BCCI had previously declined to travel to Dhaka, citing tensions with Bangladesh and threatening to boycott the meeting.
The AGM was held in Dhaka today with 24 other members in attendance.
 






Addressing the media after the meeting, Naqvi said: “The meeting went very well. We have 25 ACC members and all of them participated in this meeting”
He thanked all members who attended the meeting in person and those who attended it virtually. “We have all decided to work for cricket. None of us wants politics inside any of our organisations and it was a very good meeting in a very good atmosphere,” he added, expressing hope that such meetings would continue in the future as well.
Regarding the upcoming Asia Cup’s schedule and its fate, he said: “That will be announced soon. We are in consultation with the BCCI and we will resolve [that matter] very soon.”
Questioned about India’s lack of participation in person, Naqvi downplayed the matter, saying: “Several countries were not able to come to Dhaka. It happens every time whenever you have meetings. I was not able to go to Singapore because I was stuck so this is a normal thing.”
He said that all members participated in the meeting. He reiterated that he was hopeful of the ACC and BCCI resolving their pending issues “and we will have the Asia Cup also”.
A press release issued by the ACC said the meeting was with “100 per cent” attendance.
It said the meeting approved the comprehensive tournament calendar for 2025–2026, in line with the ACC’s sustained commitment to delivering structured development and high-quality cricketing opportunities across its member countries.
It also announced the inclusion of cricket in the upcoming Asian Games 2026 to be held in
Japan, which would see the participation of 10 men’s and eight)women’s teams from across the
continent, to be chosen based on their rankings.
The organisation also welcomed three new nations, Mongolia, Uzbekistan and the
Philippines, as members, “extending the reach of the sport into new and emerging cricket
regions”.
The council and members also reaffirmed their support for the development and promotion of Asian
cricket “whilst always putting cricket first”.
The meeting was adjourned with members “reiterating their joint commitment to a forward-looking vision; one that nurtures excellence, inclusion and broadens the game’s reach across the continent”.
 






Naqvi calls on Asian nations to ‘put aside political differences’ for sake of cricket
Addressing a reception hosted by the BCB earlier, Naqvi said in an apparent reference to the ongoing situation: “It’s not just that you’re here; it’s about a team, as we discussed, that we need to work as a team. We need to put aside all our political differences and work just for cricket.”
The PCB chairman added: “It is a family of cricketing nations, where we all need to support and strengthen each other. The most important thing is, whoever wins means we all will win; so, let’s get together and discuss how we can strengthen the ACC and how we can help our associate members.”
 






He stressed that he wanted all member teams to have stronger players to put up a stronger competition, paving the way for a stronger market for cricketing events in Asia.
“As the president of ACC, I can assure you that we will do whatever is required to make this body the strongest body for Asian games,” he said, adding that it was important to expand cricket in other countries.
Whether Pakistan visit India for the Asia Cup or a hybrid model will be followed — similar to the one adopted for the International Cricket Council events — is yet to be decided.
However, considering that the BCCI and the PCB are not keen on playing on each other’s venues, particularly after the 2024 hybrid model, the UAE has emerged as a frontrunner to host the latest edition of the Asia Cup.
Last night, the BCB also hosted a dinner for ACC delegations and the Pakistani team. The PCB chairman thanked the associate members of the council and BCB President Aminul Islam for his hospitality during his speech at the meeting.
“He worked day and night to make this happen,” Naqvi said. “I am really looking forward to receiving him in Pakistan.”
 






 






Pakistan, Bangladesh team up to boost cricket, umpiring and youth development
Naqvi also met Bangladesh’s Minister for Youth and Sports, Local Government and Rural Development Asif Mahmood for a friendly and forward-looking discussion.
 






The two leaders talked about working together to promote cricket, train umpires and create more opportunities for young people in both countries.
The talks resulted in a broad agreement to strengthen bilateral cooperation in sports, particularly cricket, and the development of umpiring and youth engagement programmes.
The two sides agreed to sign a formal memorandum of understanding between the PCB and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to promote cricket and institutionalise training programmes.
Naqvi invited Bangladeshi umpires to Pakistan for professional training, underscoring Pakistan’s willingness to share technical expertise and resources for regional sporting development.
Special focus was placed on enhancing women’s cricket, with both ministers agreeing to develop joint initiatives aimed at nurturing female athletes across both countries.
In addition to sports, the agenda extended to youth skill-building, employment generation and educational cooperation. Discussions included scholarship opportunities, higher education exchange programmes, and experience-sharing in educational reforms.
The ministers also explored collaboration in renewable energy, particularly solar energy innovation, marking a growing interest in sustainable technology exchanges.
Naqvi also introduced Pakistan’s secure identity infrastructure, highlighting the success and technological advancement of the National Database and Registration Authority.
Mahmood expressed a strong interest in Pakistan’s identity management systems and welcomed an invitation for a Bangladeshi delegation to visit Nadra. A high-level Bangladeshi delegation is expected to visit Pakistan in the near future to pursue this collaboration further.
Emphasising the demographic parallels between the two nations, Naqvi stated that youth made up the majority of both populations. “By investing in sports, skills, and education, we can create lasting opportunities for our young people,” he said.
The meeting signalled a shared commitment to deepening multifaceted ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, particularly in sports diplomacy and youth development.</p><small>2025-07-24 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615584-womans-mother-remanded-after-honour-killing-confession-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Woman's mother remanded after 'honour killing' confession in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

The two countries concluded talks on the trade pact in May after three years of stop-start negotiations, with both sides hastening efforts to clinch a deal in the shadow of tariff turmoil unleashed by United States President Donald Trump.
The agreement between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies aims to increase bilateral trade by a further 25.5 billion pounds ($34bn) by 2040.
It is Britain’s biggest trade deal since it left the European Union in 2020, although its impact will be a fraction of the effect of leaving the orbit of its closest trading partner.
For India, it represents its biggest strategic partnership with an advanced economy, and one which could provide a template for a long-mooted deal with the EU as well as talks with other regions.
It will take effect after a ratification process, likely within a year.
 






British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would bring “huge benefits” for both countries, making trade cheaper, quicker and easier.
“We’ve entered a new global era, and that is one that requires us to step up, not to stand aside … by building deeper partnerships and alliances,” Starmer said.
Modi said the visit would “go a long way in advancing the economic partnership between our nations”.
They also agreed a partnership covering areas such as defence and climate, and said they would strengthen co-operation on tackling crime.
Whisky, cars
Under the trade agreement, tariffs on Scotch whisky will drop to 75 per cent from 150pc immediately, and then slide to 40pc over the next decade, according to the British government. On cars, India will cut duties to 10pc from over 100pc under a quota system that will be gradually liberalised.
In return, Indian manufacturers will gain access to the UK market for electric and hybrid vehicles, also under a quota system.
The ministry has said 99pc of Indian exports to Britain would benefit from zero duties under the deal, including textiles, while Britain will see reductions on 90pc of its tariff lines, with the average tariff UK firms face dropping to 3pc from 15pc.
While it is Britain’s biggest deal since Brexit, the projected boost to British economic output, of 4.8bn pounds a year by 2040, is small compared to the country’s gross domestic product of 2.6 trillion pounds in 2024.
The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that UK exports and imports will be about 15pc lower in the long run compared with if Britain had stayed in the EU.
In its first year in power, Britain’s Labour government has launched a reset of ties with the EU in order to smooth trade friction, while also clinching some tariff relief from the US and the India trade deal.
“In an era of rising protectionism, today’s announcement sends a powerful signal that the UK is open for business,” said Rain Newton-Smith, the chief executive of the Confederation of British Industry.
 
 

The India deal will also facilitate easier access for temporary business visitors, though visas are not covered. Britain and India also agreed to ensure workers no longer have to make social security contributions in both India and Britain during temporary postings in the other country.
Under the trade deal, British firms will be able to access India’s procurement market for projects in sectors such as clean energy, and it also covers services sectors such as insurance.
India didn’t succeed in its efforts to get an exemption from Britain’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) — which could levy higher taxes on polluters from 2027 — as part of the deal. Meanwhile, talks over a separate bilateral investment treaty are continuing.</p><small>2025-07-24 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24165513279cfe2.jpg?r=165618' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926296/pakistan-signs-maritime-mou-with-chinese-shipping-giant-to-boost-collaboration' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs maritime MoU with Chinese shipping giant to boost collaboration</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Chinese shipping giant, Shandong Xinxu Group, on Thursday in a move that is set to bring about a “major transformation” in the shipping sector.
PNSC, headquartered in Karachi, is Pakistan’s premier national flag carrier, operating under the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.  The Shandong Xinxu Group Corporation, based in Zibo City, Shandong Province, is a leading Chinese enterprise engaged in international trade and shipping.
A statement from the Press Information Department said the MoU signing ceremony took place between the PNSC CEO and the chairman of Shandong Xinxu Group Corporation in Islamabad with Maritime Affairs Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry present.
 






“The Pakistani shipping sector is set for a major transformation following the signing of a MoU,” he was quoted as saying by the statement.
Addressing the signing ceremony, he said the development symbolised a “growing partnership” between Pakistan and China in the maritime domain that would pave the way for “future cooperation, investment, and development” in Pakistan’s shipping industry.
He emphasised that the collaboration would boost regional trade, enhance connectivity and strengthen Pakistan’s role in the global maritime industry through cooperation and shared economic goals.
“This MoU establishes a framework of mutual trust and cooperation between the two entities, aimed at pursuing commercial benefits and creating favourable conditions for investment in Pakistan’s maritime sector,” the statement quoted him as saying.
“The understanding primarily focuses on collaborative efforts in several key areas. These include the sale and purchase of merchant cargo vessels such as liquid bulk tankers, dry bulk carriers, and containerised ships under joint or individual ownership, as well as through profit and loss sharing arrangements.”
The MoU also encompassed the leasing of such vessels by Xinxu to PNSC through various charter mechanisms, including time, spot and bare boat charters.
Another major component of the MoU involved the PNSC offering commercial, technical, and administrative management services for vessels as mutually agreed, covering areas such as chartering, marketing, revenue optimisation, maintenance, dry-docking, crewing and regulatory compliance.
“The MoU includes provisions for financing arrangements by Xinxu to PNSC for investments in ships and other floating platforms. These arrangements will be governed by commercially competitive terms, ensuring mutual benefit and financial viability,” the statement said.
In June, PNSC aimed to generate an estimated $700 million in freight earnings by expanding its cargo fleet to 34 vessels over the next three years as part of a broad strategy to revitalise the country’s maritime and logistics sectors.</p><small>2025-07-24 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615571-ttap-led-opposition-decides-to-hold-apc-on-july-31-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP-led opposition decides to hold APC on July 31 in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>

The Olympic champion was set to travel to England this month to prepare for the World Championships, ahead of the Diamond League meet in Silesia, Poland on August 16 and Zurich, Switzerland on Aug 27-28.
Last week, however, he underwent surgery on his calf muscle to address a recurring injury. The interventional procedure was done by Dr Ali Bajwa at Spire Hospital in Cambridge, United Kingdom.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“We are now doing rehab work with a physiotherapist in London,” Arshad Nadeem’s coach, Salman Butt, told Dawn.com.
“This is a two-week plan before we test ourselves for going back to regular workouts,” Butt added.
“We are trying to achieve good form for the World Championship in Tokyo and maybe compete in one competition before Tokyo if Arshad regains good form by then.”
It was after his fifth-place finish at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics that Butt began coaching Arshad. A gold medal at the World Championships will complete his trifecta after he won gold at last year’s Paris Olympics and the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.
He won a silver medal at the previous edition of the World Championships in Budapest in 2023, behind Indian rival Neeraj Chopra.
In an earlier conversation with Dawn.com, Butt had noted that the rehabilitation process would take about two weeks. Ahead of the surgery, he said that Arshad was pain-free and his team had adopted a quick remedy.
“We contacted our doctor at Cambridge, got an appointment within three days, and had an MRI done,” Butt had said, adding that he was grateful for the expedited process. At the time, it was unclear whether Arshad would recover in time for the Diamond League championships in Poland and Switzerland.
Arshad made this year’s international debut in style when he won gold with an 86.40m throw at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea, in May. A month later, he was named in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Asia List for what they called a “stunning show” at the Olympics.
Despite his mammoth successes, Arshad has maintained a relatively low profile at international meets compared to competitors like Julian Weber and Neeraj Chopra, particularly owing to injury.
Last June, he pulled out of the Paavo Nurmi Games in Finland due to a mild calf muscle injury, but returned to competition in July at the Paris Diamond League ahead of the Olympics.
The Asian Athletics Championship in May is his first and only competition of the year so far. He has not competed at a Diamond League yet, putting him out of the league’s standings topped by Weber and Chopra with 15 points each.</p><small>2025-07-24 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615549-bailable-arrest-warrant-issued-for-opposition-leader-omar-ayub-in-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>ATC cancels arrest warrant for opposition leader Omar Ayub in protest case</strong></a><br><p>

In the post, citing “expanded analysis and threat intelligence”, Microsoft said a group it dubs “Storm-2603” is using the vulnerability to seed the ransomware, which typically works by paralysing victims’ networks until a digital currency payment is made.
The disclosure marks a potential escalation in the campaign, which has already hit at least 400 victims, according to Netherlands-based cybersecurity firm Eye Security.
Unlike typical state-backed hacker campaigns, which are aimed at stealing data, ransomware can cause widespread disruption depending on where it lands.
The figure of 400 victims represents a sharp rise from the 100 organisations catalogued over the weekend. Eye Security says the figure is likely an undercount.
“There are many more, because not all attack vectors have left artefacts that we could scan for,” said Vaisha Bernard, the chief hacker for Eye Security, which was among the first organisations to flag the breaches.
The details of most of the victim organisations have not yet been fully disclosed, but on Wednesday, a representative for the National Institutes of Health confirmed that one of the organisation’s servers had been compromised.
“Additional servers were isolated as a precaution,” he said. The news of the compromise was first reported by the Washington Post.
Other outlets said the hacking campaign had breached an even broader range of US agencies. NextGov, citing multiple people familiar with the matter, reported the Department of Homeland Security had been hit, along with more than five to 12 other agencies.
Politico, which cited two US officials, said multiple agencies were believed to have been breached.
DHS’ cyberdefense arm, CISA, did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the reports. Microsoft did not immediately return a message seeking further details on the ransomware angle of the hacking or the reported government victims.
The spy campaign began after Microsoft failed to fully patch a security hole in its SharePoint server software, kicking off a scramble to fix the vulnerability when it was discovered.
Microsoft and its tech rival, Google-owner Alphabet, have both said Chinese hackers are among those taking advantage of the flaw. Beijing has denied the claim.</p><small>2025-07-24 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/24122245c9c2584.jpg?r=134444' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926263/india-expulsions-to-bangladesh-unlawful-target-muslims-hrw' target='_blank'><strong>India expulsions to Bangladesh unlawful, target Muslims: HRW</strong></a><br><p>India has pushed hundreds of ethnic Bengali-speaking Muslims into Bangladesh without due process, Human Rights Watch said on Thursday, accusing the government of flouting rules and fuelling bias on religious lines.
The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long taken a hardline stance on immigration — particularly from Muslim-majority Bangladesh — with top authorities referring to them as “termites” and “infiltrators”.
Critics also accuse the government of sparking fear among India’s estimated 200 million Muslims, especially among speakers of Bengali, which is widely spoken in both eastern India and Bangladesh.
HRW, a New York-based nonprofit, said that India forcibly expelled more than 1,500 Muslim men, women, and children to Bangladesh between May 7 and June 15, quoting Bangladeshi authorities.
“India’s ruling BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is fuelling discrimination by arbitrarily expelling Bengali Muslims from the country, including Indian citizens,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at the nonprofit, said.
“The Indian government is putting thousands of vulnerable people at risk in apparent pursuit of unauthorised immigrants, but their actions reflect broader discriminatory policies against Muslims.”
New Delhi insists that the people deported are undocumented migrants.
 
 

However, claims by authorities that the expulsions were to manage illegal immigration were “unconvincing”, Pearson added, because of “their disregard for due process rights, domestic guarantees, and international human rights standards”.
‘They were holding guns’
HRW said that it had sent the report’s findings and questions to the country’s home ministry but had received no response.
The report documented the experiences of 18 people.
A 51-year-old daily wage worker told HRW that he “walked into Bangladesh like a dead body” after India’s Border Security Force (BSF) took him to the border after midnight.
“I thought they (the BSF) would kill me because they were holding guns and no one from my family would know,” the report quotes the worker as saying.
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy since a mass uprising in 2024 toppled Dhaka’s government, an ally of India.
India also ramped up operations against migrants in the wake of the attack in India-occupied Kashmir in April that killed 26 people, mainly Hindu tourists.
New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of supporting the attack, an allegation denied by Islamabad.
In an unprecedented countrywide security drive, Indian authorities detained thousands, with many of them being eventually pushed across the border to Bangladesh.
“The government is undercutting India’s long history of providing refuge to the persecuted as it tries to generate political support,” Pearson said.
India has also been accused of forcibly deporting Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with navy ships dropping them off the coast of the war-torn nation.</p><small>2025-07-24 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615537-rs116bn-privilege-travel-vouchers-issued-to-mnas' target='_blank'><strong>Rs1.16bn privilege travel vouchers issued to MNAs</strong></a><br><p>

The ACC meeting taking place in Dhaka will decide the fate of this year’s Asia Cup, which India is scheduled to host in September.
Sources within the BCCI have confirmed that the board has indeed decided to attend Thursday’s meeting virtually.
“Yes, we have decided to attend the meeting virtually,” a BCCI source told the Hindustan Times on the condition of anonymity.
Earlier, amid rising political tension between India and Bangladesh, the BCCI decided not to visit Dhaka and threatened to boycott the all-important AGM of the game’s Asian body.
The meeting on Thursday is set to determine the status of the Asia Cup, which is supposed to be played in T20 format. If the tournament gets the go-ahead, it will most likely be played in the UAE, with India maintaining its hosting rights.
Considering the fact that the BCCI and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) — amid strained political relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours that reached new heights after their military clash in May — are not keen on playing on each other’s venues particularly after the 2024 hybrid model reached between the two countries for participation in ICC events, the UAE has emerged as a frontrunner to host the latest edition of the Asia Cup.
Earlier, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) had sided with the BCCI, saying they wouldn’t visit Dhaka for the AGM. Considering the BCCI’s changing stance, the two cricket boards are now also expected to attend the meeting virtually.
The ACC chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), will host the meeting in Dhaka.
Mohsin arrived in Dhaka on Wednesday afternoon, and was greeted by Mohammad Aminul Islam, the chief of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).

Earlier, in compliance with the court’s order, the police chief appeared before LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum in connection with a woman’s petition against the killing of her son in an alleged CCD encounter.
A report submitted by the IGP stated that the suspect was being taken away after a recovery, when the police vehicle’s tyre punctured and his accomplices launched an attack. It said the suspect was killed by the firing of his own accomplices.
 
 

The chief justice said the IGP was summoned after the SHO concerned failed to satisfy the court. She found the IGP’s report complete and satisfactory.
However, the chief justice questioned, “Whenever there is firing on a police vehicle, how does the bullet directly hit a suspect? Why it never hits a constable or the police vehicle?”
She mentioned that the LHC was receiving 50 petitions daily regarding fake police encounters. She observed that the current wave of CCD encounters must be assessed.
Chief Justice Neelum directed the IGP to conduct a thorough review of the ongoing encounters. She instructed the police chief to sit with senior officers and ensure that such fake encounters were not repeated in the future.
The CJ disposed of the petition by Farhat Bibi.
 
 

The petitioner’s counsel had stated that his client’s two sons, Ghazanfar Aslam and Ansar Aslam, were arrested by Sharqpur police. He said that Ghazanfar was killed in a fake encounter on April 22 and there was a serious threat to the life of the petitioner’s other son.
He argued that ever since the CCD was established, all police encounters followed the same scripted pattern.

• Rules that infertility, even if present, is no ground to deny woman dower or  maintenance
ISLAMABAD: The Supr­e­me Court on Wednesday denounced the distressing and sorrowful social practice of ‘weaponising’ infertility, or even the mere suspicion of it, against women.
“This social prejudice routinely results in courts of law becoming venues for humiliating a woman under the guise of litigation,” regretted Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi.
The CJP, who was part of a two-judge bench alongside Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, was remarking on a case filed by one Saleh Muhammad against a March 3, 2025, judgement of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), regarding a dispute over dower claims, dowry articles and maintenance of the respondent, Mehnaz Begum.
“This court cannot but record in the strongest possible terms its disapproval of the manner in which the respondent — a woman already abandoned, denied maintenance and left to the mercy of litigation — was subjected to repeated, invasive and demeaning scrutiny of her very personhood at the behest of a frivolous and cruel defence,” Justice Afridi bemoaned.
Saleh Muhammad and Mehnaz Begum married in 2006, but in 2007, the woman was left at her parental home after allegedly enduring physical abuse at the hands of the petitioner.
The husband then went abroad, severed all communication, refused to provide maintenance and effectively abandoned her within a year of their marriage. Three years later, he remarried and has two children from that union.
Left with no other recourse, Mehnaz Begum initiated legal proceedings in 2015 for the recovery of her dower, dowry articles and maintenance.
No ground to challenge ‘womanhood’
Rather than contesting the claim on any credible grounds, the petitioner pursued a defence alleging the respondent was medically unfit for conjugal duties or to bear children, thus questioning her status as a “female” under the law. This claim was rejected by subsequent medical tests, but the petitioner continued to deny her dower and maintenance on this basis.
“While it is possible that the petitioner viewed this as a genuine grievance or felt wronged in some manner, the manner in which this allegation, targeting the very identity of the respondent, was pursued remains troubling,” the Supreme Court noted.
“It was pressed persistently and aggressively through three tiers of judicial scrutiny, unnecessarily so given that all forums rendered findings effectively refuting it, thereby subjecting the respondent to what this Court recognises as profound personal humiliation,” it added.
In the seven-page order, the CJP emphasised that it must be acknowledged without equivocation that infertility, even if present, was no ground to deny a woman her dower or maintenance and it was certainly no ground to challenge her womanhood.
 
 

“To convert such personal pain into a legal weapon is not only an abuse of the process, but an affront to human dignity that should not be enabled,” he said.
“It also bears emphasis that our religion and culture treat the marital bond as a sacred covenant. The Holy Quran has described the spouse as a garment; the relationship between a husband and wife is likened to that of libaas in our religion,” the CJP said, stressing that the ideals of protection, mutual respect and dignity in marriage must not be compromised in any event.
“Lest we forget: women in our society constitute a vulnerable group, whose dignity requires vigilant protection and care,” he observed.
Fine to be paid to ‘wronged’ woman
The courts could not, and would not, be passive venues for the perpetuation of social prejudices that harm women and subject them to one trauma after another, CJP Yahya said.
“It is not a matter of judicial discretion but of constitutional and moral obligation that the personal dignity of all who appear before the courts be duly safeguarded, particularly where the power imbalance between the parties is so manifest,” he added.
The CJP said that in the present case, the petitioner has not merely wasted judicial time, he has caused a woman already in a position of vulnerability to suffer degradation and trauma over the course of protracted litigation in three forums spread over a decade. “This court would be remiss in its duty were it to allow such conduct to pass without sanction,” he said.
The court dismissed the petition and imposed a Rs500,000 fine, payable to the respondent, as a show of strong disapproval for the petitioner’s conduct.
“It is hoped this order serves as a reminder to all litigants and counsel that the dignity of every individual, particularly women, must be respected in all judicial proceedings,” the CJP noted, adding that frivolous allegations attacking the dignity of a woman would not be countenanced in any court of law.

The EHP, which takes effect on Aug 1, will remain in force for one year and is renewable. It also allows for the future inclusion of additional items, making it the first tangible step towards launching negotiations on a comprehensive PTA.
The agreement was signed by Pakistan’s Commerce Secretary, Jawad Paul, and Afghanistan’s Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce, Mullah Ahmadullah Zahid, who was accompanied by a delegation of senior technical officials. The Afghan delegation arrived in Islamabad on Monday night to hold detailed negotiations with Pakistan’s Ministry of Commerce.
Under the agreement, tariffs on four Afghan agricultural exports to Pakistan — grapes, pomegranates, apples, and tomatoes — and four Pakistani exports to Afghanistan — mangoes, kinnows, bananas, and potatoes — will be reduced to 27pc, down from over 60pc previously.
A senior official at the Ministry of Commerce told Dawn the agreement will serve as a catalyst for reviving formal PTA negotiations, which had been dormant for nearly a decade. “We will now resume talks to discuss the details of the PTA,” the official added.
In 2014, both countries agreed to initiate PTA talks, and Pakistan subsequently shared a draft agreement. However, progress stalled when the Afghan side, under then-President Ashraf Ghani, linked further talks to allowing the import of Indian goods via the Wagah border — a proposal repeatedly rejected by Islamabad. As a result, negotiations remained suspended in the following years.
In the meantime, Pakistan has taken several steps to facilitate bilateral trade, including offering transactions in Pakistani rupees and allowing limited barter trade in the wake of Afghanistan’s banking crisis.
Official data shows that Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan surged 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25, up from $558.03m in the previous fiscal year. Imports from Afghanistan more than doubled to $25.89m from $11.96m in FY24, an increase of 116.47pc.Pakistan’s key export to Afghanistan this year has been sugar, with over 700,000 tonnes shipped in the past four months alone.

In a sweeping deal that will restore the prestigious New York institution’s federal monies, Columbia has pledged to obey rules that bar it from taking race into consideration in admissions or hiring, among other concessions.
“Columbia University has reached an agreement with the United States government to resolve multiple federal agency investigations into alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws,” a statement said, adding that the $200m would be paid over three years.
The university will also pay $21m to settle investigations brought by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, it said.
“Under today’s agreement, a vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 will be reinstated and Columbia’s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored,” the statement said.
The promise of the federal funding spigot reopening offers relief for the university, which was under growing financial pressure, despite a comfortable endowment and a reputation it can bank on.
The agreement also represents a victory for Trump, who has repeatedly claimed elite universities brainwash students against his nationalist ideas with left-wing bias.
Thanking Columbia for “agreeing to do what is right,” Trump warned in a social media post that “numerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust… are upcoming.”
The centuries-old Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is also in a fight with the administration over Trump’s threats to rip away federal funding, and Wednesday’s carefully worded agreement — in which Columbia admitted no wrongdoing — could offer a framework for future deals.
“This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,” Columbia’s acting president Claire Shipman said.
“The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track.
“Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.”
Disciplinary actions
Under the settlement, Columbia will maintain a security force to prevent demonstrations in academic spaces, such as those that rocked the campus last year when pro-Palestinian protestors clashed with law enforcement and occupied university buildings.
The school also agreed to “promptly provide” federal authorities with any requested information on “disciplinary actions involving student visa-holders resulting in expulsions or suspensions, and arrest records that Columbia is aware of for criminal activity, including trespass or other violation of law.”
Columbia found itself at the centre of a firestorm last year over claims of anti-Semitism triggered by campus protests against Israel’s conflict in Gaza.
Some Jewish students claimed they were intimidated and that authorities did not act to protect them.
The school announced a wave of various student punishments on Tuesday, including expulsions and degree revocations, against nearly 80 students involved in the pro-Palestinian protest movement that has called on the university to divest from Israel.
“Our institution must focus on delivering on its academic mission for our community,” Columbia said in a statement about student protests on its campus.
“Disruptions to academic activities are in violation of University policies and rules, and such violations will necessarily generate consequences.”
While the university appears to be acquiescing to the Trump administration’s demands to quash student protest, one of the most prominent leaders of the US pro-Palestinian campus protests is still raising his voice.
Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate active in campus demonstrations, has sued the Trump administration for $20m over his arrest and detention by immigration agents.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States who is married to a US citizen, missed the birth of his son while being held in a federal immigration detention centre in Louisiana.
He called the lawsuit a “first step towards accountability.”</p><small>2025-07-24 04:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/240822488f03fbd.jpg?r=082255' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926158/pakistani-passport-still-ranked-among-weakest-despite-improvement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani passport still ranked among ‘weakest’ despite improvement</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: While the passports of other Asian countries have emerged as the most powerful in the world, Pakistan’s travel document continues to be ranked among the ‘weakest’ in the world, with visa-free access available to only 32 destinations.
According to the Henley Passport Index for 2025, Pakistan currently ranks 96th on the list — ahead of the war-torn nations of Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.
Although still quite low, the country’s ranking has improved slightly; in 2024, the Pakistani passport was tied with Yemen as the fourth-worst in the world for the fourth consecutive year.
The Henley Passport Index compares the visa-free access of 199 different passports to 227 travel destinations, and ranks all the world’s passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa.

Singapore, Japan and South Korea top the list; Afghanistan placed at the bottom

If no visa is required, then that passport is given a score value of 1. The same applies if you can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) when entering the destination.
Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder has to obtain a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) before departure, a score with value of 0 is assigned. This also applies if you need pre-departure government approval for a visa on arrival.
The total score for each passport is equal to the number of destinations for which no visa is required.
Singapore occupies the top spot, with Japan and South Korea sharing second place on the index. Seven EU passports share 3rd place — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.
Another seven-nation Euro­pean cohort are joint 4th — Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Neth­erlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. Meanwhile, New Zealand is tied for 5th place with Greece and Switzerland.
The UK and US have each dropped a place in the global passport rankings since January, continuing a long-term downward trend. Once the most powerful passports in the world — the UK in 2015 and the US in 2014 — they now rank 6th and 10th, respectively.
India has recorded the largest jump in ranking over the past six months, climbing eight places from 85th to 77th. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has made the biggest gain in visa-free access.
The UAE continues to be a standout among the top risers, shooting up 34 places over the last 10 years from 42nd to 8th place, making it the only big riser to break into the Top 10 in the ranking.
Another notable country is China, also rising 34 places from 94th to 60th since 2015 — particularly impressive considering that it has not yet gained visa-free access to Europe’s Schengen Area.

GILGIT: Thousands of people, including foreign tourists, remai­ned stranded at multiple locations in Gilgit-Baltistan due to blocked roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), due to landslides. Mobile and internet services across the region were also disrupted after fibre optic cables were damaged in several areas.
Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq confirmed that KKH is blocked at Achar Nallah in the Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Thousands of passengers, including tourists, travelling to and from GB are stranded on both sides of the highway.
He said that while KKH has been reopened for traffic within GB, restoration work is underway in Kohistan. The Babusar Pass Road is also blocked at several locations.
Mr Faraq assured that all tourists stranded on the Babusar route have been safely evacuated and search operations for missing individuals are underway. Those rescued from Babusar Pass have been brought to Chilas, where local hoteliers and government authorities have arranged complimentary accommodation.
The mobile and internet communication systems in the region were severely damaged, leaving the majority of residents without service for up to six hours on Wednesday. The region’s communication system relies on an optical fibre cable connecting GB with Rawalpindi.
According to the Special Commu­nications Organisation (SCO), recent flash floods in Babusar Valley caused significant damage to the main optical fibre cable. Emergency alternative satellite arrangements were made, but consumers faced slow mobile and internet connectivity. Mr Faraq said that work has begun to restore the communication system.
Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly Sadia Danish expressed concern over the safety of 40 individuals stranded in Danyore’s Manogah Nallah in Gilgit. In a statement, she urged the government to initiate a helicopter rescue operation immediately.
Ms Danish emphasised tha protecting human lives should remain the top priority and recognised the efforts of the provincial government, the Pakistan Army, volunteers and residents in the rescue operations during the flood emergency.
She also commended the generosity of residents, who opened their homes, mosques, imambargahs and hotels to shelter stranded tourists.
Moreover, river erosion caused the collapse of the Hotu suspension bridge in Shigar, cutting off the only access to the K2 base camp. A large number of foreign expedition members and trekkers were stranded, while eight villages were also disconnected.
Officials from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said that a C130 sortie will be arranged from Gilgit to Islamabad to airlift stranded travellers.
Stranded tourists are expected to receive airlifts free of charge on Thursday (today) in an operation overseen by Gilgit’s additional deputy commissioner.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has assured that the rescue operations will continue until all stranded people in Babusar are rescued.
He also declared the flood-affected areas of Thaki, Niyat, Khunra and Thor in Diamer as disaster zones. He also announced that the families of those who died in the floods at Babusar will receive death compensation under the government policy.
The chief minister ordered urgent measures to restore drinking water, electricity, irrigation channels and road communications in the flood-affected areas of Thor. He also visited the flood-affected areas to oversee the recovery efforts along with Adviser on Forests Haji Shah Baig and GB Minister for Agriculture Engineer Anwar.
