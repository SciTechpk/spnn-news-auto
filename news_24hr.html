The leaders believe that the internal memo is undemocratic and ensures one-man rule instead of decentralisation. They also claimed that the original constitution of PTI had a core committee and nothing like a political one.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that “the internal memo was the need of the hour and was issued by Additional Secretary General PTI Firdous Shamim Naqvi to streamline recent issues faced by the party.”
The memo, available with Dawn, states that in the centre, provincial presidents and general secretaries or equivalent office bearers will report to the party’s secretary general.
Similarly, at the provincial level, the regional president and general secretary will report to the secretary general of the party on organisational matters. District and tehsil presidents will report to the general secretary of the region and district.
“To clarify further, no tier can break this chain of command. For the party to function properly, the office bearers must recognise their domain,” the memo, signed by party leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi, stated.
“At each tier, their many functions which are the purview of the tier as per the general directions called out above. The functional duties of the office bearer will be decided by the [secretary general] with the approval of the cabinet of the tier.”
The memo added that all provincial or regional heads’ complaints would be addressed to the centre and to the respective office bearer, as the case may be.
A leader of the party, wishing not to be quoted, said that the PTI was going under “one-man rule” with this move.
“Now, no decision can be taken without getting the approval from the secretary general. However, it is a fact that currently there is no secretary general in the PTI, and that is why Additional Secretary General Mr Naqvi has signed the internal memo,” he explained.
Another leader said that the PTI had a core committee, and there was no mention of the political committee in the party’s constitution.
“Now, there is no room for dissent or difference with the secretary general,” he said. “Once, PTI leaders had their own opinion, and Imran Khan used to say that the difference of opinion was the beauty of the political party.
“Unfortunately, now the political party will be run like an army unit in which there will be a ‘chain of command’. I can foresee that the differences within the party will further increase,” he said.
Information Secretary Akram, while talking to Dawn, said that the chain of command was already defined in the constitution of the PTI.
“The internal memo is basically related to block code, which is related to Election Management and Assessment Cell (EMAC),” he explained.
“We had to issue the internal memo as at different places, appointments for EMAC were not being understood by party wings. So Mr Naqvi has given just a clarification to streamline the issues related to appointments regarding EMAC.”

Akram emphasised that the hierarchy of the PTI was arranged according to the party constitution was submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan in 2019, further stating that all have to perform their roles as per the constitution.
“Chain of command has to be recognised to run any party smoothly. Parties cannot be run without a chain of command. Otherwise, there is a structure including Centre, Province, Region, District, Tehsil and then Unions,” the PTI Information Secretary said.</p><small>2025-11-26 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26210240b32fd5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957514/nawaz-calls-for-accountability-for-those-who-brought-imran-to-power-terms-them-bigger-criminals' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz calls for accountability for ‘those who brought Imran’ to power, terms them bigger ‘criminals’</strong></a><br><p>PML-N president and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday called for accountability for “those who brought Imran” into power, claiming that they were bigger “criminals” than the PTI founder.
“Imran Khan was not the only criminal; the ones who brought him to power were the bigger criminals, and they should be held fully accountable,” said the PML-N supremo while addressing a gathering of newly elected lawmakers today.
Nawaz has generally maintained a low profile since the PML-N, following the formation of a coalition with the PPP, came into power after the 2024 elections.
In 2018, according to figures provided by the Election Commission of Pakistan, PTI had emerged as the largest political party in the country, winning 115 of the 270 National Assembly seats on which the elections were held.
During a session in parliament following the election of then-PM Imran, PML-N leader Shehbaz brought up allegations of rigging in the July 25 polls. Alleging that 1.6 million votes were rejected, he questioned the discovery of ballot papers from gutters and streets across the country.

“You know their (PTI’s) narrative well, they used to call others robbers and dacoits while they were the bigger robbers.”
Nawaz added that the people of the country are now aware of what the previous government did and further said, “they only indulged in chaos, anarchy and fights, including slandering others”.
He asked if a country can progress under such circumstances and with such people residing in the corridors of power.
The PML chief lamented that prior to the change of power in 2018, the country was on a path of progress with low inflation and higher growth rates.
Nawaz recalled that the Saudi riyal was valued at Rs11 when Pervez Musharraf imposed martial law in 1999, compared to around Rs78 today (as pointed out by an audience member). He said currency depreciation had made life unaffordable for Pakistanis.
The PML-N supremo added that Pakistan cannot make decisions independently due to its reliance on the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“If our rate of progress had remained the same, who knows where we would’ve reached today. There would be no worries about IMF or about foreign exchange,” Nawaz said.
“Now we have all these worries; what are our reserves, whether IMF will let us do this or not. We cannot make any decision ourselves. Our personal decisions are in the hands of foreigners,” he stated.
The PML-N leader claimed that people voted for the party on the basis of its performance, praising both PM Shehbaz and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for their efforts to “reach the level that we had lost”.
He said the two were “working hard” to restore economic stability, saying the government had “taken the economy out of the trenches” and moved the country away from default.
Nawaz said provincial schemes, including low-cost housing, hospital projects, student laptops, scholarships and the “Suthra Punjab” and green bus initiatives, are evidence of progress.
He also highlighted what he described as improved security and social protection in Punjab, stating that ration cards and health facilities were being distributed to vulnerable families without discrimination. “People of all beliefs and religions are our brothers and sisters,” Nawaz stated.</p><small>2025-11-26 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26195057182bf19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957523/joint-counter-terrorism-drill-al-battar-ii-between-pakistan-and-saudi-arabia-concludes-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Joint counter-terrorism drill Al Battar-II between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia concludes: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The joint counter-terror drills between troops of the Pakistan Army and the Royal Saudi Land Forces concluded on Wednesday, said a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“Troops from both brotherly countries demonstrated exceptional standards of professionalism, operational skill, and interoperability throughout the exercise,” said the military’s media wing.
The exercise, Al Battar-II, focused on enhancing joint proficiency in counter-terrorism operations, with an emphasis on fighting in urban terrain, countering improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and refining tactical drills and procedures through integrated training.
“The exercise also served to further strengthen the deep-rooted and historic military-to-military ties between Pakistan and the KSA,” said the ISPR.
The military’s media wing further stated that all “objectives were successfully achieved, reinforcing the commitment of both nations to regional peace, security, and collaborative defence preparedness”.
The closing ceremony of the drills was attended by senior Saudi and Pakistani officials, with the general officer commanding (GOC) of the Special Services Group (SSG) attending as the chief guest of the ceremony.
On Monday, the Saudi armed forces chief had relayed the kingdom’s desire to elevate its defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.
In September, the two countries had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2025-11-26 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2619385752d09c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957522/un-report-warns-karachi-among-cities-expected-to-become-substantially-hotter' target='_blank'><strong>UN report warns Karachi among cities expected to become ‘substantially hotter’</strong></a><br><p>Karachi is among the nine densely built megacities in Asia and the Pacific which are particularly vulnerable to heat and are projected to become substantially hotter in the years ahead, a report released by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UN-ESCAP) on Wednesday said.
The report, titled Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2025: Rising Heat, Rising Risk, stated that urban areas are already at high risk for extreme heat due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Densely built surfaces trap heat and raise city temperatures above those of surrounding rural areas.
It added that this challenge is being exacerbated by rapid and often unplanned urbanisation and insufficient green spaces, further warning that UHI would raise temperatures by 2 to 7°C, on top of global warming.
As access to cooling, water and healthcare comes under increased strain, children, the elderly and outdoor workers in densely populated urban areas are disproportionately affected. Higher-income areas usually lie in cooler, greener neighbourhoods, exacerbating issues of equity and environmental justice, the report says.

Cities including Seoul, Tokyo, Beijing, Delhi, Karachi, Dhaka, Manila, Jakarta and Phnom Penh were identified as high-risk locations.
It added that during the period 2041–2060, countries projected to be the most arid include Mongolia, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Turkmenistan, as higher temperatures evaporate more surface water, drying out soils and vegetation and causing droughts and water shortages.
“Asia and the Pacific were impacted by various natural hazards and climate-induced extreme events in 2024 and 2025, and the fastest-growing climate-related hazards are driven by extreme heat,” the report reads.
The report shows that rising temperatures are “impacting all, everywhere”, with expanding and intensifying risks to food systems, public health, urban living, rural livelihoods, infrastructure and the ecosystem.
It warns that across the Asia-Pacific region, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme heat events are now creating a silent but growing health emergency.

“Under all future climate scenarios, heat stress is projected to rise sharply across Asia and the Pacific, with mortality potentially doubling by 2050,” the report added.
The report said that the urban poor are highly exposed, especially in densely populated cities where extreme heat is amplified by the UHI effect.
On the other hand, it noted that the region has had considerable experience with managing cascading disasters, but stated that the rising threat of extreme heat demands a new level of urgency.
“Every country needs to act now, with the implementation of regional cooperation initiatives turbocharged to meet the scale of this evolving disaster risk landscape,” the report read.
According to the report, the melting of glaciers is one of the most disastrous consequences of global warming.
It “exacerbates changes in tele-connected systems of oceans and atmosphere across distant regions — disrupting monsoon patterns, snow and melt dynamics, and permafrost thaw, which all lead to the increased frequency, intensity and expansion of floods, landslides, droughts, land degradation and sand and dust storms”, the report read.
According to UN-ESCAP, glaciers around the world have lost about 5 per cent of their volume this century. Out of 58 countries in Asia and the Pacific, 17 contain glaciers which can melt into lakes that burst their banks, leading to sudden glacial lake outburst floods (Glof).
 
 

“The glaciers with the highest Glof risks are in High Mountain Asia, where a total of 9.3 million people are exposed to 2,211 glacial lakes,” the report stated. “By 2060, countries like Iran, Mongolia, Myanmar, Turkiye and Uzbekistan could lose over 70pc of their glacier mass … posing Glof risks.”
New projections in the 2025 report highlight the scale of the threat. By 2100, regional disaster losses could increase from $418 billion under the current scenario to $498 billion under a worst-case climate scenario.

Additionally, the frequency of days above critical heat thresholds is set to increase sharply, with south and southwest Asia, parts of southeast Asia and northern and eastern Australia trending toward chronic heat exposure.
The report called for strategic, long-term action grounded in science, innovation and regional cooperation, emphasising the need to place heat at the centre of multi-hazard planning, supported by heat-ready early warning systems that use interoperable alerting, agreed metrics and trusted last-mile communication.
With only 54 per cent of global meteorological services issuing warnings for extreme temperatures, expanding heat-health warning systems in just 57 countries could save approximately 100,000 lives each year, the report notes.
Over the past five decades, the Asia-Pacific region has been experiencing more frequent and more severe climate-related extreme events, which often overlap and intersect to create multi-hazard events, with widespread, cascading impacts.
Intensifying multi-hazard risks, including earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, floods and cyclonic storms, threaten much of the region’s critical infrastructure.</p><small>2025-11-26 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26150037a64b342.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957491/in-additional-note-justice-najafi-says-noor-mukadam-case-direct-result-of-vice-known-as-living-relationship' target='_blank'><strong>In additional note, Justice Najafi says Noor Mukadam case direct result of ‘vice’ known as ‘living relationship’</strong></a><br><p>Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, who is now part of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), has observed that the Noor Mukadam case is the direct result of a “vice” spreading in society known as “living relationship”, it emerged on Wednesday.
It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at the Islamabad residence of Zahir Zakir Jaffer in July 2021. In May, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Najafi, had upheld the death sentence awarded to Zahir, who was convicted by an Islamabad trial court in 2022.
Last month, the apex court had taken up Zakir’s review petition challenging the capital punishment awarded to him. During the hearing, Justice Najafi told senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the convict, that it would be more appropriate for him to start arguments after going through the additional note he had not yet issued at the time.
Later, Justice Najafi was sworn in as a judge of the FCC, established earlier this month after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In an additional note on the Noor murder case, which was uploaded on the SC website today, Justice Najafi upheld the sentence handed to Zahir and observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’ [sic]”.
He stressed that such relationships ignored “societal compulsions” and “defy not only the law of the land but also the personal law” under Sharia.
 
 

Justice Najafi went on to say that engaging in a relationship like that was a “direct revolt against Almighty Allah”, calling on the younger generation to note its “horrible consequences, such as in the present case, which is also a topic for the social reformist to discuss in their circles”.
Justice Najafi further said that in his view, “no mitigating circumstances” existed in the present case.
He noted that the “minor discrepancies in the time of occurrence, the delay in postmortem, absence of the finger prints on the knife but matched with the DNA of the petitioner, minor delay in lodging the first information would not affect the credibility of the prosecution evidence, which had circumstantial evidence”.
“In this case of circumstantial evidence, one end of the rope is found tied with the dead body of Noor Mukadam, and the other end tied with the neck of the petitioner,” he said.
Mentioning the filing of the first information report (FIR) at 11:30pm of the incident that occurred at 9:30pm, Justice Najafi observed that the statement of Noor’s father, retired diplomat Shaukat Mukadam, of “receiving the information […] about the murder of his daughter is well corroborated”.
The judge wrote: “It is natural that after reaching the place of occurrence, the complainant being the real father of the victim required some time and extraordinary nerves to absorb the extreme shock of his life and then draft the complaint for registration of FIR.”
Noting that the postmortem report suggested a gap of eight to nine hours between Noor’s death and her body’s autopsy, Justice Najafi said, “This delay of conducting postmortem of about 12 hours is not fatal.”
 
 

The judge also mentioned the CCTV footage obtained during the trial, showing Noor jumped from the window and “came limping towards main gate to escape”, but watchman Mohammad Iftikhar locked the door.
He further said that Zahir “snatched the mobile phone of [the] deceased, locked her in the outer cabin”, then opened it and physically assaulted her, while gardener Muhammad Jan “did not make any effort to stop” Zahir.
“It was not mere seeing the petitioner (Zahir) with the deceased (Noor) before the unnatural death caused in most brutal manner, but there are circumstantial evidence which connect the petitioner with crime,” Justice Najafi remarked.
Touching upon Zahir’s stance, Justice Najafi said his version, which alleged Noor had consumed drugs in excess, was “found incorrect” as no intoxicant was identified in either the convict’s or the victim’s medical evidence, and no “guest of drug party” was seen in the CCTV footage.
On Zahir’s plea of insanity, the judge observed that there was “no evidence on record that the petitioner used to consult any psychiatrist, therapy workers or consume any drug in the absence of which, or due to which, he became infurious and went out of mind”.
The case
Noor was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report was registered later the same day against Zahir, who was arrested at the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge sentenced Jaffer to death for the murder and handed him 25 years of rigorous imprisonment, finding him guilty of rape. His household staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Zahir’s parents, leading businessman Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamji, were indicted by an Islamabad district and sessions court in October 2021 but were later acquitted by the court.
Six officials of Therapy Works, whose employees had visited the site of the murder before police, were also among those indicted by the lower court but were later freed of the charges along with the parents.
According to the challan, the parents and the therapy workers tried to conceal the crime and attempted to destroy the evidence.
In March 2023, the Islamabad High Court (IHC), dismissing Zahir’s appeal against the conviction, not only upheld the death sentence but also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty. The IHC had also rejected the pleas of the main suspect’s staff challenging their conviction.
The next month, Zahir approached the SC against the IHC verdict, insisting that his conviction resulted from “erroneous appreciation” of the case evidence and that the high court and trial court could not identify the “fundamental flaws” in the FIR.
In May of this year, the SC upheld the death sentence of Zahir for the murder of Noor.</p><small>2025-11-26 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635729-pm-shehbaz-eyes-1bn-pakistan-bahrain-trade-within-three-years' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz eyes $1bn Pakistan-Bahrain trade within three years</strong></a><br><p>

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was brutally tortured before being beheaded.
Not only had Zahir’s death sentence been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in 2023, but by a three-member bench of the SC as well on May 20 this year.
In an additional note released today, one of those judges, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, stood by the SC judgment but remarked that the “case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society” known as a live-in relationship.
He went on to say that such ties “defy not only the law of the land but also the personal law” under Sharia, and termed them a “direct revolt” against God. The judge even cautioned the younger generation about “horrible consequences”, specifically noting that the case was a “topic for the social reformist to discuss in their circles”.
Back in May, Justice Hashim Kakar, who headed the SC bench, opined that a man and woman living together out of wedlock was against religion and morals. This happens in Europe, not here, he reportedly said.
The judge’s observations, which surfaced just a day after the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, triggered criticism from many on social media, including lawyers and journalists.
 






Journalist Benazir Shah said blaming the relationship dynamics “in a case where a woman was brutally murdered reflects a troubling mindset”.
“Women deserve justice, not judgment.”
 
 

“So death is ordained in a ‘living relationship’? Under which law?” asked senior journalist Mariana Baabar on X. “Does Islam allow beheading of na mahram?” she rhetorically wondered.
 






Gender policy analyst Fauzia Yazdani said the judge “drills on ‘vices’ in socio-religious context but fails to drill that ‘murder’ irrespective of any vice is CRIME”.
“The case was of brutal murder of Noor Muqaddam, not an application for character certification,” the researcher pointed out.
 






Journalist Zoya Anwer said: “Really wanna ask Justice Najafi about those countless ‘legally’ married women who are treated brutally by their [very very very] legal husbands if ‘live-in’ and deen se doori (distance from religion) is the root cause of Zahir Jaffer and Noor Mukadam’s case.”
“I literally grew up reading those afternoon Urdu newspapers plastered with headlines about ‘Cruel man beheaded his wife’ along with the photo of the bloodied, dead woman in question. But cool, cool, cool that ‘live-in’ that too in Pakistan is the REAL problem,” she said sarcastically.
According to the United Nations, some 50,000 women and girls were killed by intimate partners or family members in 2024, breaking down to around one woman every 10 minutes.
 






Lawyer Rida Hosain slammed the judge’s note as “appalling”, sharing her comment piece from May about Justice Kakar’s similar remarks.
“He suggests the murder stemmed from the ‘vice’ of ‘living relationship’,” Hosain said, stressing that a judge “must uphold the law, not deliver moral lectures in a case where a woman was brutally murdered”.
 






Journalist and digital rights activist Farieha Aziz referred to the judge, who was among those appointed by the president, as “oh-so-progressive PPP’s pick for the FCC”.

Featuring marinated beef, vegetables, tofu and sweet potato noodles simmered in a savoury broth, this dish offers a well-balanced combination of textures and flavours.
While commonly prepared by layering all ingredients in a pot and boiling with seasoned broth, starting with beef tallow and salt is also popular. This flexible dish highlights the communal spirit of Korean cuisine and is especially enjoyable during colder months.
Ingredients

450 grams beef (sirloin or top round)
150 grams firm dubu (tofu)
150 grams kimchi cabbage
90 grams saesongi mushroom
45 grams green onion
60 grams sweet potato noodles

Marinade for beef

3 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon minced green onion
1 tablespoon minced garlic
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
Pinch of ground black pepper
Broth
6 cups water
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon sugar
Salt as needed

Preparation

In a medium bowl, combine all the ingredients for the beef marinade and mix well.
Slice the beef into thin strips. In a large bowl, add the beef and beef marinade and mix well.
Cut the dubu into 4x3x1-cm pieces.
Cut the cabbage into 4-cm wide pieces.
Cut the mushrooms into 5-cm-long pieces and shred them into thick strips.
Soak the sweet potato noodles in cold water for 20 minutes.
In a saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil.
Season to taste with soy sauce, sugar and salt.

Cooking

In a shallow hot pot, heat the vegetable oil over high heat. Stir-fry the beef until cooked.
Turn off the heat, and arrange the beef, dubu and vegetables in clusters side by side.
Add broth and bring to a boil over medium heat until the vegetables are tender.
Lower the heat to low.
Serve in a bowl while it is boiling.

Tip
There are two ways to eat sogogi jeongol. First is by putting ingredients in a casserole, pouring broth over the top, and boiling.
The second is by spreading the beef tallow and adding salt to the pan — like Japanese sukiyaki — before adding the meat and ingredients. Afterwards, pour the broth on top and boil.
Serves 4.

They also called for the withdrawal of an appeal by the Sindh government, challenging a two-judge Sindh High Court bench judgement on the preservation of Karoonjhar hills in Tharparkar. The appeal was filed in the Supreme Court, but it has now landed in the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which was established under the 27th Amendment.
The Sindh High Court Bar Association had announced a protest today, calling for the preservation of the Karoonjhar Mountain range, and planned to march from the Sindh High Court to the Chief Minister House.

However, the protesters were barred from reaching the CM House due to the placement of containers to block the routes leading to the building. The measure also created inconvenience for the commuters who were asked by the traffic police in multiple advisories to travel on alternative routes.
Police personnel were also deployed in the area.
The SHCBA protesters, meanwhile, gathered at PIDC Chowk, where the president of the lawyers’ body, Barrister Sarfaraz Metlo, addressed the demonstrators.
He accused the Sindh government of having a “dual policy”, saying that the provincial government was “with those leasing out the [mountain site] and, at the same time, was also aligned with those protesting against the move”.
“Karoonjhar Mountain belongs to Sindh. We demand the withdrawal of the [former] caretaker provincial government,” he said, apparently referring to a proposal by the last caretaker Sindh government for initiating a granite excavation project.
He also called for the provincial government to withdraw its appeal filed regarding the matter, warning that the lawyers would hold another protest after 15 days if their demand was not met.
Barrister Metlo, along with other representatives of the SHCBA, later visited the CM House for negotiations with the government, following which the lawyers ended the protest.
After the meeting at the CM House, Barrister Metlo said while speaking to the media that they had met Sindh Law Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar. He claimed that the minister had assured him that the Sindh government would withdraw its appeal and committed to declaring the Karoonjhar Mountain range a national heritage site.
He also claimed that the law minister had told him and his companions during the meeting that the Sindh government had “ended the contract for the lease of 21,000 acres” of the mountain site.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the CM Office said the lawyers’ delegation presented a memorandum and their demands in writing to the law minister.
The CM Office’s statement quoted the memorandum as stating that the SHCBA “expresses reservations over existing and potential dangers faced by the mountain range. This mountain is a natural, cultural and historical heritage of Sindh, and its loss is irreparable”.
The lawyers demanded “immediate and concrete” measures for the protection, survival and upkeep of the mountain range, according to the statement.
It said Law Minister Lanjar assured the lawyers’ delegation that his party, the PPP, was determined to protect the natural, cultural and historical heritage of the province.
“The land of Sindh is entrusted to us by our ancestors, and the government considers the protection of [Sindh’s] environment, mountains, natural resources and cultural identity its constitutional and moral responsibility,” Lanjar was quoted as saying.
The law minister assured the lawyers that necessary legal, administrative and practical steps would be taken to protect all historical and environmental sites of Sindh, including Karoonjhar.
According to the statement, Lanjar said recommendations of the legal community would be given “serious” consideration.
“Damage to natural, environmental and cultural assets of Sindh will not be allowed under any circumstances,” Lanjar added.
The statement said the two sides also signed a memorandum after the meeting.
KBA protest
Later, lawyers from the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also reached PIDC Chowk, following which police deployment in the area was increased.
Police then negotiated with the protesters.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Asad Raza told the media that they were trying to convince the lawyers to end their protest.
KBA President Amir Warraich also spoke to the media, saying that they had been invited for talks at the CM House.
“But, we refused to hold talks with the law minister,” he said, demanding that a “neutral senior minister” be sent by the government for talks.
He also called for the Sindh government to withdraw its appeal pertaining to Karoonjhar.
“We don’t accept the Federal Constitutional Court,” Warraich said, asserting that lawyers would protest “on every level for the protection of Karoonjhar”.
He added: “We reject the 26th and 27th Amendments. The Federal Constitutional Court will heed those who created it.”
The KBA president claimed that the Sindh advocate general had contacted the lawyers and claimed that the provincial government was mulling withdrawing its appeal.
A delegation of the KBA later held talks with Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah at the Karachi commissioner’s office.
Warraich later told the media that the lawyers had given the Sindh government 15 days, and the provincial government had assured them of withdrawing their appeal. He also said that the local government minister had said that the lawyers’ demand would be presented to the Sindh CM.
‘Always ready for dialogue’
Sindh Chief Minister addressed the matter while speaking to the media today after an event organised by the Sindh Higher Education Commission.
The CM reaffirmed his government’s commitment to protecting Karoonjhar hills, declaring the mountain range a cultural and environmental asset for the province.
“Karoonjhar is our treasure; we will not allow any damage to it,” he said.
He asserted that the Sindh government valued the ancient and historical significance of Karoonjhar and would not compromise on its preservation.
“Anyone creating hurdles in the path of development will be convinced through dialogue,” he added.
He also criticised road closures and street protests by lawyers, saying: “Coming out on the roads and causing inconvenience to citizens is not acceptable. If lawyers want to talk to the government or Parliament, they are welcome. Or they may take the matter to court. I am always ready for dialogue, whoever wants to come to the CM House can come.”
The Karoonjhar Mountain range in Tharparkar rises to a height of 305 metres and runs approximately 19 kilometres in length. Karoonjhar also has economic significance for the local people as it is rich in minerals and plants having medicinal value.
The SHC judgement challenged by the Sindh government was issued in 2023. One of the pleas taken up on the matter by the high court was filed after the provincial mines department allowed companies to excavate at the site and granted them a lease, leading to outrage among civil society.
Earlier this week, senior lawyer Salahuddin Ahmed had informed the Sindh government that he cannot not represent the province before the FCC in its appeal against the SHC judgement.
In a letter sent to law and mines and mineral secretaries, as well as advocate general, he stated that the subject matter had recently been transferred from the Supreme Court to the FCC and fixed for hearing on Nov 26.
“Due to the change in forum and on account of various concerns raised by different bars about the excessive level of government control over judicial appointments to the Federal Constitutional Court, I do not consider it possible for me to represent the government of Sindh before the Federal Constitutional Court,” he said.

The world’s fifth-largest economy last week implemented long-awaited labour laws that will replace colonial-era legislation and simplify a maze of confusing regulations.
The overhaul consolidates 29 existing labour laws into four key codes, with the number of rules being cut from more than 1,400 to about 350, but unions say the reforms will hurt workers’ rights.
Gautam Mody from the New Trade Union Initiative said workers from across all sectors were protesting on Wednesday outside factories and in many city centres.
“Workers have been blindsided by the government,” he told AFP. “We want fairness, justice and equity before the law, which are being denied under the new codes.”

While the new regulations boost safety standards and mandate guaranteed social security benefits for gig workers, they also allow for longer factory shifts, make it tougher for workers to conduct strikes and easier for medium-sized firms to fire employees.
A controversial key provision raises the threshold for firms that needed prior government permission for layoffs from 100 to 300 workers, which means companies with up to 300 employees can retrench staff without any approval.
‘Deceptive fraud’
The move has sparked worry among trade unions, aligned with parties opposed to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who have called it a “deceptive fraud” against the nation’s working people.
The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) said in a statement that the government wanted to portray these codes as “pro-worker” and “modernising”.
But “in reality they constitute the most sweeping and aggressive abrogation of workers’ hard-won rights and entitlements since Independence, aimed at facilitating corporate exploitation, contractualisation and unrestrained hire-and-fire”.
Modi has said the overhaul represented an opportunity to eliminate compliance-intensive labour laws, often seen as preventing the Indian economy from wooing foreign investors.
He has described the changes as “one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence.”

India remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy, but a slowdown over the last year has left it short of the 8 per cent growth rate that most economists say is needed to create millions of well-paying jobs for its people.
US President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz, partly sparked by the White House’s anger over New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, has also clouded the country’s economic outlook and raised questions over its energy security.
Analysts at Nomura said in a recent note that the labour law reform was an “attempt to modernise disparate, arcane and compliance-intensive labour laws” that have emerged as one of the “major challenges to the ease of doing business”.
But they added it was “part of a broader trend by the government to hasten economic reforms, especially in the wake of the 50pc Trump tariffs”.</p><small>2025-11-26 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635708-punjab-citizens-to-face-heavy-fines-under-new-traffic-ordinance' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab citizens to face heavy fines under new traffic ordinance</strong></a><br><p>

The PM reached Bahrain’s capital Manama earlier today for a two-day visit.
According to PTV, the premier received a warm welcome at the Manama airport by Bahrain’s Crown Prince and PM Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Deputy PM Khalid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, Foreign Minister Dr Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, and senior members of the Bahraini leadership.
 






The delegation also includes Deputy PM and FM Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for Railways Bilal Azhar Kayani, and other senior officials.
According to a post on the Government of Pakistan’s X account, the PM also received a guard of honour at the Al Qudaibiya Palace.
 






During his visit to Bahrain from November 26 to 27, PM Shehbaz will also hold “high-level” meetings with the Bahraini leadership.
These meetings, as per PTV, will include engagements with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad and Deputy PM Sheikh Khalid bin Abdullah.
“This official visit reflects the longstanding cordial relations between the Kingdom of Bahrain and Pakistan, with the aim of promoting a results-oriented and strategic partnership between the two countries,” state media said.
“The visit will strengthen traditionally warm and cordial relations, chart new avenues of partnership, and deepen people-to-people connections, which will contribute to mutually beneficial cooperation,” it added.
Last month, the two countries agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in different fields during the first meeting of the Pakistan-Bahrain Parliamentary Friendship Group.
They also agreed to establish a joint working group to enhance collaboration in areas such as counter-narcotics, counterterrorism, coastguard operations, border security, immigration and police training and decided to sign memoranda of understanding on extradition, mutual legal assistance and specialised battalion training.
In September, the countries had also agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, and immigration during a meeting between Interior Minister Naqvi and his Bahraini counterpart, Gen Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa.</p><small>2025-11-26 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26174123a6ccd5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957517/karachis-safari-park-welcomes-birth-of-15-animals' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s Safari Park welcomes birth of 15 animals</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) on Wednesday announced that 15 animals from different species were born at the metropolis’s Safari Park, hailing the arrivals as a “significant and heartening development”.
According to a statement from the municipal body, the park saw the birth of a mouflon, four Sindh ibex, four blackbucks, two chitals (spotted deer), one horse, two fallow deer and one white fallow deer.
“The newly born animals underwent thorough medical examinations by the veterinary team. The doctors confirmed that all animals are in excellent health, and special care arrangements have been made to ensure their continued well-being,” the statement read, quoting KMC spokesperson Daniyal Siyal.
The statement added that Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab expressed his delight at the births and directed the relevant departments to provide enhanced care and maintain a sustainable habitat for the newborns.
“I am pleased to announce the birth of 15 wildlife species at Safari Park. Their arrival not only enhances the beauty and diversity of the park but also stands as proof of the healthy and nurturing environment we have created for them,” Wahab was quoted as saying in the statement.
“These efforts reflect our commitment to expanding the park’s wildlife capacity and improving the overall ecosystem.”
The mayor added that this is a moment of joy for Safari Park, Karachi’s residents and all wildlife enthusiasts and instructed officials to arrange a naming ceremony and a formal celebration for the newly born animals.
“We must celebrate their arrival to express our care and compassion. Wildlife deserves the same respect and protection as humans, and this celebration is a gesture of our commitment to their well-being,” he noted.
3 lion cubs born at Karachi Zoo
KMC announced on Tuesday that three lion cubs were born at the Karachi Zoological Gardens on November 16 and are in “excellent health and active”.
According to the zoo’s medical staff, all three cubs are in excellent health, active and showing strong early signs of growth and vitality. Their mother is also reported to be healthy and is receiving continuous care.
The KMC took around 10 days to announce the birth because lion cubs are very vulnerable in their first few weeks, as they are born blind and entirely dependent on their mother for care, a zoo official said.
“Hence, it’s important to protect them from outside interference and help the mother strengthen her bond with the babies,” the official added.</p><small>2025-11-26 12:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635707-karoonjhar-mountain-range-lawyers-end-protest-after-meeting-with-sindh-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Protest over Karoonjhar protection ends after dialogue with Sindh minister</strong></a><br><p>

Gen Mirza’s tenure as CJCSC will end on November 27 (tomorrow), as the office will be abolished as per the recent 27th Constitutional Amendment. He has conducted farewell visits to both civilian and military leadership in the past several days.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the outgoing CJCSC was presented with a guard of honour by a contingent comprising personnel from the three services. The event was attended by former CJCSCs and senior military officers from the army, navy and air force.

“In his address, the outgoing CJCSC expressed gratitude to Allah Almighty for granting him the strength to perform his duties with dedication, professionalism and selfless devotion,” the statement read, adding that he paid tribute to the armed forces and martyrs for their sacrifices.
“He (Gen Mirza) highlighted that in the current geo-strategic environment, strong national defence is an essential pillar of national security and reaffirmed that the nation’s defence remains impregnable and our valiant officers and soldiers stand ever-ready to make it even more formidable,” the ISPR said.
Abolition of the CJCSC office
Earlier this month, the national security establishment was restructured through an amendment in Article 243 of the Constitution and the subsequent changes in the legislation governing the Army, Air Force and Navy.
The legislation also abolished the office of CJCSC, the tri-service post designed to maintain institutional balance and coordination within the armed forces.
The dissolution of the chairman’s office, effective November 27, would formally end nearly five decades of joint-service representation in armed forces decision-making, at least during wartime.</p><small>2025-11-26 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26172103a2dbb27.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957512/bangladesh-authorities-seize-10kg-gold-from-hasinas-bank-lockers' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh authorities seize 10kg gold from Hasina’s bank lockers</strong></a><br><p>Anti-corruption authorities in Bangladesh have seized approximately 10 kilogrammes of gold, worth around $1.3 million, from bank lockers belonging to ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, officials said on Wednesday.
Officials from the Central Intelligence Cell (CIC) of the National Board of Revenue said the discovery was made after opening lockers that had been seized in September.
“Following a court order, we opened the lockers and found about 9.7 kilogrammes of gold belonging to the former prime minister,” a senior CIC official told AFP, requesting anonymity. The haul included gold coins, bars and jewellery.
Investigators said Hasina had failed to deposit some of the gifts she received while in office at the state treasury, known as the Toshakhana, as required by law.
The National Board of Revenue is also probing alleged tax evasion and examining whether Hasina declared the recovered gold in her tax filings.
Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since the end of Hasina’s rule, and violence has marred campaigning for elections expected in February 2026.
Earlier this month, the International Crimes Tribunal sentenced Hasina to death over a deadly crackdown against a student-led uprising. The United Nations says up to 1,400 people were killed in the crackdown as Hasina tried to cling to power.</p><small>2025-11-26 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635694-those-who-brought-imran-equally-responsible-for-all-of-pakistans-ills-says-nawaz-sharif' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz holds Imran Khan's 'facilitators' equally responsible for Pakistan's ills</strong></a><br><p>

The brash former army captain, who fired up Brazil’s right and reshaped the country’s politics, is ending a divisive career jailed in a small room at police headquarters equipped with a TV, mini-fridge, and air-conditioning.
Bolsonaro, 70, was convicted in September over a scheme to stop Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office as president after the 2022 elections, a plan that included a plot to kill the veteran leftist.
Prosecutors said the scheme failed only due to a lack of support from military top brass.
 


The Supreme Court rejected an appeal to his sentence earlier this month and ruled the judgment final. The court also ordered a military tribunal to decide whether Bolsonaro should be stripped of his captain’s rank.
Bolsonaro had been under house arrest until Saturday, when he was detained at police headquarters in Brasilia for tampering with his ankle monitor using a soldering iron.
Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said there were signs Bolsonaro planned to flee during a vigil organised by his son outside his home.
The justice cited the nearby US embassy and Bolsonaro’s close relationship with former US President Donald Trump, suggesting he may have sought political asylum.
Bolsonaro said he acted out of “paranoia” induced by medication and denied attempting to escape.
The court ruled Bolsonaro will remain detained in the officers’ room, a secure space for protected prisoners, in Brasilia.
Five of his co-accused, including military generals and former ministers, also began serving sentences of between 19 and 26 years on Tuesday.
Former intelligence chief Alexandre Ramagem, sentenced to 16 years, was declared a fugitive after fleeing to the United States.
Bolsonaro’s defence lawyer, Paulo Cunha Bueno, called the closure of the case “surprising” and said he would file an appeal regardless.
Brazilian congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the president’s son, was also charged on Tuesday with obstruction of justice after promoting Trump-era measures seeking to interfere with his father’s trial.
‘Extremely fragile’
Bolsonaro is the fourth former president to be imprisoned since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985.
In May, Fernando Collor de Mello was allowed to serve his nearly nine-year sentence for corruption at home due to health concerns.
Bolsonaro’s defence team argues he should receive the same treatment, warning that detention endangers his life.
He suffers the consequences of a stab wound sustained during a 2018 campaign attack and has required several follow-up surgeries.
He also experiences persistent “uncontrollable hiccups” linked to gastric issues, leaving him breathless and fainting, according to doctors.
 
 

Bolsonaro’s family has highlighted his poor mental and physical state. After visiting him on Tuesday, Carlos Bolsonaro described his father as “extremely fragile and psychologically devastated,” adding: “He’s eating very little — there’s no way for someone who knows he didn’t commit a crime to see this as normal.”
Bolsonaro, president from 2019 to 2022, maintains his innocence and claims political persecution.
With Bolsonaro sidelined, Brazil’s large conservative electorate lacks a champion ahead of the 2026 presidential elections, in which Lula, 80, has said he will seek a fourth term.
Lula himself was jailed between mandates for corruption but had his conviction overturned by the Supreme Court after a year and a half.</p><small>2025-11-26 11:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635676-pakistan-expresses-concern-over-un-report-on-rights-violations-in-iiojk' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expresses concern over UN report on rights violations in IIOJK</strong></a><br><p>

Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Secu­ri­­ty Council (SNSC), called on the army chief at the General Headquarters in the garrison city, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability, COAS Munir emphasised the “need for closer collaboration with Iran to combat terrorism”.
“He also highlighted the growing importance of strategic cooperation in light of the evolving geopolitical situation,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media affairs wing described Larijani as Iran’s NSA (national security adviser).

Iran and Pakistan share a long, often tense border where terrorist groups have carried out attacks on both sides, prompting growing security coordination. Tehran has also offered to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul amid rising cross-border tensions.
Islamabad and Tehran had also vowed to enhance joint efforts to eradicate terrorism in both countries when Iranian Parliament Speaker Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad earlier this month.
Today’s meeting between COAS Munir and Larijani focused on bilateral cooperation, regional security issues, and the importance of strengthening ties between Pakistan and Iran. “Both dignitaries discussed the prevailing security dynamics in the region,” the ISPR added.
On his part, Larijani acknowledged “Pakistan’s vital role in ensuring peace and security in the region and expressed his commitment to furthering Iran-Pakistan ties”, according to the ISPR.
The Iranian top official also underlined the significance of dialogue and partnership between the two nations in tackling regional challenges and ensuring long-term stability.
Larijani’s visit
Larijani, who arrived in Pakistan on Monday, met with President Asif Ali Zardari, PM Shehbaz, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar and National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq yesterday.
He is also scheduled to meet National Security Adviser Lt Gen Asim Malik, also the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief.
The visit is focused on reviewing bilateral ties, pursuing pending agreements and discussing regional developments, including those in the Muslim world.
Larijani’s trip comes as Iran expressed reservations about United States President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, which Pakistan has supported and is seen as a potential contributor to an international stabilisation force envisioned under it.
 
 

Though Pakistan’s statements on the SNSC official’s meetings did not say much on discussions about the Gaza plan, Larijani, in a post on X at the end of the day, conveyed Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s greetings to “honourable people of Pakistan” for supporting Iran during the 12-day war with Israel.
“This reflects the firm and principled thinking of the Pakistani people,” he said.
Larijani’s trip also comes on the heels of the Saudi armed forces’ chief visiting Pakistan, with him and Pakistani officials mostly discussing defence partnership and counterterrorism efforts.</p><small>2025-11-26 10:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635662-haripur-defeat-pushes-pti-to-rethink-strategy' target='_blank'><strong>Haripur defeat pushes PTI to rethink strategy</strong></a><br><p>

UN experts on Monday raised the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the government of India in the aftermath of a terror attack in Pahalgam in April this year, for which Delhi blamed Islamabad without any evidence.
A press release issued by the FO today said, “Pakistan notes with grave concern the latest findings by the United Nations Special Procedures experts regarding India’s illegal measures in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).”
It said that the report “once again underscores the severe and systematic human rights violations endured by the Kashmiri people under Indian occupation”.
It noted “with alarm” the UN experts’ observations that India’s actions had resulted in the “extensive arbitrary arrest and detention of nearly 2,800 individuals, including journalists, students, and human rights advocates”.
“The persistent application of draconian legislation, such as the Public Safety Act (PSA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), has facilitated indefinite and unjustifiable detentions,” it added.
“Instances of torture, custodial deaths, incommunicado detention, denial of due legal process and family contact, punitive demolitions and forced evictions, recurring communication blackouts, and suppression of press freedom — including the blocking of 8,000 social media accounts — as well as the rise in hate speech, lynching, and harassment directed at Kashmiris and Muslim communities across India, are equally deplorable and deeply troubling,” the statement said.
It added, “These findings reaffirm Pakistan’s longstanding concerns regarding state-sponsored persecution of Kashmiri Muslims as well as discrimination against minorities across India.”
 






The FO called upon India to “cease its coercive measures” and to unconditionally release all arbitrarily detained individuals in India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. It also urged India to take concrete steps to end the persecution of all religious minorities, “particularly Muslims and Christians”.
“Pakistan reiterates its commitment to a peaceful, just, and enduring resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people,” it said.
The FO urged India to “halt its repressive policies, reverse demographic and legal alterations, restore fundamental freedoms, and engage sincerely in meaningful dialogue”.
“Pakistan will continue to extend moral, political, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their just struggle against foreign occupation,” it added.
The UN experts’ findings had noted that Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
They further highlighted reports of punitive house demolitions, forced evictions and arbitrary displacement, and noted that some detainees were allegedly tortured, held incommunicado, and denied access to lawyers and family members.
“These measures are disproportionate restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” the experts noted.</p><small>2025-11-26 10:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635647-justice-yar-muhammad-sworn-in-as-gb-caretaker-chief-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Yar Muhammad Nasir sworn in as GB caretaker chief minister</strong></a><br><p>

The statement came after multiple media outlets reported  on Tuesday that flight SV278 — operated by Saudia Airlines from Jeddah to Islamabad — narrowly avoided a “major disaster” as the air traffic controller timely prevented the pilot from landing the plane on the wrong runway.
The flight was scheduled to arrive at the airport at 4:05pm, but landed with a delay of more than an hour at 5:13pm, according to the tracker flightradar24.
In a statement issued today, the PAA said, “The recent go-around at Islamabad International Airport involving flight SV728 was a standard and internationally practised safety measure, executed precisely as per established protocols.”
A go-around is a “safe, routine manoeuvre” that discontinues the landing approach and returns the aircraft to an altitude and configuration for another safe attempt, according to the United States’ Federal Aviation Administration.
“Go-arounds are common, non-emergency procedures carried out to ensure the highest level of operational safety,” it explained.
In its statement, the PAA requested media outlets to “avoid presenting routine aviation procedures in a sensational manner”.
“Sensational reporting may unintentionally create unnecessary concern among the travelling public and lead to misunderstandings about normal aviation practices,” the authority cautioned.
It affirmed that the PAA “values the media’s role as an important partner in keeping the public informed and encourages continued responsible reporting based on verified information”.
“PAA remains committed to transparency and to maintaining the highest safety standards across all airports in Pakistan,” it added.</p><small>2025-11-26 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635642-proclaimed-offender-atc-orders-blocking-omar-ayubs-passport-cnic-in-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>'Proclaimed offender': ATC orders blocking Omar Ayub's passport, CNIC in protest case</strong></a><br><p>

It was South Africa’s first series win in India in 25 years, after bowling the home team out for a dismal 140 in a mammoth chase of 549 on day five in Guwahati.
India suffered their biggest Test defeat by runs and a fifth loss in seven home Tests, having been whitewashed 3-0 by New Zealand last year.
Off-spinner Harmer, 36, returned figures of 6-37 as South Africa clinched a Test series in India for only the second time, the first in 2000 under Hansie Cronje.
“Winning a Test match and series in India is very special,” said left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 6-48 in India’s first innings after smashing a quickfire 93 with the bat.
Jansen, named player of the match, added: “Very well done to everyone for putting their hand up and making this happen.”
India lost the opening Test in Kolkata inside three days on a pitch with uneven bounce before South Africa once again beat the hosts in their own game of spin on a batting-friendly track.
Ravindra Jadeja resisted with 54 before Keshav Maharaj had him stumped and the spinner soon got the final wicket of Mohammed Siraj, with Jansen pulling off a stunning catch in the deep.
The visitors had declared their second innings on 260-5 on day four to hand India a record chase but the hosts’ batting once again failed and they never threatened to get close.
“Whether you’re playing at home or away cricket demands that determination and the extra effort,” said India captain Rishabh Pant.
“As a batting unit you need to capitalise on certain moments. As a team we didn’t do that.”
India rode their luck early in the day when Jansen had Sai Sudharsan caught behind but the delivery was declared a no-ball after the bowler overstepped. The batter was on four.
In the next over Kuldeep Yadav survived a reprieve on four when Aiden Markram dropped him at first slip off Harmer.
But the relief was short-lived for India as a relentless Harmer bowled Kuldeep for five for the first wicket of the day.
Three balls later the spinner dismissed Dhruv Jurel for two and soon sent back Pant for 13 as India slumped to 58-5.
The batters fell like nine pins on a pitch where South Africa posted 489 after they elected to bat.
India were bundled out for 201 to concede a first-innings lead of 288 but South Africa did not enforce the follow-on and decided to bat again.
South African all-rounder Senuran Muthusamy led the batting charge in the first innings with 109, his maiden Test century.</p><small>2025-11-26 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261218450d552be.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957477/retired-judge-yar-muhammad-sworn-in-as-gb-caretaker-chief-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Retired judge Yar Muhammad sworn in as GB caretaker chief minister</strong></a><br><p>Retired judge Yar Muhammad was sworn in on Wednesday as the caretaker chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistan in a ceremony held at the Governor House.
He was appointed for the role by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the GB Assembly completed its five-year tenure on Monday. According to the GB Order 2018, elections must be held within 60 days following the completion of the assembly’s tenure.
GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah administered the oath to Muhammad in a ceremony attended by federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and Safron Engineer Amir Muqam, other political figures, judges and local administration officials.
During the ceremony, GB Services Department Secretary Usman Ahmed read out the notification for the appointment of the caretaker chief minister.
Assembly’s tenure
After the GB Assembly elections on Nov 15, 2020 across 24 constituencies, the PTI had formed the government in the region with Khalid Khurshid elected as the chief minister.
However, following Khurshid’s disqualification in July 2023, a coalition government was formed by members of the PTI, PPP and PML-N parties with Haji Gulbar Khan — an estranged PTI member — as the new chief minister of the region.
Khurshid was disqualified by the GB Chief Court for allegedly obtaining a license from the GB Bar Council on the basis of a fake degree.
During its five-year tenure, the GB Assembly adopted 63 bills. The assembly also passed 114 resolutions on various issues, including a demand that the federal government declare GB a provisional province of Pakistan.
A dozen bills were passed in the final session of the assembly on Monday before the completion of its tenure at midnight.</p><small>2025-11-26 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26122322a6b4427.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957473/integral-inalienable-part-of-india-new-delhi-responds-to-beijings-claim-over-arunachal-pradesh' target='_blank'><strong>‘Integral, inalienable part of India’: New Delhi responds to Beijing’s claim over Arunachal Pradesh</strong></a><br><p>New Delhi has asserted that Arunachal Pradesh is an “integral part” of India in response to Beijing’s claim over the territory as the two countries rowed over the detention of an Indian citizen at Shanghai Airport.
On Tuesday, India had issued a demarche to China over the detention of Prema Wangjom Thongdok, a UK-based woman from Arunachal Pradesh, at the Shanghai airport. Thongdok had said immigration officials had held for 18 hours and “mocked” her by saying the region was not a part of India.
China says Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Zangnan, is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.
Responding to queries during a press briefing on Tuesday, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning had said that “Zangnan is China’s territory”.
“The Chinese side has never recognised the so-called ‘Arunachal Pradesh’ illegally set up by India,” she said. She further stated there was “no so-called ‘detaining’ or ‘harassing’” of the woman at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport, adding that authorities carried out checks in accordance with the law.
 






Subsequently, in a statement issued on Tuesday night, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said New Delhi had seen China’s remarks about Thongdok’s “arbitrary detention”.
“Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a self-evident fact. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality,” Jaiswal said.
 






On the woman’s detention, he said the issue had been taken up strongly with the Chinese authorities, who he said “have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel”.
“The actions by the Chinese authorities also violate their own regulations that allow visa-free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,” the spokesperson noted.
Arunachal Pradesh woman’s ‘detention’ amidst attempts to improve ties
The recent row between the two countries, who have been cautiously strengthening ties after four years of hostility, erupted after Thongdok claimed she was held back at the Shanghai airport for 18 hours on November 21.
Thongdok said she was an Indian citizen who had been residing in the United Kingdom for about 14 years, and was detained by immigration staff at the Shanghai airport, where she had a layover during her trip from London to Japan.
“They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh, which they claimed is Chinese territory,” she had said on social media platform X on November 23, referring to Chinese immigration officials and China Eastern Airlines’ staff.
 






She had reached out to the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing, resulting in officials intervening to help her leave the country.
Thongdok said the immigration officials declared her visa unacceptable and “mocked” her, saying Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India. “You’re Chinese, you’re not Indian,” the woman quoted them as saying.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China in August for the first time in seven years, where he and Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged that the two countries were partners, not rivals.
India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s.
Ties were ruptured after a 2020 clash in the Himalayas, in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat.</p><small>2025-11-26 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/261220451704932.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957475/israeli-army-announces-new-operation-in-northern-west-bank' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli army announces new operation in northern West Bank</strong></a><br><p>The Israeli military on Wednesday announced a new “counterterrorism” operation in the north of the occupied West Bank.
The military and internal security service said in a joint statement that they “began operating as part of a broad counterterrorism operation in the area of northern Samaria”, using the Israeli biblical term for part of the West Bank.
In response to a question from AFP, the Israeli army said the operation was new and not part of its earlier operation launched in January 2025, which, according to Israel, was initiated to counter terrorism. The operation primarily targets Palestinian refugee camps.
Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has soared since the Hamas attack on Israel triggered the Gaza war in October 2023.
It has not ceased despite the fragile truce in effect in Gaza since October 10.
Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank since the start of the onslaught in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures.
At least 44 Israelis, including both soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations, according to official Israeli figures.</p><small>2025-11-26 07:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635619-pakistan-re-elected-to-executive-body-of-chemical-weapons-watchdog-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan re-elected to executive body of chemical weapons watchdog: FO</strong></a><br><p>

In September, the Central Development Working Party had cleared the Rs49.9bn project for the Zhob and Mula river basins. At the time, participants were told the project would be financed through an ADB loan of $148m (78.99pc), an ADB grant of $5m (2.67pc), and a government contribution of $34.37m (18.34pc).
On Tuesday, the Exe­cutive Committee of the Nat­­i­onal Economic Cou­ncil had approved the project.
In the press release issued today, the ADB said the additional funds would support the completion of critical components of the project, including the Churi Infiltration Gallery subproject, the development of Siri Toi Dam command area, and watershed management activities, adding that work on the components had been “previously delayed due to budgetary constraints”.
“These components are vital for enhancing irrigation efficiency, promoting sustainable water use, and mitigating soil erosion caused by floods,” it said.
The press release further said: “An innovative piped water distribution network will also be introduced in the Siri Toi command area.
“This system promises higher efficiency, reduced conveyance losses, and improved service delivery compared to traditional open-channel systems.”
The ADB projected that once completed, Siri Toi Dam in the Zhob River basin would provide a storage capacity of 36 million cubic metres of water, significantly improving reliable water availability.
“This will ensure efficient and equitable water delivery for domestic and agricultural use across 16,592 hectares of the command area, including 1,839 hectares under khushkaba (rainwater harvesting) farming systems,” the press release said.
It further detailed that “to enhance long-term sustainability, the project incorporates watershed management measures such as afforestation, soil conservation, and the construction of check dams, to reduce land degradation and improve flood management within the dam’s catchment area”.
It further stated that additional financing for BWRDSP was aimed at building on the “project’s earlier successes in strengthening irrigation infrastructure and improving water resource management in Balochistan”.
The press release highlighted that the province faced “severe water scarcity, exacerbated by economic challenges and climate impacts”.
“Agriculture, which forms the backbone of Balochistan’s economy, contributes nearly two-thirds of the province’s economic output and employs 60 per cent of its 13 million residents. However, frequent droughts, water management capacity issues, and climate vulnerabilities have put livelihoods at significant risk, with regional poverty rates nearly twice the national average.”
The press release quoted ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan as saying: “The ongoing project, for which additional financing has been approved, focuses on the Zhob and Mula river basins. This project supports livelihoods and creates improved economic opportunities, particularly for women engaged in agriculture.”
The project is cofinanced by the Japan Fund for Prosperous and Resilient Asia and the Pacific — funded by the Government of Japan through ADB — and the High Level Technology Fund, the press release said.
It added that the project “aims to establish a climate-resilient and sustainable water resource management system in Balochistan, ensuring long-term benefits for the province”.</p><small>2025-11-26 07:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26111604b5da20e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957474/professionalism-of-armed-forces-during-marka-i-haq-enhanced-pakistans-global-stature-says-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Professionalism of armed forces during Marka-i-Haq enhanced Pakistan’s global stature, says COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday lauded the “professionalism, resolve and commitment” demonstrated by the armed forces during Marka-i-Haq, stressing that it “enhanced” Pakistan’s global stature.
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India, from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, as Marka-i-Haq in May.
The army chief made the remarks while addressing the participants of the National Security Workshop–27 who visited the General Headquarters (GHQ), according to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“The professionalism, resolve, and commitment of the armed forces displayed during Marka-i-Haq [have] enhanced the global stature of Pakistan,” the army chief was quoted as saying.
In his remarks, the army chief stressed that Pakistan was a “country of consequence and is destined to reach its rightful place in the comity of nations”.
“Our greatest strength lies in national unity, and together, we shall defeat the nefarious designs of our foes,” the ISPR quoted him as saying.
According to the ISPR, the army chief also highlighted the “fluid regional environment shaped by heightened geopolitical competition, cross-border terrorism, and hybrid threats”.
“He underscored that despite complex challenges, including externally supported militancy and information-centric warfare, Pakistan’s armed forces, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement institutions continue to demonstrate unwavering professionalism and resolve to safeguard national security,” the ISPR said.
COAS Munir also reiterated that the territorial integrity, security, and protection of every Pakistani citizen was “paramount for the Pakistan Army and will not be compromised under any circumstances”.
He also reaffirmed the army’s commitment to supporting federal and provincial governments.
“Coordinated national efforts and institutional synergy are vital for lasting peace, stability, and prosperity,” the ISPR quoted him as saying.
Meanwhile, the ISPR statement said the participants of the workshop were briefed on ongoing national efforts against illegal activities, including the crackdown on smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and organised criminal networks that adversely impact security.
It added that updates were also shared on enhanced border controls and the repatriation of illegal foreigners, aimed at maintaining internal order and protecting national interests.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
After New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later raising the tally to seven.
Following tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted.</p><small>2025-11-26 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635624-field-marshal-reaffirms-armys-support-to-federal-provincial-govts-for-coordinated-national-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal reaffirms army's support to Centre, provincial govts for 'coordinated national efforts'</strong></a><br><p>

The top Iranian security official, who began a two-day visit to Islamabad by holding talks with President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, is scheduled to meet Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik on Wednesday.
The visit is focused on reviewing bilateral ties, pursuing pending agreements and discussing regional developments, including those in the Muslim world.
After landing in Islamabad, Mr Larijani told reporters “changing conditions of the region necessitate enhanced cooperation across multiple fields”, while noting Pakistan’s “privileged position” in shaping regional security.

Gaza peace on the table as Larijani discusses regional, global issues with civilian leadership; will meet army, intel chiefs today

The trip comes as Iran expressed reservations about US President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, now moving into its implementation phase after being adopted by the UN Security Council on Nov 17. The initiative includes an international stabilisation force for Gaza, a move Tehran fears could entrench foreign military involvement. Pakistan has supported the plan and is seen as a potential contributor to the force.
Though the various statements on the top security council official’s meetings by the Pakistani side didn’t say much on discussions about Gaza peace plan, the Iranian official in a post on X at the end of the day, conveyed greetings of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to “honourable people of Pakistan” for supporting Iran during the 12-day war with Israel and said it showed the “firm and principled thinking of the Pakistani people”.
 






In what many saw a possible balance act, Mr Larijani in the same post on X said, “We extend our gratitude to the government, the parliament, and the armed forces of Pakistan.”
The PM Office said Shehbaz Sharif and Mr Larijani exchanged views on major regional and international developments and “stressed the importance of coordinated efforts to promote peace and stability.”
 






The premier expressed appreciation for Iran’s engagement, while the Iranian official thanked Pakistan for its role in advocating dialogue and diplomacy for peaceful settlement of disputes, possibly a reference to Islamabad’s role of a messenger between Tehran and Washington.
The two sides agreed that a delegation led by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would soon visit Tehran to advance cooperation, particularly in agriculture and connectivity.
The Foreign Office said Mr Dar and Mr Larijani reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and expanding cooperation on regional and international issues.
 






In comments to Iran’s state news agency IRNA, the deputy premier said he held “detailed and frank discussions” with Mr Larijani, adding he was “very pleased” with the visit. The security official told IRNA the talks covered economic progress, ways to expand cooperation, and regional and international developments.
During his call on President Zardari, cooperation in energy, commerce and railways were discussed.
 






 
 

The president underscored Pakistan’s desire to boost trade with Iran and pressed for strengthening the rail link to facilitate commerce and travel, especially for religious pilgrims. He emphasised the need for a “mutually workable solution” on the stalled Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline, citing Pakistan’s growing energy needs, and welcomed technical discussions held recently in Islamabad.
Mr Larijani said directives issued after the Iranian President Pezeshkian’s visit to Pakistan in August including for preferential access for Pakistani products had set the path toward achieving the $10 billion bilateral trade target.
Mr Larijani also met NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq at Parliament House, where they discussed parliamentary cooperation, regional security and opportunities for expanded economic engagement.
 






His trip follows a visit by Iranian parliament speaker Bagher Ghalibaf last month, marking the second senior Iranian delegation to Islamabad in weeks and underscoring intensified diplomatic activity between the neighbors amid shifting regional dynamics.
Iran and Pakistan share a long, often tense border where terrorist groups have carried out attacks on both sides, prompting growing security coordination. Tehran has also offered to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul as cross-border tensions are rising.
Published in Dawn, November 26th, 2025</p><small>2025-11-26 02:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26071952005fa79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957384/imf-slams-fiscal-mismanagement' target='_blank'><strong>IMF slams fiscal mismanagement</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Despite running its 24th programme chiefly with the Ministry of Finance (MoF), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is still dissatisfied over Pakistan’s weak financial management, cash monitoring and accountability for public resource allocation and has demanded improved fiscal management and transparency in Single Treasury Account (TSA) flows to minimise misuse of taxpayer money for individual and political whims.
“Despite some improvement in the last two years, Pakistan has consistently struggled with weak budget credibility, which has generated several macro-critical governance weaknesses … there are a number of shortcomings in public investment management resulting in failure to protect funding for approved projects over the project life cycle and major project delays and cost increases in projects”, said the IMF in its Governance and Corruption Diagnosis Assessment (GCDA).
It demanded immediate steps, within three to six months, to enhance cash management by implementing the overarching sectorisation exercise to unify decision-making around TSA institutional coverage, while also improving analytical capabilities and adopting a forward-looking approach to cash forecasting.

Calls for immediate steps to combat corruption and inefficiencies

It said the situation was compounded by a weak TSA framework without a firm institutional coverage decision that undermined effective control over the government’s cash balances. “The current set-up in debt management involves multiple entities with overlapping roles and responsibilities, which complicates decision-making and coordination”, it said, elaborating that mechanisms for monitoring and accountability were weak, including in the management of financial and non-financial assets, and state-owned enterprises. “Institutions that use budgetary resources but are designed to operate outside of standard fiscal accountability constraints undermine other state institutions and increase corruption risks”, it said.
Moreover, fiscal and economic governance vulnerabilities reflect a persistent gap between formal policy and actual practice, creating space for the misuse of public authority for private gain. Parliamentary oversight of spending is weakened by substantial differences between approved budgets and actual expenditures. For example, the National Assembly approved Rs9.4 trillion in expenditure overruns in 2024-25, five times higher than the previous year.
On top of that, constituency development funds under the direct control of legislators further skew capital investments and complicate oversight. “Current arrangements for cash management, debt management, and the management of state financial and non-financial assets remain insufficient, providing officials with substantial discretion”.
The fund noted that a weak TSA framework without a firm institutional coverage decision undermined effective control over the government’s cash balances, leading to inefficiencies in the use of public funds and weakening overall budget authority. Without centralised oversight, fragmented cash holdings across various accounts can result in idle balances that are not optimally utilised for government priorities.
“Moreover, the lack of transparency raises concerns about potential foregone interest revenue for the federal budget. It remains unclear who benefits from the interest earned on accounts held by federal government entities in commercial banks, and whether such earnings are captured in the national budget”, said the IMF and emphasised that addressing these gaps was essential to strengthen fiscal discipline, reduce corruption vulnerabilities, and enhance the efficiency of public financial management.
It acknowledged that the MoF had set up the institutional framework for cash and debt management, but the implementation of the framework has been weak in practice. It said the legal changes over the years required a high-level Cash Coordination Committee (CCC) and a Cash Forecasting Unit (CFU) at the MoF to consolidate external commercial borrowing and domestic wholesale borrowing functions. The CFU was currently not operational as it was not staffed, and CCC met on an ad-hoc basis with long intervals rather than monthly as intended, and did not align with the principle that it should be systematically assessing cash forecasts and reviewing the cash buffer policy, constraining the effective borrowing programme.
Pointing to weak budget controls, the IMF said that several stages of the expenditure process were carried out manually and are not presently captured in the Financial Accounting and Budgeting System, presenting governance vulnerabilities in budget execution.
