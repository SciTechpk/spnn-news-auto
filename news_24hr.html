<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/684cd1e30dc7e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917036/budget-democratisation' target='_blank'><strong>Budget democratisation</strong></a><br><p>UNTIL about a decade ago, elected representatives in our national and provincial assemblies had no real role in the budget process except for collectively lending their names to the document’s approval.
The drafting of budget proposals had, of course, always been the exclusive domain of the executive, but even when proposals were laid before the elected Houses, there was hardly any meaningful opportunity for members to comprehend, let alone scrutinise, the budget documents running into thousands of printed pages, as the budget debate lasted for an average of just 10 days in the National Assembly (NA) and even less in the provincial assemblies.
Standing committees of the legislatures were never involved in the process and there was no formal channel for legislators to give recommendations to the government at the drafting stage. In brief, the budget process in Pakistan was one of the least democratic about 10 years ago.
 
 

Although serious weaknesses persist, there are at least three ways in which Pakistan’s budget process has been significantly democratised over the past decade or so.
The first serious democratic reform in the federal budget process was introduced in 2013, when the NA amended its Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business and added sub-sections 6 and 7 to Rule 201, requiring each ministry and division of the federal government to share its Public Sector Development Programme with the relevant standing committee of the NA by Jan 31 each year. Each committee, under the amended rule, is then required to forward its recommendations on the PSDP to the concerned ministry or division by March 1, giving one month to each committee to formulate and share its recommendations. Each ministry or division is supposed to incorporate the recommended amendments in the PSDP.

There is ample room to introduce more democratic provisions in the budget processes.

Ministries and divisions are under obligation to inform each committee whether or not the recommendations have been incorporated in the PSDP. In case they have not, the reasons are to be furnished by the ministry or division to the concerned committee.
Although implementation of the amended rule has not been ideal during the past 11 years, public representatives now have a window of opportunity to shape the PSDP, which is the most important part of the budget from the point of view of parliamentarians and their constituents. The provincial assemblies have yet to amend their rules to replicate the procedure for public representatives to give their recommendations for provincial annual development plans.
 
 

A landmark law, the Public Finance Managem­ent Act was passed by parliament in 2019 to prescribe the federal budget formulation process in detail. The Act was amended in 2020 to make it even more comprehensive. Prior to PFMA, there was no governing law to guide the budget process. This Act, beside many other provisions, made it mandatory for the federal finance minister to present and discuss the Budget Strategy Paper (BSP) containing the basic assumptions and strategies relating to the budget with the standing committees on finance of the NA and Senate and seek the input of elected representatives constituting these committees prior to the detailing of the budget proposals.
Generally, this interaction takes place in April each year after the federal cabinet approves the BSP. It may, however, be more useful if the sequence is reversed by seeking the standing committees’ input to the BSP prior to approval by the cabinet as this will give a greater opportunity to incorporate the committees’ point of view in the BSP. Even in its present form, the law provides a significant opportunity to elected representatives to review the key basis and parameters of the coming budget and make a contribution in shaping it. It is also important to frame a similar law in the provinces as well as to involve the finance standing committees in finalising the provincial budgets.
There are, however, two key aspects of the budget process in which three out of the four provincial assemblies have taken the lead over parliament. Three assemblies (Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan) had amended their rules to hold pre-budget sessions every year to solicit MPAs’ input before finalising the document.
During the session, which lasts from three to five days, officials of the provincial finance department and planning and development board are present to take notes on the MPAs’ ideas. Following the session, a report is typically submitted by the government to the assembly giving information on the action taken on each point raised by the MPAs. The Punjab Assembly was the first one to amend its rules in 2010, followed by Sindh in 2013, and Balochistan in 2018.
 
 

The three provincial assemblies also took an innovative step to amend their rules for holding quarterly post-budget sessions to monitor the implementation of the actual receipts and spending and compare it with the budgeted figures. It is expected that not only KP Assembly but also the NA will shortly follow the example of the three other provincial assemblies to incorporate the pre- and post-budget sessions in their rules.
Although parliament and the provincial assemblies have made efforts to democratise the budget processes in the past decade, there is ample room to introduce more democratic provisions. For example, parliament should seriously consider amending Articles 84 and 124 of the Constitution, which respectively give the federal and provincial governments carte blanche to modify the budget approved by the assemblies. These articles, in fact, run counter to the democratic principle of parliamentary sovereignty.
The NA and provincial assemblies may also amend their rules to increase the duration of the budget sessions so that the time for the budget debate is extended from the present average 10 days to around 45 days to facilitate the standing committees in scrutinising the budget related to their ministries.

Hossein Salami (left) and Amir Ali Hajizadeh

ISRAEL struck dozens of targets, including nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, across Iran on Friday, killing a number of senior military commanders in what it called ‘Operation Rising Lion’, BBC News reported.
The Israeli attacks also targeted a number of other influential figures linked to Iran’s nuclear programmes, including six nuclear scientists, according to the Tasnim news agency.
Friday’s strikes killed Iran’s highest-ranking military officer, armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri, and the head of the powerful Islamic Revol­utionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, Iranian media reported.
Dozens of civilians, including children, have also been reported killed while state television said a senior adviser to Khamenei was also wounded.
Mohammad Bagheri
Bagheri was the highest ranking military officer in the country, as the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces — which includes both the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and the Iranian army.
Bagheri joined the IRGC in 1980 at the age of 20 and, alongside his brother, helped establish its intelligence unit during the Iran-Iraq war.
Abdolrahim Mousavi has been appointed the new chief of staff of the armed forces, Iranian state news agency Irna said. He does not come from within the ranks of the IRGC, being an army general.
Hossein Salami
Commander-in-chief of the IRGC, Salami joined the force in 1980 during the Iran-Iraq war, and went on to become a deputy commander in 2009, before progressing to commander in 2019.
 

Mohammad Bagheri

Mohammad Pakpour has been appointed as the new commander of the IRGC, Iranian state media reported.
Gholamali Rashid
Rashid was the head of the IRGC’s Khatam-al Anbiya Central Headquarters, which coordinates joint Iranian military operations.
Since Rashid’s death, Ali Shadmani has been appointed the emergency command’s new leader, according to Iranian state media.
Amir Ali Hajizadeh
The commander of the IRGC’s Aerospace Force, Hajizadeh was one of the top men in charge of the country’s missile programme.
The IDF said Hajizadeh had gathered in an underground command centre along with the majority of the IRGC’s air force commanders to prepare for an attack on Israel, and was killed in a strike targeting the building.
Nuclear scientists
Fereydoon Abbasi, a nuclear scientist, served as the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation between 2011 and 2013.
A number of other nuclear scientists are also reported by Iranian state media to have been killed. They are: Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was also the head of Azad University in Tehran; Abdulhamid Minouchehr, head of nuclear engineering at Iran’s Shahid Beheshti University; Ahmad Reza Zolfaghari, a nuclear engineering professor at Shahid Beheshti University; and, Amirhossein Feqhi, another nuclear professor at Shahid Beheshti University.

The Zionist state’s attack on Iran, which began early on Friday morning and was continuing at the time these lines were being written, has the potential of setting the already fragile region on fire, and sending the global economy into a tailspin. A large number of fatalities have been reported, including women and children, and residential areas have been hit along with military targets.
 
 

Among the victims have been the Iranian army’s chief of staff, as well as the head of the powerful Pasdaran, along with several senior scientists. Several Iranian cities have been attacked, indicating that Israel had deep intelligence about key Iranian facilities and personnel. It is no wonder that Tehran has termed Israel’s reckless attack a ‘declaration of war’.
Tel Aviv has said it attacked Iran because of the supposed threat it posed to “Israel’s very survival”. This is contrary to the facts. It has been Israel that has constantly been provoking Iran. The bombing of Iranian diplomatic facilities in Damascus as well as the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran last year, which resulted in two separate Iranian missile and drone barrages targeting Israel, are proof.
In fact, Israel has continuously been threatening regional peace for decades by attacking and pillaging other countries. Over the last few years, along with the murderous rampage in Gaza, Israel has attacked Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and now Iran. So Tel Aviv’s ‘self-defence’ alibi is hardly believable. The plain truth is that Israeli behaviour is a threat to world peace.
There has been condemnation of the Israeli attacks from several states, particularly the Muslim bloc. The Pakistani leadership as well as parliament have denounced Tel Aviv’s aggression and expressed solidarity with Tehran.
 
 

Yet others see the aggression differently; for example, US President Donald Trump says the offensive was “excellent” and has boasted that there is more in store. But he has also perplexingly asked Iran to return to the negotiating table. It is unlikely Iran will negotiate with a gun to its head. The Iranian leadership has promised to avenge the attack. It should be remembered that Iran has survived a brutal eight-year war with Iraq, and the Iranians are adept at playing the long game.
Israel has threatened that the attacks will continue for as long as needed; the Iranians may just take them up on the ‘offer’. The world stands at a very dangerous crossroads here. If the US joins in the ‘defence’ of Israel, matters may spiral out of control. The UNSC is meeting to address the issue, and though expectations should be modest, full efforts are needed to stop this new war.

• PIA re-enters privatisation process, confirms finance minister
• Tax on Google, YouTube services increased from 10pc to 15pc
• 4pc tax on commercial rental income deferred
ISLAMABAD: The National Assem­bly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue has approved an increase in the minimum threshold for daily cash withdrawals, raising it from Rs50,000 to Rs75,000 while rejected a separate proposal to impose an additional 2 per cent sales tax on online purchases, signalling resistance to new digital levies amid growing e-commerce activity.
Chaired by MNA Naveed Qamar, the committee also gave its nod to increasing the withholding tax rate on cash withdrawals — from 0.6pc to 0.8pc. However, the committee struck down a parallel proposal to raise the tax from 15pc to 20pc on loan profits earned by banks.
Among other decisions, the committee endorsed the government’s proposal to increase the tax on services provided by digital platforms such as Google and YouTube from 10pc to 15pc. A separate proposal to levy a 4pc tax on rental income from commercial properties, however, was deferred for further deliberation.
The committee also turned down a contentious proposal that would have mandated all sales of Rs200,000 to be conducted through banking channels — a measure critics argued could burden small traders. Meanwhile, it approved an amendment excluding rental income from being adjusted against business losses.
The committee also registered strong opposition to the phased withdrawal of tax exemptions for the former Federally and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (Fata and Pata).
 
 

Terming the move an “economic assassination” of small-scale enterprises in the region, Mr Naveed urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to revisit the decision. He emphasised the need to safeguard livelihoods and stimulate economic recovery in historically underserved areas, directing the FBR to explore avenues for continued fiscal relief tailored to local realities.
A significant time of the committee’s proceedings was consumed by debate over conflicting tax rates proposed for low-income salaried individuals. While Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, in his budget speech, announced a 2.5pc tax rate for annual incomes ranging from Rs600,001 to Rs1.2 million, the Finance Bill 2025 instead reflected a lowered rate of 1pc.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial told the parliamentary committee that the federal cabinet has reversed the proposed tax relief for low-income salaried individuals.
The newly appointed minister of state for finance, Bilal Azhar  Kayani, defended the government’s decision, offering justification for the withdrawal of relief to lower-income salaried individuals. Citing revised estimates, he noted that public sector salaries were raised by 10pc — a significant upward revision from the earlier projection of 6pc.
However, the members observed that the salary bump would benefit only government employees, while the upward tax adjustment would disproportionately impact private sector earners who remain outside the scope of the pay increase.
Mr Qamar voiced concern over the cabinet’s handling of the tax rate increase, questioning the rationale behind approving a higher tax burden on low-income salaried individuals.
FBR transformation plan
Mr Langrial briefed the committee on the FBR transformation plan, whose implementation will start from December.
Some members of the parliamentary committee expressed reservations about the effectiveness of the Faceless Assessment System operational in Karachi, flagging mounting complaints over excessive charges, prolonged processing delays and resultant demurrages.
Lawmakers also raised concerns over the misapplication of the Digital Production Tracking and Digital Invoicing System.
They pointed out persistent errors by the tracking mechanism in differentiating between old, used and scrap materials — an issue they claimed was leading to unwarranted compliance penalties.
In response, the FBR noted ongoing instances where usable goods were allegedly being falsely declared as scrap, suggesting intentional misreporting by some stakeholders.
The FBR chairman informed the parliamentary committee that tax evasion in Pakistan’s cigarette and tobacco sector has reached an alarming Rs295 billion annually.
He said the FBR plans to introduce stricter enforcement mechanisms to curb widespread non-compliance in the industry.
Mr Langrial also highlighted concerns within the cotton and textile sector, noting that sales tax declarations remain significantly underreported.
He also listed several other sectors for low tax payments. He said that there is a tax gap of Rs7.1 trillion in the current fiscal year.
He said that smuggling through the Chagai border in Balochistan remains a major concern, contributing to an estimated Rs500bn in annual revenue losses. He noted tighter enforcement across other border regions and announced plans to introduce a cargo tracking system in the next fiscal year.
To bolster monitoring, digital screening technology will be installed at 22 key Indus River bridges, enabling remote vehicle checks from up to 20 kilometres away. Mr Langrial assured that the system will not hinder legitimate business activity.
Senate committee on finance
Meanwhile, in a separate session of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance, Finance Minister Aurangzeb briefed members on the economic outlook, budget measures and ongoing global challenges.
He confirmed that the World Bank had approved financing for the Reko Diq project, with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) contributing $700 million.
During the meeting, Senators Ahmed and Abdul Qadir from Baloc­histan raised the issue of water scarcity in the province. Senator Ahmed urged the committee that the issue of clean drinking water was even more important than health and education problems.
He demanded the committee complete Kachhi Canal Project in Balochistan, which had been launched 25 years ago.
Mr Aurangzeb told the committee that the budget measures were fully endorsed by the IMF under tax enforcement commitments. He dismissed concerns over hurdles in opening letters of credit, calling such claims “misinformation”.
On privatisation, he acknowledged missed targets but confirmed that Pakistan Inter­na­tional Airlines has re-entered the privatisation process.
Addressing agricultural taxation, he emphasised a shift in narrative — from claims that it could not be imposed to assertions that it it cannot be collected.
“We will collect it — just give us the chance,” he said, adding that provinces will begin agricultural income tax collection from July 1, 2025.
Senators also proposed increasing the retirement age of bureaucrats to ease pension pressures.
In response, Mr Aurangzeb noted that his previous institution had set retirement at 65, and the government would seriously evaluate the idea post-budget.

The missile salvo comes after nearly 80 people, including top army officers, were killed while over 300 were wounded in Iran a day ago as a result of Israel’s strikes on military sites and private residences, according to the country’s UN envoy Saeed Iravani.

What we know so far:

Military officers, scientists, civilians among 78 killed in Israeli strikes on Friday; 320 injured
One dead, ‘some 40’ injured in Israel as Iran launches ‘Operation True Promise 3’ in response
Khamenei appoints new military brass after top commanders, including IRGC chief Hossein Salami, killed
Radiation ‘unchanged’ in Iran’s Natanz area; ‘limited damage’ to Fordo and Isfahan nuclear sites


In the morning, Iran launched a fresh wave of attacks, state media said, after Israel’s military reported it detected inbound missiles from Tehran.
A senior Iranian military official, General Ahmad Vahidi, said “Operation True Promise 3” — as the retaliatory strikes are dubbed — will continue for as long as necessary“, according to Iranian state media IRNA.
 






Air raid sirens and explosions rang out across Israel overnight, with its military calling on residents to take refuge in bomb shelters in the morning.
The Israeli military said dozens of missiles — some intercepted — had been fired in the latest salvos from Iran.
One woman was killed and “some 40 people” were injured by the Iranian strikes, Israel’s Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter said.
“We faced three salvos of ballistic missiles fired from Iran today, about 150 in total,” Leiter told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.
“We expect that the Iranians, who have a considerable volume of ballistic missiles, somewhere in the neighbourhood of 2,000, will continue to fire them,” he said.
“Israel is in war, not with the people of Iran … we are in a war against a regime that is intent on achieving nuclear power,” Leiter said.
He added that Israel wouldn’t know “precisely how much” damage it could inflict on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure until its forces “continue and complete the campaign”. “Ask me that question in four or five days,” the envoy added.
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz took shelter inside a bunker, conducting a situation assessment after Iran’s retaliatory strikes, an Israeli official told CNN.
 






Smoke was billowing above skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, an AFP journalist reported, as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said it had attacked dozens of targets in Israel.
Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to the aftermath of Iranian missile strikes, including working to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.
Resident Chen Gabizon told AFP he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert notification.
“After a few minutes, we just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,” he said.

The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) said the missiles targeted Israel’s airbases that were used as launch sites for attacks on Iran, the Tasnim news agency reported.
“In this operation, the missile and drone units of the IRGC Aerospace Force employed a combination of precision-guided and smart missile systems to strike military centres, airbases used as launch sites for the criminal aggression against our nation,” the IRGC statement said.
It added that other targets included “military-industrial facilities instrumental in producing missiles and other weaponry for the Zionist regime’s army to commit crimes against the resistant nations of the region — particularly the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza”.
“Field reports, satellite imagery and intelligence intercepts confirm the effective impact of dozens of ballistic missiles on strategic targets in occupied Palestine. Despite the enemy’s claims of interception, they failed to counter the waves of missile attacks launched by the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the statement added.
A senior Iranian official told CNN that Iran would intensify its attacks on Israel and target the regional bases of any country that “attempts to defend the regime”.
Toll from Israeli attacks rises to 78
In Tehran earlier today, fire and heavy smoke billowed from Mehrabad airport, an AFP journalist said, as local media reported a blast in the area.
Iran’s ambassador to the UN said on Friday that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.
 


Iran said earlier it had activated its air-defence system and explosions could be heard across the capital.
Dozens of people took to the streets of Tehran overnight to cheer their country’s military response, with some waving national flags and chanting anti-Israel slogans.
Separately, IRNA said the country’s forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid, although Israel denied this.
Iranian outlets Mehr and Tasnim also reported that a female Israeli pilot was captured. However, Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson of the Israeli military, denied the reports, according to Times of Israel.
After a day of back-and-forth bombardments, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the two nations to cease fire.
“Enough escalation. Time to stop. Peace and diplomacy must prevail,” he wrote on X earlier today.
 






Calls for dialogue
US officials said they were helping Israel defend against the missile attacks, even as Washington insisted it had nothing to do with Israel’s strikes on Iran.
US President Donald Trump agreed on a call with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that “dialogue and diplomacy” were needed to calm the crisis, Starmer’s office said.
Trump also spoke with Netanyahu on Friday, US officials said, without elaborating.
Iran’s missile salvo came hours after Israel said its widespread air raids had killed several top Iranian generals, including most of the senior leadership of the Revolutionary Guards’ air force.
It had launched several rounds of strikes that hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and air bases.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel “to ruin” during a televised address.
 






In Israel, Netanyahu issued a statement calling on the Iranian public to unite against their own government. But he also warned more attacks were coming.
“In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime’s most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal,” Netanyahu said.
While stressing that it was not involved in the Israeli attacks, the United States warned Iran not to attack its personnel or interests.
Tehran nevertheless said Washington would be “responsible for consequences”.
Commanders killed
The strikes killed Iran’s highest-ranking military officer, armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri, and the head of the Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami, Iranian media reported.
Khamenei swiftly appointed new commanders to replace those killed. Major General Seyyed Abdulrahim Mousavi was appointed to replace Bagheri, while Major Gen Mohammad Pakpour was chosen as the new head of the Revolutionary Guards, according to IRNA. Gen Amir Hatami was made the new army chief.
 
 

“The senior chain of command of the air force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps had assembled in an underground command centre to prepare for an attack on the State of Israel,” the Israeli military said, adding that its attacks had killed most of them.
Iran confirmed that the Guards’ aerospace commander had been killed, along with “a group of brave and dedicated fighters”.
AFP images showed a gaping hole in the side of a Tehran residential building that appeared to have sustained a targeted strike.
Tasnim news agency said six nuclear scientists were among the dead.
Oil prices surged while stocks sank on the Israeli strikes.
‘We knew everything’: Trump still hopeful for deal
The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday’s sixth round of talks planned between the United States and Iran to seek a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman.
After the first wave of strikes on Friday, Trump urged Iran to “make a deal” while noting that a 60-day ultimatum had expired. He added that Washington was “hoping to get back to the negotiating table”.
 


After months of urging Israel not to strike Iran while he worked toward a nuclear deal, Trump told Reuters in a phone interview on Friday that he and his team had known the attacks were coming — and still saw room for an accord.
“We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran [from] humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,” Trump said.
“They can still work out a deal, however, it’s not too late,” he added.
Trump’s shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he called “excellent” and “very successful” in a series of media interviews on Friday, offered one of the most striking examples yet of how he conducts high-stakes negotiations through both frank public rhetoric and behind-the-scenes maneuovers.

Iran confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site “remained unchanged”.
“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran’s spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi.
Iran said there was only limited damage to the Fordo and Isfahan nuclear sites.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Israel’s strikes against Iran a “unilateral action” and said Washington was not involved, while also urging Tehran not to target US interests or personnel in the region.
However, a US official told AFP that Washington was helping Israel defend against Iranian missile attacks.
 
 

The United States and other Western governments have repeatedly accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapon, an ambition it has consistently denied.
Netanyahu said Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the “point of no return” on its nuclear programme.
Israel had called for global action after the IAEA accused Iran on Thursday of non-compliance with its obligations.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 per cent, far above the 3.67pc limit set by a largely moribund 2015 agreement with major powers, but still short of the 90pc threshold needed for a nuclear warhead.</p><small>2025-06-14 04:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/140839113f67762.jpg?r=084036' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917045/pakistan-warns-unsc-of-grave-threat-to-world-peace-posed-by-israeli-strikes-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan warns UNSC of ‘grave threat to world peace’ posed by Israeli strikes on Iran</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear and military facilities constitute a “grave danger and a serious threat” to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council during an emergency session convened on Friday, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Israel on Friday launched widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iran’s ambassador told the UN that 78 people had been killed and 320 wounded in the first wave of strikes by Israel.  In a message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, Reuters reported. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.
In his remarks, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate” aggression by Israel against Iran, reaffirming that Islamabad stood in resolute solidarity with the Iranian government and people.
 






Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi requested the Security Council meeting, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.
Among those supporting the request for a meeting were Algeria, Pakistan, China and Russia.
Amid escalating tensions, the Pakistani envoy urged the Security Council to discharge its responsibility to uphold international law and stop this aggression immediately.
Ambassador Asim strongly called for the resolution of the crisis through dialogue and diplomacy
Briefing the Security Council, UN Under-Secretary-General for political affairs Rosemary DiCarlo, told ambassadors that the repercussions of the attacks were already reverberating.
“I reaffirm the Secretary-General’s condemnation of any military escalation in the Middle East,” she said, urging both Israel and Iran to exercise maximum restraint and “avoid at all costs a descent into deeper and wider regional conflict”.
She also noted that the military escalation came just as “some significant diplomatic developments” were unfolding, including the planned resumption of United States-Iranian talks in Oman at the weekend. Latest reports indicate that Iran will no longer attend.
DiCarlo urged parties to stay the diplomatic course.
“A peaceful resolution through negotiations remains the best means to ensure the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme,” she said.
“We must at all costs avoid a growing conflagration which would have enormous global consequences.”
Also briefing the Council, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi said his agency was in constant contact with the Iranian Nuclear Regulatory Authority to assess the status of affected facilities and determine broader impacts on nuclear safety and security.
He stressed that nuclear sites must never be targeted — under any circumstances.
“Such attacks have serious implications for nuclear security, nuclear safety and safeguards, as well as regional and international peace and security,” Grossi said.
He stands ready to travel to the region at the earliest opportunity, he added, to assess the situation and support safety, security and non-proliferation efforts in Iran.
“It is clear that the only sustainable path forward for Iran, for Israel, the entire region and the international community is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability and cooperation.”
Grossi concluded by offering the IAEA as a neutral platform where “facts prevail over rhetoric” and where technical engagement replace escalation.
“I reaffirm my personal and the agency’s readiness to facilitate dialogue and support efforts that promote transparency, security and the peaceful resolution of nuclear issues in Iran.”
Pakistan came out strongly in support of Iran’s right to self-defence, following Israeli military strikes on Iranian targets, distinguishing its position from most other regional and global powers.
The Pakistani position was more than a diplomatic footnote; rather a bold assertion of principle in a region accustomed to cautious ambiguity.
 






When the Foreign Office described Isr­­ael’s action as “unjustified and illegitim­a­­te aggression” that violated “the soverei­g­nty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran” and flouted the UN Charter, it did not stop at condemnation.
It explicitly mentioned Article 51: “Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.” The statement further urged the world to “hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”
In a call with the Iranian foreign minister, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Islamabad’s strong support to Iran for the sake of peace in the region.
He also conveyed the deepest sympathies on the loss of many precious lives in Israeli attacks on Iranian territory.</p><small>2025-06-14 04:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/684cc14e05eae.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917024/review-of-salary-hike-offered-after-outcry' target='_blank'><strong>Review of salary hike offered after outcry</strong></a><br><p>• Ayaz Sadiq distances himself from unprecedented increase in salaries of speaker, Senate chairman
• NA’s sound system develops fault ‘due to PTI’s protest’
• Opposition continues to face ‘censorship’ as budget debate begins
ISLAMABAD: A key government minister on Friday announced that a decision to award an unprecedented and massive increase in the salaries and allowances of the National Assembly speaker, Senate chairman and their deputies as well as federal ministers, could be reviewed and potentially even withdrawn in the wake of widespread and ‘somewhat justified’ criticism.
The announcement was made by Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on the floor of the National Assembly during a debate on the federal budget, after Speaker Ayaz Sadiq distanced himself from the ongoing controversy, clarifying that neither he nor the finance committee of the house had any role in this decision.
The speaker even declared that he would have no objection, if the decision to increase the salaries was withdrawn.
The speaker gave the “explanation” while interrupting the opening speech of Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan when the latter was about to mention the issue.
“Let me give an explanation. Neither the finance committee [of the house] nor the National Assembly has made this decision. Those who have done so, they can do so,” he said without elaborating, adding that those who could make a decision about the salaries of ministers, speaker or the Senate chairman, could even withdraw it.
“There is no harm, if it [the raise] is withdrawn,” he said. However, the speaker said that the decision to increase the salaries of the members of the parliament had been made by the house finance committee, thus implying that it could not be reversed.
Though, the speaker had not named any individual or institution, the parliamentary affairs minister while mentioning the issue, admitted that it was his ministry which had prepared a summary for the increase in the salaries of the ministers and the custodians of the two houses, stating that the summary was approved by the federal cabinet.
This assertion from the minister came as a surprise for many amid reports that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken a notice of the increase in the salaries and a harsh criticism from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who is also a member of the federal cabinet.
Quoting sources, the media had reported on Friday that the prime minister’s action came in the wake of widespread public criticism over the increase in the salaries of the custodians of the two houses from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3 million a month, besides huge increase in the allowance bringing the total financial benefit to over Rs2m a month.
However, during the post-budget press conference on June 11, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had defended the steep hikes — some as large as 550 per cent — in the salaries of the speaker, Senate chairman and ministers.
The parliamentary affairs minister in his speech declared that since there was a criticism in the “concerned quarters”, therefore, the decision to increase the salaries could be “reviewed and withdrawn”, stating “it is not impracticable.”
After taking the whole responsibility on his shoulder by admitting that his ministry had sent the summary to the federal cabinet for the approval, Dr Chaudhry then stated that altho­ugh there was no big financial impact of the increase in the salaries of the MPs, ministers and the NA speaker and the Senate chairman, the government was ready to “rectify” the decision.
 
 

“Due to the general feelings among the government employees and those [sections of the society] living below the poverty line having no resources and for whom we have not added so much in the budget as our hands are tied, we can try to rectify [the decision] which has sent a bad message and caused a bad taste”, said the minister.
Dr Chaudhry, however, said they had to make this accumulative increase in the salaries as there had been no raise in the salaries of the MPs and the ministers in proportionate to the constant increase in the salaries of the government employees in the previous budgets over the past many years.
Faulty sound system
Earlier, the proceedings of the lower house of the parliament on the opening day of the bud­get debate were marked by disruptions and a controversy when the speaker anno­unced that the microphones and sound system inst­alled on the first four rows of the house were not functioning after developing a technical fault due to the protest of the opposition PTI members during the budget speech of the finance minister on June 10.
The speaker also stated that the repair of the system would cost upto Rs350m.
Interestingly, the opposition members had to come to the opposition leader’s seat to deliver their speeches as the NA Secretariat staff had made special arrangements to provide mic facility to the opposition members.
Initially, the proceedings of the house were not telecast live on the national as well as official social media websites, including YouTube and Facebook, but as soon as the opposition leader finished his speech and the parliamentary affairs minister took the floor, the live transmission of the proceedings began on the official social media channels.

The speeches of the opposition members were completely censored.

The parliamentary reporters also faced difficulties in the coverage of the proceedings as the National Assembly Secretariat staff had removed the speakers placed at the press lounge, besides the transmission was also not available on the screens installed there. The journalists had to sit in the press gallery to take notes of the speeches.
Due to complete censoring of their speeches, some of the opposition members, including Omar Ayub Khan, were seen making videos from their mobile phones during the proceedings.
Budget debate
Most of the speakers from both sides of the aisle delivered political speeches, instead of talking about budgetary measures.
All front treasury benches remained empty most of the time during the opposition leader’s speech in which he harshly criticised the government’s economic policies.
The opposition leader in his speech also talked about the alleged political victimisation of the opposition, and demanded immediate release of the “political prisoners, including Imran Khan.”
Alleging that there was no independent media and judiciary in the country, Mr Khan demanded fresh elections in the country after carrying out some poll reforms.

The budget also includes a 10 per cent increase in salaries of government employees and a 7pc rise in pensions.
The budget session, however, was marred by an unusual stand-off between the provincial government and Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who did not return a summary to call the budget session, forcing the government to convene the session through a requisition instead — perhaps for the first time in the province’s parliamentary history.
KP’s newly appointed finance minister, Aftab Alam Afridi, presented the tax-free budget, which projects federal receipts as the main revenue source, totalling Rs1.506tr. This includes Rs1.147tr from the federal divisible pool, Rs137.9bn under the one per cent share for the war on terror, Rs57.11bn in straight transfers, Rs58.15bn in windfall levy on oil, Rs34.5bn in net hydel profit (NHP) and Rs71.4bn in NHP arrears.
 
 

The province’s own tax and non-tax revenues are projected at Rs129bn, comprising Rs83.5bn in tax revenue and Rs45.5bn in non-tax revenue. Other receipts are estimated at Rs10.25bn.
Revenue estimates for the merged tribal areas have been set at Rs292.3bn, including Rs80bn as a current budgetary grant, Rs63bn in additional demand, Rs39bn under the Annual Development Prog­ra­mme (ADP), Rs50bn through the Accelerated Imp­lemen­ta­tion Programme (AIP), and Rs17bn for the rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons.
KP has also projected Rs42.7bn under its 3pc share from other provinces for merged areas — a head under which it hasn’t received a single penny so far since the Fata merger.
Foreign project loans are ex­­pected to amount to Rs171.83bn, alongside Rs5.3bn in foreign grants. Additionally, Rs3.2bn is expected under the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
Expenditure estimates
Total expenditure for the year is projected at Rs1.96tr, including Rs1.41tr in current expenditure and Rs547bn for development.
The current expenditure for settled districts has been set at Rs1.25tr, including Rs288.3bn for provincial salaries, Rs288.6bn for district salaries, Rs190.2bn for pensions, Rs334bn for non-salary items and Rs65.6bn for medical teaching institutions.
For the merged districts, Rs160bn has been allocated for current expenditure.
Development outlay
The Rs547bn development outlay marks the highest in the province’s history. It includes Rs195bn for provincial ADP, Rs39bn for district ADP, Rs39bn for merged areas, Rs92.7bn under AIP, Rs177.1bn for donor-funded projects, and Rs3.47bn under federal PSDP.
Presenting the budget, Mr Afridi announced a reduction in stamp duty from 2pc to 1pc on the allotment and transfer of residential and commercial properties.
Residential and commercial properties up to 4.9 marlas will now be exempt from property tax. The hotel bed tax has been cut from 10pc to 7pc, while registration and token taxes for environment-friendly vehicles will also be waived.
He stressed that no new taxes would be imposed on the merged districts or the former Provincially Administered Tribal Areas (Pata).
Health, education
He said the health budget has been increased by 19pc to Rs276bn from Rs232bn. The health card allocation will also be increased from Rs28bn to Rs35bn — a 25pc hike.
The budget for elementary and secondary education has risen by 11pc to Rs363bn from Rs327bn. An additional Rs5bn has been allocated under the education emergency initiative to enrol out-of-school children.
The budget for higher education has seen a 39pc boost, increasing from Rs36bn to Rs50bn. The universities’ budget has been raised from Rs3bn to Rs10bn.
The KP government has also announced a 10pc pay increase for current employees and a 7pc raise in pensions for retired staff.
The minimum wage has been raised from Rs36,000 to Rs40,000 per month. This sta­nds in contrast to the federal government’s budget, which did not announce any increase in the minimum wage.
Asked earlier why no hike was proposed, Federal Fin­ance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the industry in particular and the private sector in general were not willing to pay even the previous minimum wage announced by the government.

The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the clandestine nature of the operations, described secret and lengthy preparations that went into an attack that sent oil prices sharply higher on fears of regional escalation.
Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters shortly before the attack had been dismissive about any imminent action and repeatedly said talk of strikes was just “psychological pressure” to influence US-Iranian nuclear negotiations that were due on Sunday.
Iran has not given a detailed account of what its Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called “unlawful and cowardly attacks”, but it has promised a harsh response. Iran’s mission at the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel’s covert operation and other subterfuge related to the attacks.
Ahead of the strike, Israel gave the impression its focus was still on US diplomacy towards a nuclear deal with Iran, briefing journalists that its spy chief would go to Washington before the next negotiations.
Instead, Israel said it sent 200 warplanes to conduct a wave of air strikes across Iran before dawn on Friday, hitting nuclear facilities and missile factories, and killing military commanders and nuclear scientists, in a culmination of its efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
Iran says its nuclear programme is purely civilian.
The Israeli security source said Israel’s military and Mossad had worked for years on the intelligence needed for the strikes, which killed the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps among others.
 
 

The security source said Mossad commandos had covertly deployed weapons across Iran, including explosive drones that were launched at a surface-to-surface missile base near Tehran.
The Mossad commandos also fired precision-guided weapons systems at Iranian surface-to-air missile systems as the Israeli attack got underway, reducing the threat to Israeli warplanes.
A grainy black and white video distributed by Mossad showed what it said was the organisation’s operational force — two camouflaged figures crouched in what looks like desert terrain, deploying the precision weapons system meant to destroy Iran’s air defence systems.
Some of the operation’s components would have taken years to be put together, said Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS).
The decision to strike Iran was made on Monday, the same day Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump spoke by phone, when Netanyahu, Defence Minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir decided the operation would begin on Friday, said a second source, an Israeli defence official.
Their discussion was held after the conversation between Trump and Netanyahu, a third official, close to Netanyahu, said.
Press briefings
The final green light was given by Netanyahu’s security cabinet, which convened on Thursday night.
In the days leading up to the strikes, Israel played out a ploy to create the impression an attack was not imminent, according to a fourth source, also an Israeli official.
 
 

False reports suggesting that a rift between Israel and the United States had emerged during Netanyahu and Trump’s phone call on Monday were not denied, the fourth source said.
A press release about a visit by Katz, Zamir and the head of Israel’s Air Force Tomer Bar to an air force base mentioned Gaza, Yemen and Lebanon — but not Iran.
The fourth source said that the ruse included misleading information given in press briefings. As the attack unfolded in the early hours of Friday, some Israeli journalists pointed to one such briefing, according to which Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Mossad Head David Barnea were to be sent to Washington ahead of the next round of nuclear talks on Sunday.
Dermer later appeared seated with Netanyahu at Israel’s defence headquarters bunker in Tel Aviv, in a video distributed by the prime minister’s office.
A fifth, military source said that Israel had been able to surprise Iran but since the operation was not over, there could be “difficult days” ahead.
Iran, which fired ballistic missiles at Israel when they traded blows last year, has promised “harsh punishment” in response to the attack. Israel said it had intercepted many of the 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.</p><small>2025-06-14 03:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609109-pakistan-strongly-condemns-israels-aggression-against-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan strongly condemns Israel's aggression against Iran</strong></a><br><p>

Iranian media outlet Tehran Times reported that 100 missiles were fired at Israel from Shiraz in the initial phase.
“TV footages show that Israel’s capital Tel Aviv is in disarray and people seeking shelter as ballistic missiles are raining down on the occupied territories. The legitimate retaliatory attacks by Iran’s military is called ‘Operation True Promise 3’,” the report added.
 






It said the attack was launched as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was addressing the nation. Khamenei said that Israel initiated a war and said it will not be allowed to do “hit and run” attacks without grave consequences.
“The Zionist regime (Israel) will not remain unscathed from the consequences of its crime. The Iranian nation must be guaranteed that our response will not be half-measured,” Khamenei said in a statement
 






Khamenei said that Israel’s deadly attacks on his country will “bring it to ruin”, vowing retaliation.
“The armed forces of the Islamic Republic will inflict heavy blows upon this malevolent enemy,” Khamenei said, adding that the consequences of the Israeli attack “will bring it to ruin”.

Key developments so far:

Iran launches response as part of “Operation True Promise 3”
Israel launches more attacks in evening
Iran says top commanders, including Hossein Salami, killed
Israel says military intercepting drones fired from Iran in response
At least 95 casualties so far, including women and children
Iran’s supreme leader appoints new military commanders
Trump urges Iran to make deal, warns of more “death and destruction”
Iran says at least six nuclear scientists killed in attacks


Iran’s state news agency IRNA said the attack was the “beginning of Iran’s crushing response to the Zionist regime”.
It added: “A decisive response to the brutal attack by the Zionist regime began minutes ago with the firing of hundreds of various ballistic missiles towards the occupied territories.”
 






Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said they launched an attack on dozens of targets in Israel.
“The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps … has executed its decisive and precise response against tens of targets, military centres and airbases of the usurping Zionist regime in the occupied territories,” the Guards said in a statement carried by state media.
The United States is helping Israel intercept Iranian missiles, Axios reported, citing a senior US official.
Al Jazeera reported citing Israeli newspaper Haaretz that as per emergency services, 15 people were wounded in central Israel, including one with moderate injuries.
Images on Israel’s Channel 12 showed what appeared to be a building hit by a missile.
Iranian news agency Mehr and IRNA reported that an Iranian missile hit Israel’s Ministry of War as well, the former citing Israel’s Channel 13.
 






Air raid sirens sounded in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and loud blasts were heard, AFP journalists reported, as the Israeli military said it had detected a missile launched from Iran.
“A short while ago, sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification of missiles from Iran toward the State of Israel,” the military said in a statement, with AFP journalists reporting booms over Jerusalem, similar to those heard during past interceptions.
 






A thick plume of smoke billowed over the coastal Israeli city of Tel Aviv, an AFP journalist reported. The smoke towered over the city’s skyscrapers as blasts echoed across the city, the journalist said.
Israel’s military sirens sounded across the country after the new salvo of Iranian missiles was identified.
Israel’s Home Front Command application, used to warn the public of incoming projectiles, said that sirens sounded across the country.
 






Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to several “major” incidents resulting from an Iranian missile attack, including efforts to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.
“Firefighting crews are handling several major incidents, mainly in the Dan region” around Tel Aviv, a statement said, adding that “firefighters are working in a high-rise building to rescue trapped individuals and extinguish a fire, as well as responding to two additional destruction sites. “
Later, the military said Israelis could leave protected spaces but urged them to stay nearby.
“Following the situational assessment, the Home Front Command published that it is now permitted to leave protected spaces in all areas across the country and to remain near them,” the military said in a statement.
Separately, Iranian state media also said the country’s forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid.
“At least two Israeli fighter jets were shot down in Iranian skies,” IRNA reported, without elaborating.
 






Iranian outlets Mehr and Tasnim reported that a female Israeli pilot was captured. However, Al Jazeera reported that Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson of the Israeli military, denied the reports.
Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran earlier today, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders, and that this was the start of a “prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon”.
Iran promised a harsh response and the Israeli military said Iran launched around 100 drones, with air defences intercepting them outside Israeli territory, while neighbouring Jordan said it targeted drones and missiles that violated its airspace.
But around 0800 GMT (1pm PKT), Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all the drones had been neutralised.
In a letter to the United Nations, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the attack as a “declaration of war” and called on the UNSC to immediately address the issue, the ministry said.
Araghchi requested the meeting in a letter to the 15-member body, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.
He wrote: “Iran reaffirms its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter and will respond decisively and proportionately to these unlawful and cowardly acts.”
Article 51 of the UN Charter covers the individual or collective right of states to self-defence against armed attack.
An Israeli security source said Israeli Mossad commandos had operated deep inside the Islamic Republic before the attack and the Israeli spy agency and military had led a series of covert operations against Iran’s strategic missile array.

Israel also established an attack-drone base near Tehran, the source added.
The military said it had carried out a large-scale strike against Iran’s air defences, destroying “dozens of radars and surface-to-air missile launchers”. Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.

Evening attacks by Israel
The Iranian retaliation came some time after Tehran’s defence system intercepted fresh projectiles as several explosions were heard in the city and its surrounding areas in the evening, more than 12 hours after a massive wave of Israeli attacks on the country.
“There were reports of explosions heard in the west of Tehran province,” in the cities of Shahriar and Malard and around the neighbourhood of Chitgar in Tehran city, state news agency IRNA reported, while Mehr agency reported a blast in Pakdasht southeast of the capital.
 


IRNA said Tehran’s defences were activated. “News received indicates that enemy projectiles have been intercepted by Tehran’s defences,” it said in a post on X.
 


Meanwhile, the Mehr news agency said a “massive explosion” was heard in Isfahan, a major city in central Iran, in a province that is home to several nuclear facilities.
“A few minutes ago, a massive explosion was heard in Isfahan,” Mehr said without immediately elaborating.
The Israeli military said it struck Iran’s nuclear facility in Isfahan as it pressed on with its strikes on the Islamic Republic’s military and nuclear sites. “I can now confirm that we struck the nuclear facility in Isfahan. The operation is still ongoing,” military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin told journalists.
He said Israel had so far struck more than 200 targets across Iran since it began the wave of air strikes. “We are continuing to strike,” Defrin added.
The Israeli military said its strike on Iran’s nuclear facility in Isfahan dismantled infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium.
Israeli “fighter jets completed a strike on the Iranian regime’s nuclear site in the Isfahan area”, a military statement said, adding that “the strike dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories, and additional infrastructure.”
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iranian authorities said that nuclear sites at Fordow and Isfahan were struck in attacks.
“At present, the Iranian authorities are informing us of attacks on two other facilities, namely the Fordow fuel enrichment plant, and at Isfahan, [where a] fuel plate fabrication plant, a fuel manufacturing plant, a uranium conversion facility … are located,” Rafael Grossi told the UN Security Council.
However, Iran’s atomic energy agency said there was limited damage to the Fordow nuclear site south of Tehran and another site in the country’s centre after Israeli attacks.
“The damage was limited to areas that did not cause any urban damage in the case of Fordow … In Isfahan, there were also attacks on several points, which were related to warehouses that caught fire,” said agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that “the damage was not extensive and there is no cause for concern in terms of contamination”.
Israel’s army chief said the military was keeping up “full force” to achieve its goals after launching the wave of strikes.
“We are continuing with full force, at a high pace, in order to meet the goals we have set for ourselves,” Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said in a statement.
“There will be difficult moments, we need to be prepared for the range of scenarios we have planned for, very high readiness and discipline are required on the home front. “
The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting at 1900 GMT (12am PKT) following Israel’s wave of airstrikes, current presidency Guyana announced.
The meeting was requested by Iran, and supported by Russia and China, a diplomatic source told AFP.
Iran said Israel’s deadly strikes on its military and nuclear facilities were a “declaration of war” and called on the UNSC to act.
Iranian military leaders killed
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said its top commander, Hossein Salami, had been killed and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Several children were killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, they said.
At least 95 people were wounded in Israel’s attack and taken to medical centres in 12 different provinces that were targeted, national emergency services spokesperson Mojtaba Khaledi told state TV.
The IRGC confirmed later in the day that its aerospace commander had been killed with fellow officers in an Israeli air strike on their command centre.
“Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps aerospace force Major General Amirali Hajizadeh … along with a group of brave and dedicated fighters of this force, were martyred” in an Israeli attack on their command centre, the Guards said in a statement.
 
 

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei swiftly appointed new Revolutionary Guards and armed forces chiefs to replace those killed.
In separate decrees, Khamenei named Mohammad Pakpour to replace Salami as IRGC commander and Abdolrahim Mousavi to replace Mohammad Bagheri as chief of the armed forces general staff. Major General Ali Shademani was appointed as the commander of the Khatam al-Anbia Headquarters.

Pakpour threatened to open “the gates of hell” in retaliation for Israel’s attacks that killed his predecessor.
“In retribution for the blood of our fallen commanders, scientists and citizens, the gates of hell will soon be opened upon this child-killing regime,” Pakpour said of Israel in a message carried by state news agency IRNA.
A senior adviser to Khamenei was wounded during the attack, state media reported.
“Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to the supreme leader… was injured in today’s attack by the Zionist regime,” according to state TV.
Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message: “We are at a decisive moment in Israel’s history.
“Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”

Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive “a bitter fate for itself”.
An Israeli military official said Israel was striking “dozens” of nuclear and military targets, including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official claimed Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.

The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil-producing region.
Iran’s foreign ministry summoned the ambassador of Switzerland, which represents US interests in Tehran, state media said.
“During the meeting, the Islamic Republic of Iran conveyed its deep outrage and strong protest over this act of aggression by Israel and the support extended to it by the United States,” IRNA reported.
Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel’s Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, Axios reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Iran’s strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.
At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel’s attacks, media outlets in the Islamic Republic reported.
Iran’s Tasnim news agency named the six scientists, including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.
The organisation added that most of the damage from Israeli air strikes targeting its underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was at ground level.
“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said the organisation’s spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that there had been “no casualties” at the facility where the enrichment centrifuges are housed underground.
A fresh round of explosions was heard in northwestern Iran, state television reported, following Israel’s wave of early morning strikes on multiple cities.
“A few minutes ago, new explosions were heard in East Azerbaijan,” the broadcaster said, as the Tasnim news agency said an earlier wave of strikes had hit 10 sites in the province, killing at least three people.
The death toll from Israeli strikes in northwestern Iran increased to 18, state media reported, revising an earlier figure of eight dead.
“So far, as a result of this brutal aggression, 18 individuals have attained martyrdom and 35 of our fellow citizens have been injured,” IRNA quoted East Azerbaijan provincial authorities as saying, reporting attacks on 11 locations in the province.
A loud blast was heard later in the afternoon near a military airbase in Iran’s western Hamedan province, state media reported.
“A few hours ago, a loud blast was heard near Hamedan,” more than 300 kilometres from Tehran, the IRNA state news agency said, adding that “it was heard near the Nojeh airbase”.
Meanwhile, Israel’s embassy to Sweden said that Israel would close its diplomatic missions around the world in light of recent developments and that consular services would not be provided. It did not say how long the missions would be closed.
Pezeshkian administration: Iran will write the ending to this story
The administration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has released a statement, announcing that Iran will avenge the blood of every single individual killed in Israeli strikes, IRNA reported.
“With a savage regime as this,” the statement read, referring to Israel, “one shall not speak but with the language of power.”
“As of this moment, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government has begun the necessary defensive, political and legal measures to make the illegitimate Israel regret [its aggression] and will deny the Israelis a moment’s rest,” it said.
“The world now better understands Iran’s insistence on its right to enrichment and nuclear technology and missile power.”
Iran has in the past 200 years never started a war, the statement said, but would not hesitate for a second to defend itself.
“The ending to this story will be written by Iran.”
Pezeshkian said that Iran would make Israel “regret” its deadly attack.
“The Iranian nation and the country’s officials will not remain silent in the face of this crime, and the legitimate and powerful response of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make the enemy regret its foolish act,” Pezeshkian said in a video statement aired on state TV.

Trump urges Iran to make a deal
US President Donald Trump urged Iran to “make a deal”, warning that there will be more “death and destruction” after Israel launched the deadly strikes.
“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left … just do it before it’s too late,” he said.
He said there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.
“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
Speaking to ABC News, Trump added the Israeli attack on Iran was “excellent” and warned there was much more to come.
“I think it’s been excellent. We gave them a chance and they didn’t take it. They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as you’re going to get hit. And there’s more to come. A lot more,” Trump was quoted as saying by an ABC reporter on X.
The outlet reported that when asked if the US participated in the attack in any way, Trump responded by saying, “I don’t want to comment on that.”
 






Trump told Reuters in a phone interview that it was unclear if Iran still has a nuclear programme following Israeli strikes on the country.
Trump told Reuters the US still has nuclear talks planned with Iran on Sunday, but that he is not sure if they will still take place. He said it was not too late for Iran to make a deal.
“I tried to save Iran humiliation and death,” Trump said.
He said he is not concerned about a regional war breaking out as a result of Israel’s strikes.
Earlier in the day, Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with Fox News after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.
“We will see,” Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.
Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday that an Israeli strike on Iran “could very well happen” but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.
The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told Reuters.
Iran’s armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally, the US, would pay a “heavy price” for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.
While the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the country was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.
“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement.
“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” he added.
 






The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should “shelter in place until further notice”.
Lebanese group Hezbollah condemned Israel’s wave of strikes, warning that they threaten to “ignite the region”.
“This enemy adheres to no logic or laws and knows only the language of killing, fire, and destruction,” Hezbollah said in a statement that condemned the strikes as a “brutal” aggression.
UN nuclear watchdog chief ready to travel to Iran to assess situation
UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he was ready to travel to Iran to assess the situation there after Israel’s strikes hit the sprawling nuclear complex at Natanz.
In a statement to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors, Grossi said the other main enrichment centre in Iran, Fordow, was not hit, and neither was another nuclear facility in Esfahan, citing Iranian authorities.
There are no elevated radiation levels at Natanz, he added.
“I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. I reiterate that any military action that jeopardises the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region, and beyond,” Grossi said in his statement.
“I have indicated to the respective authorities my readiness to travel at the earliest to assess the situation and ensure safety, security and non-proliferation in Iran.”
He did not say what the extent of the damage at Natanz was or what parts of the site were hit. The site includes a vast underground uranium enrichment plant and a smaller, above-ground pilot enrichment plant.
Iran is enriching to up to 60 per cent purity, close to the roughly 90pc of weapons-grade, at the pilot plant, but it is producing smaller quantities of that material there than at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain that military experts have said would be difficult for Israel to destroy through bombardment.
“Despite the current military actions and heightened tensions, it is clear that the only sustainable path forward — for Iran, for Israel, the entire region, and the international community — is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability, and cooperation,” Grossi said.
Earlier today, Grossi said that nuclear facilities “must never be attacked”.
The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels was observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.
“Iranian authorities have informed the IAEA … that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was “among targets” of the strikes.
 






It added that Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.
An exceptional meeting of the watchdog’s Board of Governors will be held on Monday to discuss Israel’s strikes after at least one country on the board requested one at Friday’s regular, quarterly session of the body, diplomats said.
Any country on the board of the IAEA can call a meeting under its rules.
Iran, which is not on the board, requested a meeting and its call was supported by board members Russia, China and Venezuela, diplomats said. The diplomats gave differing accounts as to which board member was the first to clearly make the request.
The meeting will start at 10am (0800 GMT) on Monday, diplomats at Friday’s closed-door meeting said before any public announcement of the emergency meeting.
There was no sign of any push for a resolution or other action on Monday by the 35-nation board, said the IAEA’s top policymaking body.
However, Iran’s atomic energy organisation confirmed in a statement that its nuclear facility in Natanz had been damaged, but investigations had not shown any radioactive or chemical contamination outside the site.
“The attack has damaged several parts of the facility. Investigations are ongoing to assess the extent of damages,” the statement said.
 






Meanwhile, Israel’s neighbouring country Jordan’s military said it intercepted drones and missiles that had violated the kingdom’s airspace.
“Royal Air Force aircraft and air defence systems intercepted on Friday morning a number of missiles and drones that entered Jordanian airspace,” a military statement said.
Air raid sirens sounded in the Jordanian capital after Israel’s attack on Iran, while the public security directorate urged people to stay at home.
“Adhere to the guidelines and stay in your homes,” said an announcement on loudspeakers in Amman.
Jordan had earlier said it would not allow its airspace to be violated and vowed not to become a “battleground” in any regional conflict. “Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told AFP.
The government condemned Israel’s attack, with foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah warning of “the consequences of such escalatory actions”.
Jordan also called the attack “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of a United Nations member state and a clear breach of international law and the UN Charter”.
Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel’s air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.
“Following the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.
Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and “prepared across all borders”.
“We are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,” he said.
Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding a “marathon of calls” with counterparts around the world regarding Israel’s attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which condemned Israel’s strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned “in the strongest possible terms today’s unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel”.
“I convey my deepest sympathies to the Iranian people on the loss of lives in this attack. This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region,” he said in a post on X.
“We urge the international community and the United Nations to take urgent steps to prevent any further escalation that could imperil regional and global peace.”
 






Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Pakistan’s strong support for Iran in a telephonic conversation with FM Bagchi.
 






The National Assembly also unanimously passed a resolution against Israel’s attack on Iran, which was jointly presented by the government and opposition.

The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.
“The secretary general asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,” Haq said.
Flight disruptions, airspace closure

Emirates airline said flights to and from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Iran had been cancelled after Israel’s strikes sparking concerns of a wider escalation.
Several flights scheduled for Friday and one Tehran flight on Saturday were listed as cancelled on the airline’s website, with the Dubai International Airport also reporting that “some flights at [DXB] and DWC — Al Maktoum International have been cancelled or delayed due to airspace closures over Iran, Iraq, and Syria” in a statement on X.

The United Arab Emirates capital’s international airport warned of flight disruptions.
“Flight disruptions are expected through today at Zayed International Airport. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for the latest status of their flights before travelling to the airport,” the Abu Dhabi airport said in a statement on X.
 






Qatar Airways said it had temporarily cancelled flights to Iran and Iraq “due to [the] current situation in the region”, the airline said in a statement.
German airline Lufthansa also said it had suspended all flights to and from Tehran.
“Lufthansa Group flights to and from Tehran will be suspended until further notice due to the current situation,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding it would also avoid Iranian, Iraqi and Israeli airspace for now.
Air France said it was suspending its flights to and From Tel Aviv “until further notice” and was “closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East in real-time,” a spokesman for the French airline told AFP, adding that “the safety of its customers and crews is its absolute priority.”
Air India diverted or called back 16 flights between India and London and cities in Canada and the United States “due to the emerging situation in Iran”.
The New Delhi-Vienna and Mumbai-London flights were about to enter Iranian airspace when Israel launched its attack, forcing the planes to turn back to their origin, according to aircraft tracker Flight Aware.
Iraq also closed its airspace. “The ministry of transport closes Iraqi airspace and suspends air traffic at all Iraqi airports,” the Iraq News Agency reported.
It filed a complaint later with the UN Security Council over Israel’s “violation of Iraqi airspace” in a major attack on Iran, Baghdad’s foreign ministry said.
“These practices constitute a flagrant violation of Iraq’s sovereignty,” the ministry said, calling on “the Security Council to assume its responsibilities” and act to “prevent the recurrence of such violations”.
Nuclear talks
US and Iranian officials were scheduled to hold a sixth round of talks on Tehran’s escalating uranium enrichment programme in Oman on Sunday, according to officials from both countries and their Omani mediators.
A US official said those talks were still scheduled to proceed despite the Israeli attack.
The Israeli military said that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was “approaching the point of no return” in the development of a nuclear weapon.
“In recent months, this programme has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.
A source familiar with US intelligence reports said there had been no recent change in the US intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei had not authorised the restarting of the nuclear weapons programme that was shuttered in 2003.

The government recently approved a fivefold increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker, taking it to Rs1.3 million a month. A May 29 notification revealed that the Senate chairman and NA speaker’s salaries have been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50pc of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance. The hike will take effect from January 2025.
“I have full respect for the defence minister. I have nothing to do with my salary increase,” Gilani told reporters at the Senate building when asked about the hike amid an economic crisis and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s criticism of the move.
The PPP stalwart said the decision regarding the raise will be made by the government. When asked if he would refuse the salary hike, he replied, “I didn’t say about withdrawing. I have no connection with it.”
Gilani added he was not consulted when the hike was approved.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken notice of the increase in the salaries of the National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman and sought a report from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.
The decision has drawn criticism from within the ruling PML-N as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif publicly criticised the move. In a post on X, the senior PML-N leader termed the massive hike in salaries a “financial obscenity, urging lawmakers to “keep in mind the life of a common man.”
During an appearance on Geo TV show ‘Capital Talk’ hosted by Hamid Mir, the defence minister defended his stance, saying that while the hike will not have a significant financial impact, it reflected poorly on the image of the ruling elite and the parliament.
He said the salary hike was approved by the National Assembly’s finance committee despite government resistance. When asked if the prime minister opposed the move, Asif said it was “logical” to assume so. He added that the salary increase was not included in the budget.
The defence minister said the ruling elite should practice austerity and simplicity, noting that the prime minister does not receive a salary and poses no burden on the exchequer. However, Asif defended the increased expenditures of the President’s House and PM’s Office.
On the other hand, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb defended the steep hikes in the salaries of parliamentarians.
During the post-budget press conference on Wednesday, he insisted the hikes should be seen in the context that the salaries were last adjusted in 2016, compared to annual increases in the wages of employees in public and private sectors in line with inflation and other factors.
“Had these been adjusted on an an­­n­ual basis, there would have been no sudden jump,” he said.
Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had earlier slammed the pay raise, calling it “incomprehensible” and lacking moral justification.
In a post on X, Rafique said: “A sudden increase of many times in the salaries of the Chairman Senate and Speaker National Assembly and a 50 per cent increase in allowance is an incomprehensible move.”</p><small>2025-06-13 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609059-indias-suspension-of-iwt-threatens-regional-peace-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>India's suspension of IWT threatens regional peace: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

A former student killed ten people and himself at a secondary school in Graz on Tuesday in the worst school shooting in Austria’s modern history, sending shockwaves through the country which declared three days of national mourning.
In a statement, the Foreign Office said it was “deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at the secondary school in Graz that resulted in several casualties with many injured.”
The foreign office extended “deepest condolences to the families and loved ones and wish a swift and full recovery for the injured.”
“Pakistan stands with the people and government of Austria in this hour,” the statement added.
Introvert, online shooting games
Austrian police described the shooter as an introvert who had largely withdrawn from the outside world before he carefully planned the attack, Reuters reported.
Police found discarded plans for a bomb attack and a non-functional pipe bomb during a search of his home after the shooting in Graz, the capital of the state of Styria.
Police are still trying to establish a motive, but Michael Lohnegger, head of Styria’s criminal investigation office, said findings indicated the man was very introverted and that his great passion was online first-person shooting games.
“He led an extremely withdrawn life, he didn’t want to take part in activities in normal life outside in the real world, he preferred to withdraw into the virtual space,” Lohnegger told reporters.
Police said the rampage at the school lasted about seven minutes and that the man shot himself in the head in a toilet about 10 minutes after beginning the attack. A few minutes earlier, the man entered the school with a rucksack, and then went into a bathroom to prepare for his assault.
The shooter posted on social media from the building just before he shot dead 10 people and then killed himself this week, Austrian newspapers reported on Friday.
Newspapers Heute and Kronen Zeitung published details of a photo the young man apparently took inside a toilet cubicle with a timestamp minutes before police said the attack began in the school in Graz, a city in the southern state of Styria. The photo was published on X, they said.
Kronen Zeitung said the man had an interest in the 1999 US Columbine school massacre in Colorado carried out by two teenage shooters and that he apparently used a photo of one of the pair on his profile with his online gaming pseudonym.
Heute said the man had also published pictures of the pistol and the shotgun he would go on to use during the shooting on other social media.
Police have been scouring the perpetrator’s electronic devices, and said on Thursday that they had not discovered any video of the high school shooting on his mobile phone. The shooter was an introverted fan of online shooting games, criminal investigators said.</p><small>2025-06-13 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609023-sindh-announces-12-salary-hike-8-pension-increase' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh announces 12% salary hike, 8% pension increase</strong></a><br><p>

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision does not mean that the court will ultimately agree with Trump, but it does leave the command of the Guard with the president for now.
Earlier on Thursday, San Francisco-based US District Judge Charles Breyer found that Trump’s deployment of the Guard was unlawful. Breyer’s 36-page ruling had ordered the National Guard to return to the control of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had brought the case.
It was a short-lived victory for Newsom, as Breyer’s order was paused about two and a half hours later. Asked for a comment, Newsom’s press office referred to the governor’s statement after the initial ruling and noted that the appeals court put a temporary pause on the ruling but did not reverse it.
“I’m confident, on the basis of the review of the 36 pages — absolutely it will stand,” Newsom said of the district judge’s order. Trump welcomed the ruling in a social media post on Friday.
The three-judge appeals court panel consisted of two judges appointed by Trump in his first term and one judge who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden. The panel said it would hold a hearing on Tuesday to consider the merits of Breyer’s order.
The court’s action called an administrative stay, gives the appeals judges additional time to consider the Trump administration’s request to block Breyer’s order while litigation in the case continues.
Trump summoned the National Guard on Saturday in response to protests that had broken out over immigration raids, then on Monday ordered the US Marines to support the Guard.
A battalion of 700 US Marines is expected to arrive on Friday, marking an extraordinary use of military forces to support civilian police operations within the United States.
The troops have stood guard at a federal detention centre in downtown Los Angeles where many of the protests have taken place in a show of solidarity for immigrants detained inside. The protests so far have been mostly peaceful, punctuated by incidents of violence, and restricted to a few city blocks.
The Guard had also accompanied Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on operations to detain immigrants.
In his ruling, Breyer wrote that the presence of the troops in the city was itself inflaming tensions with protesters — a contention made by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, among others — and depriving the state of the ability to use the Guard for other purposes.
Mayor wants ICE out of LA
Bass on Thursday called on ICE officers to stand down from the intensified series of raids that led to the protests, saying the local economy could be harmed as immigrants stayed home from work and school for fear of being snatched off the streets.
“The peace that we need to have happen needs to begin in Washington, and we need to stop the raids,” Bass told a press conference as supporters flanking her broke out in a chant of “Stop the raids.”
“Peace begins with ICE leaving Los Angeles,” said Bass, who has imposed a nighttime curfew over one square mile (2.5 square km) of downtown LA.
Bass spoke after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged to “liberate” Los Angeles at a press conference that was dramatically interrupted when federal agents dragged Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla out of the room, forced him to the ground and handcuffed him.
The court battle and press conference scuffle underscored the political polarisation generated by Trump’s hardline approach to immigration enforcement and expansive use of presidential power.
Trump is carrying out a campaign promise to deport immigrants, employing forceful tactics consistent with the norm-breaking political style that got him elected twice. Democrats have said the use of military force was unnecessary and an example of Trump’s authoritarianism.
Between the rulings, Newsom said the National Guard would be redeployed to its previous tasks, including border security, preparing for wildfires and countering drug smuggling.
But the Trump administration immediately appealed the judge’s order, calling Breyer’s ruling “an extraordinary intrusion on the President’s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.”
Trump justified the deployment of troops by characterizing the protests in Los Angeles as a “rebellion,” but Breyer said in his temporary restraining order that the protests fell far short of that legal standard.
“The Court is troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants’ argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion,” Breyer wrote.
Trump on Friday reiterated his comments that if he had not ordered the National Guard the city would be in flames, writing: “We saved LA.”</p><small>2025-06-13 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/13165750c2c7db7.png?r=165930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916931/pakistans-cities-sizzle-under-extreme-hot-weather-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s cities sizzle under extreme hot weather: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The country experienced extremely hot and dry weather on Friday with the perceived or ‘Feels Like’ temperature crossing 50 degrees Celsius in four cities.
Cities in Punjab recorded reported high temperature exceeding 40°C amid no let-up in the extreme heatwave that has engulfed the country since last week. The heatwave could subside as the Met Office has forecast gusty winds and rain in the northern and central parts of the country from Friday (today) to Monday.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, the highest current temperature was recorded in Sibbi at 47°C with extremely hot and dry weather and humidity levels of seven per cent.
Karachi recorded a temperature of 39°C at 2pm with a humidity level of 48pc. However, the perceived temperature was recorded at 50.4°C. The Met Office heat index warns of danger with probable risk of heatstroke, cramps, and exhaustion at temperatures from 41-54°C.
 






The temperature in Bahawalpur was recorded as 46°C, but the perceived temperature reached 55.8°C — the highest in the country. The heat index warns of “extreme danger” with imminent risk of heatstroke at temperatures above 54°C.
Cities recorded the following current temperatures: Faisalabad (46°C), Sargodha (46°C), Dera Ismail Khan (45°C), Multan (45°C), Lahore (44°C), Sialkot (43°C), Islamabad (43°C),  Rawalpindi (42°C),  Peshawar (41°C), Muzaffarabad (40°C), Quetta (35°C) and Gilgit (30°C).
However, the perceived temperature in Sialkot and Lahore was 51.4°C and 51.1°C, respectively. Other cities also reported hot weather with the ‘Feel likes’ temperature in DI Khan at 49.6°C, 48.4°C in Faisalabad and Sargodha, Multan with 47.9°C, Islamabad with 44.4°C and Rawalpindi with 41.2°C.
Several parts of Pakistan are currently experiencing an intense spell of extreme heat, with temperatures soaring well above normal across many regions.

The 12th session of Pak-UAE JMC is being held following a hiatus of 13 years after it was scheduled in October 2024. The 11th session was held in Islamabad from 6-7 November 2013.
“Dar chaired a high-level meeting that discussed advancing key bilateral initiatives, formalising collaboration in existing sectors, exploring new avenues for cooperation, and attracting mutually beneficial UAE investments in priority areas,” the FO statement said.
“The deputy prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to strengthening Pak-UAE economic and trade relations.”
 






The meeting was attended by federal secretaries of economic affairs, commerce, maritime affairs, interior, inter-provincial coordination, national heritage, and health, along with senior officials from relevant ministries and departments, and special assistant Tariq Bajwa.
The UAE is Pakistan’s third largest trading partner after China and the United States, is home to more than a million Pakistani expatriates, and is the second-largest source of remittances to the South Asian country after Saudi Arabia.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE Faisal Tirmizi earlier this year said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the UAE exceeded US$10.9 billion in the fiscal year 2023–24, including goods and services.
The envoy also disclosed that remittances from the Pakistani community in the UAE reached $6.7 bn in 2024. He noted that during the period July 2024 to January 2025, goods trade rose by 21.63pc, with Pakistan’s exports growing by 7.53 per cent, indicating sustained momentum in economic engagement.
According to Ambassador Tirmizi, goods trade in 2023–24 reached $8.41 bn, with Pakistan’s exports rising by 41.06pc to $2.08 bn, while imports from the UAE declined by 14.45pc to $6.33 bn, resulting in a 28.28pc reduction in the trade deficit. In the services sector, total trade stood at $2.56 bn, marking a 20.54pc year-on-year increase.
He added that there were 19 Emirati companies currently operating in Pakistan and the UAE had invested significantly in key sectors such as communications, services, tourism, information technology, oil and gas, housing, banking, and real estate.
A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his official one-day visit to the Gulf state, where he discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest.
The high-level engagement aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its recent standoff with New Delhi.
PM Shehbaz conveyed his sincere gratitude to the UAE leadership for its “constructive role” in helping defuse tensions during the recent conflict between Pakistan and India. He appreciated the UAE’s positive role in promoting peace, dialogue and stability in the region.
Tensions flared following what Islamabad termed a “false flag operation” by India in the mountainous resort town of Pahalgam. In the wake of the incident, both countries carried out missile and air strikes. According to Pakistan’s military, India lost six aircraft in the exchange, including a Rafale fighter jet.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the meeting underscored the deep-rooted, brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE, built on mutual trust, shared values, and a history of close cooperation.
The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest, and reaffirmed their commitment to further enhancing collaboration in key areas.
Both sides expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and ongoing engagements at all levels. The leaders agreed to maintain close coordination and continue working together to advance shared goals of regional peace and prosperity.</p><small>2025-06-13 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1316485284c925e.png?r=164940' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916928/india-china-agree-to-expedite-resumption-of-direct-flights-as-ties-improve' target='_blank'><strong>India, China agree to expedite resumption of direct flights as ties improve</strong></a><br><p>India and China have agreed to expedite the resumption of direct air services and step up communication, the two countries’ foreign ministries said on Friday, as Beijing and New Delhi continue to mend bilateral ties.
The ministries’ statements came after a meeting on Thursday of Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, who is visiting India.
The two countries reached an agreement in October regarding patrolling along their Himalayan border, thawing a standoff that began in 2020 and had strained bilateral ties, impacting areas from trade to technology to air travel.
Sun said in the meeting that the two sides should properly handle disputes and differences, and jointly play a constructive role in maintaining international and regional peace and stability, according to the Chinese ministry’s statement.
The two sides agreed to continue to stabilise and rebuild ties, the Indian ministry’s statement said.
In January, the neighbours agreed to work on resolving trade and economic differences, a move expected to boost their aviation sectors.</p><small>2025-06-13 11:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1316303685fab86.jpg?r=164610' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916926/pm-shehbaz-orders-help-for-pakistani-zaireen-in-iran' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz orders help for Pakistani Zaireen in Iran</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday directed all relevant authorities to provide every possible assistance for the safe return and protection of Pakistani Zaireen currently in Iran following Israel’s deadly strikes.
Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran earlier today, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was the start of a “prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon”.
Iran promised a harsh response and Israel said it was working to intercept about 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.
In light of PM Shehbaz’s directives, a Crisis Management Cell has been established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to monitor the situation and coordinate efforts.
The Pakistani Embassy in Iran has also been instructed to remain vigilant and actively assist the pilgrims. Earlier today, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar shared the embassy’s hotline number: (0098)-2166941388.
 






The prime minister emphasised that immediate and effective measures must be taken to ensure the safety of all Pakistani nationals in Iran. He further instructed that all available resources be utilised to facilitate their safe and prompt return to Pakistan.
He directed that until the regional situation normalises, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Pakistani diplomatic mission in Iran will remain on high alert, ensuring continued support and communication with the pilgrims.
The Foreign Office (FO) also advised all Zaireen from Pakistan to reconsider their travel plans to Iran and Iraq in view of the evolving security situation in the region.
 






Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which condemned Israel’s strikes, with the FO calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”
“The Israeli military strikes violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran and clearly contravene the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law. Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said in a statement.
He said that Pakistan stood in “resolute solidarity” with the people of Iran and unequivocally denounced these blatant provocations, which constituted a grave danger and a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, with serious implications.
The spokesperson said that the international community and UN had the responsibility to uphold international law, stop this aggression immediately and hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari called Israeli’s military strikes “a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran”, while PM Shehbaz said this “grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region”.</p><small>2025-06-13 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1316294752836a6.jpg?r=162953' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916927/sbp-set-to-hold-policy-rate-as-israel-iran-conflict-overshadows-growth-push' target='_blank'><strong>SBP set to hold policy rate as Israel-Iran conflict overshadows growth push</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to hold its policy rate on Monday, a Reuters poll showed, as many analysts shifted their previous view of a cut in the wake of Israel’s military strike on Iran, citing inflation risks from rising global commodity prices.
Israel said on Friday (today) it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders in a “preemptive strike” to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict. The escalating hostilities triggered a sharp spike in oil prices — a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.
Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll expected the SBP to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 12 per cent. Two forecast a 100 basis-point cut and one predicted a 50 bps cut.
“There remains an upside risk of a rise in global commodity prices in light of geopolitical tensions which could mark a return to inflationary pressures,” said Ahmad Mobeen, senior economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“The resultant higher import bill could also threaten external sector performance and bring pressure to the exchange rate.”
Inflation has been declining for several months after it soared to around 40pc in May 2023.
Last month, however, inflation picked up to 3.5pc, above the finance ministry’s projection of up to 2pc, partly due to the fading of the year-go base effects. The SBP expects average inflation between 5.5pc and 7.5pc for the fiscal year ending June.
The SBP paused its easing cycle in March after cumulative cuts of 1,000 basis points from a record high of 22pc, and resumed it with a 100-basis-point reduction in May.
The policy meeting follows the release of a tight annual budget, which saw defence spending raised by 20pc but overall expenditure was reduced by 7pc, with GDP growth forecast at 4.2pc.
The government says the $350 billion economy has stabilised under a $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout that helped it stave off a default threat.
Some analysts are sceptical of the government’s ability to reach the growth target amid fiscal and external challenges.
Abdul Azeem, head of research at Al Habib Capital Markets, which forecast a 50-bp cut, said a lower rate could “support the GDP target of 4.2pc and reduce the debt financing burden”.</p><small>2025-06-13 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1316064947e7ba7.jpg?r=161256' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916914/fact-check-viral-video-said-to-be-of-israeli-attack-on-tehran-shows-oct-2024-iranian-strikes-on-israels-nevatim-airbase' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video said to be of Israeli attack on Tehran shows Oct 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users on social media platform X on Friday shared a video amid the outbreak of Israeli attacks on Iran, claiming that it allegedly showed a missile attack on Tehran. However, the footage dates back to October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.
Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed and state media reported that the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Additionally, at least six nuclear scientists were also killed along with civilians, as per reports.
Today, an Israeli X user posted a video of missile attack on an unidentified location, with the following caption: “Crazy documentation from Iran, dozens of periods at the same time.”
The post was viewed nearly 30,000 times.
Israeli analyst Eli David shared the same clip with the following caption, “Tehran moments ago,” racking up 523,000 views.
It was also shared here, here, here, and here, gaining 209,000, 77,000, 11,000, and 2,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and influx of visuals coming out of the recent conflict between Iran and Israel.
A reverse image search of the keyframes of the clip yielded a posted by a user on X dated October 1, 2024, with the caption, “🇮🇱🇮🇷 15 minutes Iranian missiles hitting Israel … supercut.”
 






Refining the search for that date yielded an October 1, 2024, YouTube video by Indian state broadcaster Doordarshan titled: “Iranian missiles targeting the Nevatim airbase in the Negev Desert”.
 


A keyword search for “Iran airstrike” and “Israel” around the corresponding date yielded an October 1, 2024, news report from Al Jazeera, titled “Iran says missiles fired at Israel in response to assassinations.”
According to the report, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, in retaliation for the killing of senior Iranian and allied leaders, including top commanders from Hezbollah and Hamas.
Israeli authorities reported that around 200 ballistic missiles were fired, triggering air raid sirens and shelter warnings across several regions. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had claimed responsibility, labelling the attack a response to Israeli “crimes”. While many of the missiles were intercepted, some caused significant damage and casualties, escalating fears of further regional conflict.
The viral clip was also circulated during the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May with claims it showed India attacking Pakistan.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows an Israeli attack in Tehran is false. The video is old from October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.

All 156 passengers on flight AI 379 had been escorted from the plane, in line with emergency plans, an Airports of Thailand official said.
The aircraft took off from Phuket airport bound for the Indian capital at 9:30am (7:30am PKT) on Friday, but made a wide loop around the Andaman Sea and landed back on the southern Thai island, according to flight tracker Flightradar24.

The incident follows the crash of an Air India flight in Ahmedabad on Thursday shortly after takeoff, in which more than 265 people were killed.
AOT did not provide details on the bomb threat. Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Indian airlines and airports were inundated with hoax bomb threats last year, with nearly 1,000 hoax calls and messages received in the first 10 months, nearly 10 times that of 2023.
Blackbox found of crashed Air India 787; India considering grounding fleet
Investigators recovered a black box recorder from the crash site on Friday of a London-bound passenger jet that ploughed into a residential area of India’s Ahmedabad city, killing at least 265 people on board and on the ground.
The Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner had issued a mayday call shortly before it crashed around lunchtime on Thursday after lifting barely 100 metres (330 feet) from the ground.
One man on board the plane, which was carrying 242 passengers and crew, miraculously survived Thursday’s fiery crash, which left the tailpiece of the aircraft jutting out of the second floor of a hostel for medical staff from a nearby hospital.
“Initially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,” survivor Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a British citizen, told national broadcaster DD News from his hospital bed.
The nose and front wheel of Air India flight 171 landed on a canteen building where students were having lunch, witnesses said.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Kanan Desai said that 265 bodies had been counted so far, which suggested that at least 24 people were killed on the ground. The toll could rise further as more body parts are recovered.
“The official number of deceased will be declared only after DNA testing is completed”, Home Minister Amit Shah said in a statement late on Thursday. DNA samples will be taken from family members of the dead who live abroad, he said.
Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian on board the flight bound for London’s Gatwick airport, as well as 12 crew members.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the devastated neighbourhood on Friday and was also pictured by survivor Ramesh’s bedside.
Ramesh, who suffered burns and other injuries, said: “Everything happened in front of me, and even I couldn’t believe how I managed to come out alive from that.”
“Within a minute after takeoff, suddenly… it felt like something got stuck… I realised something had happened, and then suddenly the plane’s green and white lights turned on.”
The Indian government is also considering grounding Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet, Indian broadcaster NDTV reported earlier on Friday, a day after one of the airline’s aircraft of the same make crashed in Ahmedabad city, killing more than 240 people.
The fleet will likely be grounded for a safety review, NDTV reported, citing sources.</p><small>2025-06-13 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608991-karachi-heat-spikes-to-nearly-49c-feels-like-temperature' target='_blank'><strong>Pre-monsoon system expected to hit Sindh from Saturday: PMD</strong></a><br><p>
