Most seats had fallen vacant after the disqualification of PTI lawmakers due to their convictions for alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023 violent riots.
The six NA constituencies where polling was conducted included one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, NA-18 (Haripur), and the rest in Punjab — NA-96 (Faisalabad), NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-129 (Lahore), NA-143 (Sahiwal) and NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan).
The seven Punjab Assembly constituencies where by-polls were held were PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), PP-98 (Faisalabad), PP-115 (Faisalabad), PP-116 (Faisalabad), PP-203 (Sahiwal) and PP-269 (Muzaffargarh).
The PTI had officially boycotted the polls in all constituencies except Lahore and Haripur, while the PML-N fielded its candidates on all available seats, and the PPP contested on two NA and one Punjab seat.

In NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), the seat fell vacant following the death of former Punjab governor and PTI stalwart Mian Muhammad Azhar. His grandson Chaudhry Arsalan Ahmad is now contesting the by-poll, while the PML-N has fielded Hafiz Mian Muhammad Noman.

As polling neared its end, absconding PTI leader Hammad Azhar alleged on X that “voter booklets” were missing.
“Confirmation from [PTI leader] Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed sahib’s son regarding missing voter booklets. It is now essential for all activists to remain at polling [stations till] issuance of Form-45,” Azhar wrote, telling workers to follow the presiding officers till the returning officer’s (RO) office.
 






In another post, Azhar shared the purported audio of Arsalan, who claimed he had been stopped from entering the RO’s office and that only Noman’s vehicle was to be allowed inside.
Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Moeen Riaz Qureshi also accused the authorities of “uprooting almost 99 per cent” of the PTI’s camps outside polling stations in Lahore.
Qureshi pointed out the low voter turnout and claimed that the PML-N attempted to “sabotage the by-polls by distributing more than half of the polling stations’ lists” in other areas, resulting in voters heading to the wrong polling stations.
 






The PTI also alleged that “multiple” of its workers were injured after the Punjab police and PML-N-backed men attacked them at a polling station.
Earlier in the day, the PML-N shared a video of purported PTI camps having no party workers and no voters as of 12:30pm at multiple polling stations in Samanabad and on Poonch Road. Meanwhile, the video showed people gathering at PML-N camps.
On the other hand, later in the day, the PTI’s Sahiwal chapter shared a video on X showing supporters thronging its party camp in Lahore’s Sabzazaar area, while that of the PML-N had comparatively fewer people.
 






PML-N’s Bilal Farooq Tarrar, who won the Wazirabad by-elections earlier this month, visited a polling station in Gulshan-i-Ravi, where party supporters greeted him.
PML-N’s Rana Mashhood Ahmad, head of Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, cast his vote at the Pak Angel School polling station in Union Council 100, APP reported.
He said, “Every vote given to Hafiz Mian Muhammad Nauman is a guarantee of a fair and strong mandate to advance the journey of public service, transparent leadership and sustainable development.”

Earlier in the day, Azhar alleged on X that ballot paper books received by the presiding officers at polling station No.330 (Government Model Girls High School, Samanabad) were less than the number of books issued to them.
However, an official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that the serial numbers (5179-5194) mentioned in Form-36 (“Packing Invoice” containing the quantity of ballot paper books) confirmed that 15 ballot books had been issued.
 






Faisalabad
Faisalabad witnessed elections on two NA seats, NA-96 and NA-104, and three provincial seats — PP-98, PP-115 and PP-116.
In NA-96, the PML-N fielded Muhammad Bilal Badar Chaudhry, brother of Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry.
According to APP, 16 candidates, including several independents, were in the contest for the seat, which was vacated after the disqualification of PTI’s Rai Haider Ali Kharal. The constituency comprises 372,133 male voters and 272,991 female voters.
 


In NA-104, the PML-N had nominated Daniyal Ahmed, who contested against three independent candidates. Ahmed previously contested the elections and lost to PTI ally Sahibzada Hamid Raza, who secured 132,655 votes. Ahmed is the son of former NA opposition leader Raja Riaz.
The voter turnout was reported to be low as of 12pm. However, as the day progressed, an increasing rush of voters was witnessed, APP quoted an ECP spokesperson as saying. A total of 557,637 voters were eligible to exercise their franchise in the NA constituency.
The PML-N set up its party camps outside numerous polling stations, while Ahmed’s rival, Rana Adnan Javed, did not have his camps outside many stations.
Video footage of Faisalabad City Police Officer Bilal Omer’s visit to multiple polling stations also showed barely any voters present, with cops filling the venue instead.

In PP-98, the PML-N had nominated Azad Ali Tabbasum, who competed against nine independent candidates.
Workers at the camps of PML-N’s Tabbasum and independent candidates Wasim Akram Chattha and Haji Ajmal Cheema at a government school polling station reported “almost no voters” at around 12pm.
Due to the low turnout, an announcement was later made on a mosque’s loudspeaker in Chak Jhumra tehsil’s Chandian Talawan locality, urging people to cast their ballots.
The party had not nominated any candidate in this constituency in the 2024 elections, backing instead the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) candidate Muhammad Ajmal, who was the runner-up to PTI-backed Junaid Afzal Sahi.
In PP-115, the ruling party’s candidate Muhammad Tahir Pervez faced three independents and an Awami Justice Party Pakistan (AJPP) candidate. Pervez also contested the 2024 polls and remained the runner-up to PTI-backed Shahid Javed.
In PP-116, the PML-N had nominated Ahmed Shaharyar, the son-in-law of Senator Rana Sanaullah. He contested against five independents and a Pakistan Nazriyati Party (PNP) candidate.
Shaharyar also cast a vote for himself. In the 2024 polls, he was the runner-up with 52,517 votes.
 






Speaking to the media, Sanaullah said there had been “no complaints” from anywhere in the constituency about the polling process.
“We hope that people will vote for service, progress and solutions to their issues,” he said, adding that the PML-N deserved the ballot for serving the people.
On the PTI’s boycott of the by-polls, Sanaullah said, “Imran Khan sahib is not even doing politics. He has never done politics. It is this country’s and the public’s misfortune that he was brought [into power].”
Asked about reported violations of the electoral code of conduct, the senator asserted that there had been no arrests or legal actions taken against any political opponent in the entire constituency.
 


More than 6,500 security personnel were deployed at 1,240 polling stations established in the five constituencies, APP quoted a police spokesman as saying. The stations included 64 of Category-A, 610 of Category-B and 566 stations of Category-C.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Nasir Mahmood Bajwa reviewed the security of Category-A and Category-B polling stations with other senior officers in PP-115 and PP-116.
All independent candidates of the five constituencies had claimed that they had been backed by the PTI leadership. It is pertinent to mention that the PTI had announced the boycott of these by-elections, except for those in Haripur and Lahore.
The PML-N was likely to win all five seats in Faisalabad thanks to the PTI’s official boycott, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) being in no condition to contest due to the recent ban on it, and the PPP fielding no candidate.
Separately, in a statement, the provincial election commissioner’s office said a man, identified as Muhammad Kaleem, was arrested for sharing a video of his ballot paper with a vote for the PML-N on social media.
“Violating the secrecy of the vote is a legal offence,” the district returning officer was quoted as saying.
The ECP official directed security officials to ensure that no voter entered the polling stations with their mobile phones. Directives were also issued to the presiding officers and the polling staff to ensure secrecy of the vote.
Dera Ghazi Khan
In NA-185 (DG Khan-II), PPP’s Dost Muhammad Khosa and the PML-N’s Mehmood Qadir Khan Leghari were among the key candidates. The seat had fallen vacant after the disqualification of PTI’s Zartaj Gul.
The voters’ enthusiasm defeated the PTI’s boycott call as the constituency witnessed a 25pc turnout in the city areas and 30pc in rural areas.
The by-elections were held peacefully, with 3,000 police officials performing their duties.
 






Besides Khosa and Leghari, other aspirants included independent candidates Allah Bakhsh, Zafar Bashir and Mureed Hussain; PNP’s Sohail Meheruddin; Abdul Aziz Baloch of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Pakistan (JUI-P) and Nawab Muhammad Ali Faisal of All Pakistan Muslim League (Jinnah).
Leghari, a sitting MPA, is a self-made businessman, not directly related to the family of late former president Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari.
NA-185 is one of the three NA constituencies in the district and encompasses populous urban areas, according to the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen).
A total of 226 polling stations with 860 booths were set up, including 434 male and 426 female booths. The constituency has 418,310 registered voters, comprising 222,392 men and 195,918 women.
From an administrative and security perspective, 4 polling stations were declared highly sensitive, 53 as sensitive, and 169 as normal.
Haripur
While the PTI had announced an official boycott of most by-elections, it contested on Haripur’s NA-18 seat left vacant after the disqualification of former NA opposition leader Omar Ayub.
The PTI leader’s wife, Shehrnaz Omar Ayub, contested the seat and faced PML-N’s Babar Nawaz and PPP’s Irum Fatima Turk. Shehrnaz had been allotted the “kettle” symbol.

While the turnout remained poor between 8am and 12pm due to the cold winter weather, there was a sudden increase in voters showing up at polling stations after 12pm, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Former KP minister and Ayub’s brother, Yusuf Ayub, accused the ECP of being biased against Shehrnaz.
“The election commission’s biased approach is evident from the posting of presiding officers, other polling staff, and changing our election symbol,” he said. He acknowledged that the voter turnout remained low but expressed the hope that, despite all the bias, the PTI candidate would win the election with a margin of 100,000 votes
PTI Haripur President Raja Ehtesham also expressed his reservations over the election arrangements.
Shehrnaz contested an election for the first time. While Ayub and former MPA Momina Basit had been campaigning for her, Shehrnaz herself abstained from appearing in public meetings and only addressed women-specific election meetings.
Polling was largely peaceful with no poll-related violence reported from across the constituency, which spans about 1,726 square kilometres.
Speaking to the media in Haripur’s Khalabat Township, Ayub said he was hopeful of a “clean sweep” on all 29 polling stations in the union council. Another video shared by the PTI showed camps of the PML-N set up outside a polling station in Haripur.
 






A total of 753,944 registered voters, comprising 392,339 male and 361,605 female voters, were expected to cast their ballots, according to the ECP.
APP reported that 602 polling stations were established across the constituency. Of these, 462 stations were declared normal, 100 sensitive, and 40 highly sensitive. The ECP deployed 4,414 polling staff to manage the electoral process.

Babar, who had earlier served as MNA during 2015-2018, has won the support of his party leaders, including Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s husband, retired Captain Safdar Awan.
According to observers, Haripur’s political landscape remains dominated by patronage rather than ideology. Not a single woman in the district’s history could ever make it to the provincial or the National Assembly in a direct election.
Sahiwal
For NA-143, PML-N has fielded Muhammad Tufail Jutt against independent candidate Zarrar Akbar Choudhary.
 






In PP-203, the PML-N’s Muhammad Hanif Jutt, brother of Muhammad Tufail Jutt, is contesting against independent candidate Sardar Falak Sher Dogar.

Sargodha
From PP-73, the PML-N has fielded Mian Sultan Ali Ranjha as its candidate.
 






Mianwali
In Mianwali’s PP-87, the PML-N has fielded Ali Haider Noor Khan as its candidate.
 






Muzaffargarh
In PP-269 of Muzaffargarh, Mian Alamdar Qureshi is contesting as the PPP’s candidate.
Polling at the Karam Dad polling station was “paused for a few minutes” following clashes between two parties, the spokesperson for the election commissioner of Punjab said in a statement.
“However, later on, law enforcement agencies confirmed that the polling had resumed after a short break,” the spokesperson said.
Security personnel deployed
According to the ECP’s code of conduct for the armed forces, troops will be deployed outside polling stations declared “most sensitive” and will remain in quick-response mode at the remaining stations as third-tier responders.
The personnel have been directed to perform duties strictly in accordance with Article 245 of the Constitution, the law and the mandate assigned to the armed forces to assist the election regulator.
While stationed outside selected polling stations, they have been instructed to focus solely on ensuring a secure environment, complying with all relevant laws, and maintaining public confidence by safeguarding voters and preserving law and order throughout the polling process.
They have been barred from preventing any eligible voter from entering a polling station, except in cases involving weapons, explosives, prohibited items or attempts to incite violence or threaten national security.
Out of a total of 2,792 polling stations, 408 were declared highly sensitive and 1,032 sensitive across the 13 constituencies, APP reported, citing official sources.
In Punjab, where by-elections for 12 of the 13 vacant seats are taking place, more than 20,000 police personnel have been deployed for security in the province’s national and provincial constituencies.
In a post on X, the Punjab police said it was on “high alert”. It asserted there was “zero tolerance” for the violation of the ECP’s code of conduct, restrictions under Section 144, and the ban on arms.
 






“The polling process is being continuously monitored from the Central Police Office, the Safe City Authority, and the control and monitoring rooms of districts,” the police said.
Noting that the police had the full assistance of the Rangers and the army, Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar said, “All formations, including the Dolphin Squad, Special Branch and CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department), are being employed for the elections’ security.”

The cause of Friday’s crash was not immediately known but it capped a week of jockeying for influence at the event, attended by India’s arch-rival Pakistan six months after the neighbouring foes faced off in the world’s largest air battle in decades.
Such a public loss will inevitably overshadow India’s efforts to establish the jet abroad after a painstaking development over four decades, experts said, as India paid tribute to Wing Commander Namansh Syal who died in the crash.
Crash at showcase event in Dubai
“The imagery is brutal,” said Douglas A. Birkey, executive director of the US-based Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, referring to the history of crashes at air shows where nations and industries seek to tout major national achievements.
“A crash sends quite the opposite signal: a dramatic failure,” he said, adding, however, that while the Tejas would suffer negative publicity, it would most likely regain momentum.
Dubai is the world’s third-largest air show after Paris and Britain’s Farnborough, and accidents at such events have become increasingly rare.
In 1999, a Russian Sukhoi Su-30 crashed after touching the ground during a manoeuvre at the Paris Airshow, and a Soviet MiG-29 crashed at the same event a decade earlier. All crew ejected safely and India went on to place orders for both jets.
Fighter sales “are driven by high order political realities, which supersede a one-off incident”, said Birkey.
Powered by GE engines
The Tejas programme began in the 1980s as India sought to replace vintage Soviet-origin MiG-21s, the last of which retired as recently as September after numerous extensions due to slow Tejas deliveries by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).
The state-owned company has 180 of the advanced Mk-1A variant on order domestically but is yet to begin deliveries due to engine supply chain issues at GE Aerospace.
A former HAL executive who left the company recently said the crash in Dubai “rules out exports for now”.
Target markets included Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and HAL also opened an office in Malaysia in 2023.
“The focus for the coming years would be on boosting production of the fighter for domestic use,” the former executive said, requesting anonymity.
But the Indian Air Force is worried about its shrinking fighter squadrons, which have fallen to 29 from an approved strength of 42, with early variants of the MiG-29, Anglo-French Jaguar and French Mirage 2000 set to retire in coming years.
“The Tejas was supposed to be their replacement,” an IAF officer said. “But it is facing production issues.”
As an alternative, India is considering off-the-shelf purchases to fill immediate gaps, with options including more French Rafales, two Indian defence officials said, adding that India still plans to add to about 40 Tejas already in service.
India is also weighing competing offers from the US and Russia for 5th-generation F-35 and Su-57 fighters — two advanced models also rarely sharing a stage in Dubai this week.
‘Base’ for future programmes
India has for years been among the world’s biggest arms importers, but has increasingly projected the Tejas as an example of self-reliance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking a sortie in the fighter in November 2023.
Like most fighter programmes, the Tejas has fought for attention at the intersection of technology and diplomacy.
Development was initially held up partly by sanctions following India’s 1998 nuclear tests as well as problems in developing local engines, said Walter Ladwig, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.
But the jet’s long-term significance is “likely to lie less in sales abroad than in the industrial and technological base it creates for India’s future combat-aircraft programmes,” he said.
Regional rivalry plays out
Both India and Pakistan were present in force at the show, where the Tejas performed multiple aerial displays in the presence of the rival Pakistani contingent.
Pakistan disclosed the signing of a provisional agreement with a “friendly country” to supply its JF-17 Thunder Block III fighter, co-developed with China.
On the ramp, a JF-17 was flanked by arms including PL-15E, the export variant of a family of Chinese missiles that US and Indian officials say brought down at least one French Rafale used by India during an aerial battle with Pakistan in May.
At an exhibition stand, manufacturer PAC distributed brochures touting the JF-17, one of two models deployed by Pakistan during the four-day conflict, as “battle-tested”.
India is a lot more careful with the Tejas, which was not actively used in the four-day conflict in May, Indian officials have said, without giving any reasons.
Nor did it participate in the annual January 26 Republic Day aerial display in New Delhi this year due to what officials said were safety reasons associated with single-engine aircraft.</p><small>2025-11-23 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23174148b007ffe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956887/in-pictures-artists-writers-and-poets-come-together-at-the-adab-festival-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Artists, writers and poets come together at the Adab Festival in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>The Adab Festival saw a gathering of big names from art, literature, media and politics for a series of talks, music performances and mushairas.

Karachi faced a severe water crisis in November as prolonged power outages across the city disrupted pumping operations.
In a statement released today, the KWSC said they maintained close coordination with K-Electric throughout the crisis to restore the water supply, and officials confirmed that “citywide water services have now returned to normal.”
“All possible steps are being taken to further strengthen the water supply system in the future,” the KWSC said.
Per the KWSC, the city experienced a total shortfall of 884 million gallons of water due to electricity disruptions.
“The Dhabeji Pumping Station was hit hardest, with 132 hours and 20 minutes of power outages leading to a shortage of 424 million gallons, while the Dumlottee Wells recorded 146 hours of outages, resulting in 111 million gallons of lost water,” the statement read, quoting the spokesperson.
It added that North East Karachi Pumping Station alone faced a deficit of 335 million gallons, while smaller stations saw comparatively lower shortages — 6 million gallons at Hub and Pipri stations and 2 million gallons at the Gharo station.
Officials at the central pumping stations said operations were halted for several hours during the month due to persistent outages, the spokesperson was quoted as saying.
“Measures should be taken to ensure a stable and uninterrupted power supply,” they added, warning that repeated cable faults had already caused significant damage to pumping machinery.
The statement said that recommendations include setting up alternative feeders, standby cables, and technical upgrades to safeguard central stations.</p><small>2025-11-23 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/23164807b37698f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956881/eu-and-pakistan-urge-afghanistan-to-root-out-terror-on-its-soil-ensure-womens-rights-in-joint-statement' target='_blank'><strong>EU and Pakistan urge Afghanistan to root out terror on its soil, ensure women’s rights in joint statement</strong></a><br><p>In a joint statement shared on Sunday, Pakistan and the European Union (EU) called on Afghanistan to deal with terrorist organisations operating from its soil and to ensure the protection of human rights, especially those of women and girls.
The development came as the 7th Strategic Dialogue between Pakistan and the EU was convened in Brussels. The meeting was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and the EU’s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas.
According to a joint statement shared by the Foreign Office (FO), Dar and Kallas discussed relations between Islamabad and Kabul amid cross-border tensions last month, with both top diplomats reaffirming their commitment to regional peace, stability, prosperity, and resolving issues with neighbours through dialogue.
“The two sides called on Afghanistan’s de facto authorities to play a constructive role in achieving the shared objective of rooting out terrorism from Afghan soil,” the statement read.
It added that Dar and Kallas expressed concern over Kabul’s deteriorating socioeconomic conditions and were in favour of a “peaceful, stable and self-reliant Afghanistan”.
They also hoped that Afghanistan would advocate for a “credible political process aligned with the UN-led ‘Doha process’, and in line with the commitments made by the Taliban de facto Authorities to the international community”, according to the statement.
It added that the EU appreciated Pakistan’s hosting millions of Afghan nationals for over four decades, but emphasised that any repatriation must be “safe, dignified and in line with international standards”.
“Both sides called upon the Afghan authorities to ensure protection of human rights, especially for women, girls and vulnerable communities,” the statement read.
Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.

Speaking to the media in Faisalabad, Sanaullah said, “We are still in favour of politicians sitting together at a table to resolve issues.”
He recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s “unconditional offer“ he made in August to all political parties to become a part of the ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’ (Charter for Stability of Pakistan).
Sanaullah was speaking to reporters as by-elections were underway today in PP-116, where his son-in-law Ahmed Shaharyar is contesting as the PML-N candidate.
 
 

On the PTI’s official boycott of most of the by-elections held today, Sanaullah said, “Imran Khan sahib is not even doing politics. He has never done politics. It is this country’s and the public’s misfortune that he was brought [into power].”
Sanaullah, also the PM’s political aide, assailed Imran for “always creating a deadlock”, while “democracy progresses through dialogue”.
“A person is sitting in jail, and from there he wants to spread chaos, anarchy and fitna (evil) in the country, and there are also examples of May 9 and Nov 26 present,” he said, referring to Imran and the PTI’s protests.
Weeks of negotiations between the government and the PTI in December last year failed to achieve any tangible results on major issues back then, as both parties accused each other of derailing the negotiations.
Late last month, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said there were no negotiations or talks ongoing between the party and the federal government or the military establishment.
‘PML-N only party deserving of votes’
Speaking about the by-election, Sanaullah said there had been “no complaints” from anywhere in the constituency regarding the polling process, dismissing allegations of rigging and disturbances in different constituencies.
“We hope that people will vote for service, progress and solutions to their issues,” Shaharyar’s father-in-law said, adding that PML-N was the only deserving party for that.
On the low voter turnout, the senior politician contended that while general elections usually recorded a turnout of 50 to 60 per cent, by-polls only witnessed a 25 to 30pc turnout on average.
Sanaullah added: “There should be no such incident as Oct 12, 1999 or 2017/2018 when a conspiracy was done against Pakistan and a project was launched, which injected the culture of hatred [… and] enmity into politics.”
 


The senator said, “I contested seven elections in my constituency, out of which I won five. So my performance is in front of everyone. And as far as rigging is concerned, the voting process is being carried is in front of you, and the counting will take place in front of you.
“But despite that, if someone wants to cry foul,  and if someone has started crying foul since yesterday and today morning about rigging, then we have no solution for that,” he added.
“The era of development has returned in the name of Maryam Nawaz Sharif,” Sanaullah said, referring to the Punjab chief minister’s election last year.
The PML-N leader also highlighted that the party halted certain development projects in Faisalabad in line with the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) campaigning rules.
“There were projects worth Rs70 billion to be started in Faisalabad, including a metro project and a scheme to supply fresh water to the entire city. But we requested to halt it for the time being and proceed after the election so that people cannot say we only did that for the sake of elections.”</p><small>2025-11-23 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231637202cd35da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956872/pakistan-urges-urgent-grant-based-climate-finance-at-cop30' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges urgent grant-based climate finance at COP30</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for rapid, grant-based, and predictable financing for climate-vulnerable developing countries, warning that recurring climate disasters are exacerbating debt distress and undermining development gains in nations that have contributed the least to global emissions.
The appeal was made at a high-level side event titled “Operationalising Loss and Damage: Financing Resilience and Recovery in Vulnerable Countries”, organised jointly by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination and Unicef at the Pakistan Pavilion during the UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil.
Secretary for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Aisha Humera Moriani, in her keynote address, stated that Pakistan was investing heavily in strengthening national resilience despite contributing less than one per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions.
She recalled the catastrophic floods of 2022 and 2025 that displaced millions, damaged infrastructure and caused multi-billion-dollar economic losses. “The scale and frequency of such disasters in developing countries underscore the disproportionate climate burden placed on nations that played almost no role in heating the planet,” she said.
Representatives of the newly established Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), government officials, development partners and experts attended the event to discuss ways of operationalising the global Loss and Damage mechanism.
Panellists noted that repeated climate shocks had pushed several vulnerable economies into what they described as a “debt emergency,” forcing them to borrow for reconstruction in the absence of adequate grant-based support.
They stressed that new, additional and concessional financing was essential if Loss and Damage assistance was to be transformative rather than short-lived.
Speakers also highlighted that children were bearing the greatest burden of climate stress, with Pakistan having nearly half its population under 18.
Recurring disasters, they said, were severely affecting nutrition, health, education and mental wellbeing. “Climate disasters are not only destroying infrastructure, they are also robbing a generation of its right to safety and opportunity,” Moriani added.
The discussion further underscored the need to prioritise the Barbados Implementation Modalities (BIM), which call for simplified application procedures, faster disbursement and flexible financial windows to support countries with constrained fiscal space.
Participants also emphasised the importance of financing mechanisms that can address slow-onset events such as glacial melt, desertification and sea level rise.
Ministry spokesperson Muhammad Saleem Shaikh told APP that a significant part of the dialogue focused on support for vulnerable groups, particularly children and young people.
He pointed out that non-economic losses — including trauma, cultural disruption, displacement and community breakdown — remained insufficiently recognised in global policy frameworks.
He added that Pakistan had announced its readiness to submit two proposals under the FRLD’s initial funding cycle, aimed at rebuilding critical social infrastructure and strengthening resilience in key sectors, including agriculture, community systems and water resources.
While domestic resources were being mobilised, he said, the scale of climate-related loss far exceeded national capacity.
Calling Loss and Damage financing a matter of national survival, the ministry reiterated Pakistan’s position that climate justice and the principles of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) must guide international action. “Climate justice demands immediate access. Our people cannot wait,” the ministry stated, urging developed countries and multilateral institutions to translate commitments into tangible financial delivery.
Moriani reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working with the UN, international partners and global climate finance bodies to shape an equitable framework for climate recovery.
The goal, she said, was to ensure that vulnerable countries receive the resources needed to recover, rebuild and adapt to accelerating climate impacts.</p><small>2025-11-23 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2314510197a39ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956868/after-ambani-zoo-probe-wildlife-body-reverses-call-to-curb-animal-imports-to-india' target='_blank'><strong>After Ambani zoo probe, wildlife body reverses call to curb animal imports to India</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations wildlife trade body decided on Sunday not to restrict India from importing endangered animals, after many countries supported reversing an earlier, stringent recommendation that had embroiled the private zoo run by Asia’s richest family.
Vantara, a 3,500-acre zoo in Gujarat run by the philanthropic arm of the Reliance conglomerate led by Mukesh Ambani and his family, had faced allegations from non-profit and wildlife groups of improper imports of some animals, triggering higher scrutiny by Germany and the European Union.
After visiting the facility in September, the Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) issued a report this month asking India to “not issue any further import permits” as discrepancies had been found between exporter and importer trade data, and there were insufficient checks on the origin of some animals.
At the CITES meeting in Uzbekistan, live-streamed on Sunday, the recommendation was reversed after many countries, including India, the United States, Japan, and Brazil, said the measure was too premature, with some also saying there was no evidence of illegal imports into India.
“There doesn’t seem to be enough support for retaining the recommendation,” Naimah Aziz, Chair of the CITES Standing Committee, told the delegates, adding that it could consider if further regulatory measures were needed.
CITES is a global treaty that regulates trade in endangered plants and animals. India had earlier opposed the UN recommendation.
Vantara, which previously said it remains committed to transparency and legal compliance, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Vantara Zoo has animals from around the world
The Vantara zoo houses around 2,000 species, including exotic animals imported from South Africa, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo, such as snakes, tortoises, tigers, giraffes and spiny-tailed lizards.
While India’s delegate affirmed the country’s commitment to CITES’ compliance, Belgium and at least one conservation group, the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance, on Sunday pushed to suspend exports to India until concerns were addressed.
In September, an Indian Supreme Court-appointed investigation cleared Vantara of wrongdoing, while the facility said it complies with all laws.
European Environment Commissioner Jessika Roswall said in August that EU states “will pay particular attention to any export requests directed towards India and the facility in question”.</p><small>2025-11-23 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635011-karachi-faced-884m-gallon-water-shortfall-in-nov-due-to-power-outages-kwsb' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi faced 884m gallon water shortfall in Nov due to power outages: KWSC</strong></a><br><p>

This shifting landscape framed the session ‘Truth, Trust, and Tenacity: The New Media Paradigm,’ held on Saturday, which brought together journalists Fazil Jamili, Azhar Abbas, Amber Rahim Shamsi and Azaz Syed under the moderation of Nadia Naqi.
The discussion was part of the Adab Festival, which returned to Karachi for its 10th edition at Habitt City from November 22 to 23.
Opening the discussion, Naqi noted the challenges journalists face in working and surviving in the current media environment.
“Speaking the truth comes with challenges; often we’ve seen journalists being intimidated, and the controlled environment makes it difficult to speak the truth,” she said. “With truth, of course, comes trust. Is there public trust in the media? That’s the big question; it’s a challenge, actually.”
Naqi asked how difficult it had become for traditional media outlets to remain relevant and compete in the new media paradigm, where social media, content creators, YouTubers, and digital platforms held huge influence.
Abbas, currently Managing Director at Geo TV Network, said the pervasive noise made it much harder to speak the truth. He opined, without naming anyone responsible, that over the past 15 years, “social engineering” had created clouds of lies, misinformation, and doubt aimed at discrediting the political class, journalists, and human rights activists.
“Beyond mainstream media, digital and social media are also used to spread misinformation. It takes a long time for a journalist, politician, or human rights activist to build trust, but that trust can be destroyed in a minute by social media propaganda,” he added.
“We ourselves question whether we are still relevant,” Abbas said, adding that legacy media still holds its audience in terms of numbers.
Naqi emphasised that censorship goes beyond shutting down news outlets or intimidating journalists, affecting their families as well. She noted that issues which cannot be raised on television are often addressed through digital platforms.
Shamsi, Pakistan Editor at Nukta, responded that even though digital media avoids censorship faced by traditional outlets, it comes with its own challenges.
“We exist in a time where there’s never been so much access to information,” she said. According to her, digital platforms prioritise clicks and views and appeal to the reactive, emotional side of the brain rather than encouraging rational thought. “You will prefer somebody who will agree with your views and opinions. That will confirm your bias.”
Another limitation, Shamsi said, came from the platforms themselves, including YouTube, Google, Meta, and X. Political and commercial interests shaped content distribution, where platforms profited from outrage, favouring content with sensational headlines and thumbnails.
“If you use keywords like ‘genocide’, ‘rape’, ‘murder’, or ‘Palestine’ in your [search engine optimisation], then you might get shadowbanned. Because it’s not your own platform, distribution remains an issue even in digital media,” she said.
Amid Israel’s onslaught in Gaza, social media platforms have reportedly been accused of curtailing the reach of pro-Palestine or Israel-critical content, though the companies deny it.
“Globally, journalism is struggling, and I don’t think truth is important anymore,” Shamsi added.
Moderator Naqi indicated that journalists today often felt as though they were “competing with creators on TikTok and YouTube, despite their core responsibility being to report news and seek the truth”. She questioned whether the profession itself was partly to blame, emphasising that social media had deepened divisions within journalism, including within press bodies.
Jamili, President of the Karachi Press Club (KPC), said the line between information and journalism had become increasingly blurred, largely because of social media. “Journalists themselves are confused, and even mainstream media gets caught up when something comes up on social media,” he said.
“There’s no comparison between speed and accuracy. You need time for the truth; only then is there trust. These are things we’ve abandoned over time,” he lamented.
Jamili said censorship had evolved, with self-censorship now the most prevalent form. Editors and reporters, he added, often wrote with fear.
It is worth noting that Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan 158 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index 2025.
He argued that algorithms effectively replaced the editor’s role. “Earlier, editors decided which stories mattered, assessed their quality and relevance, and determined how they should be published. Now the algorithm dictates the priorities, and we’ve become captive to it.”
Speaking about KPC, he said that although it had around 1,800 active members, more than half were unemployed. With delayed wages and salary backlogs stretching three to four months, he asked, “If a journalist is hungry, how can you expect them to be honest?”
Syed, also associated with Geo TV Network, disregarded using the word “truth” and argued that it was subjective, with each religious or political group holding its own version. “My job is to collect facts,” he said, emphasising instead the need for journalists to distinguish between facts, assumptions, and opinions.
On the role of editors, Naqi noted they were once considered “untouchable”, but said the editors themselves no longer pushed back the way they used to. Jamili added that the practice of editorial writing had effectively disappeared. He mentioned that one of Pakistan’s largest-circulated Urdu newspapers no longer published editorials, yet “no one seems to care”.
In response to a question about controversial media ownership and the influence of land developers in Pakistan, the journalists stressed that such challenges plagued the industry globally.</p><small>2025-11-23 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635008-pakistan-eu-press-kabuls-de-facto-rulers-to-act-against-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, EU press Kabul's de facto rulers to act against terrorism</strong></a><br><p>

Despite a ceasefire signed by Israel and Hamas on October 9, Israeli forces have continued to regularly bombard Gaza with airstrikes, with the latest attack on Saturday leaving at least 21 dead in the territory.
A statement issued by the FO today said, “Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attacks by Israeli occupying forces across Gaza.”
It added that the attacks had reportedly resulted in the deaths of several Palestinian civilians and left many more wounded.
“Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international law, relevant UN resolutions, and the recently concluded peace agreement at Sharm el-Sheikh,” the FO said.
It said that the attacks also undermined international efforts aimed at achieving “lasting peace and stability” in the region.
“The Government of Pakistan reiterates its call upon the international community to take immediate steps to end Israeli impunity and ceasefire violations, and to uphold international human rights and humanitarian law,” the statement said.
It reaffirmed Pakistan’s principled position in favour of establishing “an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital”.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza began on October 7, 2023 and has lasted over two years, with previous attempts at a ceasefire having failed. Over 69,000 Palestinians have been killed in the onslaught; of these, according to the Gaza Government Media Office, around 342 were killed in the last 44 days since the ceasefire was announced.</p><small>2025-11-23 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2308124313d4710.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956811/federal-constitutional-court-finds-support-in-apex-lawyer-bodies' target='_blank'><strong>Federal Constitutional Court finds support in apex lawyer bodies</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Two premier lawyer bodies on Saturday extended support to the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) through the recently passed 27th Amendment.
In a joint statement, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) affirmed that it was their two-decade-old demand that the FCC should be established with equal representation of the provinces for hearing constitutional and political matters, so that general public cases could be decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a timely manner.
The statement was jointly issued by PBC Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warriach and SCBA President Haroonur Rashid.
 
 

According to the statement, the FCC will strengthen the federation. It said the premier bodies were watching carefully the entire process, including the appointment of judges, and would express their concerns and grievances, when needed, through decisions and resolutions of the general houses of both bodies. The statement said that the PBC and the SCBA always stood for upholding the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the supremacy of institutions, and adherence to the Constitution.
The statement also expressed regret over certain political factions within the legal community aimed at creating chaos and division among lawyers, just to achieve their ulterior political motives and promote their political agenda. They often issue statements aimed at sabotaging the democratic system of the country, it claimed.
“We strongly reject and condemn such statements issued by the non-elected people and assure that their futile exercise will soon be rendered ineffective,” the statement said.
“We, the elected representatives, want to make it explicitly clear that the PBC and SCBA, being apex bodies of the legal fraternity, were only supposed to issue statements on behalf of the ins­titutions on national issues,” it stressed.

Reuters was not able to establish the exact timing or scope of the new operations, nor whether US President Donald Trump had made a final decision to act.
Reports of looming action have proliferated in recent weeks as the US military has deployed forces to the Caribbean amid worsening relations with Venezuela.
Two of the US officials said covert operations would likely be the first part of the new action against Maduro. All four officials quoted in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of impending action by the United States.
The Pentagon referred questions to the White House. The CIA declined to comment. A senior administration official on Saturday did not rule anything out regarding Venezuela.
“President Trump is prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration has been weighing Venezuela-related options to combat what it has portrayed as Maduro’s role in supplying illegal drugs that have killed Americans. He has denied having any links to the illegal drug trade.
Two US officials told Reuters the options under consideration included attempting to overthrow Maduro.
Maduro, in power since 2013, has contended that Trump seeks to oust him and that Venezuelan citizens and the military will resist any such attempt.
The Venezuelan president, who will celebrate his 63rd birthday on Sunday, appeared on Saturday night at Caracas’ main theatre for the premiere of a television series based on his life.
A military buildup in the Caribbean has been underway for months, and Trump has authorised covert CIA operations in Venezuela.
The US Federal Aviation Administration on Friday warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution.
Three international airlines cancelled flights departing from Venezuela on Saturday after the FAA warning.
The United States plans on Monday to designate the Cartel de los Soles a foreign terrorist organisation for its alleged role in importing illegal drugs into the United States, officials said. The Trump administration has accused Maduro of leading Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.
Hegseth: New options after terrorist designation
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that the terrorist designation “brings a whole bunch of new options to the United States.”
Trump has said the upcoming designation would allow the United States to strike Maduro’s assets and infrastructure in Venezuela, but he also has indicated a willingness to potentially pursue talks in hopes of a diplomatic solution.
Two US officials acknowledged conversations between Caracas and Washington. It was unclear whether those conversations could impact the timing or scale of the US operations.
The US Navy’s largest aircraft carrier, the Gerald R. Ford, arrived in the Caribbean on November 16 with its strike group, joining at least seven other warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft.
US forces in the region so far have focused on counter-narcotics operations, even though the assembled firepower far outweighs anything needed for them.
US troops have carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, killing at least 83 people.
Human rights groups have condemned the strikes as illegal extrajudicial killings of civilians, and some US allies have expressed growing concerns that Washington may be violating international law.
Washington in August doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million.
The US military dwarfs Venezuela’s, which is debilitated by a lack of training, low wages and deteriorating equipment. Some unit commanders have been forced to negotiate with local food producers to feed their troops because government supplies fall short, Reuters has reported.
That reality has led Maduro’s government to consider alternative strategies in the event of a US invasion, including possibly a guerrilla-style response, which the government has termed “prolonged resistance” and mentioned in broadcasts on state television.
This approach would involve small military units at more than 280 locations carrying out acts of sabotage and other guerrilla tactics, Reuters has reported, citing sources and years-old planning documents.</p><small>2025-11-23 07:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634988-judges-transfer-case-five-ihc-judges-challenge-hearing-of-plea-by-fcc' target='_blank'><strong>Judges' transfer case: Five IHC judges challenge hearing of plea by FCC</strong></a><br><p>

Police officials note with concern the increasingly disturbing trend to promote obscenity, vulgarity and brandishing of weapons to terrorise citizens: the rise of negative content on TikTok, which is increasingly influencing young people.
Police say, content creators have turned to entertainment platforms like TikTok to make money by generating more views through showcasing of weapons and promoting vulgar content that is having a negative impact on society.
 
 

In some cases, the exchange of abuses on the social media platform led to fire fight between individuals, resulting in killings.
Taking note of the increasing trend, Peshawar police recently launched a crackdown against those responsible for pushing boundaries and were promoting negative content through vulgar videos and showcasing of weapons.
According to data, 91 cases have so far been registered for vulgar content, resulting in 94 arrests. Additionally, 657 cases have been registered for showcasing weapons leading to 681 arrests.
The police data reveals that majority of those arrested are men misusing the social media platform with a significant number of cases involving the display of pistols to semi-automatic and automatic weapons on the popular platform.
A local TikToker argued that there were many reasons why people engaged in abusive conversation on live videos on the social media platform. “Some individuals believe that they will get more views than normal videos, while others do it for fame, seeking attention in form of likes, comments and followers.”
Interestingly, some individuals claim that they are trying to break free from extremism, using the platform as a space to express themselves in way they feel are liberating.
But while the crackdown helped sent out a strong message with some content creators repenting their behavior in social media posts and video statements promising to become good citizens, police say that some content creators have adopted novel methods to escape the dragnet of law by relocating to other cities to be able to upload videos from outside of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Some TikTokers voiced their concern, arguing that the crackdown was an infringement on their right to freedom of expression and free speech.
They believed they should be free to express themselves without fear of censorship, referring to Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which guaranteed the right to freedom of expression. But police said that the freedom had limits regarding “decency and morality”.
A sociologist at the University of Peshawar said that some users might engage in such behaviour due to disconnect in their desires and reality.
“People’s desires can drive them to create negative content. The desire for attention and social media fame can lead people to create content that pushes the boundaries. This is often a result of daydreaming where people’s desires are different from reality, leading to a kind of addiction that blurs the boundaries of modesty,” the sociologist explained.

He said that the nation wouldn’t allow the government to accept the supremacy of the United States in connection with foreign policy and internal affairs of Pakistan. He said that Islam does not provide immunity to anyone, be it a marshal or a president.
He directed his party workers to invite all political workers without discrimination to join their struggle to change the ‘corrupt and dilapidated’ system.
Talking about reforms to empower people, he lambasted the Punjab government and questioned why it had not held local government elections in the past one and a half decade.
Talking about the education sector, he said the provincial governments had allocated tens of billions of rupees for the sector, yet the situation was utterly disappointing.
Taking a dig at PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, he said that he claimed to be a democrat, however, he himself was a typical feudal landlord. He questioned why the people of rural Sindh were still deprived of their rights. “A capitalist mindset is making the poor even poorer,” he said, adding that the “Badal Do Nizam” (change the system) movement must also be expanded within Sindh to eliminate feudalism and oppression.
If given the opportunity, he promised to fully empower institutions at the grassroots level, establish neighborhood justice committees, and reform the judicial system in accordance with the Constitution.
He said that Bhutto and Imran Khan raised slogans against feudalism, but later made the same feudals their political guardians. “We will not come to power through anyone’s blessings but through the will of the people,” he said, adding that corporate feudalism had now replaced traditional feudalism, enslaving the public even further.
He said the movement was committed to establishing equal education for all, ensuring labour rights, and guaranteeing fundamental rights for women according to the Constitution.
He also condemned the entrenched power of feudal lords, tribal chiefs, generals, and bureaucrats who “exploit 250 million people to please their superiors.”
“The state is prepared to enforce its writ in every matter except providing education to the youth,” he said.
A prize distribution ceremony was later held to encourage the young talent in the society. Seasoned economists, political scientists and industrialists shared their views and shed light on the potential of Pakistan and the red tape culture, coupled with corruption in almost every sector.

He was talking to the media after offering condolences to the family of PPP leader Mian Manzoor Ahmed Maneka.
Mr Ashraf said that Mian Manzoor Maneka was an asset of the PPP, who stood with the party through thick and thin.
He said it was not appropriate to comment on the IMF report and take it as a benchmark. All constitutional institutions should work within their limits, he said, adding that the Chief Minister of KPK should meet the founder of PTI to seek guidance.
To another question, he said that no government wanted inflation, but it was true that it had been out of control. But now, it was bridled to a great extent.
He said that the PPP had an agreement with the PML-N that the local bodies elections would be held in the province soon.

In a detailed response, Ms Bukhari said that the chief minister “never interferes in the work of any government official,” and that all meetings inside jails were strictly governed by established prison rules.
 
 

She said that political meetings were categorically prohibited under jail regulations, and the jail superintendent was the “final authority” on all such matters. She explained that prison officials only facilitate meetings between inmates and their immediate family members and that the list of approved visitors was provided by the prisoner himself.
“If an inmate does not wish to meet someone, jail authorities cannot forcibly arrange such a meeting,” she added.

Suggests KP CM to study the law; Kundi again rules out governor’s rule

Clarifying the situation of the PTI founder, Ms Bukhari said that he was allowed meetings twice a week and had already held 420 meetings with his lawyers and 189 meetings with his family members. She noted that meetings requested by Bushra Bibi’s family were handled separately.
“Yet, every week, a rally is staged outside the jail as if no meetings are being allowed,” she remarked.
Criticising Sohail Afridi, the minister said that he should “study the law himself before attempting to lecture others”.
 
 

She accused him of standing alongside “convicted offenders of the May 9 attacks” and of intimidating government officials during political gatherings.
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Kareem Kundi has again ruled out the possibility of imposition of governor’s rule in KP and termed the social media reports of his removal baseless.
He said his Friday’s meeting with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif was to discuss the law and order situation and other matters related to the well-being of the people in KP.
He was talking to the media at Kothi Nawab Shaib after offering condolences with former MNA Nawabzada Ghazanfar Gul on the demise of his brother and veteran parliamentarian Nawabzada Mazhar Ali Khan here on Saturday.
JUI-F MNA from KP Noor Alam Khan, ex-MPA Nawabzada Haider Mehdi, Gujrat PML-N president Tahirul Mulk and other members of Nawabzada family were also present at the occasion.
Mr Kundi said the KP province had been a victim of terrorism but still some elements were unnecessarily opposing even the intelligence-based operation.
He said now the educational institutions had come under attack of terrorists who had also been targeting the police, army and Frontier Constabulary which could not be tolerated.
He said the role of federal government and armed forces was vital for the peace and stability in the KP where huge reservoirs of oil, gas and other mines had been found which could become beneficial for the country and the province.
Earlier, he offered prayers for the departed soul.
Meanwhile, former federal minister Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain and his son and PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi also offered condolences with the Nawabzada family on the death of the ex-MNA.
Wajahat and his son, have been the political rivals of the Nawabzada family for the last three decades in the electoral politics of NA-63 (Jalalpur Jattan-Tanda) of Gujrat district.
Senior PPP leaders Nadeem Afzal Chan, Qamar Zaman Kaira and others also visited the Nawabzada family for the condolences.

Earlier on Friday, KP chief minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi in a media interaction in Islamabad told reporters that he intended to attend NFC inaugural meeting.
He said that he was going to attend the meeting as it was a matter of provincial rights and that the Centre should pay Rs3 trillion of liabilities.
On Saturday, KP adviser to chief minister on finance Muzzammil Aslam in a social media post stated the shared a range of items which the province was expecting from the 11th NFC Award.

Province seeks to align Award with ‘ground realities’

He said that the KP was looking towards the financial merger for erstwhile Fata into federal divisible pool. “Currently, merged area gets special grants from federal government. This will pass on the burden on provinces and relief to federal government,” he said.
 






KP government has been of the view that from 7th NFC to 10th NFC, vertical and horizontal distribution remained intact despite25th Amendment (merger of Fata into KP).
The provincial government has been pushing to align NFC with the change in population, geography and backwardness, as post-merger province’s revised divisible pool share goes up to 19.64 per cent of the total instead of existing 14.62 per cent.
 
 

Mr Aslam also said that the 11th iteration of the NFC Award would also hopefully remove the grievances of small provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan.
He said that the province was also looking towards improvement or reconstitution of the horizontals of provincial horizontals (population, revenue, poverty and reverse population density) and adding climate, water resources, population control, own source revenue collection and human development index as new horizontals
In addition to this, he said that province was also hopeful of retaking non-divisible pool resources which the federal government passed on to provinces without any yard stick (such as subsidies). “In that small provinces are getting less as compared to larger provinces,” he said.
Besides, he said that KP was also looking towards complete devolvement of some expenditure borne by federal government to provinces which doesn’t belong to the Centre as well as identifying the new avenues to improve revenue to GDP and essentially tax to GDP ratio.
He said that they were also hopeful of serious discussion on provincial finance commission (PFC) and assessment of its current status.
Mr Aslam said that the province also looked up to restructuring and rationalisation of federal expenditures, which were challenging federal government fiscal management.
“Fiscal indiscipline and gaps identified by recent International Monetary Fund corruption diagnosis report may ensure extra resources for federal government without disturbing the 57.5: 41.5: 1 percent vertical distribution,” he said.
He said that the province also wanted independent audit of population province-wise.

Mehsud, along with his other associates, has been booked in a case pertaining to opening fire on people protesting against a fatal accident involving a dumper on the night between Nov 3 and Nov 4 in the Nishtar Road area. On the next day, the suspect had moved the court and got interim pre-arrest bail.
On Saturday, Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Irshad Hussain rejected the pre-arrest bail application and also recalled his interim bail after hearing both sides and examining the record.
The court noted that the act of indiscriminate firing on people by a guard of the applicant was an act of terrorism and the case should be exclusively tried by an anti-terrorism court.
The suspect appeared in court and as soon as the order was announced he managed to escape from the court premises and police as well as the investigating officer (IO) failed to arrest him.
In its order, the court stated that as per the footage produced by the IO, the applicant along with his guard was present at the scene and the latter opened straight fire at the people, which created terror, fear and insecurity among the public.
It also noted that the permit of the weapon used in the crime was also not valid as it had expired in September.
The court observed that although no one sustained firearm injuries, the act of indiscriminate firing on the people amount to use of lethal force in public.
It said that the case came within the ambit of Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and there were reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed the offences of terrorism, rioting and attempted murder.
Initially, the FIR against Mehsud was lodged under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed) and 337-H (ii) (rash or negligent act to endanger human life) of the Pakistan Penal Court against the dumpers association’s head at Garden police station.

PM Shehbaz receives a presentation on initiatives to improve Pakistan Railways.—APP

• ADB approves $10m for railway improvement project
• PM for adopting public-private partnership for rail land
ISLAMABAD: With the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approving $10 million in assistance for preparing the Railway Improve­ment Project, Pakistan Railways is moving to outsource 11 more trains, a step expected to generate an additional Rs8.5bn for the country’s largest state-owned rail operator.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting on Pakistan Railways on Saturday, where he was informed that tenders had been floated for outsourcing the eleven passenger trains to the private sector. Pakistan Railways has already outsourced four trains.
 
 

The meeting was also informed that railway hospitals in Lahore, Karachi, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta and Sukkur were being outsourced, while the outsourcing of railway schools, colleges and rest houses was already underway. Similarly, dry ports in Islamabad, Lahore and Azakhail were also being handed over to private operators.
It was also noted that 40 luggage and brake vans had been outsourced, which are expected to bring in an additional Rs820m. The outsourcing process for two cargo express trains was in progress and is projected to generate Rs6.3bn in additional revenue.
Addressing the meeting, the premier stressed that a public-private partnership model shou­­ld be adopted when managing Pak­istan Railways’ land and properties.
 
 

He said that the railway system serves as the backbone of a country’s economy and directed that top-tier legal and economic experts be engaged, especially for projects related to regional connectivity and cross-border rail links.
He appreciated the ongoing measures for the revival of the railway system and commended Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and his team.
The meeting was infor­med that the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul train service would resume soon, and preliminary work on the Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan-Afghan­istan-Pakistan rail corridor was underway.
A plan was being developed for upgrading the Karachi–Kotri section of Main Line-1 and Main Line-3.
The premier was informed that so far, 155 railway stations have been equipped with solar power. Seven digital portals under the ‘Rabta’ initiative are operational, 56 trains have been shifted onto the new system, and 54 stations have been digitised.
Free Wi-Fi service has been provided at the Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad stations.
An online freight booking system has been launched while a pilot digital weighing bridge has been installed at Karachi City Railway Station.
To enhance security, 148 AI-powered surveillance cameras have been installed, and ATM machines are being set up at railway stations.
Cleanliness services have also been outsourced.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill heard the bail petition during a hearing held at Kot Lakhpat jail.
Barrister Taimur Malik argued on behalf of the petitioner and referred to the rule of consistency applied to other accused people, including PTI founder Imran Khan, former senator Ejaz Chaudhry and former governor Umar Sarfraz Cheema by the courts granting bail to them in similar cases.
The judge approved the bail for Dr Rashid in the case, subject to furnishing surety bonds worth Rs100,000.
However, he adjourned the hearing of the PTI leader’s bail petitions in three other cases till Nov 25.
In a statement, Barrister Malik said his client should be granted bail in the remaining cases as well on the same legal principle.
He added that later if the high court accepted her suspension applications, she could be released pending the outcome of her appeals against the convictions. The PTI Punjab president has already been convicted in four other May 9 cases including an attack on the Shadman police station.
Statements recorded
An anti-terrorism court also recorded the statements of 10 police personnel in a case related to violence at GOR-I neighbourhood during the May 9 riots.
The prosecution presented the police officials as its witnesses. A prosecutor told the court that 57 witnesses had testified in the case so far. The court summoned more prosecution witnesses on Nov 25. The Race Course police had registered the case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking the main gate of GOR-I Club Chowk and damaging property.

• Leaders warn of fracture in multilateralism
JOHANNESBURG: A Group of 20 leaders’ summit in South Africa adopted a declaration addressing the climate crisis and other global challenges on Saturday after it was drafted without US input, a move a White House official called “shameful”.
The declaration, using language Washington has opposed, “can’t be renegotiated”, South African Pre­sident Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson told reporters. “We had the entire year of working towards this adoption and the past week has been quite intense,” the spokesperson said.
President Ramaphosa, hosting the weekend gathering in Johannes­burg, said earlier there was “overwhelming consensus” for the summit declaration.
Envoys from the G20 drew up the draft on Friday without US involvement, according to four sources familiar with the matter.
The document utilised language long disliked by the Trump administration, stressing the seriousness of climate change and the need to better adapt to it. It praised ambitious targets to boost renewable energy and noted the punishing levels of debt service suffered by poor countries.
 
 

The inclusion of climate change language served as a snub to US President Donald Trump, who has doubted the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities. US officials had previously indicated they would oppose such references.
“We should not allow anything to diminish the value, the stature and the impact of the first African G20 presidency,” Ramaphosa said in his opening remarks.
His bold tone presented a striking contrast to his subdued decorum during a visit to the White House in August. During that meeting, Ramaphosa endured Trump repeating a false claim that there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa. Trump subsequently said US officials would not attend because of allegations that the host country persecutes its white minority.
‘Geopolitical fractures’
The G20’s role in fixing economic crises is threatened by geopolitical fractures, leaders warned, however, despite the boycott, Ramaphosa downplayed Trump’s absence and argued the G20 remained key for international cooperation.
However, French President Emmanuel Macron warned during the summit that “the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle.” Speaking at the opening, Macron noted that leaders are “struggling to resolve major crises together around this table”.
In a sign of other geopolitical fissures, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen warned in a speech about “the weaponisation of dependencies.” This was a reference to China’s export curbs on rare earths vital for the energy transition.
While the US skipped the summit, it still intended to take up the G20 baton for the next gathering. Trump plans to stage that summit in 2026 at a Florida golf club he owns.

• Drone attack on Lebanon leaves one dead, five hurt
• Canadian PM, UAE president back comprehensive Palestinian peace plan
• Hamas says ‘escalating violations’ place a responsibility on mediators and US
CAIRO: Israel continued its deadly assault blatantly violating ceasefire agreements on two fronts with airstrikes on Saturday that killed at least 21 people in Gaza and one in southern Lebanon, despite assurances from Palestinian resistance groups that they remain fully committed to the accord.
Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 21 people and wounded several others, local health authorities said, posing a further test to the six-week-old ceasefire.
Witnesses and medics said the initial attack struck a car in the densely populated Rimal neighbourhood, setting it ablaze. It was not immediately clear whether the five dead were passengers in the vehicle or included passersby. Dozens of people rushed to extinguish the fire and rescue the victims.
 
 

Shortly after the attack on the car, the Israeli air force carried out two separate airstrikes on houses in Deir Al-Balah city and Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least four people and wounding several others, medics said.
The Israeli military claimed a gunman had exploited the “humanitarian road in the area through which humanitarian aid enters southern Gaza” to cross into Israeli-held territory. The military said it was striking targets in Gaza in response.
A Hamas official in Gaza rejected the Israeli military’s allegations as baseless and an “excuse to kill”, insisting the group was committed to the ceasefire agreement.
Hamas said in a statement earlier on Saturday that Israel’s “escalating violations” place a responsibility on mediators and the US to confront the aggression and preserve the ceasefire.
While the October 10 ceasefire in the Gaza war has eased the conflict — enabling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to Gaza’s ruins and increasing aid flows — violence has not completely halted.
Palestinian health authorities say Israeli forces have killed 316 people in strikes in Gaza while Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began since the truce began. Some observers are concerned Israel is seeking to reassert itself.
Attacks in Lebanon
Violations also continued on another front, where an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed one person on Saturday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. The death occurred in the latest attack despite a nearly year-long ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
In a statement, the ministry attributed the death to “an Israeli enemy strike” on a vehicle in Zawtar al-Sharqiyah. The National News Agency identified the man killed as Kamel Reda Qarnabash.
The ministry also reported that a grenade dropped by an Israeli drone in the southern town of Shaqra wounded five people.
The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the deadly incident in Zawtar al-Sharqiyah but claimed it struck “several Hezbollah launchers that were recently identified and placed in military sites in southern Lebanon”.
Lebanon has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement reached in Nov 2024 by continuing its strikes and maintaining forces inside Lebanese territory. According to the health ministry, more than 330 people have been killed in Lebanon and 945 wounded since the ceasefire.
The attacks follow an Israeli strike Tuesday night on the Ain al-Hilweh camp for Palestinian refugees in southern Lebanon that killed 13 people.
A secondary school in the camp stated on its Facebook page Thursday that two of its students were killed in the attack, publishing an image of two adolescent boys.
Canadian PM, UAE president meet
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met on Nov 20 in Abu Dhabi to advance bilateral ties and discuss Gaza peace plan, Canada’s government said on Saturday.
Regarding Gaza, the leaders reaffirmed a shared commitment to a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace” based on the two-state solution, leading to a sovereign, independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel.
Both sides welcomed the leadership of US President Donald Trump and his “comprehensive peace plan” to end the war in Gaza, as well as the adoption of Resolution 2803 by the UN Security Council as a key instrument for implementation.

I’m always glad to see regional and provincial languages promoted at our literary festivals, and this year at Adab, one of the languages of Gilgit-Baltistan — Burushaski to be precise — was included in a mushaira in which poets Ahmed Ali Jan and Qamar Kazmi participated.
This inclusion resonated with me this year because I’ve been teaching expository writing at the AKU’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences this semester, and many of my students come from Gilgit-Baltistan, Chitral, Hunza, Kohistan. They’ve left their homes up in the mountains to seek knowledge in the big bad city of Karachi, but they’re also educating everyone here about themselves, their land, culture, norms and values, and their dreams and hopes for the future.
At first I had no idea of Gilgit-Baltistan’s Buddhist history, or how Sufi preachers brought Islam to Baltistan from Persia and Central Asia. Nobody taught me that the Gilgit Scouts mutinied in 1947 to overthrow the Dogra kings of Jammu and Kashmir, and that’s how Gilgit-Baltistan came under Pakistan’s jurisdiction. We still operate in a headspace where those separate regions are collectively and dismissively called ‘the Northern Areas’ and envisioned as a land of great natural beauty simply waiting for us to discover it. We lack true understanding or knowledge of its rich history, culture, religions, and societies. Part of this is because of its isolation — the Karakoram Highway reconnected Gilgit-Baltistan by road to the rest of the country in 2017. But even now, we do not care to learn about their religions, their folklore, or their political aspirations to becoming a fifth province of Pakistan.
I now know the names of the languages: Burushaski, Shina, Khowar and Waakhi, as I hear the students speaking them every day in the halls of the university. These young adults are trying to figure out their place in the federation of Pakistan. As their society transitions, they are vulnerable to outside forces that threaten to overwhelm their culture and exploit their material wealth. The promotion of Gilgit-Baltistan’s languages and literature (mostly an oral tradition) at festivals that can showcase their art, their music, their culture, their scholars, is a huge opportunity for cultural diplomacy within our nation.

We lack true knowledge of GB’s rich history.

This year, sociologist Dr Nosheen Ali and research scholar Aziz Ali Dad have established the very first independent press in Gilgit-Baltistan, Raachi Publications. It is named after the traditional female deity who is the guardian spirit of the land. Raachi’s first book is Beyond the Mountains: Social and Political Imaginaries in Gilgit Baltistan, co-edited by Dr Ali and Aziz Ali Dad. It’s been successfully launched in Pakistan, the UK and the US, where Dr Ali teaches at New York University. When Aziz Ali Dad gave a talk at my university this month, I was informed the book is already out of print.
The book consists of 16 chapters written by different researchers that explore a multitude of facets about life, land and social thought in Gilgit-Baltistan. Muhammed Feyyas discusses geopolitics, statehood and violence; Khalid Manzoor Butt writes of ethnic diversity and collective actions. There are several chapters on politics and governance in Gilgit-Baltistan, and how the people are struggling for participation. Dr Ali writes a chapter identifying Gilgit-Baltistan as the “Eco-Body” of the nation. The book is a perfect representation of the region: multilingual, collaborative and indigenous, which also reflects the ethos and social awareness of its people as it passes throu­­gh a crucible of mo­­dernisation and de­­-velopment. They worry: what of theirs will truly survive?
Another thing I have learned is the Gilgit-Baltistan reverence for the natural world and everything in it. The animist religious tradition believed that not just humans, but also animals, mountains and rocks have a spirit; glaciers have genders and can be ‘married’ (as described in Uzma Aslam Khan’s excellent Thinner Than Skin).
Aziz Ali Dad spoke of how Gilgit-Baltistan is the land of juniper trees, and that these trees were where fairies loved to perch in throngs. But now, instead of fairies, people look at those juniper trees and only see the money they can fetch on the market.
The people of Gilgit-Baltistan see their land and their lives as rich, thriving and meaningful. They seek a path to development that preserves and restores their heritage, keeping their values and voices intact.

This has resulted in the total commercialisation of education, with private schools burdening parents with unreasonable costs. Taking note of parents’ complaints, the Competition Commission of Pakistan has issued notices to 17 private school systems to inquire into alleged non-transparent selling practices, such as forcing parents to purchase mandatory branded school books, stationery and uniforms. Parents had also complained of arbitrary price hikes. Many schools disallow the purchase of cheaper generic notebooks. In August, the Senate Standing Committee on Education had also taken note of complaints that many private schools were hiking annual fees beyond the legal limit. As per the law, schools can only increase fees by 5pc every year. When asked about the CCP’s concerns, a representative of a private schools’ association observed that the “topic needs some clarity”.
It is a fact that if it were not for private schools, Pakistan’s education situation would be even more dire. As per official figures from 2021-22, private institutions educate 25.5m children, which is over 46pc of total enrolled students. The figures have likely increased. This makes students, in the words of the CCP, “captive consumers”; private schools know that in order to give their children a better future, parents will enrol their kids with them. While it is true that many of these school systems are not charity institutions, and need to cover their costs, economic realities must be kept in mind. Fees rise every year, but family budgets are stagnant or rapidly shrinking. Therefore, private schools must not force parents to purchase expensive supplies from exclusive distributors, and must also reconsider arbitrary fee hikes. The long-term solution is a quality public sector education system. But until that dream is realised, private schools must not burden parents with exorbitant costs.

• Firms cut purchases by 23m kg in four years
SWABI: Tobacco purchasing companies have slashed their demand for the 2026 crop by 13.183 million kg, marking the fourth consecutive year of reduced requirements. This cutback is expected to result in significant financial losses for local tobacco farmers, sources told Dawn on Saturday.
Tobacco experts noted that while multinational and national firms have the capacity to store large quantities of tobacco, growers face major challenges due to limited financial resources and storage options. The inability to store crops like Virginia and White Patta tobacco means any surplus must be sold quickly, leaving growers at the mercy of fluctuating market demand.
For 2026, the total demand from tobacco companies is set at 61.627m kg, with 58.184m kg of flue-cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco, 0.360m kg of dark air-cured tobacco, 1.342m kg of White Patta, 1.381m kg of burley, and 0.360m kg of sun-cured tobacco.
This marks a significant reduction from previous years, with companies cutting their demand by 23.873m kg over the past four years. In 2023, total demand was 85.5m kg, which fell to 77.322m kg in 2024, 74.810m kg in 2025, and will drop to 61.627m kg in 2026.
The bulk of tobacco purchases is made by multinational companies, with a smaller portion allocated to national companies and smaller tobacco entrepreneurs. Among multinational firms, Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) and Philip Morris (Pakistan) Ltd are the largest buyers, with a combined demand of over 36m kg of FCV tobacco in 2026. The remaining FCV demand will be met by 78 national companies, including Khyber Tobacco.
Shift in tobacco requirements
The Pakistan Tobacco Board (PTB) has noted that while demand for FCV, dark air-cured, and sun-cured tobacco has decreased in 2026, demand for White Patta and burley tobacco has increased slightly. FCV tobacco remains the primary focus for both multinational and national companies, given its use in cigarette manufacturing and export.
Iqbal Shewa, a prominent tobacco grower, stressed that both multinational and national companies are primarily concerned with FCV tobacco for export and cigarette production. To avoid confusion during the purchasing season, PTB has instructed tobacco companies and landowners to formalise agreements for the upcoming year and share those agreements with the board. Farmers have been advised to grow tobacco in line with these agreements to avoid complications during the buying season.
Price discrepancies and low profit
Ayaz Khan, a former PTB director, explained that companies are reducing their demand for the 2026 crop in part because of the price discrepancy between the weighted average price (WAP) and the minimum indicative price (MIP). The WAP for the current year was set at Rs 719 per kg, while the MIP for surplus tobacco was set at Rs 545 per kg. Companies, Mr Khan said, profited from purchasing surplus tobacco at the MIP, which was Rs174.8 less than the WAP, resulting in significant savings for them but at the expense of the growers. This year’s surplus tobacco amounted to 35.35m kg, which allowed companies to profit by Rs6.17 billion, a windfall that was not shared with the farmers.
 
 

In contrast, the farmers have faced significant losses. The lower purchase prices have put them in a difficult financial position, with many reliant on tob­acco cultivation for their annual income.
Surging exports
Despite the reduced demand for domestic consumption, tobacco exports have seen a marked increase. In 2023-24, Pakistan exported 20m kg of tobacco, rising to 47m kg in 2024-25, an increase of 135pc year-on-year. However, despite this rise in exports, companies have kept their domestic purchase demand low to avoid paying higher prices for surplus tobacco.
Mr Khan also pointed out that the increased exports have not led to corresponding benefits for local growers. Instead, the companies’ strategy of reducing domestic purchases and capitalising on cheaper surplus tobacco has disproportionately benefited the tobacco industry, while the farmers and government have borne the brunt of the financial losses.
The ongoing reduction in tobacco demand by purchasing companies is creating a challenging environment for tobacco growers, who face severe financial losses due to lower prices and limited storage options. While companies continue to benefit from price discrepancies and increased exports, farmers remain the biggest losers in this equation.

This has increasingly dominated public and political analyses, intensifying significantly over the last two decades.
The current era is widely considered distinct from previous periods of political division. Today’s political polarisation is characterised by an unprecedented level of animosity. One should keep in mind that affective polarisation differs from ‘ideological polarisation.’ The latter is strictly measured by policy differences. 
As noted by Estonian scholar Andres Reiljan, affective polarisation is fundamentally “about people’s feelings”, creating a society split into “mutually hostile political groups” and fostering a powerful “tribal” instinct. Individuals begin to strongly identify with their political party and express a wider hostility toward the opposition. This mentality is strengthened when social identities merge with political affiliations. 
According to Reiljan, some political parties and media outlets often exacerbate this divide for financial or political gain, choosing to intensify conflict rather than promoting consensus. This cycle leads individuals to perceive fellow citizens through a prejudiced lens, based solely on political preferences. 

As political disagreements turn into social suspicion and emotional hostility, a new form of division is taking root around the world

A 2020 study by the American Family Survey indicated a significant decline in marriages and romantic relationships between Democrats and Republicans, as individuals increasingly prefer partners who share their political views. 
Such divisions are being reported from multiple countries. People don’t just dislike the other party’s policies, they dislike the supporters of the other parties as well. Consequently, relationships and social networks are being formed that are politically homogeneous. If one has friends across the political aisle, they often avoid discussing political or social issues to maintain the relationship.
A 2022 study by the US-based Pew Research Centre shows that affective polarisation leads partisans to attribute negative, non-political traits to the opposing group. The dislike is so strong that it becomes a moral judgement. Partisans are less likely to trust members and supporters of the opposing party, even in non-political contexts. They are also less likely to feel empathy for the opponent group when it experiences a personal or financial setback.
On social media platforms, for example, one can see clusters supporting a party actually celebrating the misfortunes of supporters or members of the opposing party. Survey data shows that partisans frequently describe the opposing side as dishonest, unintelligent, immoral or unpatriotic. This shifts the debate away from policy disagreement toward identity rejection.
Indeed, the characteristics of affective polarisation are mostly observed in right-wing populist parties and in groups that support them. But these characteristics are increasingly becoming common among ‘left’ and ‘liberal’ sides also. The latter two often pose as being more sorted, decent, ‘balanced’ and ‘democratic’. They really aren’t. 
The ‘agenda’ of all involved remains the same, though: to question and even demolish the credibility of perceived enemies through echo chambers and internet cliques and mobs. Sometimes even friends and acquaintances aren’t spared. And here lies another aspect of affective polarisation, which rebounds and causes polarisation within a group. 
According to a 2025 study published in the Communications Psychology journal, as affective polarisation intensifies, it begins to impact the inner dynamics of the groups too. Members of a group may begin to turn on each other, causing the fragmentation of the group. 
The segregation and divisions that affective polarisation creates and the mistrusting mindset that it produces, eventually leads to infighting within groups. One can witness this in right-wing populist groups as well as in left and liberal groups and cliques, and even among members of the media.
When some members of a group become more extreme than the parent camp, factions develop. These factions begin to distance themselves from the initial opposing camp, as well as the parent camp. One can see this happening within groups that support US President Donald Trump and those who support the former prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan. It’s also quite common within clusters of social activism. 



 
But what causes affective polarisation? A 2025 study by the Berlin Social Science Centre suggests three main reasons. First, current society is less and less structured along permanent formal social groups. There is a decreasing number of memberships in formal civil society organisations and in mainstream political parties. Emotions now play a more central role in identification with a social group and are strategically used to win and maintain group members. Therefore, the ‘us versus them’ mindset is robustly shaped and readily accepted.
Second, social media and digital platforms are increasingly crucial as moderators of public discourse. Social media offers networked flows of communication and a broad set of attitudes that compete with each other for societal attention. Social media postings with a higher intensity of emotional tone are known to elicit more attention and are shared more widely. Thus, emotive arguments have a systematic benefit on social media. This reinforces discourses that are polarising instead of compromising. 
Third, it has become quite obvious now that social and political mechanisms developed by modernity to encourage rational thinking have been eroding for years. The idea of the ‘importance’ of emotions has returned to claim that emotions were always important in the exchange between the state and the polity. Apparently, those who designed and implemented mechanisms to shape a rational polity failed to see this and are therefore struggling to constructively channel the outcomes of the returning emphasis on emotions. 
These are the factors, the study suggests, that are behind the increasing incidents of hate speech, tribalisation, incivility, intolerance and the dehumanisation of political opponents. Affective polarisation is also threatening governance by undermining rational and reformist means of resolving political, economic and social issues.
Affective polarisation symbolises the failure of rational mechanisms. Indeed, these failed and undermined the importance of what they were discouraging or suppressing. From the late 1970s onwards, the ‘post-modernists’ rejoiced this failure by romanticising emotion, intuition and impulse. But by doing this (through academic means, marketing, religious revivals and pop culture) they ended up thoroughly demonising rationality. 
The result was not really societies brimming with joyous, free and tolerant people, but societies pregnant with mistrust, emotional chaos and an overindulgent misuse of certain vital democratic notions, especially freedom of speech.

“Pakistan has strengthened its global digital connectivity with the deployment of the SEA-ME-WE 6 submarine cable system, a 19,200-km high-capacity fibre network linking Pakistan to countries between Singapore and France,” said the statement from the ministry.
The cable has a total capacity of over 100 terabit per second and it will provide “one of the lowest-latency routes between Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe”.
It added that Pakistan has been allocated a total of 13.2tbps, with 4tbps being activated immediately — expanding the country’s international bandwidth capacity and enhancing support for cloud services, data centres, fintech, e-commerce, streaming, and the broader digital economy.
 






The press release added that SEA-ME-WE 6 features “more fibre pairs and more than double the capacity” of previous SEA-ME-WE systems, enhancing resilience and diversification across high-traffic Asia-Europe routes through trans-Egypt geo-diversified crossings and landing points.
“The system enables rapid scalability, improved fault protection and lower total network ownership costs for participating service providers, while adding an essential new redundancy layer to the global internet backbone.”
It added that the consortium involved in the project included Pakistan’s Transworld Associates, Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company, Bharti Airtel, Dhiraagu, Djibouti Telecom, Mobily, Orange, Singtel, Sri Lanka Telecom, Telecom Egypt, Telekom Malaysia and Telin.
In February, Pakistan Tele­communication Com­pany Ltd successfully landed the Africa-1 submarine internet cable at Karachi.
In December, Trans­world Associates linked the Africa-2 cable to its landing station in Karachi.
Currently, six cables, with a capacity of 13tpbs, bring internet to Pakistan: Asia-Africa-Europe 1 (AAE-1), South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 (SMW4) and India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE), managed by PTCL; and South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 5 (SMW-5) and Transworld Associates 1 (TWA-1), operated by Transworld Associates.

The by-election is being held after the seat fell vacant in July following the death of Azhar’s father, Mian Azhar.
In a post on X, Hammad said: “We are receiving reports that multiple presiding officers are missing Form 45s in the election materials they have received from ECP (Election Commission of Pakistan) for the by-elections of tomorrow. This is a serious violation of the electoral process.”
 






The alarm came after he had earlier issued “important instructions” for his party’s polling agents about the forms.
“When the bags containing election materials are opened in the morning, make sure that the Forms 45 and Forms 46 in them are blank and shown to you. This is most important.”
The PTI leader stressed the importance of the polling agents’ presence during the polling and the counting processes. “The polling boxes must not be out of sight at any moment.”
Hammad further told the agents that it was their “right to obtain the Form-45 [filled] as per the count”, and that any staff who obstructed this would be liable to strict legal punishment.
He directed all PTI workers at the party camps outside the polling stations to remain there after the polling had ended and “peacefully follow the presiding officer to the returning officer’s (RO) office”.
 






A candidate or their election agent can appoint “as many polling agents as may be prescribed” for each polling station to observe the process on behalf of the candidate under the Elections Act 2017.
In another post, Hammad also gave a message to the presiding officers and the polling staff, urging them not to indulge in any “illegal act”.
“We are aware that you are being frightened and threatened,” the PTI leader claimed, adding that those who were allegedly doing so were “finding immunity for themselves, buying property abroad and moving their families there”.
“They will push you into [carrying out] unconstitutional actions and flee themselves,” Hammad contended.
“Be careful! Do not put yourself in difficulty by taking any serious and illegal action at the behest of any intruder,” the PTI leader said, urging them to fulfil their duty.
 






The NA-129 seat is being contested by Mian Azhar’s nephew Chaudhry Arsalan Ahmad — nominated by Hammad, who himself is absconding as he is wanted by the state in different cases.
Hafiz Mian Nauman, who was defeated by Mian Azhar by a margin of over 30,000 votes in the 2024 elections, is once again the PML-N’s candidate.
The PTI has accused the PML-N’s Punjab government of employing rigging tactics in support of its candidate in the NA-129 by-poll.
Yesterday, Hammad said officials of the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) were appointed as presiding officers for the polls contested by Nauman, who has served as chairman of the Lesco Board of Directors.
Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt, however, rebutted Hammad’s post, stating that the appointments were the decision of the ECP and not Lesco or any other government organisation.
 
 

Before the election campaign could pick up, the local police officials, caught on video footage, were seen removing banners of the PTI candidate.
Similar to the situation during the 2024 general elections, Ahmad is contesting as an independent candidate on the “geyser” symbol, instead of the “bat” due to the revocation of the party’s electoral symbol last year.</p><small>2025-11-22 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22195051055c15c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956710/nawaz-sahibzada-star-as-pakistan-romp-to-seven-wicket-victory-against-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz, Sahibzada star as Pakistan romp to seven-wicket victory against Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>Spinner Mohammad Nawaz set it up for Pakistan before opener Sahibzada Farhan finished it off to the joy of a packed crowd at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.
With Nawaz (3-16) weaving his magic with the ball, including two wickets in two balls, in the Twenty20 tri-nation clash, Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to 128-7 before romping to their target with 4.3 overs to spare in their Twenty20 tri-nation series clash on Saturday.
Sahibzada led the batting effort with his sixth T20 half-century, hitting five sixes and six fours in an explosive 80 not out off 45 balls, as Pakistan eased to a six-wicket victory that made in two in two for the hosts, who beat Zimbabwe by five wickets in the series opener.
Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have no wins in two with the defeat following a humbling at the hands on Zimbabwe on Thursday.
But it had seemed all so different at the start when skipper Dasun Shunaka won the toss and elected to bat with openers Kamil Mishara and Pathum Nissanka tearing into Pakistan’s bowling with the latter cutting away Salman Mirza for four on the first ball of their innings.
Mishara then pulled Mohammad Waseem Jr, in for the injured Shaheen Shah Afridi, for six and then smashed Salman for a four and a six off consecutive deliveries in the third over.
Mishara then slashed at Faheem Ashraf and got a top-edge that ran for four but his enterprising 22 off 12 ended on the next ball when he was undone by the change of pace and found Fakhar Zaman at mid-off.
One-drop Kusal Mendis, didn’t last long as he was run out in an attempt to scamper a quick two and Sri Lanka ended the powerplay at 44-2 after the incoming Kusal Perera pulled Faheem away past mid-on for four.
Spinner Abrar bowled an expensive first over, giving away 11 — four of them wides, with Perera raising Sri Lanka’s 50 with his second four. But Abrar hit back in his second over, having Nissanka caught at long-off for a sluggish 23-ball 17 and Sri Lanka trudged to 65-3 by the midway point of their innings.
Perera, who made 25 off 19, welcomed Saim Ayub into the attack with a six over deep square leg but Nawaz’s double-wicket burst left Sri Lanka reeling.
First Perera was cleaned up with a ball that was tossed outside off but turned enough to find a way between bat and pad and hit the off-stump before Shanaka was sent packing in similar fashion.
From 78-3, Sri Lanka slipped to 86-6 when Nawaz had Kamindu Mendis caught thanks to a superb display of athleticism by Waseem in the deep.
A first boundary in six overs came when Janith Liyanage, who hit a valiant 41 not out, lifted Abrar straight back over his head for six on the first ball of the 17th and as Sri Lanka crossed 100, Wanindu Hasaranga got a four over extra cover two balls later.
An upper-cut for off Waseem got Liyanage his first four and he followed it up with another off Salman in the penultimate over before Hasaranga (11) holed out in the deep.
Liyanage, though, couldn’t give Sri Lanka the lift they were looking for in the last over with just seven coming off it.
Pakistan got off to a flyer in the chase, Saim (20) getting the first boundary when he dispatched a full toss by Eshan Malinga and the left-hander ended the second over with two fours through the offside.
Sahibzada got on the act, lifting Hasaranga over mid-off for four and then hitting Dushmantha Chameera for a four and six — over square leg.
Saim sliced Shanaka for four to bring up his 1000 runs in T20Is but was stumped two balls later.
Sahibzada, though, was unfazed by losing his opening partner; crashing Vijayakanth Viyaskanth for four as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 53-1.
A glorious cover drive by Sahibzada off Malinga ended a 24-ball boundary drought and Pakistan were well-placed after ending the first 10 overs at 68-1.
Viyaskanth was then crashed by Sahibzada for a four and six, both in the square leg area, off consecutive balls before the right-hander raised his half-century off 33 balls.
At the other end, Babar Azam (16) got his first boundary on the 17th ball he faced when he pulled away Shanaka for six.
Sahibzada, though, was having no difficulty in getting the big hits — smoking two sixes off Hasaranga in the 13th over and following it up with another down the ground in the next off Chameera, who hit back by cleaning up Babar and trapping captain Salman Ali Agha lbw off consecutive balls.
But with Sahibzada at the crease, Pakistan had no late jitters and the right-hander lifted Malinga for four to seal a comfortable victory for his side.</p><small>2025-11-22 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/221915095a77b0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956712/ptis-jhagra-assails-govt-says-judicial-distrust-creating-hurdles-in-foreign-investment' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Jhagra assails govt; says judicial distrust creating hurdles in foreign investment</strong></a><br><p>PTI leader Taimur Saleem Jhagra said judicial corruption and institutional distrust were barriers to capital investment in the country, while he assailed the government on Saturday following the release of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) report.
The report, published earlier this week, highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan driven by systemic weaknesses across state institutions and demanded immediate initiation of a 15-point reform agenda to improve transparency, fairness and integrity.
Speaking at a press conference today about the report in Islamabad with former Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair, Jhagra highlighted a portion of the report that said: “The judicial sector that is organisationally complex is not able to [reliably] enforce contracts [or protect property rights] due to problems with efficiency, antiquated laws and the integrity of judges and judicial personnel.”
“[The report] also points out how capital investments in the country have been undermined by concerns over vulnerability to corruption of judicial institutions,” said the PTI leader.
“A barrier for investment in Pakistan is that the investor is scared of the fact that your judicial institutions are corrupt,” Jhagra said.
He added that according to the IMF, the judiciary was also unable to play a role in the economy besides political issues and those related to justice in society, as distrust in the system drove investors and businessmen away.
Speaking about the role of the National Accountability Bureau, he said the report criticised its structure and said anti-corruption efforts were constrained by “heavy reliance on a single institution exposed to strong political influence”.
“When IMF is saying there is corruption in Pakistan, and IMF states that the institutions in Pakistan, meant to fight corruption, have no coordination, and their actions are influenced politically; do you accept that or not?”
“If there is one thing that is written about the most, it is that everything is in the government’s hands,” said the former finance minister of KP.
As per the IMF, “state domination extends to employment, where the state employs 72 per cent of individuals with formal jobs”. In reference to this part, Jhagra said undue favours were inevitable when the state ran sectors that it should not.
The IMF pointed out, as emphasised by Jhagra, that the country’s sugar sector was a case study of how the intertwined relationship between economic and political elites and state regulators had combined to capture public benefits at deep cost to the populace.
“Firms in the sugar sector benefited from favourable government policies, subsidies and regulatory loopholes for decades, mainly due to the nexus between industry magnates and political leaders,” as per the report.
Jhagra also pointed out how the report criticised the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), saying that it operated with “untested transparency and accountability provisions”.
Giving his own thoughts on the matter, Jhagra said the SIFC was brought about by the PML-N government to keep the stakeholders of the self-admitted current hybrid setup placated and content.
“They knew that it would not bring a penny’s worth of investment and neither have they tried.”
Jhagra said there were only two paths left after the report’s release, one was for the government to begin working on the issues and solutions outlined or to give answers to the questions being raised since the revelations were made public.
However, he quipped that the first was unlikely since “the government won’t remain and the SIFC won’t remain”.
Meanwhile, Zubair alleged that the IMF report was only disclosed by the government after “immense pressure” from the institution.
He further alleged that the SIFC awarded contracts to favourite contractors and that those who were involved in the sugar scandal were protected.
The former PML-N stalwart said 240 million people were suffering because of the policy failure of the current government, which had converted into an economic crisis.
He also said that it was unfortunate that no government representative had denied the report even after the passage of 48 hours. The former governor demanded an investigation after the report’s disclosures.
The politicians, under the banner of opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, lashed out at the government and accused it of hiding the report for three months.
They also alleged that the report had identified corruption worth Rs5,300 billion in the governance system and termed it the “worst financial scandal” of the country’s history, demanding that the names of those responsible be made public.</p><small>2025-11-22 16:10</small></div><hr>
