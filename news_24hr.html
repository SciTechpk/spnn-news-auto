US President Donald Trump’s administration on Wednesday ordered the resumption of student visa appointments but significantly tightened its social media vetting in a bid to identify any applicants who may be hostile towards the country, according to an internal State Department cable reviewed by Reuters.
US consular officers are now required to conduct a “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles”, said the cable, which was dated June 18 and sent to US missions on Wednesday.
In Instagram posts uploaded today, the consulates said: “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to ‘public’ to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States.”

They added that since 2019, the US has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms. The post stated that applicants had to fill out social media identifiers and account handles for each platform on the application form.
“Omitting social media information on your application could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future US visas,” the consulate warned.
F and M are different student visa types, while the J visa is a nonimmigrant visa for individuals approved to participate in exchange visitor programmes in the US.
On May 27, the Trump administration ordered its missions abroad to stop scheduling new appointments for student and exchange visitor visa applicants, saying the State Department was set to expand social media vetting of foreign students.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said updated guidance would be released once a review was completed.</p><small>2025-06-26 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26183252ea14ca3.jpg?r=184233' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920303/finance-bill-sails-through-parliament-to-greenlight-rs1757tr-budget' target='_blank'><strong>Finance Bill sails through parliament to greenlight Rs17.57tr budget</strong></a><br><p>The Finance Bill, 2025, was approved by parliament on Thursday, meaning that the Rs17.57 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year has been greenlit.
The PPP on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend “contentious” clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s amendments to various legislation, including the Income Tax Ordnance, 2001, were all approved, while opposition amendments were rejected, according to a Dawn.com correspondent.
The bill was read out in the assembly and approved clause by clause. The session has been adjourned until 11am tomorrow.
 






Addressing the House, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said his party would “happily support the budget,” since the government had accepted the party’s proposals.
“We appreciate the government’s efforts as BISP’s (Benazir Income Support Programme) budget has been increased,” he said. “Moreover, the salaried class will not be taxed if their income equals to Rs1.2m per year and the solar tax has been reduced by 50 per cent.”
Bilawal added that after the PPP’s initial rejection, their recommendations regarding the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were accepted.
“We are grateful to the government and the prime minister for accepting our proposals,” Bilawal said.
Meanwhile, amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, presented by Aurangzeb were approved by a majority vote in the House.
The amendment granted the finance committee powers to arrest traders involved in tax fraud exceeding Rs50 million. The federal government had earlier proposed an amendment to give the powers of arrest to the tax commissioner.
“The FBR will not have the power of arrest during the investigation stage,” the amendment added.
All amendments introduced by the opposition in the Sales Tax Act were rejected by majority vote.
Similarly, an amendment to the Salaries and Allowances Act was presented with the support of the finance minister, according to which ministers and ministers of state will receive the same salary as members of parliament.
The amendment was approved by a majority vote.
107 institutions granted tax-exempt status
During the session, 107 entities— including lawyers’ bodies, hospitals and government projects — were granted tax-exempt status as part of amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
The finance minister’s amendments were all approved, while those presented by the opposition were rejected.
According to the amendments, the following institutions and organisations are exempt from tax:

Provincial bar councils
Pakistan Bar Council
The Military Foundation
Army Welfare Trust
Foundation University
Forman Christian College
LUMS
Ghulam Ishaq Khan University
FBR Foundation
Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital
The Edhi Foundation
Al-Shifa Trust and Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital
The Poverty Alleviation Fund
National Rural Support Programme
National Endowment Scholarship
Pakistan Agricultural Research Council
Audit Oversight Board

Under the amended ordinance, the pensions of former presidents and their widows will also be tax-exempt.
Earlier this month, Aurangzeb unveiled Pakistan’s annual federal budget in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.
The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.
The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.

Illegal production jumped to 3,708 tons, nearly 34 per cent more than in 2022, and more than four times higher than 10 years earlier, when it was at a low, the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its annual report.
The current surge is mainly due to an increase in the size of the area under illicit coca bush cultivation in Colombia and updated yield data, it added.
Global cocaine seizures, too, recorded a high of 2,275 tons, marking a 68pc rise in the four years to 2023. The number of cocaine users also grew to 25 million in 2023, up from 17 million ten years earlier.
 






“Cocaine has become fashionable for the more affluent society,” UNODC chief researcher Angela Me said, noting a “vicious cycle” of increased use and production.
While Colombia remains the key producer, cocaine traffickers are breaking into new markets across Asia and Africa, according to the report, with organised crime groups from the Western Balkans increasing their influence.
Captagon
“A new era of global instability has intensified challenges in addressing the world drug problem, empowering organised crime groups and pushing drug use to historically high levels,” UNODC noted.
In 2023, 6pc of the population aged between 15 and 64 are estimated to have used a drug, compared to 5.2pc of the population in 2013.
Cannabis remains the most widely used drug.
Seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants also reached a record high in 2023, making up almost half of all global seizures of synthetic drugs, followed by synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, UNODC said.
The fall of ruler Bashar al-Assad in Syria last December has “created uncertainty around the future of the captagon trade”, UNODC added.
Earlier this month, Syria said authorities had seized all production facilities of the illicit stimulant, which became Syria’s largest export under Assad.
“The latest seizure data from 2024 and 2025 confirm that captagon is continuing to flow — primarily to countries of the Arabian peninsula — possibly indicating the release of previously-accumulated stockpiles or continued production in different locations,” UNODC said.</p><small>2025-06-26 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/261758184432f42.jpg?r=181026' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920247/7-killed-39-injured-in-multiple-incidents-as-rain-lashes-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>7 killed, 39 injured in multiple incidents as rain lashes Punjab</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people were killed and 39 others were injured in multiple rain-related incidents as Punjab was battered by heavy monsoon showers on Thursday, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and Rescue 1122.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.
Earlier today, the PDMA said that four people died and 19 were injured in rain-related incidents.
According to the data, 13 incidents were reported across Punjab, with the majority of them in the Okara district. Two children are among the four deceased.
The majority of incidents were roof collapses caused by rain.
“Two citizens were killed by the collapse of dilapidated and decaying buildings in Okara and Bahawalnagar,” a PDMA handout read. “Two citizens drowned in Jhelum … 13 dilapidated and mud houses were affected by monsoon rains.”

According to the data, one child was killed in Okara, one in Bahawalnagar and two men in Jhelum.
Punjab rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said that the deceased child in Okara was a five-year-old girl.
“[The girl] drowned in a storm drain in Basti Riazabad in Okara,” Ahmed was quoted as saying in a statement. “Another person drowned in a storm drain in Jhelum, while two people were injured in Sohawa. A search operation is underway.”
The spokesperson added that a person in Okara was injured in a lightning strike.
“The public should avoid electric poles, hoarding boards and low-lying areas,” the spokesperson warned, urging them to call 1122 in case of emergencies.
A statement by the Rescue 1122 also confirmed the deaths of one each in Okara, Bahawalnagar, and two in Jhelum.
It further said that two people died when a wall collapsed in Muzaffargarh, while one person died and another was injured after lightning struck in Khanewal.
Rescue 1122 said that emergency rescue services were provided to a total of 46 people in the last 24 hours, including 39 of those who were injured and taken to the hospital.
The statement said, “In Multan, three people were injured when a wall collapsed in Basti Rata,” adding that three others were injured when a roof collapsed in Latifabad.
Another roof collapse incident in Faisalabad injured one person, while two people were injured in more roof collapse incidents each in Shorkot and Sahiwal, according to Rescue 1122.
In Mandi Bahauddin, two children were injured by electrocution, the statement added.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia issued instructions to provide the best available medical assistance to the injured.
“As per the instructions of the Punjab Chief Minister, losses incurred by citizens will be compensated,” Kathia said. “Assistance will also be ensured to the families of the deceased under the government policy.”
DG PDMA also directed citizens to take precautionary measures, stating that this spell of monsoon rains will continue until July 1.
Separately, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had earlier predicted rainfall and thunderstorms across the country, warning of the risk of flash floods and urban flooding.
In a weather forecast, the Met Office said, “moist currents from [the] Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are penetrating in most parts of the country. A westerly wave is also affecting the upper parts of the country.”
The weather agency forecast widespread rainfall and thundershowers on Thursday in Azad Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the federal capital Islamabad.
It added that rain thundershowers with gusty winds may also occur at isolated places in southeast Sindh and northeast/south Balochistan during the period.
“On Friday, widespread rain and thundershowers with isolated heavy rainfall is expected in Azad Kashmir, KP, Islamabad, and upper and central Punjab. Rain thundershowers with gusty winds are likely in south Punjab, Sindh and northeast and south Balochistan,” it added.
In the previous 24 hours, the weather agency reported rain and thundershowers in Upper KP, Upper Punjab, Islamabad, Azad Kashmir and northeast Balochistan. Hot and very humid weather prevailed over other parts of the country, it added.

The maximum temperatures recorded yesterday (Wednesday) were Dalbandin 46°C, while Sibbi, Jacobabad, Bhakkar, Bahawalpur, Dadu, and Nokkundi recorded 45°C.
The Met Office warned that heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in local streams of Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, DG Khan, and parts of northeast Punjab and Azad Kashmir.
It further warned that heavy downpour may cause urban flooding in low lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera, Charsadda and Peshawar, and in Karachi and Hyderabad on June 27.
“Landslides may cause road closures in the vulnerable hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat, Azad Kashmir during the wet spell,” it added.
It warned that heavy downpour, windstorm and lightning may affect daily routines, and may damage weak structures of houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels during the forecast period.
In light of the forecast, the Punjab government intensified emergency measures following the prediction to receive 25 per cent more monsoon rains this year in the province.
Monsoon rains have commenced in Punjab and the first spell will continue till July 1. Rainfall with strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted in most districts of the province.
Rain expected in Karachi
The PMD had earlier issued a weather forecast for Karachi division, according to which isolated rains and thunderstorms are expected on Friday evening.
The weather in the city today has been forecast as partly cloudy and humid, with chances of isolated light rain and drizzle. The maximum temperature will remain between 35-37 °C and humidity levels of 70-80pc.

A Brussels summit held by the group to raise money on Wednesday was overshadowed by a video message sent by US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who raised sweeping vaccine safety doubts without evidence and announced an end to Washington’s support.
“We were disappointed to see the video,” Gavi CEO Sania Nishtar told AFP in a phone interview.
“Of course, we disagree with many of the things that were narrated in the video. It’s unfortunate but we are hopeful of a positive relationship with the United States. We will continue to engage them.”
The United States’s funding withdrawal comes as Gavi and the United Nations reported in April that outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, meningitis and yellow fever are on the rise globally amid misinformation and cuts to international aid.
Gavi secured more than $9 bn (7.7 bn euros) in pledges on Wednesday, short of the $11.9 bn the group said it needed to fund its operations for the next five years, when it hopes “to protect 500 mn children from preventable disease”.
Yet, Nishtar said that was a “positive result” at a time when many donor nations had other priorities, including ramping up defence spending, and as international aid as a whole is in decline.
Despite Washington pulling support, Gavi was “in a very good position,” she added. The United States currently contributes around 13 per cent of the group’s core budget.
Blistering attack
On Wednesday, Kennedy — who spent decades spreading vaccine misinformation before becoming President Donald Trump’s top health official — said the United States “won’t contribute more” until Gavi re-earns “public trust”.
In a blistering attack, he accused the group of pushing unsafe vaccines in the developing world.
“When vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem,” Kennedy said in a clip that was played at the summit.
“In its zeal to promote universal vaccination, it has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,” he added.
 






He raised concerns in particular over a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, known as DTPw, which is widely used in lower-income nations.
Gavi replied that the DTPw vaccine is used in developing nations as the disease burden there is much higher than in high-income parts of the world.
The shot is more potent, with longer-lasting effects than the alternative used in the West, it added.
“In places where access to hospitals is limited and disease risk is high, the stronger protection from DTPw against these life-threatening diseases far outweighs the temporary side-effects this vaccine may cause,” Gavi said.
Nishtar also questioned the idea that her organisation had to regain public trust.
“We have so much demand for vaccines from the countries that we support that we are unable to fulfil them. When you go to the field, you see women lining up to get the children vaccinated,” she said.
“There’s immense trust already there,” she added
European countries and the European Union jointly pledged more than two billion euros to Gavi, according to Brussels. Another $1.6 bn was offered by the Gates Foundation of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.</p><small>2025-06-26 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26170052f7eb287.jpg?r=173721' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920290/german-police-shoot-dead-afghan-man-after-officer-stabbed' target='_blank'><strong>German police shoot dead Afghan man after officer stabbed</strong></a><br><p>German police said on Thursday they had shot dead an Afghan man after he used a knife to attack officers trying to arrest him, seriously wounding one of them.
The incident happened in the southern city of Wangen when two officers attempted to detain the 27-year-old man at his home to take him to serve a prison sentence for assault.
“In the course of the operation, the man suddenly pulled out a knife and attacked the officers without warning,” police and prosecutors said in a joint statement. “As a result of the attack, the police officers fired several shots.”
The Afghan died at the scene despite efforts to resuscitate him, they said. One officer was seriously injured after being stabbed several times, but was not in a life-threatening condition.
The authorities have launched an investigation into the use of a firearm by police.
Several serious attacks in Germany carried out in recent times — some by migrants — including knife attacks and car-rammings, fuelling a heated debate on immigration.
Chanceller Friedrich Merz, who took power in May, has launched a crackdown on irregular immigration, which includes turning away most undocumented migrants at Germany’s borders.</p><small>2025-06-26 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26143754782d5c5.jpg?r=145008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920241/fact-check-videos-of-iranian-armed-forces-thanking-pakistan-for-support-against-israel-are-ai-generated' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Videos of Iranian armed forces thanking Pakistan for support against Israel are AI-generated</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users on social media platforms X and Facebook since Monday shared videos allegedly showing Iranian armed forces thanking Pakistan for intelligence support against Israel. However, the viral clips are AI-generated.
Israel launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences, killing top commanders, scientists and hundreds of others on June 13. Both countries traded wave after wave of devastating strikes and missile volleys since then. A ceasefire was achieved on June 24 after 12 days of fighting.
On Monday, a pro-military account on Facebook shared a video of two soldiers allegedly recording a video in gratitude to Pakistan.
“Our nuclear programme is safe. Thank you, Pakistan, for protecting it with your intelligence support,” they said.
The post was captioned: “An Iranian soldier thanking Pakistan, saying: Thank you, thank you, thank you.”
The post gained 1.4 million views and 12,000 reactions.
The viral clip was also shared here, here, here, here and here, and on X here, here, here and here.
Another similar video went viral with among social media users on Wednesday, showing Iranian soldiers expressing gratitude to Pakistan, as can be seen here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in diplomatic relations between Iran and Pakistan amid the conflict with Israel.
An observation of the video revealed signs of AI-generated content, including a plastic-like skin texture, unnatural lip movements, and fixed eyes with no blinking throughout the viral clip.
Analysing the video using tools to detect manipulation revealed that Hive Moderation assigned it a 57 per cent suspicion rating, Attestiv.ai gave it a 30pc rating while Deepware did not flag the content as a deepfake.
 


The viral clip also featured a Veo logo on the bottom-right corner, a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind.
Looking up the username @isipakistan440 as visible in the clip yielded a TikTok account, featuring similar AI-generated videos with nationalistic content.
As for the second video, an observation showed the same signs of AI-generated content.
Analysing the video using the tool revealed that Hive Moderation assigned it a 31pc suspicion rating, while Deepware did not flag the content as a deepfake.
 


It also featured a Veo logo in the bottom-right corner.
A reverse image search yielded a TikTok post from account @waggyai, featuring the same video posted on Monday.

As evident from the account name, the user routinely posts AI-generated media exploring geopolitical themes.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that viral videos show Iranian armed forces thanking Pakistan for intelligence support against Israel is false. The videos are AI-generated.
Multiple claims
At the same time, iVerify Pakistan observed multiple other claims regarding celebrations in Iran after the ceasefire. Here are more claims that were debunked by the platform.
- Image of Tehran celebrations — FALSE
On Tuesday, a pro-Iranian user shared an image of Tehran’s Milad Tower on X, captioned: “Tehran now … The Iranian capital is celebrating the great victory. Tap like and share the photo.”
The post was seen by more than 2.5m people.
The same image was also shared on X by an Indian actor and film critic, where it garnered over 88,000 views.
Several other X users also shared the same claim as can be seen here, here, here, here, here and here, collectively gaining more than 30,000 views.
It also appeared on Facebook, receiving over 1,000 reactions.
A reverse image search led to an Instagram post by the account lorestan_travel_guide, a self-described tour guide, dated October 27, 2020. The post featured the same image with the caption: “Milad Tower, also known as Tehran Tower, is a multi-purpose tower in Tehran, Iran. It is the sixth-tallest tower and the 24th-tallest freestanding structure in the world.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Additionally, the same image had been shared previously in September and November 2024.
Therefore, the claim that an image shows celebrations in Tehran after the ceasefire is false. The image is not from recent celebrations and has been online since at least 2020.
- Tehran rally thanking Pakistan — FALSE
On Wednesday, an X user shared an eight-second clip showing a large crowd of people gathered on a city street, appearing to be in a celebratory or protest mood.
The caption on the post read, “In today’s rally held in Tehran, young people are holding the Pakistani flag and expressing their gratitude to Pakistan.”
The post received 43,600 views.
“The same clip was shared by several other X users as seen here, here, and here, collectively accumulating 6,000 views.
The clip was also found on TikTok.
Examining the viral clip reveals several inconsistencies. The walking style of the crowd appears unnaturally fast and gliding, giving the impression that individuals are being slid rather than walking naturally.
At the five-second mark, people can be seen moving in different directions and oddly passing through one another. Additionally, those raising their hands while chanting slogans display unusual hand movements — some hands visibly pass through others’ heads.
 


The presence of the “Veo” watermark at the bottom-right corner indicates that the video was created using AI-generated inputs.
Examining the video using AI detection tools revealed that Hive Moderation flagged it with a 99.9pc likelihood of being AI-generated.
 


Therefore, the claim that a video shows Iranians thanking Pakistan in a Tehran rally while carrying the flag is false. The video is a deepfake.

After waves of Israeli attacks on nuclear and military sites and retaliatory missile fire from Iran since June 13, the United States bombed three key Iranian atomic facilities at the weekend.
The extent of the damage in Iran, where Israel said it had acted to stop an imminent nuclear threat, has become the subject of profound disagreement in the United States.
An initial classified assessment, first reported by CNN, was said to have concluded that the strike did not destroy key components and that Iran’s nuclear programme was set back only months at most.
Another key question raised by experts is whether Iran, preparing for the strike, moved out some 400 kilogramme of enriched uranium — which could now be hidden elsewhere in the vast country.
 
 

The US administration has hit back furiously, with Trump repeatedly saying the attack “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities, including the key site of Fordo buried inside a mountain.
“I can tell you, the United States had no indication that that enriched uranium was moved prior to the strikes, as I also saw falsely reported,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.
“As for what’s on the ground right now, it’s buried under miles and miles of rubble because of the success of these strikes on Saturday evening,” she said.
 






Trump said that Hegseth, whom he dubbed “war” secretary, would hold a news conference at 8am (5pm PKT) on Thursday to “fight for the dignity of our great American pilots”.
CIA chief John Ratcliffe said in a statement on Wednesday that “several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years”.
 






The Israeli military said it had delivered a “significant” blow to Iran’s nuclear sites but that it was “still early” to fully assess the damage.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that “we have thwarted Iran’s nuclear project”.
“And if anyone in Iran tries to rebuild it, we will act with the same determination, with the same intensity, to foil any attempt,” he said.
Nuclear talks?
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei told Al Jazeera that “nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that’s for sure”.
After the war derailed nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, Trump said Washington would hold discussions with Tehran next week, with his special envoy Steve Witkoff expressing hope “for a comprehensive peace agreement”.
Trump told reporters that Israel and Iran were “both tired, exhausted”, before going on to say that talks were planned with Iran next week.
“We may sign an agreement. I don’t know,” he added.
Iran has systematically denied seeking a nuclear weapon while defending its “legitimate rights” to the peaceful use of atomic energy.
It has also said it was willing to return to nuclear negotiations with Washington.
In both Iran and Israel, authorities have gradually lifted wartime restrictions.
Iran on Wednesday reopened the airspace over the country’s east, yet without allowing flights to and from the capital Tehran.
In the Israeli coastal hub of Tel Aviv, 45-year-old engineer Yossi Bin welcomed the ceasefire: “Finally, we can sleep peacefully. We feel better, less worried… and I hope it stays that way.”
State funeral
While Iran and Israel have been locked in a shadow war for decades, their 12-day conflict was by far the most destructive confrontation between them.
The Israeli strikes on Iran killed at least 627 civilians, Tehran’s health ministry said.
Iran’s attacks on Israel killed 28 people, according to official figures.
According to Mehr news agency, the funeral of Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami, who was killed in an Israeli strike, will no longer be held in his hometown on Thursday.
Instead, a state funeral will be held on Saturday in Tehran for top commanders, including Salami and nuclear scientists, killed in the war.</p><small>2025-06-26 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/261446234e377d9.jpg?r=144941' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920266/interior-ministry-vows-to-take-strict-action-against-religious-hate-online-during-muharram' target='_blank'><strong>Interior ministry vows to take strict action against religious hate online during Muharram</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Interior on Thursday announced that it planned to take strict action against elements spreading religious hate on social media as part of a security plan ahead of the month of Muharram.
The government has ramped up security efforts in the past few weeks as the first month of the Islamic calendar inches closer. KP and the Punjab government have planned to impose Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10, barring public gatherings, protests, or other actions that might disrupt peace.
The central Ruet-e-Hilal committee is set to meet today for the sighting of the moon for Muharram.
According to a statement from the ministry today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi chaired a meeting aimed at reviewing the security plan for the month.
“It was decided that action will be taken against elements inciting religious hatred on social media in light of Muharram,” it said.
“In this regard, PEMRA (Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority) has been instructed to monitor hateful content on electronic and social media.”
The meeting reviewed the security plan for Muharram in all provinces, including Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Islamabad, in detail, planning to take necessary administrative measures to ensure a peaceful Muharram across the country.
Naqvi promised to cooperate on all possible fronts to ensure peace, particularly in AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad.
On the matter of internet and mobile phone service being suspended during processions, the meeting detailed that the decision will be taken in consultation with each province, keeping in view the security situation of each respective province.
“All the necessary steps and decisions will be taken with the mutual consultation,” the minister said, warning that no one would be allowed to incite religious hatred or provocation.
Detailing further security measures, he shared that Muharram processions will be monitored via modern technology.
Inspector general (IG) of police and Secretaries from all provinces, including Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as the capital, gave a briefing on the security plan at the meeting.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, federal secretary interior, acting chairman CDA, commandant Frontier Constabulary, deputy commissioner Islamabad, deputy inspector general of police Islamabad, ministry of interior and senior officials of law enforcement agencies were also present at the meeting.
Meanwhile, other senior officials of law enforcement agencies attended the meeting via video link.
Muharram is a month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide.
It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where, amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.
Keeping in view the need for extra security due to the spike in religious activity during the first 10 days of Muharram, authorities make arrangements accordingly.
Last week, the Punjab home department took additional security measures, including the deployment of armed forces where required, to ensure peace in the province during Muharram.</p><small>2025-06-26 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611038-will-punjab-suspend-cellular-services-during-muharram' target='_blank'><strong>Will Punjab suspend cellular services during Muharram?</strong></a><br><p>

The London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed moments after takeoff from India’s Ahmedabad city on June 12, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and the rest on ground in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
The black boxes of the plane — the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) — were recovered in the days that followed, one from the rooftop of a building at the crash site on June 13, and the other from the debris on June 16.
 
 

They were transported to national capital Delhi on Tuesday, where a team led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau began extracting their data, the ministry said in a statement.
“The Crash Protection Module (CPM) from the front black box was safely retrieved, and […] the memory module was successfully accessed and its data downloaded […] the analysis of CVR and FDR data is underway,” it said.
The CPM is the core part of a black box that houses and protects data recorded during a crash.
 
 

India said last week that it was yet to decide where the black boxes would be analysed. The data retrieved from them could provide critical clues into the aircraft’s performance and any conversations between the pilots preceding the crash.
The air disaster has also brought renewed attention to violations of norms by airlines in the country.
India’s aviation regulator said on Tuesday that multiple instances of aircraft defects reappearing were found at the Mumbai and Delhi airports — two of India’s busiest.
Reuters has reported that warnings were given by India’s aviation regulator to Air India, which has come under increased scrutiny since the crash, including for permitting some aircraft to fly despite emergency equipment checks being overdue.
The airline has also been warned for violations related to pilot duty scheduling and oversight.
Air India has said it had implemented the authority’s directions and was committed to ensuring adherence to safety protocols.
It also said it was accelerating verification of maintenance records and would complete the process in the coming days.</p><small>2025-06-26 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611024-provinces-to-be-consulted-on-muharram-mobile-internet-suspensions' target='_blank'><strong>Provincial govts to be consulted on suspension of mobile, internet services during Muharram</strong></a><br><p>

Enacted in January this year, the act aimed to transform Pakistan into a “digital nation” by enabling a digital society, digital economy, and digital governance. The bill was approved by the federal cabinet in June 2024.
The bill said it was expedient to enable the people to become a digital nation by leveraging the transformative power of digital technologies, responsible use of data, innovative service delivery models and robust digital public infrastructure to accelerate sustainable economic development, improve citizen well-being, and modernise governance frameworks for efficient and effective public service delivery.
According to a notification issued today by the ministry of IT and telecommunication, “the search committee will appoint a chairperson and two members of the PDA.”
Federal Minister for IT Shaza Fatima Khawaja has been appointed as the convener of the search committee.
 
 

The committee will recommend three candidates for each position and make recommendations regarding salaries and benefits of the chairman and members.
Other members of the committee include the federal minister for the economic affairs division, as well as secretaries of the cabinet division, establishment division and IT and telecom division.
The Digital Nation Bill encompasses the establishment of three new bodies. The PDA will comprise a chairperson and two members, to develop, implement, and monitor the national digital master plan. This authority will also establish a monitoring and evaluation framework for digital transformation projects.
The srategic oversight committee will be headed by the IT minister, with secretaries of IT, finance, and planning, and representatives from the private sector as its members.
Upon being passed, Chairman of the NA committee Syed Aminul Haque highlighted the importance of approving the bill, stating that it was essential to transform Pakistan into a digital nation.
“The aim is to create a progressive digital society as well as promote a thriving digital economy, for which we need to establish a shared digital governance ecosystem,” Haque said, adding that all measures should not be viewed through the political lens.
He stressed that digitisation was a technical matter — a need of the times.</p><small>2025-06-26 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26134225c66bbfe.png?r=134242' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920254/pakistan-concerned-over-worst-form-of-torture-in-palestine-indian-occupied-kashmir-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan concerned over ‘worst form of torture’ in Palestine, Indian-occupied Kashmir: FO</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has expressed concerns over the “worst forms of torture” the people of Palestine and Indian-occupied Kashmir are being subjected to by foreign occupation powers, the Foreign Office said in a statement on Thursday.
There have been widespread reports of systematic torture and human rights violations by Indian occupation forces in held Jammu and Kashmir since the region was unilaterally annexed in 2019. Pakistan continues to provide political, moral, and diplomatic support to Kashmiris until they realise their inherent right to self-determination as per the UNSC resolutions.
In Gaza, Israeli forces have killed 56,156 people and injured 132,239 in the enclave since launching a military onslaught in October 2023. A human rights monitor published a report detailing the “shocking” treatment of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.
“Pakistan remains gravely concerned at the widespread and systematic use of torture as an instrument of oppression in situations of foreign occupation” the FO statement said on the occasion of the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.
“The people of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) continue to be subjected to the worst forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the occupying powers to suppress their right to self-determination.”
Pakistan stands in solidarity with the victims of torture worldwide and reaffirms its continued commitment to eradicating torture and upholding human dignity, it added.
“Islam upholds the sanctity and dignity of every human being. Any act of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is incompatible with the values of justice, mercy, and compassion that are at the core of Islamic teachings.
“Guided by these values and its international obligations Pakistan remains committed to eradicating torture and strengthening protections for all individuals,” the statement said.
It added that “legal reforms, institutional safeguards, and oversight mechanisms continue to be strengthened by Pakistan to ensure accountability and uphold the rule of law,” adding that “measures are also being taken to provide victims with medical, legal, and psycho-social support.”
Pakistan reiterates its call on the international community to condemn the crimes of these occupying powers and to hold them accountable, in addition to helping end the plight of the victims of their torture and oppression, the FO concluded.
The UN General Assembly proclaimed 26 June as the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. It marks the moment when the in 1987 when the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment came into effect.
The day is an opportunity to call on all stakeholders including UN member states, civil society and individuals to unite in support of people around the world who have been victims of torture and those who are still tortured today.</p><small>2025-06-26 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611017-karachi-braces-for-first-spell-of-monsoon-rains-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi braces for first spell of monsoon rains from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

Beijing has long sought to present the 10-member Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a counterweight to Western-led power blocs and has pushed to strengthen collaboration between its member countries in politics, security, trade and science.
The Qingdao meeting of the organisation’s top defence officials comes as a fledgling ceasefire between Israel and Iran holds after 12 days of fighting between the arch-foes.
It is also being held the day after a summit of Nato leaders in The Hague, where members agreed to ramp up their defence spending to satisfy United States President Donald Trump.
Beijing’s ties with Moscow are also in the spotlight.
China has portrayed itself as a neutral party in Russia’s war with Ukraine, although Western governments say its close ties have given Moscow crucial economic and diplomatic support.
 
 

Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov painted a bleak picture of a world seeing “worsening geopolitical tensions” when he addressed his counterparts at the meeting.
“The current military and political situation in the world remains difficult and shows signs of further deterioration,” he said, according to a statement by the Russian defence ministry.
His Chinese counterpart Dong Jun also framed Thursday’s meeting in Qingdao, home to a major Chinese naval base, as a counterweight to a world in “chaos and instability”.
“As momentous changes of the century accelerate, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Dong said as he welcomed defence chiefs from Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Belarus and elsewhere on Wednesday, according to state news agency Xinhua.

“Hegemonic, domineering and bullying acts severely undermine the
international order,” he warned.

He urged his counterparts to “take more robust actions to jointly safeguard the environment for peaceful development”.
Backing for Iran?
Recent fighting between Israel, Iran and the US will likely also be discussed in Qingdao.
Beijing refrained from offering anything more than diplomatic support to its close partner Tehran throughout that conflict, reflecting its limited leverage in the region and reluctance to worsen relations with the US.
“Public backing for Iran will come in the form of words, rather than deeds,” James Char, an expert on the Chinese army at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, told AFP.
“Other than condemning the US strikes on Iran, Beijing can be expected to continue treading cautiously in the Middle East’s security issues and would not want to be dragged into the region’s security challenges,” he said.
Iran’s defence minister will likely “discuss with China the supply of weapons but I doubt China would agree”, said Andrea Ghiselli, an expert in China foreign policy and a lecturer at Exeter University.
“It would be seen as provocative by both Israel… and, even more important for China, the US, with which Beijing is trying to stabilise relations,” Ghiselli said.
India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, also in attendance in Qingdao, said SCO members should “collectively aspire to fulfil the aspirations and expectations of our people as well as tackle today’s challenges”.
“The world we live in is undergoing a drastic transformation.
Globalisation, which once brought us closer together, has been losing momentum,” he said in comments his office posted on social media platform X.

The Special Investigation Unit of the Sindh police and an intelligence agency conducted the raid on a tip-off, SIU SSP Mohammed Shoaib Memon said, adding that they had links with the Indian intelligence agency — the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).
He identified the suspects as Mohammed Khan alias Gullu, Yameen Malah, Akhter Thaheem and Ghulam Qadir alias Akash, and claimed that they were found involved in espionage activities.
With their arrest, a plot to carry out terror attacks in the country was foiled, he said.
SSP Memon said that two hand grenades, a Kalashnikov, a rifle, two pistols and mobile phones were seized from them. The mobile phones, believed to be containing sensitive digital material, have been sent for a forensic analysis, he said.
“The suspects had made videos and captured pictures of the country’s sensitive installations, which they used to send to RAW using specialised software,” the SIU officer claimed.
According to him, the suspects admitted that they used to meet officers of RAW and Indian Border Security Force in border areas.
They received large sums of cash, liquor and valuable gifts from Indian agencies’ personnel, the SSP said.

Talking to reporters alongside Rutte at a Nato alliance summit, Trump again berated Israel and Iran.
“They’ve had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. You know, they fight like hell, you can’t stop them. Let them fight for about 2-3 minutes, then it’s easy to stop them,” he said. In response, Rutte laughed and said: “And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get (them to) stop.”
On Tuesday, after a ceasefire deal, Trump had raised eyebrows by saying Israel and Iran had been fighting “so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing”.
With the 32-member Nato alliance endeavouring to placate Trump after complaints that it was over-reliant on US financial and military muscle, Rutte was asked if he might be over-flattering the US president.
“No, I don’t think so. I think it’s a bit of a question of taste,” he said, calling Trump a “good friend” for more than a decade and praising his role in “finally” persuading Europe to boost military spending.
“So doesn’t he deserve some praise?” Rutte asked, also noting Trump’s decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites.
“And when it comes to Iran, the fact that he took this decisive action, very targeted, to make sure that Iran would not be able to get his hands on a nuclear capability — I think he deserves all the praise.”
Iran branded Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte’s gushing note to President Donald Trump on US strikes targeting key nuclear sites as “disgraceful, despicable and irresponsible”.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei hit back, saying it was “disgraceful, despicable and irresponsible for Nato’s SG to congratulate a `truly extraordinary’ criminal act of aggression against a sovereign state”. Whoever supports a crime is regarded as complicit“, Baqaei said in a post on
X.

Speaking at a webinar titled “Opportunities in Pakistan’s Mining Sector – Unlocking Mineral Potential”, the minister highlighted the country’s rich endowment of mineral resources, including gold, copper, coal, rare earth elements and other critical minerals vital for the global energy transition.
The event was jointly organised by the Ministry of Energy and the US Embassy in Pakistan to promote investment opportunities in the country’s minerals and mining sector.
Mr Malik assured that both the Government of Pakistan and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) are fully committed to facilitating international companies seeking to partner in unlocking Pakistan’s mineral reserves.
He emphasised Pakistan’s growing role in the global shift towards clean energy, citing the nation’s abundant reserves of critical minerals as a key enabler of a green transition. “Renewable energy development is central to our climate goals and economic future. We are facilitating this shift by supporting the mining of essential minerals and improving ease of doing business,” he stated.
 
 

The minister underscored the international significance of the Reko Diq copper-gold project, while also referencing recent discoveries in Balochistan’s Chaghi district and KP’s Waziristan region.
Mr Malik lauded the success of the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 (PMIF25), held earlier this year, which attracted over 5,000 participants and global attention. “PMIF25 marked a turning point, showcasing Pakistan as a serious player in the global minerals economy,” he remarked.
US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker reaffirmed the strong economic ties between the US and Pakistan. “Pakistan offers immense opportunities in the minerals sector. With one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits at Reko Diq, and a strong commitment to economic reforms, this is the right time for US investors to explore and engage,” she said.
Ms Baker welcomed Pakistan’s recent policy initiatives aimed at unlocking the sector’s potential and pledged continued support from the US Embassy in facilitating American businesses. “We are here to foster connections and build win-win partnerships. US investors have long contributed to Pakistan’s development, and we see great promise in this sector,” she added.
She concluded by reaffirming the US government’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s economic development and strengthening bilateral economic ties. “We believe in Pakistan’s potential and see shared opportunity in its journey toward inclusive, sustainable growth,” she said. The webinar was broadcast from the head office of Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) and brought together senior officials from the Ministry of Energy, leading mineral and energy firms, SIFC representatives, US diplomats, and energy sector stakeholders.

According to Kurram District Police Officer Habibullah, the blasts also resulted in injuries to four others.
Parachinar Hospital’s Medi­cal Superintendent Mir Hassan Jan told Dawn that the dece­a­sed were identified as Nawab Ali, Aamir Hussain, Hidayat Hussain, and Manzar Ali. All four died on the spot.
The injured — identified as Muhammad, Qunein, Shafaat Hussain and Hassan Ghulam — were initially taken to Para­chi­nar Hospital for first-aid, and later referred to Peshawar for further treatment. DPO Habib­ul­­lah said police teams had been dispatched to the area and that an investigation is underway.
Two of the injured, Qunein and Hassan Ghulam, told Dawn that the landmines exploded as they neared a mountain area. They said they were seriously wounded in the blasts, which also killed four of their companions and two horses on the spot.
Tribal elders strongly condemned the incident, demanding the immediate arrest of those responsible and calling for a high-level investigation. They termed the explosions an attempt to sabotage peace efforts in the region.

• Omar Ayub labels budget ‘dead on arrival’, slams inflation claims
• Rs4.8tr in grants approved for four ministries
• Finance minister claims macroeconomic stability restored
ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) came under fire in the National Assembly on Wednesday over allegations of collusion with smugglers and tax evaders, as the House paved the way for the federal budget’s passage today (Thursday).
The budget, presented on June 10, is now set to pass with previously agreed-upon amendments.
On Wednesday, the National Asse­m­bly completed the process of approving demands for grants to cover the ex­­­pe­n­ses of various ministries and divisions.
It approved 31 demands for grants totalling Rs4.814 trillion for four ministries and divisions —Finance and Revenue, Human Rights, Interior, and National Food Security — while rejecting all 430 cut motions submitted by the opposition.
Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, speaking during the debate on budgetary allocations for the Finance Division, alleged that oil worth Rs550 billion is smuggled from Iran every year.
He wondered how around 200 heavy vehicles manage to cross more than two dozen bridges daily without being intercepted, implying official complicity. Describing the FBR as “one of the most corrupt institutions”, he opposed proposals to grant it arrest powers.
He rejected the budget as “dead on arrival” and dismissed government claims of reducing inflation. He said the purchasing power of the masses continues to shrink and lamented that 44 per cent of citizens had slipped below the poverty line.
He accused the government of sig­ning flawed power purchase agreements with independent power producers (IPPs) between 2013 and 2018, saying capacity payments had soared from Rs450bn in 2018 to Rs 2.2tr.
“This regime is responsible,” he said, adding that 97pc of the fiscal deficit would be financed through bank borrowing, benefiting the owners of four private banks.
JUI-F’s Aliya Kamran voiced alarm over the ballooning national debt, noting it had swelled to Rs76tr by March — more than four times the entire budget. On tax evasion, she said the FBR’s system was weak and lacked ac­­countability. “Tax frauds are made with the help of FBR officials,” she alleged.
PTI’s Usama Ahmad Mela criticised the government’s reliance on indirect taxes, including the imposition of a carbon tax amid rising oil prices, instead of reducing the petroleum levy. He questioned the rationale behind taxing hybrid vehicles if the state was serious about promoting eco-friendly alternatives and demanded the reversal of the decision.
He also condemned the government’s policy of exporting and then re-importing 750,000 tonnes of sugar, saying it had led to a Rs50 per kilogram price hike. “If we continue surrendering to pressure groups and lobbies, we should forget about public relief,” he said.
He warned that allowing the FBR to make unlimited contract-based recruitments and leaving small business owners at its mercy would open floodgates of corruption.
JUI-P’s Shahida Begum criticised the FBR’s inaction in the face of disclosures about public officials owning large, undeclared properties, and opposed proposed powers allowing it to arrest businessmen.
PTI’s Shandana Gulzar challenged government claims of growth in the livestock sector, pointing out that the last livestock census was held in 2006. She accused the government of peddling falsehoods and pursuing anti-people policies, adding: “We are sowing the seeds of revolution in Pakistan.”
‘Macroeconomic stability’
Winding up the discussion on cut motions on demands for grants relating to the Finance and Revenue Division, Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb claimed that macroeconomic stability had been restored.
He cited improvements in economic indicators, including a stable curren­cy, increased foreign reserves sufficient to cover two and a half months of imp­orts, and reduced inflation and policy rates. “These are hard facts, independently validated by rating agencies,” he said. He said investor, business and consumer confidence had improved over the past four to five months, citing a Dun & Bradstreet survey indicating the highest consumer confidence since 2022.
On FBR corruption, he said digitisation was meant to ensure transparency and minimise human involvement, which he called the most effective way to reduce graft.
Concluding debate on cut motions related to the Human Rights Division, Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar highlighted that the National Commission for Human Rights Pakistan had, for the first time, received “A” status from a cluster of global human rights organisations. He said effective legislation had been enacted to protect the rights of women, children, and minorities.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry stated that Pakistan’s passports have been upgraded with international security features to prevent forgery. He added that airports and seaports are now integrated with AI systems to ensure that no person can leave the country without a valid visa and the necessary legal documents.

A flash flood in the Burundubar stream near Attabad Lake blocks access to the Luxus resort.—Photo by the writer

GILGIT: NDMA’s Nat­ional Emergencies Ope­ration Centre (NEOC) on Wednesday issued a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (Glof) alert for northern areas, including Gilgit-Baltistan, citing a dangerous combination of persistent high temperatures, intensified monsoon currents and a prevailing westerly wave.
The alert comes as current heatwaves intensify glacier melting across the region, leading to increased water levels and flash floods creating disasters in downstream areas.
A flash flood triggered on Wednesday by a melting glacier occurred in the Burundubar stream, which flows into the famous tourist point Attabad Lake, according to Rescue 1122.
The floodwater blocked access to the Luxus hotel, entering its premises where “a large number of national and foreign tourists were present”.

160 evacuated by boat after flash flooding near Attabad Lake

More than 160 tourists and hotel staff were evacuated by boat.
The flood also damaged trees and land, creating “panic among stranded tourists cut off from land link”.
Elsewhere, rising temperatures triggered flooding in Barga nallah in Skardu, where water “once again entered homes and crops, causing widespread destruction,” police said.
GB Environmental Pro­tection Agency’s (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that the frequency of melting glacier disasters “intensified in recent years”.
Mr Hussain attributed this to global climate cha­nge and localised factors.
“In old times, snowfall received the mountains in November to December, that was converting into ice, now snowfall in February and March, that couldn’t convert into ice, with heatwaves, the snow melting in speed that causes flooding,” he said.
He added that “localised factors including def­orestation, unplanned con­­struction, and tourism influx,” along with incr­e­ased population and certain energy practices, contribute to accelerated glacier melt.
Another environmental expert told Dawn that many in GB live “in downstream areas of nallahs and rivers and near glaciers,” and when floods hit, “they have no time to save themselves.”
The expert highlighted the broader consequences, saying, “The GB glaciers produce 80pc of Pakistan’s agricultural water. This isn’t just a GB issue — it affects the whole country.”
Concerns were also raised that the GB government “has shown little priority in creating awareness or reducing the risks of climate change and disasters.”

A lieutenant, three staff sergeants and three sergeants, members of a combat engineering battalion, were killed when an explosive device planted on the armoured vehicle they were travelling in ignited a fire, the military said on Wednesday.
The latest deaths are likely to increase public pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and end the nearly two-year-long war, a move strongly opposed by hardline members of his right-wing ruling coalition.
Public support for Netanyahu collapsed after the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas rain on southern Israel from Gaza, which exposed Israel to its deadliest security failure. But his standing has been boosted by his surprise decision to strike Iran a campaign widely viewed as dealing a significant blow to Israel’s longtime adversary.

Six Palestinian aid seekers among 20 who lost their lives to Israeli fire

Attention has shifted back to Gaza following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a truce between Israel and Iran that came into effect on Tuesday and continues to hold.
Moshe Gafne, a lawmaker from an ultra-Orthodox party within Netanyahu’s coalition government, on Wednesday publicly questioned why Israel was still locked in the war in Gaza. “This is a very sad day, with seven soldiers killed in Gaza … I still don’t understand why we are fighting there. To what end?” he told a parliamentary committee.
Hamas’ military wing confirmed that it had carried out the deadly attack in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, on Tuesday. It said its fighters had also fired an anti-tank missile at another vehicle that came to help.
The war in Gaza has isolated Israel from many of its international partners critical of the military campaign. During the 12 days Israel was fighting Iran, more than 800 Palestinians were killed in Gaza by the Israeli military, including at least 30, among them a journalist, on Wednesday, according to local health officials.
Israel kills 20 Palestinians
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 20 people on Wednesday, including six who were waiting to collect food aid in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
The latest in a string of deadly incidents near aid distribution sites came after the United Nations had condemned the “weaponisation of food” in the Gaza Strip, where a US- and Israeli-backed foundation has largely replaced established humanitarian organisations.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that six people were killed and 30 others wounded “following Israeli fire targeting thousands of civilians waiting for aid” in an area of central Gaza where Palestinians have gathered each night in the hope of collecting food rations. Bassal said the crowd was hit by Israeli “bullets and tank shells”.
Pressure grew Tuesday on the privately run aid group Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was brought into the Palestinian territory at the end of May to replace United Nations agencies.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, called the US- and Israeli-backed system an “abomination” that has put Palestinians’ lives at risk, while a spokesman for the UN human rights office condemned the “weaponisation of food” in the territory.

“I think great progress is being made on Gaza,” Trump told reporters ahead of a Nato summit in the Netherlands, adding that his special envoy Steve Witkoff had told him: “Gaza is very close.”
Key mediator Qatar announced on Tuesday that it would launch a new push for a ceasefire, with Hamas on Wednesday saying talks had stepped up.
“Our communications with the brother mediators in Egypt and Qatar have not stopped and have inten­sified in recent hours,” Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told AFP.
He cautioned, however, that the group had “not yet received any new proposals” to end the war.
The Israeli government declined to comment on any new ceasefire talks beyond saying that efforts to return Israeli prisoners in Gaza were ongoing “on the battlefield and via negotiations”.
Trump’s comments came a day after a US intelligence assessment revealed that US strikes had only set back Iran’s nuclear programme by just a few months. But on Wednesday, Trump compared the attacks to the end of World War II, arguing that the damage was severe even though available intelligence was inconclusive.
“The intelligence was … very inconclusive,” Trump told reporters while meeting with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte ahead of a summit in The Hague.
Trump said the US strikes were responsible for ending the war between Israel and Iran and compared them to the United States’ use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, which brought an end to World War Two in 1945.
“I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war,” Trump said.
Trump argued that Iran’s nuclear deal had been set back “basically decades, because I don’t think they’ll ever do it again” and he turned to top advisers to reinforce that message.
Teases nuclear talks
Trump also said the US would hold nuclear talks with Iran next week, teasing the possibility of a deal even after boasting that recent US strikes had crippled Tehran’s atomic programme.
Insisting on the “total obliteration” of Iran’s nuclear capabilities, contrary to leaked US intelligence, Trump said, “They’re not going to be building bombs for a long time,”
He added that the strikes had set back the programme by “decades” and that the ceasefire that he declared was going “very well”.
Trump later told reporters that Israel and Iran were “both tired, exhausted”, going on to say that talks were planned with Iran “next week”.
“We may sign an agreement. I don’t know,” he added.
Iran’s death toll
The spokesperson for Iran’s Health Ministry has released an updated death toll from Israel’s attacks on Iranian territory, Al Jazeera reported.
In a post on X, Hossein Kermanpour said at least 627 people were killed and 4,870 wounded in Israeli strikes.
Tehran recorded the highest number of casualties, followed by Kermanshah, with Khuzestan, Lorestan, and Isfahan reporting significant losses, he said.

• Federal cabinet likely to approve revised Finance Bill today
• Most contentious clause involves FBR’s expanded powers
• Nearly half of NA panel’s suggestions incorporated
• PM holds one-on-one meetings with MNAs to secure support for budget
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend contentious clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).
Former finance minister and PPP MNA Naveed Qamar, who currently chairs the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, met Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in a bid to build consensus on key provisions of the Finance Bill 2025.
With the clock ticking down to the National Assembly’s decisive vote on the Finance Bill on Thursday, tensions within the ruling coalition have intensified. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has meanwhile ramped up individual meetings with MNAs in the lead-up to the bill’s presentation in parliament.
According to a source in the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, the premier has been meeting five to six MNAs daily since the budget was presented — excluding days he is abroad.
Each meeting typically lasts around 10 minutes and is aimed at ensuring parliamentary attendance and addressing individual concerns. “This is an incentive for an MNA to meet the premier,” the source said, adding that, as a result, MNAs have also been attending the budget sessions in greater numbers.
Mr Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiani did not respond to messages or calls for comment.
Mr Qamar told Dawn that the final draft of the Finance Bill reflects the recommendations put forth by the standing committee. He stated that the finance committee must first approve these amendments before they are presented for final voting.
He acknowledged the PPP’s opposition to the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) proposed arrest powers for tax officials, saying the issue remained under discussion with the PML-N and would be addressed before the final vote.
Another source said the federal government is set to convene a cabinet meeting today to approve the revised Finance Bill. This marks the first time the government has incorporated nearly half of the standing committee’s recommendations into the final draft. The cabinet will endorse the revised version of the Finance Bill before presenting it to parliament for a vote.
The most contentious clause involves expanded powers for the FBR, particularly the authority to arrest and prosecute individuals in sales tax fraud cases. A compromise was reached following a proposal by PPP Senator Farooq H. Naek, with revised provisions now expected to be included in the final version.
Another controversial measure links the purchase of property and vehicles to a person’s declared income in their wealth statement. While the government has raised the threshold, the PPP argues the provision remains politically unpopular and may negatively impact the real estate sector.
A third sticking point concerns business registration under the sales tax regime. Initially, it was proposed that non-compliant businesses would face disconnection of utility services or closure. However, the government has since introduced a revised version of the proposal.
NA Finance Committee
In a departure from past practice, the chairmanship of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance now lies with a member of a coalition partner rather than the ruling party. More significantly, this is the first time the committee has conducted a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill.
Mr Qamar, the committee chairman, told Dawn this change was made possible through an amendment to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007 — introduced in September 2024 and moved by him.
The change, unanimously endorsed by the Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges, mandates that the Finance Bill be referred to the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue before passage, with a report due within 15 days.
As per past practice, the Finance Bill is laid before the Senate, where the chairman refers it to the Senate Committee on Finance and Revenue.
Meanwhile, the National Assembly typically passes the budget around 28 days later, following extensive debate and discussion. However, the Senate committee’s recommendations are non-binding and have largely gone unheeded during the passage of the final Finance Bill.
In contrast, recommendations from the National Assembly are mandatory, reflecting a growing empowerment of the lower house in the budget-making process. Currently, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance and Revenue is also a PPP senator, Saleem Mandviwalla.
As a result of this amendment, during the National Assembly’s budget session 2025, Mr Qamar presented the committee’s first detailed report on the Finance Bill, which aims to give effect to the federal government’s fiscal proposals for the year beginning July 1.
Mr Qamar described the development as a landmark achievement, marking the first time parliament has been empowered to engage in budget deliberations at a micro level.
He noted that committee members were consistently present and actively participated in detailed discussions on the Finance Bill. He added that the government had accepted most of the committee’s recommendations, despite being constrained by the IMF programme.
“This is no longer a rubber-stamp process,” Mr Qamar said, adding that the process had been shifted from the hands of the bureaucracy to the representatives of the people in parliament.

Explaining how he helped defuse tensions across the globe — from Ukr­­aine to Serbia — Trump said “the most impo­r­­tant” of these conflicts was last month’s war scare between India and Pakistan.
“And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East, like we are talking about with Israel and Iran. This is — they have nuclear weapons,” President Trump said at his news conference in The Hague, at the conclusion of a Nato summit.
Referring to recent tensions between the two South Asian neighbours, Trump said, “I ended that with a series of phone calls on trade. I said, ‘Look, if you are going to be fighting each other…’ It was getting very bad — you know how bad that last attack was. It was very bad. If you are really going to go fighting with each other, we are not going to do any trade.’ They said, ‘No, no. No, you have to do a trade deal’.”
 
 

He described a conversation with Pakistan’s army chief and praised him in personal terms: “In fact, I had the general — he was really very impressive — the general from Pakistan was in my office last week. You know Prime Minister Modi is a great friend of mine. He is a great gentleman. He is a great man. And I got them to reason. I said, ‘We are not doing any trade deal if you are going to be fighting. And if you are going to be fighting each other, we are not doing any trade deal’.”
Trump concluded, “And you know what? They said, ‘No, I want to do a trade deal.’ And we stopped the nuclear war.”
The remarks highlighted the key role played by Field Marshal Munir in easing regional tensions.
Although Trump did not name the general directly in his public remarks, he had earlier described Munir as “an exceptional human being and an inspiring personality.”
These statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.
In broader comments during the Nato summit, Trump also said, “The Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.” While brief, the comment underscored Washington’s view of Pakistan as a key regional player, especially as the US explores reopening talks with Tehran.
Trump indicated negotiations with Iran could resume “as early as next week.”
