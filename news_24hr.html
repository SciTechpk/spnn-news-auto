Thomas Barrack raised the American flag over the ambassador’s residence for the first time since the US embassy closed in 2012, underlining a rapid expansion of US ties with Damascus since President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced the lifting of sanctions and met Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.
“Syria and Israel is a solvable problem. But it starts with a dialogue,” Barrack told a small group of journalists in Damascus. “I’d say we need to start with just a non-aggression agreement, talk about boundaries and borders,” he said.
Barrack also said that Syria would no longer be deemed a state sponsor of terrorism by the United States, saying the issue was “gone with the Assad regime being finished”, but that Congress had a six-month review period.
“America’s intent and the president’s vision is that we have to give this young government a chance by not interfering, not demanding, by not giving conditions, by not imposing our culture on your culture,” Barrack said.
 
 

Interim President Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda commander, is rapidly reorienting a country that had turbulent ties with the West and close relations with Iran and Russia during more than five decades of rule by the Assad family.
Syria has long been a frontline state in the Arab-Israeli conflict, with Israel occupying the Syrian Golan Heights since a war in 1967. Israel seized more Syrian territory in the border zone following Bashar al-Assad’s ouster in December, citing concerns about the jihadist roots of Syria’s new rulers.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Israeli and Syrian officials were in direct contact, having held face-to-face meetings aimed at calming tensions and preventing conflict in the border region.
Trump urged Sharaa to normalise relations with Israel when they met in Riyadh earlier this month.
Barrack, who is also US ambassador to Turkey, was named as Syria’s US envoy on May 23.
He noted Syria had been under US sanctions since 1979. Some of the toughest were implemented in 2020 under the so-called Caesar act, which Barrack said must be repealed by Congress within a 180-day window.
“I promise you the one person who has less patience with these sanctions than all of you is President Trump,” he said.
The US closed its embassy in Damascus in February 2012, nearly a year after protests against Assad devolved into a violent conflict that went on to ravage Syria for more than a decade.
Then-ambassador Robert Ford was pulled out of Syria shortly before the embassy closed. Subsequent US envoys for Syria operated from abroad and did not visit Damascus.
During Syria’s 14-year war, hundreds of thousands of people were killed, millions were displaced both internally and outside the country and the West ratcheted up pressure against Assad by cutting ties and imposing tough sanctions, but he clung onto power with help from Iran and Russia.
Sharaa led al Qaeda’s official wing in Syria for years until severing ties with the global terrorist network in 2016.</p><small>2025-05-29 13:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29173515ea453ff.jpg?r=173641' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914095/adviser-to-the-finance-minister-announces-no-extension-in-budget-date-amid-speculation' target='_blank'><strong>Adviser to the finance minister announces ‘no extension’ in budget date amid speculation</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad on Thursday said that no decision has been made to postpone the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, clarifying that the previously announced date of June 10 remains unchanged.
Amid media reports claiming that the budget had once again been rescheduled due to the Eidul Azha holidays, Schehzad wrote on X today that no decision has been made to postpone or reschedule the budget.
“As communicated earlier, the upcoming Federal Budget FY26 is on schedule to be announced on June 10, 2025,” he wrote. “Similarly, the upcoming Pakistan Economic Survey FY25 is scheduled to be announced on June 9, 2025.”
 






Additionally, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal told reporters that there was no change in the budget date.
“The federal budget will be presented on June 10,” he told the media after exiting a committee meeting at the National Assembly.
According to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), Eidul Azha is expected to fall on June 7, which means the third day of Eid will likely fall on June 9 — the same day the Economic Survey is due to be released.
Last week, Schehzad announced on X that the federal budget would be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey would be released a day earlier.
Before that, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal announced that the federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.
Last year, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.
Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.</p><small>2025-05-29 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/291712154a5661c.jpg?r=171741' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914092/pm-shehbaz-touches-down-in-tajikistan-to-cap-off-four-nation-tour' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz touches down in Tajikistan to cap off four-nation tour</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday landed in Tajikistan as he continues his four-nation tour of friendly countries.
Earlier this week, the PM and his delegation, including Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, visited Turkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan, expressing gratitude for their support during a recent military escalation with India.
Yesterday, the PM took part in a trilateral summit with Turkiye and Azerbaijan. He reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.
According to state broadcaster PTV News, the PM arrived in the Tajik capital Dushanbe today for his two-day visit, being received by Tajik PM Kokhir Rasulzoda at the airport.
“Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also accompanied the prime minister,” PTV News reported.
 






During his two-day visit, the PM is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, in which the PM will discuss “cooperation between Pakistan and Tajikistan in various fields … and will thank the Tajik President for Tajikistan’s strong support … during the recent tensions between India and Pakistan,” the broadcaster added.
According to PTV News, the PM will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation during his visit, where he is expected to brief participants on Pakistan’s struggle against climate change and efforts to preserve glaciers.</p><small>2025-05-29 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/291704132aaf836.jpg?r=170435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914090/bulls-dominate-as-psx-rise-by-600-points-due-to-budget-expectations' target='_blank'><strong>Bulls dominate as PSX rise by 600 points due to budget expectations</strong></a><br><p>Bulls dominated the market on Thursday at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as shares rose by more than 600 points in intraday trade.
The benchmark KSE-100 index increased by 638.5, or 0.54 per cent, to close at 118,971.40 from the last close of 118,338.90.
At 1:45pm, the index stood at 1,298.02 points.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said that the market had better expectations from the budget due to which the market performed well, adding that better corporate results instilled hope.
The government has delayed unveiling the federal budget from June 2 to June 10 due to inconclusive discussions with the IMF on taxation and fiscal measures.
Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.

The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
At the height of the conflict, US President Donald Trump warned Pakistan and India of “not doing any trade” if they did not stop fighting.
A date prior, Deputy Secretary Christopher Landau met with Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in Washington, the US State Department said.  It noted that Landau “reaffirmed the close partnership between the US and India, a key component of US foreign policy for the 21st century.
“He underscored the importance of fair and reciprocal market access to fostering economic growth and prosperity in both countries,” the statement said.
It added that Landau also emphasised the importance of enhanced cooperation on migration and counternarcotics.
“The Deputy Secretary and the Foreign Secretary also reaffirmed their shared desire to maintain regional stability and peace.”
In a post on X early on Thursday, Landau spoke of his meeting with Misri, saying the US-India relationship is at a “historic zenith and represents a key partnership in the 21st Century.
“We discussed the importance of expanding fair and reciprocal trade, combatting illegal immigration, and expanding counternarcotics cooperation,” he said.
 






Earlier this month, Trump said that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods while expressing his dissatisfaction with Apple’s plans to invest in India.
New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9 on tariff hikes for major trading partners.
The US is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling some $129 billion in 2024. The trade balance is currently in favour of India, which runs a $45.7bn surplus with the US.</p><small>2025-05-29 11:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29141545d94c70c.jpg?r=142108' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914076/sri-lanka-ex-ministers-jailed-up-to-25-years-for-corruption' target='_blank'><strong>Sri Lanka ex-ministers jailed up to 25 years for corruption</strong></a><br><p>A Sri Lankan court on Thursday sentenced two former ministers from the government of deposed president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to decades in prison in a landmark corruption case.
Ex-sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage and former trade minister Anil Fernando were found guilty by the Colombo High Court of misappropriating 53 million Sri Lankan rupees ($177,000) of state funds.
The pair were also fined $2,000 for using government money to donate board games — including 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draughts sets — in an attempt to boost the failed 2015 re-election bid of Gotabaya’s elder brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Aluthgamage was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Fernando was sentenced to 25 years.
Aluthgamage is now the most senior member of a Rajapaksa-led cabinet to be successfully prosecuted for corruption.
The cases against both men were initiated six years ago, when the Rajapaksa brothers were out of power, but the case had been making slow headway until a new government took office last year.
Aluthgamage also faces a separate investigation into allegations that he authorised in 2022 a payment of $6.09m to a Chinese supplier for a fertiliser shipment that was never delivered.
He caused a stir in 2020 when he accused Sri Lanka’s national cricket team of rigging the 2011 World Cup final in favour of India, triggering an investigation that ultimately failed to substantiate his claims.
Aluthgamage, who served as sports minister from 2010 to 2015, said in June 2020 that he had “not wanted to disclose” the alleged match-fixing plot at the time.
“In 2011, we were supposed to win, but we sold the match. I feel I can talk about it now. I am not implicating players, but certain sections were involved,” he said.
Sri Lanka lost the final at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium by six wickets. Both Indian and Sri Lankan players have strongly denied any wrongdoing.</p><small>2025-05-29 11:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29141027db6868c.jpg?r=141055' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914069/cop-dead-4-others-injured-in-gunfire-between-public-police-and-terrorists-in-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Cop dead, 4 others injured in gunfire between public, police and terrorists in Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>A cop was martyred and four others were injured as a result of gunfire between the public, police and terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, the police said on Thursday.
Speaking to Dawn.com, spokesperson to the regional police officer, Khanzala Quraishi, said, “The members of the peace committee, along with police personnel, were patrolling the area when they were attacked by terrorists at around 12:30am.”
He said that police personnel, Murtaza Jan, embraced martyrdom, while four others, including a school teacher and a police constable, were injured in the attack.
“The incident took place within the limits of the Hoyed Police Station,” he said, adding that the “terrorists fled the scene due to the quick response from the police”.
He continued: “The injured and the deceased were moved to a hospital. The school teacher is in critical condition.”
KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed was also on a visit to the region for reviewing the security situation, he said.
The spokesperson added that people were “fed up with the terrorists and retaliated whenever they came across them”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Earlier this month, a policeman was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the limits of the Mandan police station in Bannu.</p><small>2025-05-29 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2914474289165b5.jpg?r=145544' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914080/foreign-students-seek-to-quit-harvard-amid-trump-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign students seek to quit Harvard amid Trump crackdown</strong></a><br><p>Harvard University has been flooded with requests from foreign students to transfer to other institutions as US President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to ban it from hosting international scholars, a staff member said on Wednesday.
“Too many international students to count have inquired about the possibility of transferring to another institution,” Maureen Martin, director of immigration services, wrote in a court filing.
Trump has upended the United States’ reputation among foreign students, who number around one million, as he presses a campaign against US universities he sees as obstructing his “Make America Great Again” populist agenda.
He has blocked Harvard from hosting international scholars in a manoeuvre being challenged legally, targeted non-citizen campus activists for deportation, and most recently suspended student visa processing across the board.
 
 

The president’s crackdown has prompted “profound fear, concern, and confusion” among students and staff at the elite university, which has been “inundated with questions from current international students and scholars about their status and options”, Martin wrote.
More than 27 per cent of Harvard’s enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data.
“Many international students and scholars are reporting significant emotional distress that is affecting their mental health and making it difficult to focus on their studies,” Martin wrote in the filing.
Some were afraid to attend their graduation ceremonies this week or had cancelled travel plans for fear of being refused re-entry into the United States, she added.
She said that a handful of domestic students at Harvard had also “expressed serious interest” in transferring elsewhere because they did not want to attend a university with no international students.
A judge last week suspended the government’s move to block Harvard from enrolling and hosting foreign students after the Ivy League school sued, calling the action unconstitutional.
A hearing into the case was scheduled for Thursday.
At least 10 foreign students or scholars at Harvard had their visa applications refused immediately after the block on foreign students was announced, including students whose visa applications had already been approved, Martin wrote.
“My current understanding is that the visa applications that were refused or revoked following the Revocation Notice have not yet been approved or reinstated,” despite a judge suspending the move, she said.</p><small>2025-05-29 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606759-vendor-displaying-sacrificial-animals-to-attract-the-customers-at-peshawars-ring-road-cattle-market-on-june-6-2024-app' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh issues code of conduct for Eid ul Adha hides collection</strong></a><br><p>

From the details reported in the international media we learn that at least some of the efforts of the Pakistani government in the crypto domain are geared towards procuring influence in Washington DC, with those close to the Trump administration coming to Pakistan for crypto-related discussions.
To that extent we can look at what is happening and say “it is what it is” and leave it at that. But the moment the government begins to take crypto seriously as a business proposition it becomes dangerous. And it is important to keep this distinction in mind, between crypto as an influence peddling tool versus a serious business proposition, because the resources the government will put at risk if it ventures into the world of crypto are public resources.
 
 

In the past few weeks, since the Crypto Council was announced by the government, we have seen suggestions appear in print on how Pakistan can expand its participation in the wider world of cryptocurrencies. One suggestion was to place a portion of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves in crypto, and the individual making this suggestion deployed a classic tactic used by small-time stock brokers or real estate agents selling junk to gullible clients. He pointed to the rise in the value of Bitcoin over the past decade, and asked the reader to imagine if Pakistan had placed a certain amount of its reserves in this asset, how much that value would have multiplied by today.
What was not mentioned in the article was the sheer volatility of currency over that same time period. Sovereign reserves are never gambled with in volatile assets. They are, as a rule, always invested in fixed-income instruments. It’s the same principle when managing pension funds or other institutional savings. The principles are low-volatility, low-risk, fixed return.

The resources the government will put at risk if it ventures into the world of crypto are public resources.

Another argument encouraged the state to go into crypto mining by offering the right “incentives”. The right incentives apparently include providing them with electricity at around five to six cents per unit. For comparison consider that you and I pay somewhere around 20 cents per unit for our electricity, with industry somewhere around 14 cents. The most obvious question to ask when considering this proposition is this: if Pakistan has electricity to give at five cents per unit, why should crypto miners be the first to get it?
A puzzling press release from the finance ministry a few days ago added to the confusion. It announced that the government has “allocated” 2000MW for crypto mining. It was puzzling because there was no mention of price (the single most important thing to mention in such an announcement), but more importantly, there is literally no such thing as electricity allocations in Pakistan. There are no quotas of who gets how much electricity. So what exactly is being announced in this press release?
 
 

The third suggestion that has been floated is to create on-shore crypto exchanges in Pakistan, much like we already have a commodities exchange. This is probably the most benign of the suggestions since all it does is make crypto trading a regulated activity without putting any state resources into play.
It is critical to keep in mind that crypto is a fictitious asset. It is not the first, nor the last of these. Fictitious assets are those that exist only in the mind of the holder. If enough people buy into the fiction they can become liquid, meaning you can trade them for real goods and services. Money, for example, is a fictitious asset as is gold. But both are highly liquid. I can pay my bills with money, buy my groceries, because almost everyone in my society buys into the fiction that money (or gold) represent.
Not so with crypto. This is purely a speculative asset, created for speculative purposes, given prominence by speculator interests, and currently in the process of being pumped by a massive speculative scheme being launched by the White House itself. This endows it with a great deal of speculative value. But none of it is real.
In the past we have seen fictitious assets grow to unmanageable proportions and pose risks to the entire global financial system. Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs) were fictitious assets when left unregulated, because those creating them were able to bundle junk mortgages by illiquid borrowers into their offering and sell them as a AAA-rated financial product. This scam became so large in the late 2000s that it lay at the root of the greatest financial collapse since the Great Depression.
CDOs are still around, but as a regulated product they now pose little risk of growing into a threat to the financial order. But speculator capital has its own ingenuity. Think of plot files being sold by unscrupulous property developers, in housing projects they haven’t even begun acquiring land for yet. That is a fictitious asset, and trading in it brings enormous risks that should not be taken by retail investors or those entrusted to manage the wealth of others, such as sovereigns or pension fund managers.
 
 

Fictitious assets have always been around in the modern world. The South Sea Bubble in the early 18th century was created by massive investments in the stock of a company that had no prospects of actually being able to do the business it was supposed to do (sell slaves to the Spanish colonies of South America).
They are around in our time too and crypto is just one of their manifestations. It’s fine for those who wish to trade in these sorts of fictitious assets with their own money. But the state should beware the wiles with which the salesmen of this snake oil try to lure you into their racket.

Saqib was recently appointed as Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Crypto and Blockchain, with the status of a minister of state. He has been on a tour of the United States seeking investment in Pakistan’s crypto markets.
He made the announcement about the reserve after delivering a keynote address before an elite audience, which included United States Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 in Las Vegas.
“Pakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation — powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,” said Saqib, in a statement issued by his office.
“I’m not just here as a minister,” he said. “I’m here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.”
 






In his keynote speech, Saqib announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.”
 


He also thanked Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.
He revealed that the government had allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in first phase for bitcoin mining and AI data centres, opening doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners around the world.
The statement noted Pakistan having over 40 million crypto wallets and one of the “largest and most active freelancer economies in the world”.
It added that Saqib was leading the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) — a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future.
“Both Pakistan and bitcoin have suffered from bad PR,” Saqib declared. “But if you look past the headlines, you’ll see something else: talent, resilience, and vision.”
He called on global crypto builders to come and invest in Pakistan. “If you’re building something real — come build it in Pakistan. Come build wallets for the unbanked. Come tokenise land. Come scale your mission with our youth and our unstoppable grit.”
During his keynote, Saqib delivered a “blueprint for the future of emerging markets in Web3 that positions Pakistan as a tech-forward, youth-powered, and opportunity-rich nation ready to lead,” the statement concluded.
On February 25, the government had announced it was considering establishing a National Crypto Council to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. In March, it appointed Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the PCC and later made him the council’s CEO.
According to a press release, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.
 
 

Additionally, he will also facilitate “licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)” and champion “investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth” in the country.
Furthermore, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.
According to the Finance Division, the ambitious initiative was part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.</p><small>2025-05-29 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29125949ac68ad7.png?r=130333' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914038/gurdwara-tibba-sahib-in-a-sleepy-pakpattan-village' target='_blank'><strong>Gurdwara Tibba Sahib in a sleepy Pakpattan village</strong></a><br><p>PAKPATTAN: Near the city of Pakpattan along the railway tracks, lies a quiet little village — Tibba Nanak Sar. The local legend says that this was the place where Baba Guru Nanak met Sheikh Ibrahim, the spiritual heir of the great Baba Fariduddin Ganj Shakar.
In the meeting, Farid’s verses reached the ears of Guru Nanak and from this small, silent village, those sacred words reached the Granth Sahib. A modest, orange-colored gurdwara still stands here, quietly commemorating that historic encounter.
Crossing through the villages of Pakka Sadhar and Chak Azmat, one reaches Chak Datar Singh, which has a railway station whose building is hidden behind the neem trees. Just a decade back, the name in Urdu script “Datar Singh Railway Station” was written on it in black paint. Then came fresh whitewash, bringing a new name and Datar Singh was replaced with “Murad Chishti”.
 

Gurdwara Tibba Sahib near Chak Datar Singh in Pakpattan District, Punjab, Pakistan. —  sikhheritagetours.ca

This was once the land of Datar Singh — a man who returned from the United Kingdom after studying agriculture and dairy farming. In Montgomery (Sahiwal), he established united India’s first dairy farm. He bred an excellent breed of cows and buffaloes and the British Empire honoured him with the titles of ‘Sir’ and ‘Sardar Bahadur.’ This same Datar Singh was also the maternal grandfather of Maneka Gandhi, daughter-in-law of India’s former Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.
In the village of ‘Punjab Khor’ near Delhi, Datar Singh’s grandson later established a dairy farm of his own. He named it “Montgomery Dairy Farm” in remembrance of those lost days.
From Chak Datar Singh, a road leads to a large mound — an ancient tibba having old graves and broken pottery pieces. Beside it lies a village, also called “Tibba” (the mound). In the heart of the village, stands a two-storey building whose dome can be seen from afar. This is Gurdwara Tibba Sahib.
Before the Partition, the city of Pakpattan and its surrounding villages were home to a significant Sikh population, alongside the Muslims and the Hindus. Most of the Sikh families were farmers.
Hundreds of Sikh pilgrims used to gather at the gurdwara which had a thriving life. Pilgrims bathed in the sarovar, washing their hands, faces, and feet — becoming pure before entering the holy place. The sangat would stay in the rooms here. Delicious prasad was cooked and served in abundance.
The elders remember an annual fair that used to be held at Gurdwara Tibba Sahib. Not only Sikhs but Hindus and Muslims too visited the annual fair and the gurdwara stood as a symbol of harmony and love.
Sardar Gurdip Singh, the nephew of Sardar Sir Datar Singh (Chak Datar Singh village was named after him) now lives in Karnal, India. He was about 15 when India was partitioned. His family lived in Arifwala (Pakpattan) who owned lands in surrounding villages of Tibba.
“I recall the annual mela (fair) was held at Gurdwara Tibba Sahib. Hundreds of Sikhs from far-off places would participate in it. The mela is an important and indelible part of my memories of my native land,” he tells this writer.
In 1947, the Hindus and Sikhs from this side were forced to cross the newly drawn border while the Muslims from the other side faced the same fate. Everyone lost something—their homes, their temples, their friends and their memories.
Just as they left behind fields, cattle, homes and dreams, this gurdwara too was left behind — abandoned.
Nazeer Ahmad was 12 years old when he migrated from Bahman Wala (Muktsar, Indian Punjab) along with his family. They settled at Chak Azmat, the neighbouring village of Tibba. He says: “Gurdwara Tibba Sahib used to be a marvellous edifice. It was showy, eye-catching and nawa nakore (brand new). With the passage of time it kept losing its beauty due to rains and storms. The residents didn’t take care of it, nor did the government. Now it has become old like me.”
The gurdwara fell into silence. Now, no one can read gurmukhi script inscribed on its doors and walls. A Muslim family, themselves migrants from across the border, now lives here. Their bedding, trunks and utensils fill the rooms of the gurdwara. Broken pots lie toppled on the Nishan Sahib. In the langar hall, a couple of goats munch on fodder, their bleating echoing softly. The steps of the sarovar are stacked with rows of cow dung cakes. In the pond, mustard flowers sway in the breeze — dancing softly in the twilight.
Gurdwara Tibba Sahib is turning to dust day by day. The Gurmukhi inscriptions are fading while paint of the walls is peeling. If somebody pays attention to it, its past glory can still be restored as all is not lost.

According to a press release issued on Wednesday, a formal complaint was received by the KMU Vice-Chancellor Prof Ziaul Haq regarding a harassment incident inside an examination hall on May 18.
The harassment committee investigated the matter and listened to the complainant as well as the alleged harassers to ensure due process, it said.
Following the committee’s findings, KMU’s administration took disciplinary actions, terminating a grade-18 officer, with nearly 17 years of service, from his position. The student involved in the incident was expelled from the university and barred from any future enrolment at KMU, the release said.
 
 

In the last two years, the varsity has consistently upheld its zero-tolerance policy against harassment by taking strict action, including major to minor penalties, against perpetrators.
The university remains resolute in its mission to provide a safe and dignified space for all students, faculty, and staff.

It termed the incident “regrettable and a cause of public unrest” and called for legal action against those responsible.
In a statement, the JPPA leaders said public cooperation was vital for maintaining peace in the region and such incidents risked eroding the trust of local youth and civilians.
They said that ensuring public safety and security was the foremost responsibility of the state and all relevant institutions should play a constructive role in that respect.
The alliance leaders insisted that at times, extraordinary measures taken under the pretext of security could inadvertently affect innocent civilians.
 
 

They urged law-enforcement agencies to adopt strategies that were both effective and community-friendly to restore peace and rebuild public confidence.
The JPPA leaders announced they’re committed to pursuing peace and protecting people’s rights through constitutional and democratic means.
They demanded justice for the victims of the “quadcopter strike” and said trust-building measures should be taken to create a peaceful environment in the region.
The JPPA leaders noted that several peaceful options were under consideration — including public consultations, awareness campaigns and peaceful protests — to raise these concerns through legitimate and non-violent avenues.
They urged all institutions to work collaboratively for lasting peace and well-being of the residents.
The alleged quadcopter reportedly injured 22 youth, children and elderly people, with two being shifted to Dera Ismail Khan due to critical condition.
In a statement, security forces denied social media reports regarding the quadcopter strike in the Azam Warsak area, declaring them “completely false and fabricated.”
According to them, no “quadcopter munition dropped” in the area.
However, a limited security operation was conducted nearby against elements associated with a banned extremist group, leading to an exchange of gunfire. A few individuals reportedly sustained minor injuries during the operation.
The security forces dismissed the claims about large-scale civilian casualties or injury to 22 children as “baseless and inflammatory propaganda aimed at spreading fear and confusion among the public.”
Authorities urged people not to “rely on unverified social media content or fabricated documents” and said citizens should trust only verified sources and official statements issued by the relevant state institutions.

Held at Khyber House and chaired by Peshawar Commissioner Riaz Mehsud, the meeting was also attended by regional security officials, deputy commissioner of Khyber, DPO and elders from Tirah and Bara along with elected representatives.
Sources told Dawn that commissioner conveyed to the participants of the meeting the government’s resolve about ‘decisive’ military operation against various terrorist groups presently holed up in some localities of Shalobar and Zakhakhel areas in Tirah valley.
They said that the commissioner also told Tirah elders that residents of Landawar, Dray and Darpair in Shalobar and Zarra Pakha and Mazari Sar in Zakhakhel had to be temporarily displaced prior to start of operation after Eidul Azha to avoid collateral damage.

MNA questions infiltration of terrorists into the valley after border fencing

“An army operation in Tirah is a must and we want to go all about it,” the commissioner told the meeting point blank and also exhorted Tirah elders to assist security forces in their resolve to flush out terrorists from the region, said sources.
 
 

They said that a detailed discussion followed after the commissioner’s assertions, as some tribal elders consented to a decisive ‘push’ against terrorist groups while others, including Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-backed parliamentarians, expressed their reservations about the launch of a military operation.
MNA Iqbal Afridi was quoted as saying on the occasion that infiltration of terrorist groups into the valley was questionable after fencing of border with Afghanistan and stationing a considerable number of security forces in the region.
Rejecting the official assertion about the impending military operation, he reminded the high ranking government officials present on the occasion that a military operation in the valley could only be launched with the collective consent of all the tribes of Tirah which was duly consented during a high level meeting between the chief minister, chief secretary and security officials in recent past.
Sources said that it was later decided at the end of Tuesday’s meeting that a series of parleys and consultations would be held in Tirah and Bara to ascertain the final view of local elders about the military operation.
Another similar meeting was planned to be held at Khyber House on Monday (June 2) after tribal elders from Tirah and Bara and elected representatives sought time for their mutual consultations to reach a consensus about supporting or otherwise of the proposed military operation.
Meanwhile, Bara tehsil chairman Mufti Kafeel convened a meeting of all the prominent tribal elders, elected councillors and representatives of various political parties to take stock of the situation arising after the commissioner’s announcement about a military operation in parts of Tirah.
The meeting, however, ended inconclusive as any final decision about support for the military operation was linked to an in-depth and detailed discussion with Tirah elders, who were expected to meet on Saturday.
 
 

The meeting formed a committee to contact elders in Tirah for a possible participation of Bara elders, elected representatives and political parties’ representatives in their important Saturday jirga.
Sources in Tirah said that a majority of elders were not happy with political representatives and parliamentarians as they were accused of failure to effectively raise their voice in support of the militancy-affected people of the valley.
A final decision about inviting the Bara delegation to Tirah jirga was expected to be taken on Friday, sources said.

The encounter occurred in Hussain Kot village, located on the outskirts of Rawalakot in Poonch district, following intelligence reports that a group of militants, allegedly led by a man named Zarnosh Na­sim, was hiding in the area.
The operation was set in motion following the April 10 arrest of a suspect, Muiz, a resident of Chak Dhamni near Rawalakot. Muiz, who was found in possession of arms and ammunition, disclosed during interrogation that he was an associate of Zarnosh, a resident of Bagh district, and had delivered weapons to him just a day earlier.
Based on his information, a joint police team from Poonch and Bagh districts launched a raid in the Petaratta Morh area of Bagh on April 11. However, the suspects reportedly opened fire during the operation, resulting in the death of a passerby and injuries to two constables.
On Wednesday, acting on fresh intelligence, police launched another operation in the forested area near Hussain Kot. Upon arrival, the raiding party came under heavy fire and grenade attacks from the suspects.
Two constables were martyred while at least five others were reported injured in the exchange of fire. In retaliatory fire, police gunned down four militants, including Zarnosh.
There were unconfirmed reports suggesting that the militants may have detonated suicide jackets.

At a meeting, members of the Refugees Working Committee — including heads of refugee camps and elected councillors — urged the government to fulfil their long-ignored demand for two reserved seats in the Legislative Assembly, one each for refugees from occupied Jammu and the occupied Valley, ahead of the general elections due next year.
They also demanded an increase in the monthly subsistence allowance and allocation of funds for their resettlement in the 2025-26 budget.
The participants strongly condemned what they called the persistent neglect of the 1989 refugees by successive AJK governments.
“It is deeply unfortunate that even after three and a half decades, the condition of Kashmiri refugees remains unchanged,” read a joint communiqué issued after the meeting.
 
 

According to the communiqué, over 9,500 refugee families — comprising around 46,000 individuals — continued to live in miserable conditions in camps and rented accommodations across Mirpur, Kotli, Bagh, Muzaffarabad, Jhelum Valley, and other cities of AJK.
The participants recalled that a comprehensive ‘Charter of Demands’ was submitted to the AJK government some 18 months ago, and among its key points were proposals for resettlement, resolution of other chronic issues, as well as allocation of one Assembly seat each for refugees from occupied Jammu and the Valley. However, they lamented that no action had been taken on the document to date.
“Refugees will no longer tolerate exploitation, nor will there be any compromise on the future of our younger generation,” the communiqué warned.
The group stressed that allocation of two separate seats for post-1989 refugees would help them elect their own representatives to advocate their concerns and contribute meaningfully to the discourse on India’s human rights violations in occupied Kashmir.
The refugees also reminded Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of the commitments he made during previous meetings. These included a Rs1,500 increase in the monthly subsistence allowance and concrete steps towards their resettlement.
The group communiqué congratulated the government of Pakistan, the armed forces and Field Marshal Asim Munir on the success of Operation Bunyanum  Marsoos against Indian aggression.

The Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025, which seeks to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18, reached the presidency on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.
However, the move attracted strong opposition from religious segments of society, with the CII ruling that classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.
CII member Maulana Jalaludin, who belongs to JUI-F, said Presi­dent Zardari should prevent anarchy in society and not sign the bill.

Controversy deepens as Sharmila cites Shariat court’s ruling; Sherry urges CII to reconsider its opinion

Incidentally, members bel­ong­ing to different sects opposed the bill.
 
 

Responding to a query, the CII member said the assembly could not be above Quran and Sunnah. “This bill is not only against the norms of Sharia but also contrary to the values of our society and our traditions,” Maulana Jalaluddin reasoned, terming the move a western conspiracy to destroy ‘family system’.
The ‘bad intentions’ were evident as the bill was not forwarded to the CII, but approved by parliament ‘in secrecy’, he said.
However, PPP MNA Sharmila Faruqi, who tabled the bill in the National Assembly, said the matter of marriage of girls below 18 years of age, should not be given a religious colour and instead be considered in the context of human rights.
“We are not against marriages. We say marrying girls as young as 13 or 14 years is unfair when girls under 18 years of age do not have right to vote, cannot obtain national identity cards and driving licence,” she added.
In this regard, the PPP lawmaker referred to a decision by Federal Shariat Court of 2022 that allowed the state to set the marriage age.
In its 242nd meeting, the CII also rejected the recommendation of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony regarding mandatory thalassemia testing prior to marriage. The CII was of the opinion that testing should not be made compulsory.
CII urged to review matter
Senator Sherry Rehman told Dawn the CII should reconsider their views in the wake of the Shariat Court stance and the practice in many Muslim countries, which adhere to the age of 18 years for maturity.
The issue sparked a controversy after a fiery speech by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman in the National Assembly stating that the bill should be stopped right there, while it was being approved by Senate.
He asked parliament to forward the bill to the CII, as per suggestion of JUI-F lawmaker Kamran Murtaza, warning that failing to do so would undermine the nation’s unity and solidarity.
Most senators, including from PTI, voted that the bill be moved in the upper house by Ms Rehman for approval instead of being forwarded to the CII.

• PTI stresses need for political unity, independent judiciary
ISLAMABAD: A message shared via the official X (formerly Twitter) account of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday called on public to prepare for a countrywide protest movement.
The post came a day after Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, had proposed a ‘give-and-take formula’ for Mr Khan’s release.
Although Mr Khan does not have direct access to his social media account, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has not disclosed who manages his posts.
The latest message, posted in Mr Khan’s name, urged the masses to get ready for a nationwide protest movement, to be launched soon. It also raised concerns about his treatment in Adiala Jail, alleging that he was being denied basic rights.
 
 

“Under jail regulations, I am entitled to a 30-minute meeting with my wife, Bushra Bibi, once a week, but even that has not been allowed for several days,” the post quoted Mr Khan as saying. “Today’s meeting was also scheduled but was not held. Bushra Bibi has been imprisoned for 13 months solely to torment me, despite no crime being proven against her.”
He added, “They can do whatever they want — I will neither bow before their tyranny nor make any deal.”
 






The former premier revealed that he had issued special instructions to Salman Akram Raja for filing a contempt of court petition in the high court against the prison authorities, and simultaneously submit a petition in the Supreme Court over the violation of fundamental human rights.
“All of you should be prepared — a nationwide protest movement will be launched soon,” he said.
‘Nawaz opposed nuclear tests’
Meanwhile, on the 27th anniversary of Pakistan’s nuclear tests, Youm-i-Takbeer, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan alleged that then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif was initially unwilling to conduct the nuclear tests, citing negotiations with the United States.
“May 28, 1998, was the day Nawaz Sharif’s legs were trembling,” Mr Ayub claimed. “He had refused to conduct the tests and was negotiating with the US administration to avoid going nuclear.”
Omar Ayub also claimed that Nawaz Sharif was ultimately compelled to authorise the nuclear tests due to significant pressure from key figures within the government and national leadership.
 
 

“My late father, Gohar Ayub Khan, the late Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the late Majeed Nizami, Raja Zafarul Haq, and Sheikh Rashid Ahmad strongly advocated in the cabinet meeting for proceeding with the tests. Their firm stance left the cabinet with no choice but to agree,” he claimed.
“Shehbaz Sharif told my father that Nawaz Sharif was engaging in negotiations with the American president in return for not conducting the nuclear tests,” he said. “My father responded by stating that Pakistan was fully prepared and must proceed.”
He paid tribute to those who played a pivotal role in making Pakistan a declared nuclear state, stating: “We remember and honour the patriots who stood firm in the national interest and safeguarded Pakistan’s strategic future.”
‘India may attack again’
Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said that Imran Khan had been continuously warning that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would go for another misadventure.
 
 

At a press conference, he stressed the need for unity among political parties and called for an independent judiciary. “It’s unfortunate that lawyers can predict court decisions even before proceedings begin. This has made Pakistan a global laughing stock,” he said.
Mr Akram said that Pakistan emerged as the first nuclear power in the Islamic world. “It is deeply regrettable that Dr A.Q. Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, was forced to apologise on national television,” he said.
On the current political and judicial crisis, Mr Akram criticised the 26th constitutional amendment, calling it the “burial ground” of the Constitution.

“I got released this morning after being imprisoned for 14 years,” A.T.M. Azharul Islam said, waving at thousands of supporters of the country’s main religious party, Jamaat-i-Islami.
The tight-packed crowd cheered as the senior leader was released from a prison hospital in central Dhaka, a day after the Supreme Court overturned his death sentence and acquitted him of war crimes. “There was no justice in the past… we expect the court will ensure that the people get justice in the coming days,” Islam said.
Leftist parties say they will demonstrate in opposition to his release. Across Ramna Park in the neighbourhood of Naya Paltan, thousands choked the streets as part of a rally in support of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). Political parties are readying for hugely anticipated elections which the interim government has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.
Protests have become part of daily life in Bangladesh’s capital, with residents either taking part as political parties jostle for power after an uprising last year — or avoiding them.
The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August 2024, fleeing by helicopter as crowds stormed her palace.
 
 

Hasina’s 15-year-long aut­ho­­ritarian rule contained protests like a pressure cooker, until the student-led movement spearheaded a revolt that toppled her from power. On Wednesday, at least half a dozen demonstrations were held in the sprawling megacity of Dhaka, home to more than 20 million people.
‘Unpredictable’
While tens of thousands gather at major intersections across Dhaka with their demands, others spend hours navigating their way through traffic-snarled streets. “All the major roads are blocked during the day,” chicken seller Zakir Hossain said on Wednesday.
“We’ve had to shift our schedules. I start work at midnight now, even though the law and order situation is worsening every day, and muggings have become common.” It worries many, remembering the violence last year when police tried — and failed — to crush the protests that toppled Hasina.
“The situation is unpredictable — the protests can turn violent at any moment,” said a 43-year-old housewife. “I never used to call my husband much, but now I do. If he is even a little late coming home from the office, all sorts of bad thoughts come to my mind.”
Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections are held, has called for parties to build unity and calm intense political power struggles. The government warned on Saturday that  “unreasonable demands” and obstruction had been  “continuously obstructing” its work.
Yunus has said polls could be held as early as December, but that having them later would give the government more time for reform.
Rallies organised by the powerful BNP are calling for the government to set an election date, as well as a raft of other demands, including the sacking of multiple members of Yunus’s cabinet.

“This is not an aspirational goal but a binding obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC),” Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah wrote in a judgement on a case related to the custody of two children.
Justice Shah emphasised that courts, especially family courts, had a moral and legal responsibility to see, hear and protect every child not as a passive subject of proceedings, but as a rights-bearing individual whose dignity must be safeguarded at every stage of the judicial process.
The proceedings were initially instituted by Dr Sana Sattar (mother) who filed an application for custody of her two children before the senior civil judge (family division), Layyah. While her application was dismissed on July 14, 2023, a visitation schedule was framed to facilitate meetings between her and her children.

Review petition by father of two children dismissed

Both parents, however, filed separate appeals before the court of additional district judge, Layyah, which granted children’s custody to their mother and ordered a visitation arrangement for their father, Dr Muhammad Asif.
 
 

The father then filed a constitutional petition before the Multan bench of Lahore High Court, which got dismissed on May 24, 2024. Later, an appeal before the apex court met the same fate on July 18.
Subsequently, the father moved a review petition before the Supreme Court. A two-member bench comprising Justice Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi heard the matter and maintained that the custody stands vested with the mother.
While dismissing the review petition, the court also directed the parties to strictly adhere to the visitation schedule determined by the lower appellate court though the custody of the children would continue with the mother unless and until the father moves “a fresh application for custody to be adjudicated by a competent forum in light of any material change in circumstances”.
In the 12-page judgement, Justice Shah explained that the best interests of the children, particularly the child with special needs, were best served by keeping them in the custody of their mother. No alternative caregiver can fully replicate the intuitive care, emotional constancy, and protective environment a mother is uniquely positioned to offer, the judgement emphasised, adding that even a working professional mother does not detract from her suitability as a custodial parent. On the contrary, it reflects her resilience and her commitment to providing a secure, nurturing, and dignified upbringing for her children.
The judgment asked the courts to adopt a child-friendly, participatory approach while underscoring the need that courts should deal with cases involving children through the lens of a dedicated child-centered and child justice framework, a judicial philosophy grounded in both legal and moral obligations to safeguard, nurture and empower children within the justice system.
The concept of child justice is broad and inclusive. It encompasses not only children in conflict with the law, requires rehabilitative and restorative processes rather than punitive sanctions, but children involved in custody and guardianship disputes must be treated with dignity, heard, protected, and empowered throughout judicial proceedings, the judgment emphasised.
Courts bear a heightened responsibility to prioritise the best interests of child in all decisions affecting them. This principle demands that the judiciary transcend procedural formalism and engage substantively with each child’s unique vulnerabilities, developmental needs and future potential.

“I am delighted that the letter of intent signed today could open up a new perspective with new orders for Rafales, Scorpenes, light frigates,” Macron said at a joint press conference alongside Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
Prabowo said France was one of Indonesia’s main partners as it upgrades its military hardware and develops its defence industry through joint production and technology transfers.
Macron arrived in Jakarta from Vietnam on Tuesday night on the second leg of his Southeast Asia tour. The French president is scheduled to fly to Singapore on Thursday.

Two countries sign agreements, MoUs worth $11bn

Dassault Aviation shares were up 3.4 per cent in the morning session in Paris. The jets’ performance came under scrutiny last month after reports that Rafales used by the Indian air force were shot down by Pakistan’s Chinese-made jets in clashes.
 
 

Indonesia has yet to receive any of the Rafale jets from the 2022 deal. The chief of the Indonesian Air Force Mohamad Tonny Harjono said in February that six jets would arrive in early 2026, state news agency Antara reported.
Aside from the Rafale deal, Indonesia in 2024 struck an agreement with French state-owned shipyard Naval Group to buy two “Scorpene” submarines, and in 2023 announced the purchase of 13 long-range air surveillance radars from France’s Thales.
Agreements, MoUs
France and mineral-rich Indon­esia also signed a host of other agreements and more than 20 MoUs worth at least $11 billion, said Indonesia’s chief economic minister at a business forum.
The MoUs included one on cooperation between French mining company Eramet and Indonesian sovereign wealth funds Danantara and Indonesia Investment Authority (INA).
The agreement aims to “explore the establishment of a strategic investment platform in the nickel sector, spanning upstream to downstream operations,” Eramet, Danantara and INA said in a joint statement.
The partnership aims to develop the raw materials needed for electric vehicle (EV) batteries and the statement said a preliminary assessment will be made to identify projects.

The understanding was reached during a meeting in Tehran between Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi and his Ira­nian counterpart, Eska­ndar Momeni. The discussions focused particularly on the movement and welfare of pilgrims, the ministry said.
According to an official statement, Mr Momeni said the Iranian government “will provide boarding and lodging facilities in Mashhad for 5,000 Pakistani pilgrims”. Also, Iran “will make special arrangements from the border to Iraq for them,” he said, adding that serving the pilgrims is considered a “religious duty”.
Both countries also agreed to establish a hotline to resolve issues concerning pilgrims swiftly. A trilateral conference of the interior ministries of Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq will be convened in Mashhad before Arbaeen to discuss matters related to Pakistani pilgrims. The ministers also agreed to increase the number of flights to ensure pilgrim’s safety and convenience.
 






Discussions also included sending pilgrims via sea routes to Iran and Iraq. Furthermore, the leaders talked about strengthening Pakistan-Iran relations and mutual cooperation in various fields, including curbing illegal immigration, human trafficking, and drug control, with an agreement to enhance coordination for better border security management.
The Iranian interior minister emphasised that Iran and Pakistan enjoy “excellent relations” and that “Pakistan’s security is of utmost importance to Iran”.
Talks also covered the release of Iranian fishermen detained after they unintentionally entered Pakistani territorial waters. Mr Naqvi assured full cooperation in this regard at the request of his Iranian counterpart.
He expressed gratitude to the Iranian government for facilitating the pilgrims and said the establishment of a hotline would “help resolve issues promptly.”
Attending from the Iranian side were Deputy Interior Minister Ali Akbar Pourjamshidian, Deputy Minister Nader Yar Ahmadi, Adviser Hadian, Governor General of Sistan and Baluchestan Mansour Bager, and Colonel Javaheri, Head of International Affairs at the Ministry of Interior.
FIA director general and senior officers from Pakistan also attended the meeting.

“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President Donald Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” he wrote on his social media platform X.
“The DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government,” he added.
 






The South African-born tech tycoon had said Trump’s bill would increase the deficit and undermine the work of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has fired tens of thousands of people.
Musk — who was a constant presence at Trump’s side before pulling back to focus on his Space X and Tesla businesses — also complained that DOGE had become a “whipping boy” for dissatisfaction with the administration.
“I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,” Musk said in an interview with CBS News, an excerpt of which aired late Tuesday.
Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” — which passed the US House last week and now moves to the Senate — offers sprawling tax relief and spending cuts and is the centrepiece of his domestic agenda.
But critics warn it will decimate health care and balloon the national deficit by as much as $4 trillion over a decade.
“A bill can be big, or it can be beautiful. But I don’t know if it can be both. My personal opinion,” Musk said in the interview, which will be aired in full on Sunday.
The White House sought to play down any differences over US government spending, without directly naming Musk.
“The Big Beautiful Bill is NOT an annual budget bill,” Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Musk’s social network, X, after the tech titan’s comments aired.
All DOGE cuts would have to be carried out through a separate bill targeting the federal bureaucracy, according to US Senate rules, Miller added.
 






But Musk’s comments represented a rare split with the Republican president whom he helped propel back to power, as the largest donor to his 2024 election campaign.
‘Whipping boy’
Trump tasked Musk with cutting government spending as head of DOGE, but after a feverish start, Musk announced in late April he was mostly stepping back to run his companies again.
Musk complained in a separate interview with the Washington Post that DOGE, which operated out of the White House with a staff of young technicians, had become a lightning rod for criticism.
“DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,” Musk told the newspaper at the Starbase launch site in Texas ahead of Space X’s latest launch on Tuesday.
“Something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.”
Musk blamed entrenched US bureaucracy for DOGE’s failure to achieve all of its goals — although reports say his domineering style and lack of familiarity with the currents of Washington politics were also major factors.
“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,” he said. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”
Musk has previously admitted that he did not achieve all his goals with DOGE even though tens of thousands of people were removed from government payrolls and several departments were gutted or shut down.
Musk’s own businesses suffered in the meantime.
Protesters against the cost-cutting targeted Tesla dealerships while arsonists even torched a few of the electric vehicles, and the firm’s profits slumped.
“People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That’s really uncool,” Musk told the Post.
Musk has also been focusing on Space X after a series of fiery setbacks to his dreams of colonising Mars — the latest of which came on Tuesday when its prototype Starship exploded over the Indian Ocean.
The tycoon last week also said he would pull back from spending his fortune on politics, having spent around a quarter of a billion dollars to support Trump.</p><small>2025-05-29 03:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29073419ff2427b.jpg?r=073433' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913994/un-to-honour-two-pakistani-peacekeepers-posthumously-today' target='_blank'><strong>UN to honour two Pakistani peacekeepers posthumously today</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The United Nations will honour two Pakistani peacekeepers posthumously at a ceremony at its headquarters on Thursday on the occasion of ‘International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers’ being observed on May 29.
Among the peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously with the Dag Hammarskjold medal the two Pakistanis are: Sepoy Muhammad Tarique and Havildar Ahsan Ullah Khan - both served with UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA).
During the ceremonies, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will lay a wreath to honour more than 4,400 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948. He will also preside over a ceremony in the Trusteeship Council Chamber, at which Dag Hammarskjöld Medals will be awarded posthumously to 57 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their lives serving under the UN flag last year.
Pakistan is the fifth largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys more than 2,800 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Congo, Cyprus, Somalia, South Sudan and Western Sahara. Peacekeeping is one of the most effective tools available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security.
Since 1948, when the historic decision was made to deploy military observers to the Middle East to supervise the implementation of Israel-Arab Armistice Agreements, in what became the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, more than two million peacekeepers have served in 71 operations around the world.
Today, some 68,000 women and men serve as military, police and civilian personnel in 11 conflict zones across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. 119 countries currently contribute uniformed personnel.
