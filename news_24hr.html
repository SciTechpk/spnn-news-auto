Justice Najafi, who is now part of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), observed that the Noor Mukadam case was the direct result of a “vice” spreading in society known as “living relationship”. It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.
In a meeting today, the committee questioned what “would happen to the conviction rate in cases against women, which is already shameful, if a judge himself has made such remarks.”
The committee summoned advocate generals, prosecutor generals, police officials and all relevant authorities due to the low conviction rate.
Conviction rate in cases of gender-based violence (GBV) is reportedly as low as 1.2 per cent due to weak prosecution and judicial delays.
Women’s rights advocates say there is also no centralised GBV database, hindering data analysis. Furthermore, due to resource constraints, shelters and crisis centres, GBV courts, police protection cells, and the like are underfunded.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at the Islamabad residence of Zahir Zakir Jaffer in July 2021. In May, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Najafi, had upheld the death sentence awarded to Zahir, who was convicted by an Islamabad trial court in 2022.
Last month, the apex court had taken up Zakir’s review petition challenging the capital punishment awarded to him. During the hearing, Justice Najafi told senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the convict, that it would be more appropriate for him to start arguments after going through the additional note he had not yet issued at the time.
Later, Justice Najafi was sworn in as a judge of the FCC, established earlier this month after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In an additional note on the Noor murder case, which was uploaded on the SC website on Wednesday, Justice Najafi upheld the sentence handed to Zahir and observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’ [sic]”.
He stressed that such relationships ignored “societal compulsions” and “defy not only the law of the land but also the personal law” under Sharia.
The judge’s observations, which surfaced just a day after the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, also triggered criticism from many on social media, including lawyers and journalists.

In many countries, the rule of law is becoming rule by law, with executive priorities dictating legislative action and overriding judicial checks on government regulation of the internet, enabling widespread abuses that impact freedom of expression, privacy, and due process, among other fundamental rights..
In particular, expanded government authority and the aggressive online surveillance it enables are being coded into laws and public policies, allowing governments to overreach the garb of legality and require compliance by domestic and foreign internet service providers (ISPs) — is typically tied to the State’s deployment of intrusive tech tools to monitor and access user communications and data, usually without public oversight.
Pakistan’s track record is no better; in fact, the country’s trajectory is a troubling example of this trend. From the deployment of a national “firewall” in recent years to the discovery of a “Lawful Intercept Management System”, user data and citizen privacy remain hostage to political ambitions and corporate collusion.



The upsurge in the use of these surveillance technologies has raised alarms about the erosion of privacy and the weakening of democratic norms. The Pegasus Project, for one, unveiled how governments — particularly authoritarian regimes — employ sophisticated spyware to infiltrate devices of journalists, activists, and political adversaries, extracting sensitive information without consent.
The Pegasus spyware can gather data, record video and audio, take screenshots and track location, all without the user’s knowledge. The infection occurs silently, without the target ever clicking on a link or answering a call. As of 2021, The Guardian reported that the technology had been sold to 40 governments around the world, ostensibly to combat terrorism and crime, though forensic analyses cast doubt on these justifications.
This was the same year the Pegasus Project revealed India as one of several countries utilising the spyware and released surveillance lists containing identities of prominent persons who were targeted. The data collected was not disaggregated, and individual searches were therefore not attributable to specific countries; nor could it be said with certainty whether any particular hack was successful.
Nevertheless, thousands of Indian citizens appeared on the surveillance list, including ministers, opposition leaders, journalists and activists. The surveillance list also included hundreds of Pakistani phone numbers, including one belonging to former prime minister Imran Khan.
Pakistan’s track record is no better. A 2013 report by Citizen Lab revealed the presence of command-and-control servers for FinFisher — a commercial network intrusion malware capable of intercepting communications, accessing private data, and recording audio and video from computers or mobile devices — in Pakistan. The server was employed on a network owned by the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL), a now-privatised state-owned entity, with 62 per cent government shareholding.
Mass network surveillance has existed in Pakistan since at least 2005, with spying technologies obtained from both domestic and international companies, including Alcatel, Ericsson, SS8 and Utimaco, revealed a 2015 report by Privacy International.
It also documented Pakistan’s consistent cooperation with the US National Security Agency (NSA), exposing its participation in the NSA’s Fairview Program and SKYNET initiative. Pakistan has featured strongly in the NSA’s Fairview Program, which involves the mass surveillance of individuals within and outside the US, facilitated by a ‘highly collaborative’ partnership with AT&T, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the US.
The SKYNET programme, which algorithmises terrorist detection by harvesting cellular metadata from Pakistani telecom service providers, was used to identify thousands of alleged ‘extremists’ in Pakistan between 2004 and 2016, who were later killed through drone strikes.
In 2019, The Guardian reported that at least two dozen Pakistani government officials had been targeted using Israeli spyware, alongside lawyers, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, and diplomats. The malware reportedly exploited a vulnerability in WhatsApp, allowing operators to access encrypted messages and other sensitive data on the targets’ devices.
While these attacks were not initially credited to Pakistani authorities, in 2023, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and various police units in Pakistan have been using the software since at least 2012. Local officials later confirmed that the spyware — a dated version of Israeli company Cellebrite’s Universal Forensics Extraction Device (UFED) — had been acquired indirectly, through foreign agents, despite the lack of diplomatic ties between the countries.
Around the same time, it was further revealed that Pakistan acquired the services of a controversial Canada-based company, Sandvine, through an $18.5 million contract, to help build a nationwide ‘web monitoring system’. This system would use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to monitor communications, as well as measure and record traffic and call data, on behalf of the country’s national telecommunications regulator, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).
This was seemingly pursuant to the Monitoring and Reconciliation of Telephony Traffic Regulations, 2010, issued by the PTA, which alleged that it discontinued its use of DPI services in mid-2023.
In 2024, Pakistan tested a national internet ‘firewall’, using Chinese technology, which allowed the government to bolster its web monitoring capabilities and regulate the use of popular platforms by blocking specific features within an app or a website. It was deployed at the country’s main internet gateways, as well as the data centres of mobile service and major internet service providers, and triggered numerous complaints of poor internet connectivity.

 

The Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS) is yet another surveillance mechanism employed by the Pakistani state, and can be used to retrieve the unencrypted data of any consumer, eavesdrop on their calls, and read text messages. The tool recently came to light, following a series of leaked audios which resulted in litigation before the Islamabad High Court, and revealed a growing trend of politicised intrusion that now threatens the independence and integrity of key institutions, including that of the judiciary.

In a turbulent political and legal climate such as that of Pakistan, the impact of leaked audios is immediate, driven by a widespread presumption of truth.

They possess the power to coerce, damage reputations, and shape public narratives well before the facts come to light. By the time clarity emerges, the damage is done — hardened public opinion, suffered reputations. The perpetrators, on the other hand, remain elusive, while societal pressure descends upon the latest target.
To highlight the far-reaching consequences of such breaches of privacy, we explored a selection of audio leaks that have surfaced since 2022, implicating an array of influentials, including politicians and judges. By examining the legal, social, and political fallout of these audio leaks, we seek to establish how this strategically disseminated information functions not only as a tool of public embarrassment but as a means to exert pressure, undermine credibility, and influence institutional conduct and decision-making.
It also outlines the glaring shortcomings in the domestic legal framework that enable such intrusions, offering no meaningful recourse, with an aim to highlight the evolving risks posed to democratic accountability and judicial independence in an age where state surveillance operates with little transparency and even less restraint.
While this article is rooted in the Pakistani experience, its relevance transcends national borders. The tactics, technologies, and political incentives behind the weaponisation of data are not unique to any one country — they reflect a global trend in which digital surveillance, audio manipulation, and leak-driven smear campaigns are increasingly deployed to shape public perception and suppress dissent.
As democratic institutions around the world grapple with declining public trust and as constitutional frameworks struggle to keep pace with technological advancement, the Pakistani example serves as a cautionary tale. It emphasises the urgent need for international scrutiny, effective legal safeguards, and civic vigilance to protect the integrity of judicial systems, political discourse, and the private lives of citizens before fundamental freedoms become (fundamentally) fiction.
Here, we focus on a set of audio leaks that resulted in litigation before the Islamabad High Court (IHC), in what is commonly known as the ‘Audio Leaks Case’. It was a case that laid bare the state’s ability to undertake mass surveillance of citizens through LIMS and brought to the fore flaws in the domestic legal framework that enable the misuse of such spying technologies.
The revelations made during the case have reinforced long-standing suspicions of institutional manipulation and state complicity, heightening concerns over the integrity and independence of Pakistan’s democratic institutions, including the judiciary. The potential impact of such reputational warfare, both on the individual and institutional level, is evident from the aftermath of the numerous audio leaks surfacing in recent years, involving judges, politicians, and private individuals — many of whom are either directly affiliated with the PTI or perceived to be aligned with Imran’s political camp.
Once installed, the LIMS enabled the interception of consumer data by allowing designated agencies to directly tap into the network of service providers — which is done with just a click of a button — by initiating a track and trace request using a unique SIM, IMEI or MSISDN number associated with the consumer’s device. The subsequent process was then entirely automatic, with the SMS, CDRs and metadata associated with the consumer being reported into a monitoring centre established at the surveillance centre.
Through another server, the entire content of the consumer’s communications routed through the telecommunications service provider (TSP) — including audio, video and search histories — would be transmitted to this monitoring centre, and stored. Any encrypted material, generated from applications such as WhatsApp, that formed part of the transmitted data would also be shared. And while the LIMS itself could not automatically decrypt such data, requests for decryption could be made to the company owning the relevant application.
Moreover, TSPs were required to ensure that up to 2pc of their entire consumer base could be surveilled through the LIMS. The TSPs reiterated that they had no way to monitor which consumers were being surveilled. The designated agencies could therefore access the LIMS, a mass surveillance system exposing the data of over four million citizens, without any supervision, oversight or control.
In its consequent order — issued on June 25, 2024 — the IHC noted how, throughout the proceedings, the federal government, its divisions, law enforcement agencies, and the intelligence agencies denied that any agency or entity had been authorised to undertake surveillance pursuant to the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996 (PTRA), Investigation for Fair Trial Act, 2013 (IFTA), and/or the Telegraph Act — the only laws providing for lawful interception — or that any rules had been made for this purpose.

 

The court found that this gave rise to one of two possibilities: either the state, through its investigative and intelligence agencies, never deemed it necessary to conduct surveillance for any legitimate state purpose and therefore did not do so; alternatively, that these agencies do, in fact, engage in surveillance, albeit unlawfully, without any legal authority or oversight.
It referenced numerous instances of audio leaks, beyond the subject audios, in the recent past, including the leaks referenced earlier in this article. From this, the IHC stated it could be logically deduced that there are surveillance mechanisms in place, and in use, enabling the recording of the highest executive, legislative and judicial officeholders of the country.
The court further observed that this was both “frightening and damning for a rule of law democracy functioning under the Constitution”, noting that Article 14 guarantees the right to privacy, whereas the right to life and liberty under Article 9 also includes the right of citizens to be left alone in their private spheres. The freedom of speech, guaranteed under Article 19, also includes the freedom to speak freely, without the state prying into the conversation.
However, these constitutional guarantees had been undermined through the mass surveillance of citizens in Pakistan without any constitutional or legal backing or judicial oversight. Justice Babar Sattar of the IHC — who heard the case among other judges — likened this to George Orwell’s book 1984, observing that the mass surveillance system seemed to be inspired by the dystopian novel.
While it appears that the federal government and its extensions, including the law enforcement and intelligence agencies, may have succeeded in evading accountability this time, it is nevertheless important to examine the rather suspect claims made in the process and chart a course that leads to true progress.
The positions taken by the Pakistani government are not without precedent; rather, they reflect a broader global pattern, transcending the issue of surveillance, wherein national security imperatives are invoked to deflect scrutiny with respect to the use of broad discretionary powers, often at the cost of constitutional freedoms. This moment, therefore, offers a critical opportunity for all democratic societies to reflect more seriously on the legal and institutional safeguards we must advocate for to ensure that such powers are not exercised in ways that violate fundamental freedoms.
In Pakistan’s case, the federal government contends that it lacks the technological capability to surveil citizens, or to identify those doing so, and has not authorised any agency or body for this purpose. The contention is, however, clearly contradicted by publicly available data, such as Privacy International’s comprehensive special report on security and surveillance in Pakistan, which reveals that the country not only possesses a wealth of surveillance technologies but has also actively facilitated local intelligence agencies and foreign states in surveilling its own citizens.
And while it is acknowledged that the mere existence of surveillance capability does not, on its own, prove culpability, it does raise urgent questions about oversight, access controls, and the potential for abuse, whether by rogue officials, ‘hostile agencies’, or state institutions themselves.
In any jurisdiction, the unchecked capacity to collect and retain personal data opens the door to misuse, even when deployed to meet admittedly legitimate objectives, such as national security or criminal justice. Following the issuance of the July 8 notification, wherein the government granted the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) broad-based powers of surveillance, thereby increasing the potential for abuse.
Consequently, the ISI is left to determine the boundaries of vague terms such as “national security” and the “apprehension” of an offence.
What emerges from the audio leaks case, hence, is not necessarily a conclusive finding of state complicity but, perhaps, a deeper institutional failure: either to prevent abuse of power, or to ensure that objectives of national security and criminal justice are met proportionately and made subject to democratic oversight and legal accountability.
We have seen that in the absence of such safeguards, breaches of digital privacy stand to inflict irreparable harm on the reputations, liberties, and safety of individuals, from ordinary citizens to politicians, often without the procedural protections of due process. These harms reverberate throughout the democratic system, deterring the freedom of expression, quelling dissent, and undermining the integrity of core institutions, including the judiciary.

A society stricken by the fear of such harm can never truly be free.

To facilitate meaningful progress, we must therefore move beyond critique and commit to concrete, actionable reforms. What follows is an attempt to do just that, by proposing targeted legislation and amendments to the existing legal framework designed to minimise the risk of misuse, manipulation, or even negligent oversight of surveillance powers.
In Pakistan, the unresolved discord between key statutes governing the interception of information, particularly the PTRA and the IFTA, heightens the risk of Pakistan’s surveillance framework being abused, leaving loopholes that can be exploited by those for whom the lack of data security represents an opportunity, rather than a liability.
During the audio leaks case, Justice Sattar had commented that any rules made to regulate the authorising and conducting of surveillance under Section 54 of the PTRA would necessarily have to comply with the IFTA; however, this does not settle the matter. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the legislature or the superior judiciary to resolve this issue, as presently, Section 54 of the PTRA provides a means to circumvent and render redundant the elaborate procedure and safeguards laid out under the IFTA.
Empowering the ISI to conduct surveillance, while bypassing the need for a judicial warrant under the IFTA, is clear evidence of this glaring flaw in Pakistan’s legal framework.
There is also a need to narrow the boundaries of what constitutes ‘lawful’ interception or surveillance. In Pakistan, the IFTA achieves this goal through the use of clear language and provisions to prevent and punish the misuse of surveillance frameworks. However, as previously mentioned, the beneficial effects of the IFTA are neutered by Section 54 of the PTRA, which employs far broader language, including vague references to ‘national security’, and does not contain any mechanism to punish such abuse.
It is this disharmony that enabled the federal government to issue the July 8 notification, following which no individual warrants will have to be sought, and the government may authorise surveillance at its discretion without being bound by the provisions of the IFTA. The ISI, in turn, will have unfettered access to Pakistan’s surveillance infrastructure, likely with little to no oversight.

 

With no safeguards to mitigate excesses, it is impossible to predict the extent of intrusive surveillance Pakistani citizens will be subjected to under the guise of ‘national security’. This controversy can only be resolved through the legislative process, or by the judiciary, which can exercise its powers of judicial review to harmonise the PTRA with the IFTA, or, alternatively, to invoke Article 8 of the Constitution and strike down the portions of the PTRA deemed inconsistent with fundamental rights.
But, beyond this, there remains a dire need to supplement the existing legislative framework with a comprehensive personal data law. This is particularly crucial, given there is currently no legal framework to regulate the interception, use, collection, storage and disclosure of personal data by the government, organisations and other individuals and entities in Pakistan.
While the Ministry of IT&T proposed a Personal Data Protection Bill for this purpose in 2023, the latter was subjected to great criticism for ambiguities, lending themselves to exploitation. Despite the barrage of audio leaks seen in 2023, this Bill has yet to be debated or passed into law.
There is therefore a critical need to design effective legal mechanisms to detect and punish the misuse of personal data, both by domestic and foreign entities. The framework in the European Union (EU) provides a useful model, incorporating both reactive and pre-emptive measures for data protection, while empowering individuals to monitor the collection of their data.
Lastly, it is essential to ensure that unlawfully obtained digital content is not admissible in judicial, disciplinary, or administrative proceedings, or allowed to influence such proceedings, whether directly or indirectly, especially where it infringes upon the fundamental right to privacy. Institutions cannot operate with integrity when their internal dynamics are susceptible to manipulation through illegitimate digital disclosures.
Moreover, using such material to punish or discipline individuals sets a dangerous precedent: one which legitimises unlawful surveillance and encourages its use. This practice must be unequivocally rejected, not only by those targeted but by society as a whole.
While Pakistan’s failure to confront the fallout of its recent digital scandals represents a missed opportunity for reform, on a global scale, its experience demonstrates the urgent need for comprehensive data protection laws that both prevent and punish invasions of privacy and are insulated from political interference.

In both fragile democracies and mature legal systems, unchecked surveillance and politicised data breaches threaten to compromise institutional independence and derail accountability mechanisms and fundamental freedoms, striking at the very foundations of justice.

Upholding the sanctity of privacy is therefore not merely a matter of personal liberties, but a collective imperative to preserve the integrity of democratic institutions and uphold the rule of law. As digital intrusions grow more sophisticated and pervasive, the task for the global community is clear: to build resilient legal frameworks capable of withstanding manipulation and protecting the democratic values they claim to uphold.
However, our success in this regard presupposes the existence of a rule of law regime, one where the various branches of the state remain confined to their spheres and abide by both the letter and the spirit of the law.
It also requires meaningful compliance by private organisations and entities which are bound by international principles and obligations to safeguard consumer data, such as under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).
These international instruments now stand enshrined in principles laid out by the Global Network Initiative, which was launched in 2008 to protect and advance the freedom of expression and privacy rights, by setting global standards in the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector to regulate decision-making in the face of government restrictions and demands. The GNI comprises internet platforms, telecommunication operators, equipment vendors and other entities playing a key role across the ICT sector.
The role of private organisations and entities is thus of great importance, as a refusal to comply with illegal surveillance requests has the potential to do grave damage to the existing surveillance framework in Pakistan and in other jurisdictions.
Lastly, as individuals, what we can do is to fulfil a more fundamental duty: to reject vague denials, institutional silence, and the normalisation of unchecked surveillance, wherever we may be. We must demand that our governments uphold their constitutional commitments and international obligations with respect to the freedom of expression, and the rights to privacy and due process, regardless of our personal affiliations or political leanings.
Ultimately, we must recognise that when the rights of even one individual are compromised, the rights of all are endangered.



In the battle to protect privacy rights, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) companies operating in Pakistan often find themselves in a bind — caught between the demands of an authoritarian state and their duty to uphold human rights.
Since 2022, a political barrage has been rattling Pakistan with a series of high-profile audio leaks that surfaced online involving senior government officials and opposition leaders. The leaks, widely suspected to have originated from government intelligence agencies, exposed private conversations and sensitive political strategies between political figures. The fallout was immediate and severe; public trust in the government was further eroded, opposition parties denounced the surveillance as unconstitutional, and civil society groups raised concerns about the growing encroachment on privacy.
The scandal underscored a longstanding and deeply troubling reality in the country: the prevalent use of highly intrusive surveillance technologies with little to no accountability. This situation raises a critical question: what are the responsibilities of ICT companies operating in regimes like Pakistan, when confronted by potentially unlawful government demands to deploy highly intrusive surveillance technologies against the public and political figures?
As conduits for the transmission of data and telecommunications, ICT companies are often beset by governments’ demands to engage in surveillance. When such governments demand access to user data or pressure companies to otherwise invade the privacy of public and political figures, ICT companies face complex legal, ethical, and operational challenges.
The situation in Pakistan thus reflects a broader global issue: how should private companies balance their legal obligations to host governments with their responsibility to protect user data and personal privacy — an internationally recognised human right?

 

Here, we argue that ICT companies should adhere to international standards that recognise their responsibility to respect human rights, including privacy, as outlined in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and by the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder initiative that implements the UNGPs for the ICT sector.
The UNGPs, endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011, provide a global framework for businesses to prevent and address human rights impacts, emphasising accountability and due diligence. When operating in countries such as Pakistan, where digital rights are actively suppressed, this responsibility becomes even more urgent and morally significant.
ICT companies are not merely passive players; they are intermediaries with the capacity to shape the frontiers of digital rights and privacy protections.
Responsibility to respect human rights
This section examines the international legal normative framework governing the responsibility of ICT companies to respect human rights, with a particular focus on the right to privacy. The framework is primarily guided by the UNGPs and the GNI Principles — the latter commit ICT companies to uphold freedom of expression and privacy rights, while the former offer practical measures for conducting human rights due diligence and addressing government requests for data or censorship.

A. Under the UNGPs, ICT companies have a responsibility to respect the right to privacy as a human right.
1. ICT companies should enact policies to avoid infringing on the privacy rights of others, recognising that the right to privacy is an internationally recognised human right.

Under the UNGPs, ICT companies are called upon to respect the right to privacy as a fundamental human right. Principle 11 of the UNGPs states that companies should first adopt policies and practices to ensure they do not infringe on the privacy rights of others.
The right to privacy is an internationally recognised human right that companies should respect globally, regardless of state actions or national laws. They are expected to take proactive steps to prevent, mitigate, and remedy any harms to privacy rights, which includes enacting human rights policies and effectively implementing them in their business operations. Furthermore, companies should avoid undermining state human rights obligations or judicial integrity when addressing privacy concerns.
Similarly, under Principle 12 of the UNGPs, ICT companies are expected to respect the right to privacy as a recognised human right. Heightened attention should be given to individuals and groups most at risk of privacy violations in specific industries or contexts. Vulnerable groups, including journalists, women, religious minorities, and political opponents, warrant special attention.
These obligations, reinforced by GNI Principles, apply specifically to ICT companies that agree to adhere. According to the GNI Principles’ Preamble, ICT companies joining the initiative should respect and promote both freedom of expression and privacy rights as expressed therein. Companies under GNI are expected to support privacy rights through responsible business decisions, shared learning, and collaboration with other stakeholders.

 

While these companies are required to comply with local laws, they must also strive to uphold international human rights standards and minimise any adverse impacts arising from conflicting national legal frameworks. Although the GNI Principles apply only to member ICT companies, they provide expert normative guidance for the sector as a whole on how the UNGP should be applied.
GNI Principle 3 defines privacy as a fundamental human right that protects human dignity, security, and freedom of expression. All individuals have the right to legal protection against unlawful or arbitrary interference with their privacy. Accordingly, under the GNI Principles framework, ICT companies are responsible for safeguarding user privacy on a global scale, even when faced with intrusive government demands. Companies are expected to uphold international standards and resist pressures that conflict with these fundamental privacy protections.

2. ICT companies should conduct thorough due diligence and risk assessments to identify, prevent, mitigate, and address potential privacy rights violations arising from their business activities.

Under Principle 13 of the UNGP on Business and Human Rights, businesses must avoid causing or contributing to human rights harms and take action to address them when they occur. Even if a company is not directly responsible for a violation, it must still prevent or mitigate human rights harms linked to its operations, products, or services through business relationships.
The GNI Principles reinforce this obligation by requiring ICT companies to identify situations where privacy rights may be jeopardised or advanced and to integrate these findings into their decision-making processes. Section 3.4 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines specifically states that participating companies must assess the human rights risks associated with the collection, storage, and retention of personal information in the jurisdictions where they operate. This means companies need to evaluate how their data practices, including cross-border data transfers and government surveillance requests, could affect users’ privacy rights.
Principle 17 of the UNGPs further establishes that human rights due diligence should involve an ongoing process of assessing actual and potential privacy rights impacts, acting upon the findings, tracking responses, and communicating how these impacts are being addressed. Due diligence should not be a one-time exercise; it must adapt and conform to evolving risks over time and begin early in the development of new activities or business relationships, including mergers, acquisitions, and contractual agreements.
By implementing robust human rights policies and due diligence frameworks, ICT companies can ensure they meet international human rights standards while safeguarding user privacy.

3. ICT companies should be transparent about their human rights impacts, disclosing policies and practices related to government surveillance requests and user data protection.

ICT companies have a responsibility to be transparent about their human rights impacts, especially concerning government surveillance requests and user data protection practices. Under Principle 21 of the UNGPs, companies are expected to communicate externally about how they address human rights impacts, especially when affected stakeholders raise concerns.
For companies operating in high-risk contexts, this obligation extends to formally reporting on how they manage human rights risks and impacts.

Communication should be provided in a form and frequency that accurately reflects the company’s human rights impact and ensures accessibility for the intended audience.

The GNI Principles reinforce these transparency obligations by establishing a framework for governance, accountability, and transparency. According to GNI Principle 6, companies must operate under a collectively determined governance structure that clearly defines roles and responsibilities, ensuring that accountability is maintained.
Transparency should include public disclosure of human rights policies and practices as well as independent assessments of the company’s implementation efforts. By adopting transparent communication and governance structures, ICT companies can build trust with stakeholders and demonstrate their commitment to respecting privacy rights and broader human rights standards.

B. Obligations of ICT Companies in Responding to Arbitrary Surveillance Requests from Repressive Regimes

Further building on the framework established by the UNGPs as well as the GNI Principles and Implementing Guidelines, this section examines the obligations of ICT companies when responding to arbitrary surveillance requests from authoritarian regimes. It outlines key international standards that ICT companies should adhere to and the practical challenges they face when domestic laws conflict with global privacy norms. The suggested framework guides ICT companies with strategies to balance legal compliance, corporate responsibility, and human rights protection in authoritarian regimes.

1. ICT companies should encourage governments to establish legal regimes that comply with international standards on human rights, including privacy rights.

ICT companies have a broader responsibility to promote alignment between domestic regulations and international privacy standards. Section 3.1 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines advises companies to encourage governments to adopt specific, transparent, and consistent legal frameworks governing surveillance and privacy. Governments should be urged to harmonise their domestic regulations with international human rights standards, particularly those related to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.
To support this effort, companies should develop internal policies and procedures that guide how they anticipate, assess and respond to government demands for content restrictions or disclosure of personal information. Adopting a structured approach, companies can ensure that their own actions, as well as their responses to government demands, remain consistent with human rights obligations.
Encouraging governments to comply with international standards helps establish a more predictable and rights-respecting legal environment, even in politically restrictive jurisdictions.

2. ICT companies should require the government to follow established domestic legal processes that implement or reflect international human rights standards.

ICT companies should require governments to comply with domestic legal procedures when seeking to access user information or restrict communications. According to Section 3.2 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines, companies should ensure that any government demand for personal data, content removal, or communication restrictions follows established domestic legal processes.
The GNI Implementation Guidelines emphasise that companies should request clear written communications from the government explaining the legal basis for such demands. This ensures that the company’s response is based on a transparent and well-defined legal framework.
Moreover, Section 3.5 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines encourages companies to operate transparently when responding to government requests. Transparency includes informing users about government requests where legally possible and issuing public reports that summarise the nature and scope of such requests. This approach helps prevent governments from overstepping legal boundaries and ensures that companies uphold their commitment to protecting user privacy and freedom of expression.

3. ICT companies should challenge overbroad, arbitrary, or otherwise unlawful government restrictions.

When governments make surveillance requests that exceed legal limits, ICT companies are encouraged to push back. Section 3.3 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines urges companies to seek clarification or modification from authorised officials when surveillance requests appear overbroad or unlawful. If the government’s response remains unsatisfactory, companies should, for the purpose of seeking guidance and support, engage with relevant stakeholders, including government authorities, international human rights bodies, and non-governmental organisations.

 

In cases where the government’s actions would clearly violate domestic legal standards, companies are encouraged to challenge such measures through domestic courts. Such legal challenges not only protect the rights of individual users but also set important precedents that may influence future government conduct. Taking legal action demonstrates the company’s commitment to defending user rights and upholding global privacy norms even in difficult political environments.

4. ICT companies should move to uphold human rights and privacy when domestic laws and/or government conduct conflict with international standards.

ICT companies have a responsibility to uphold human rights and protect user privacy, even when domestic laws and/or government conduct conflict with internationally recognised standards. According to Principle 23(b) of the UNGPs, businesses must respect human rights regardless of the political or legal context in which they operate.

When domestic laws prevent full compliance with international human rights standards, companies should strive to honour these international standards and principles to the greatest extent possible and demonstrate their efforts to mitigate harm.

The GNI Principles reinforce the expectation that companies will protect user privacy. ICT companies will respect and work to protect the privacy rights of users when confronted with government demands, laws, or regulations that compromise privacy in a manner inconsistent with internationally recognised laws and standards. Companies should treat human rights risks as legal compliance issues and take steps to reduce potential harm.
ICT companies can take several steps to navigate these complex challenges. They can seek advice from internal cross-functional teams and external experts, including governments, civil society, national human rights institutions, and multi-stakeholder initiatives. Collaboration and consultation with stakeholders can help companies develop more effective strategies for responding to government demands while maintaining a strong commitment to human rights and privacy.
Moreover, ICT companies can challenge overbroad, arbitrary, or unlawful requests by demanding formal legal justifications and operating with transparency. They can report the nature and frequency of government requests for user data or surveillance, for example. Upholding these principles helps maintain user trust and ensures that ICT companies remain aligned with international human rights norms.



Picture this: the First Lady was on the phone discussing political party-related information. A number of political events cause friction and instability within the government. In the midst of this political turmoil, the First Lady’s phone conversations are strategically leaked to the press.
Sounds like the audio leaks case in Pakistan, specifically the audio recordings released of ex-prime minister Imran Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, and her private conversations. Surprise! It is actually a recent series of released audio recordings of Kim Keon Hee, the wife of former South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol.
In February 2025, a phone conversation between Kim Keon Hee and a political broker was made public by a local weekly affairs magazine. Although the conversations occurred before President Yoon took office in May 2022, they were likely leaked in 2025 because of the pending impeachment trials of President Yoon.
First Lady Kim, speaking on behalf of the then President-Elect Yoon, and the political broker were allegedly discussing the ruling People Power Party’s candidate nomination process for the 2022 parliamentary by-elections. These recordings confirmed allegations against Kim and President Yoon that they were involved in illegal election meddling. Their release to the public further complicated the couple’s legal troubles, and since then, Korea’s highest court has affirmed the impeachment of President Yoon.
Similarly, in Pakistan, a number of private audio recordings of high-level political actors were recently made available online, a couple of which were the subject of litigation before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
In April 2023, an audio recording of Mian Najamul Saqib, son of the former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, was leaked; in November 2023, a recording of a conversation between Bushra Bibi, Imran, and her lawyer was released; and in November 2024, another of Bushra Bibi’s phone conversations discussing politics and strategies was made public.
These leaked conversations were scandalous because they touched on political and internal affairs. In particular, the recordings of Bibi’s conversations were all released within the period that Bibi and former Prime Minister Khan were fighting a legal battle against bribery allegations. The consequent audio leaks case, or ALC, as the joint litigation is known in Pakistan, is representative of the type of nefarious surveillance that has silenced political opponents, suppressed journalists from sharing information critical of the government, and put citizens in fear of repercussions from their online activities.

 

The joint case of Bushra Bibi and Mian Najamul Saqib has become the leading case symbolising the fight against state surveillance overreach in Pakistan, highlighting that no one is out of reach.
What can the parallel travails of former presidents and their spouses in Pakistan and South Korea tell us about government surveillance capabilities and the abuse of such power? The two countries have walked a similar path: starting from the end of military dictatorships, digital repressive policies of the government, the use of government surveillance of civilians to further the state’s interests, and now the public release of the private conversations of the wives of former heads of each state’s government.
Here, we will present a case study of state surveillance in South Korea and draw broad comparisons between that context and the Pakistani one, of which the ALC is emblematic. It will highlight the history of the South Korean government’s use of overly broad surveillance to set up a discussion of similar government surveillance practices in Pakistan.
The goal is to provide a foundation for readers to better understand the issue of state surveillance and draw insight into the readers’ own circumstances and needs. Specifically, the study of South Korea can help to illustrate where the ALC is headed within the Pakistani legal system, how it might be understood by Pakistani citizens, and how people can respond to a government that does not respect their privacy rights.
Global internet freedom has been declining as authoritarian governments continue in their efforts to repress the flow of news and information, centralise state control over internet infrastructure, and create barriers to cross-border transfers of user data.
Reflections on South Korean, Pakistani leaks
There are a number of parallels between Pakistan’s current surveillance practices and the history of state surveillance in South Korea. Notably, both countries face the recent issue of the public release of private conversations involving the wives of the former president or prime minister, as well as challenges to accountability for government malfeasance.
Some of the parallels between the obstacles faced in Pakistan and those described in the South Korean case study in this regard suggest significant insights that are explored below.
The scandal generated by the audio leaks case has highlighted several challenges that Pakistan must address to make similar progress in curbing the its abusive surveillance practices and policies, namely, (a) overly broad laws authorising or enabling virtually unlimited surveillance powers; (b) government agencies and other state actors exercising nearly unlimited surveillance powers with little to no effective oversight, judicial or otherwise; (b) the nonexistence of data protection laws; and (c) the susceptibility of ICT companies to surveillance and data requests by state actors.
Government agencies’ power of surveillance
Both South Korea and Pakistan have agencies with broad statutory authority to conduct intrusive surveillance. In March 2024, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), in response to the IHC’s inquiry into the role of the government in the ALC, asserted its national security authority to intercept calls by telecom operators.
This takes place through the PTA’s own licensing clauses, which permit the state to suspend or modify telecommunication systems and licenses over the preference of any licensee upon a broad declaration of emergency. Furthermore, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) grants surveillance powers to agencies within Pakistan. There is no adequate oversight, and provisions grant powers to “law enforcement to seize digital devices and content.”
Similarly, 1980s legislation granted South Korea’s intelligence agencies broad authority to collect and compile information regarding public safety against communists and plots to overthrow the government. Despite transitioning to democratic rule, the Korean government has made no significant change to limit the scope of the power of surveillance permitted by this statute.
However, the South Korean judicial system no longer permits the broad scope of this legislation to allow intrusive surveillance of civilians. As seen above, South Korean officials who overreached in their surveillance of private citizens were subject to investigations and criminal convictions.
Legislation
Both countries have legislation granting the government expansive legal authority to surveil citizens.
The PTA draws its power to spy from the Pakistan Telecommunications (Reorganisation) Act (2010), the Investigation of Fair Trial Act (2016), and the Telecom Act (1996). In particular, Section 54 of the TRA grants the federal government power to intercept conversations or to trace those conversations through any telecommunication system.
The Investigation of Fair Trial Act then permits the interception of and direct access to all information upon the issuance of a warrant by a high court judge. There is also Peca, which “grants powers to law enforcement to seize digital devices and content.”
Peca — which penalises acts of cyberterrorism, hate speech, defamation, and the dissemination of false information — has been widely abused and lacks proper oversight. Such broad surveillance powers have resulted in allegations of intelligence agencies monitoring human rights defenders, journalists, politicians, and other dissidents or opponents of the current ruling political party.

 

With respect to the audio leaks case, while there is no identified source linked to Bushra Bibi and Saqib’s conversations, there is a widespread understanding that intelligence agencies had to have been involved. In court, government agencies have denied any liability by citing the aforementioned laws as the legal basis for collecting information from telecommunication companies.
Similarly, the Korean National Security Act (NSA) was passed in the mid-20th century to punish “those praising or sympathising with an anti-state group”. But the law has been most often used to imprison people who exercised their right to freedom of expression in the 20th Century.
Significantly, although other political and judicial limitations have evolved, the South Korean government has not reformed the statute to limit its broad scope; this, despite criticism from human rights organisations on how the law violates international human rights norms.
A key difference between the two case studies relates to data protection laws, emphasising their importance. While South Korea has enacted a robust data protection legal framework, in part to counteract widespread abuse of surveillance powers, Pakistan has no stand-alone data protection legislation. Despite some efforts to adopt such a law, there is currently no legislation in Pakistan that shields personal data from either private or government entities.
Role of government requests to private companies
Companies in both countries are susceptible to government requests for users’ private information. While it has not been ascertained yet as to how the audio leaks subject of the litigation occurred, the government’s position was that user devices could have been hacked or accessed by a third party, and that it was not the result of “lawful” interception.
The position taken by telecom operators in the case was that there are several laws and regulations that require the disclosure of user data, in particular their licenses issued by the PTA, due to which they are obligated to comply. Corporate telecom operators cited the same legal authorities as the PTA, specifically provisions that authorise government agencies to collect information from private companies, which is obligated through the PTA’s licensure requirement.
Similarly, South Korea permits government agencies to collect information from private companies through warrants and other legal government requests. Former President Park Geun-hye attempted to use this opportunity to monitor private messages sent through Kakao Talk — the main messaging app in Korea — to crack down on messages deemed as critical of her presidency.
As mentioned above, an ICT company’s susceptibility to the government’s request to pry into its users’ conversations led to the mass exodus of users, ultimately forcing the company to promise it would no longer respond to government requests for access to information. Most importantly, it was an encouraging example of a company willing to push back on government data requests and assume the possible legal consequences to retain its customers’ trust.
Lessons from South Korea
The foregoing makes clear a number of the similarities between the South Korean case study and the situation in Pakistan, as exemplified by the audio leaks case, in terms of government surveillance power and potential abuses of that power.
The key question thus remains: what are the differences between the two that might explain why government surveillance in South Korea has been scaled back, and is being held in check more effectively?
In short, the experience of South Korea highlights the importance of global and domestic media attention, widespread popular mobilisation, and the role of responsible ICT company conduct in combating state overreach, among others. When these factors converge, the case study suggests, abusive surveillance policies and practices can be reined in and wrongdoers held accountable, at least to some extent.
South Korea is an example of how factors like domestic and global media coverage, along with public mobilisation, can pressure governments to phase out abusive surveillance practices and even repeal repressive policies that violate constitutional and human rights.
The press and public backlash to the Chun government’s torture and killing of student activists Park Jong-chul in 1987; the negative coverage of government abuses in relation to South Korea hosting the 1988 Olympics; the scandals generated by the surveillance of political opponents during the administrations of Presidents Roh and Lee; and the huge outcry against President Park for spying on the families of the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy, as well as her political opponents, leading to her impeachment in 2016; these key moments in South Korea’s history all reflect the way in which democratic forces can positively influence public policies on state surveillance and respect for privacy rights.
In addition, even where government agencies have broad surveillance powers authorised by statute, these positive forces can motivate ICT companies to “do the right thing”, as Kakao Talk did in response to President Park’s unlawful surveillance of its messaging app and network.
Another key feature of the South Korean landscape that finds no direct corollary in Pakistan is the existence of a robust data protection legal framework that is strongly enforced; this acts to counterbalance at least some of the potential government overreach otherwise enabled by law. Indeed, ICT companies will be less susceptible to government surveillance and data requests when those powers are curbed by law in line with constitutional and human rights norms.
Such legal reform in turn can be enabled by international media and diplomatic pressure, which dovetail with domestic public backlash to positive change — a dynamic that altered the practice of state surveillance in South Korea.
It should be noted that surveillance by the South Korean authorities remains ongoing despite the positive evolution of public policies over the past several decades. Surveillance is still being used against citizens to silence political opponents and dissidents. However, the South Korean media and legal system continue to push back against the State’s overreach, fueled by the public’s decreased tolerance of abusive practices for the historical reason discussed.
And as technological advancements have made it faster and easier for South Korean citizens to access information, it has become harder for government officials to use surveillance powers against the interests of the people.

He made the remarks while addressing the business community in Manama. The premier had arrived in the country’s capital a day earlier and held delegation-level talks with Bahrain’s leadership at Al Qudaibiya Palace.
In his address, PM Shehbaz said that strategic cooperation had existed between the two countries for decades.
Addressing Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, he said: “Pakistan is ready to enhance economic cooperation with Bahrain in the fields of agriculture, information technology, artificial intelligence, financial technology and all other areas where our two countries can really work together, and create synergy through our efforts and our knowledge and our experience and our commitment to support each other.”
He said ties between Islamabad and Manama were based on cultural, religious, mutual respect and trust. These “are the pillars of our relations”, he added.
He termed his recent meetings with Bahrain’s leadership “extremely productive”.
“I am not a visitor here. I have come here to meet my family members, our Bahraini brothers and sisters,” he said.
“This is what our relationship is all about. Now we have to convert these wonderful relations into economic cooperation,” he added.
The premier highlighted that Pakistan possessed a “great youth bulge”.
“Sixty per cent of our population comprises young boys and girls within the [age] bracket of 15 to 30 years,” he said.
He added that the country was “committed” to converting this challenge into an opportunity by empowering the youth and training them in the fields of information technology and artificial intelligence, along with providing vocational and skills training.
“Together with our Bahraini brothers, entrepreneurs, we will create a great momentum in this field,” he said.
“I think this is the time to really catch up because time and tide wait for none,” PM Shehbaz stressed.
He also talked about the Pakistani community in Bahrain. The premier added that in every country he visited, he interacted with Pakistani communities and listened to the “stories of men and women whose love for Pakistan has never faded, even as they have dedicated their talent, loyalty and hard work to the progress of other nations and cultures”.
“The more I learn of these journeys, the more convinced I become that the Pakistani identity is not bound by geography. It is in the hearts of our people wherever they may be. Here in Bahrain, that spirit is visible beyond any ray of doubt,” he emphasised.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the Pakistanis living in Bahrain for their services to both countries.
“You are great ambassadors of Pakistan, and we are very proud of your contribution to Pakistan’s national economic development,” he said.
“Your hard-earned money, valuable remittances amounting to $484 million in the last financial year, is indeed highly appreciated.”
He also expressed gratitude to the Bahraini leadership for its love, affection, and support for the Pakistani diaspora.
PM Shehbaz added that Islamabad offered scale, talent, resources and a growing consumer market that was “strategically located, connecting to the wider region”.
“Combined with Bahrain’s financial expertise, business acumen and global outlook, the potential is huge and enormous,” he said, adding that Pakistan was undergoing a structural transformation, embodying economic reforms, digital modernisation and a decisive push for a private sector-led growth.
“We have cut red tape forever, strengthened our regulations and opened new sectors such as agri-business, information technology, minerals, energy and tourism for long-term partnership,” he highlighted. He added that Pakistan wanted to work with Bahrain and learn from its experience and expertise.
He further mentioned that the Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement (GCC FTA) had been “nearly finalised and is expected to be signed soon”.
“This will enhance trade between Pakistan and the GCC countries, particularly with Bahrain,” he said. The premier ended his address by encouraging Bahraini investors interested in collaborating with Pakistan to “let this moment be your launching pad for a bold and meaningful collaboration”.
Dar meets Bahrain’s finance minister, discusses economic cooperation
Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who is accompanying the premier on his visit, met Bahrain’s Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa.







In a press release, the Foreign Office said that the two ministers had a “fruitful discussion” that focused on enhancing cooperation in the finance sector.
“Bahrain has made significant progress in fintech and offered to share its expertise with the Pakistani banking sector,” the FO said.
It said that the two ministers discussed avenues of cooperation between the central banks of the two countries.
“The two sides further decided to establish teams of relevant officials to chalk out a roadmap for future collaboration in the fields of finance, banking, commerce and economy,” the FO added.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2713505125c9ded.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957707/imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chatta-object-to-new-court-appointed-lawyer-after-previous-counsels-vanishing-act' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chatta object to new court-appointed lawyer after previous counsel’s vanishing act</strong></a><br><p>Lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, on Thursday objected after the apparent vanishing act of the court-appointed lawyer representing them in the controversial social media posts case and the appointment of a new counsel.
Judge Afzal Majoka, who has been presiding over the case’s proceedings, too, was also seemingly unaware of the finalisation of the appointment of the new counsel when Advocate Taimur Janjua showed up in the Islamabad district and sessions court instead of Advocate Shakeel Jatt.
Advocate Jatt, who attended the case’s hearing as Imaan and Hadi’s court-appointed defence counsel for the first time on Tuesday, had previously refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying that he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
“I am in favour of a fair trial. I cannot ask questions that are dictated [to me]. My conscience does not allow this,” he had said. The counsel had alleged without sharing any specific details that he had “received 15 questions with the instructions that he should ask them during the cross-examination”.
Advocate Jatt had also sought more time from the court to prepare for the case, but Advocate Janjua showed up at the hearing today to represent Imaan and Hadi.
When he informed the court that he had been appointed as the couple’s counsel, Judge Majoka said the court had not yet received a notification in this regard.
A three-member prosecution team present at the hearing assured the court that the relevant notification would be submitted.
For her part, Mazari objected to the change, questioning who had made the new appointment and through what process. She also raised concerns over the “disappearance” of Advocate Jatt.
Mazari contended that she or Chattha had not expressed any lack of confidence in Advocate Jatt and requested the court to record their statements on the matter.
She further raised doubts over an application said to be submitted by Advocate Jatt for his removal as the duo’s lawyer. Moreover, she questioned why the court had not objected to the disclosures made by Advocate Jatt at the previous hearing.
After the court provided a copy of Advocate Jatt’s application to Chattha, the latter requested the judge to summon the lawyer. He also contended the defence had “not rejected” the counsel.
However, the prosecution objected to Chattha’s request, arguing that “while a sessions judge is the appropriate authority to summon a state-appointed counsel, the court hearing the case is not the relevant forum for such an action”.
The proceedings were suspended for a while after Mazari and Chattha requested for time to consult the newly appointed counsel. Judge Majoka accepted their request and granted them time until 1:30pm.
Earlier in the day, the court had suspended the proceedings twice, first until 10 am and later until 11 am, awaiting the appearance of the accused and a clarification about the appointment of a counsel for them.
An order from the office of the Islamabad west district and sessions judge regarding the appointment, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states: “Consequent upon the request made by Mr Muhammad Afzal Majoka, additional sessions judge Islamabad west, for the appointment of a defence counsel at state expenses, for Hadi Ali Chattha and Imaan Zainab Mazari accused […] Muhammad Taimoor Janjua is appointed as the defence counsel on state expenses.”
Mazari and Chattha were indicted in the case on October 30, a day after the latter was arrested outside the courtroom over non-appearance. Mazari said that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Speaking to reporters after his release, Chattha had maintained that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings on October 29, but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”.
Before Tuesday’s hearing, Mazari had also alleged that the court had “forcibly appointed [a] state defence counsel” for her and Chattha.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27103523d94dfb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957697/pti-demands-clarification-from-govt-regarding-rumours-about-imrans-health' target='_blank'><strong>PTI demands clarification from govt regarding ‘rumours’ about Imran’s health</strong></a><br><p>The PTI has demanded a clarification from the government regarding recent “rumours” about the health of jailed party founder Imran Khan, calling on authorities to arrange a meeting between the former premier and his family.
The development comes as Imran’s sisters have in recent weeks been repeatedly denied a meeting with him, leading them to question the whereabouts of the ex-prime minister and stage sit-ins outside the Adiala jail. Further, several social media accounts on X have shared unverified claims of his death, with Indian media also reporting on the alleged rumours about his health. The trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ was also trending on X on Thursday morning.
In a statement issued early on Thursday on X, the party said “rumours of a despicable nature” were being spread from “Afghan and Indian media, and foreign social media accounts” regarding Imran’s health.
The party demanded that the “current government and the interior ministry immediately and clearly dismiss and clarify the rumour and immediately arrange a meeting between Imran and his family”.
“A formal and transparent statement should be issued on behalf of the state regarding the health, security and current status of Imran,” the party demanded.







It further called on the state to investigate those responsible for spreading rumours of a “sensitive nature” and demanded that the “facts be presented before the nation”.
The party, in its statement, warned that “the nation will not tolerate any uncertainty regarding the status of its leader (Imran)”.
“The government is directly responsible for protecting Imran’s security, human rights and constitutional rights,” the party said. The PTI also vowed to take “every legal and political step to counter these rumours and bring the truth to light”.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Meher Bano Qureshi, who is also the daughter of former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said on X that rumours regarding Imran’s health were concerning.
“The government is responsible for Khan sahib’s safety and is duty-bound to issue a statement updating the nation. As far as putting an end to these rumours goes, the best, most credible way possible is to allow Khan sahib’s sisters, lawyers and party members to meet with him,” she said.







‘Afghan origin’ claim debunked
Separately, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MOIB) debunked “false claims by Afghan and Indian social media alleging that Imran had been killed in jail”.
“Anonymous Afghan accounts circulated an unverified rumour that Imran was killed in custody and his body moved. Indian outlets repeated the rumour using two old photos from 2013 and 2022 as ‘fresh evidence’,” the ministry’s official fact-checking cell said on X.
It added that “disinformation originated from two Afghan propaganda handles known for fabrications”.







“Their posts appeared only 46 minutes apart, a clear indication of a coordinated attempt rather than independent reporting. Both accounts falsely claimed a “Pakistani source” confirmed the death but provided no documentation, proof, or institutional verification,” it said.
The account clarified that the photos of Imran used by the accounts, and presented as “fresh evidence”, dated back to 2022 and 2013.
The fact-checking account said that the “first image used to support the rumour is actually from 2013, when Imran fell from a forklift stage during an election rally.”
“Afghan and Indian networks repurposed this 12-year-old image to imply a recent incident inside jail,” it added.
It detailed that “at 12:06pm PKT, Republic TV aired a false claim of ‘PTI supporters storming Adiala Jail”. It added that “within hours”, India’s Republic TV started running the rumour as well, followed by other indian outlets at 3pm — all of whom were “relying on the same two Afghan accounts”.
Tracing the origin of the second picture used by the Afghan-origin accounts, the fact-checking account clarified that the picture was from November 4, 2022, from an assassination attempt on Imran in Wazirabad.
“This photo predates Imran’s imprisonment and has zero connection to jail or custody,” it said.
Elaborating on the Indian media’s role in amplifying the rumour, the account said that “despite PTI representatives telling Indian channels that no such information existed, the rumour was aired repeatedly.”
“No journalist, official, hospital, or government agency confirmed any abnormal development,” it said.
Citing Republic TV as an example, the account said that indian channels continued to run the rumour as a “possible developing story” despite admitting that the rumour was of Afghan origin.
It added that the Indian media also misrepresented the “routine, court-ordered family visitation schedule as ‘suspicious.’
“In reality, jail meetings follow judicial guidelines, not intelligence or law enforcement discretion,” it said.
The account noted that the “timing, coordination, and rapid cross-border amplification suggest a deliberate attempt to create unrest within Pakistan.”
“The rumour was designed to provoke agitation, fuel anti-state narratives, and manufacture a false sense of instability,” it said.
‘Imran has TV, allowed use of exercise machine in jail’
Earlier on Wednesday, Defence Minister and PML-N leader Khawaja Asif had responded to a video on X in which Imran criticised ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif for demanding amenities while in jail.
“He (Imran) himself has a TV in his jail cell … and his food comes from outside,” he claimed.
“There are exercise machines available for him as well,” he added.







Asif, recalling his own time in prison, said, “We used to sleep on the cold floor and eat the food [prepared] at the jail.”
He continued: “It was the month of January, and we had only two blankets, and there was no hot water.”
On the other hand, Imran, he alleged, had “a double bed and velvet bedding”, claiming that the jail superintendent personally tended to him.
Asif called on the PTI founder to “listen to his own speech on the jail’s loudspeaker,” adding that “he (Imran) should fear God.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The party has previously also raised concerns over the health of Imran, who is 73-years-old.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2707371092c1a4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957664/2-national-guard-soldiers-shot-near-white-house-trump-terms-incident-act-of-terror' target='_blank'><strong>2 National Guard soldiers shot near White House; Trump terms incident ‘act of terror’</strong></a><br><p>Two US National Guard soldiers were critically wounded on Wednesday after being shot in a brazen daytime attack a few blocks from the White House, with US President Donald Trump terming the incident an “act of terror”.
The incident, which left two Guard members critically wounded, was “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror,” Trump said.
“It was a crime against our entire nation.”
He confirmed that the man taken into custody after the daylight shooting two blocks from the White House was “a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan”.







The suspect had arrived in the United States in 2021 “on those infamous flights,” Trump said, referring to the evacuations of Afghans fleeing as the Taliban took over the country in the wake of the US retreat after 20 years of war.
“We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan” under former president Joe Biden, Trump said.
“We must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country if they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”







The Department of Homeland Security identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national. According to CNN, the suspect applied for asylum in 2024, which was granted by the Trump administration in April 2025.
Separately, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it had stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely.
“The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a post on X.







Reacting to the incident, former US president Barack Obama said “violence has no place in America”.
“Michelle and I are praying for the servicemembers shot in Washington, DC today, and send our love to their families as they enter this holiday season under the most tragic of circumstances,” he said.







‘Targeted shooting’
Trump was in Florida at the time of the attack, which prompted the White House to go into lockdown as law enforcement from multiple federal and city agencies swarmed the area.
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called it “a targeted shooting” by a single assailant.
“That individual has been taken into custody,” she said.
The shooting occurred around 2:15 pm local time, when the two soldiers — a man and a woman — were conducting what authorities described as a “high-visibility patrol”.
According to DC Police Executive Assistant Chief Jeffrey Carroll, the attacker rounded a corner, raised a firearm, and “ambushed these members of the National Guard” without warning.
Both soldiers were struck multiple times and rushed to local trauma centers, where they remain in critical condition. The suspect was also injured during the encounter.
Carroll said investigators were still working to determine whose gunfire wounded him, but confirmed that there were no additional suspects and no ongoing threat.
Senior counterterrorism officials confirmed to ABC News that the FBI was examining the shooting as a possible act of international terrorism, and investigators were looking into whether the attack may have been inspired by a foreign militant group.
Authorities stressed, however, that no motive had been established.
Trump was the first to announce the incident publicly, writing on social media that “the animal that shot the two National Guardsmen” was also severely wounded and would “pay a very steep price”.
He praised the National Guard and federal law-enforcement agencies as “truly great people”.







Following the shooting, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said the president directed him to deploy an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington “immediately,” saying: “This happened just steps away from the White House. It will not stand.”
A brief security lockdown was also imposed at the White House as the situation unfolded, though Trump was not in the capital at the time.
“The president has been briefed,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
Confusion briefly erupted when West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued — then retracted — a statement saying the two soldiers had died. His office later said the information was based on “early and conflicting reports”.

A relative of Lakanwal’s told NBC News that the suspect had arrived in the US in September 2021, after serving for 10 years in the Afghan army alongside US Special Forces.
According to the relative, Lakanwal spent part of his military service stationed at a base in Kandahar. The relative who spoke to NBC News had also served with him, supporting US troops.
“We were the ones targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,” he said. “I cannot believe that he might have done this,” the relative added.
Lakanwal came to the US five months after Biden announced the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.
Originally from Khost province, Lakanwal had been living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.
The attack also triggered unease within Muslim communities.
“We hope this report is incorrect,” a Muslim political commentator, who declined to be named, told Dawn after initial reports about the nationality of the suspect.
“If it turns out to be true, it may trigger a strong backlash against Muslim communities across the United States.”
National Guard personnel from several Republican-led states, including West Virginia, have been deployed in Washington since August, when Trump expanded an earlier mission aimed at combating street crime and supporting immigration enforcement initiatives.
The soldiers shot on Wednesday were part of that deployment.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271414093f9cc49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957708/bangladesh-ex-pm-sheikh-hasina-gets-21-years-in-jail-for-corruption' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh ex-PM Sheikh Hasina gets 21 years in jail for corruption</strong></a><br><p>A court in Bangladesh sentenced ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday to 21 years in prison for corruption, a week after she was given the death penalty for crimes against humanity.
Hasina, 78, is currently residing in India and has defied court orders that she return to Bangladesh.
She was sentenced in absentia on November 17 to be hanged for crimes against humanity after ordering a deadly crackdown against a student-led uprising last year that eventually ousted her.

 

But three other cases had been brought against the ex-leader by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) over land grabs of lucrative plots in a suburb of the capital Dhaka.
Hasina received seven years’ imprisonment in each of the three cases, Dhaka Tribune reported. Several other accused were also handed varying prison terms, it added.
It is unclear if the sentences will run concurrently.
Hasina’s conduct “demonstrates a persistent corruption mindset rooted in entitlement, unchecked power, and a greedy eye for public property”, ruled judge Abdullah Al Mamun.
“Treating public land as a private asset, she directed her greedy eye toward state resources and manipulated official procedures to benefit herself and her close relatives.”

 

Hasina’s US-based son Sajeeb Wazed and daughter Saima Wazed, who has served as a top United Nations official, were sentenced to five years each.
Hasina fled Bangladesh by helicopter on August 5, 2024, after weeks of student-led protests against her autocratic rule.
Public prosecutor Khan Moinul Hasan said he would appeal the verdict in the corruption cases.
“We are not satisfied with the verdict, as we had sought maximum punishment,” he told AFP.
“We will consult our client, the Anti-Corruption Commission, and decide on the next course of action.”
The three cases involve a total of 47 accused, with 23 individuals named across them, according to Dhaka Tribune.
The first case listed 12 accused, including Hasina; the second listed 17, including Hasina and Sajeeb; and the third listed 18 convicts, including Hasina and her daughter Saima.
Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since the end of Hasina’s rule, and violence has marred campaigning for elections slated for February 2026.
The UN says up to 1,400 people were killed in crackdowns as Hasina tried to cling to power.

 

Hasina has called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”.
She is also being prosecuted in three other corruption cases, along with her sister Sheikh Rehana and her children, including British MP Tulip Siddiq.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635871-fia-clarifies-only-passengers-with-incomplete-documents-being-stopped' target='_blank'><strong>FIA clarifies only passengers with incomplete documents being stopped</strong></a><br><p>

Almost a full day after the fire began, firefighters were struggling to reach residents potentially trapped on the upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex due to intense heat and thick smoke from the blaze that erupted on Wednesday afternoon.
The tightly packed complex in the northern Tai Po district has 2,000 apartments in eight blocks that are home to more than 4,600 people in a city struggling with chronic shortages of affordable housing.
“We bought [a place] in this building more than 20 years ago. All of our belongings were in this building, and now that it has all burned like this, what’s left?” asked a 51-year-old resident with the surname Wan.
“There’s nothing left. What are we supposed to do?”



A firefighter was among the 55 killed, with dozens in hospital in critical condition, Hong Kong authorities said on Thursday afternoon. Around 279 people remain uncontactable.
Among the dead was a 37-year-old firefighter, who was found with burns on his face half an hour after losing contact with colleagues, according to the fire service director Andy Yeung.
A government spokesman told AFP that 56 people were being treated in hospital. Sixteen were in a critical condition, 24 in a serious condition and 16 were stable.
Eileen Chung, a Hong Kong police superintendent, said 900 residents were spread across eight shelters.
The fire was still burning on Thursday afternoon, more than 24 hours after it started.
Sections of charred scaffolding fell from the burning blocks, and flames could be seen inside apartments, sometimes belching out through windows into the night sky, casting an eerie orange glow on surrounding buildings. An AFP reporter heard loud cracking sounds, possibly from the burning bamboo.

A 65-year-old resident surnamed Yuen said he had lived in the complex for more than four decades and that many of his neighbours were elderly and might not be mobile.
“The windows were closed because of the maintenance, [some people] didn’t know there was a fire and had to be told to evacuate via phone calls by neighbours,” Yuen told AFP. “I’m devastated.”
A woman surnamed Ng, 52, was distraught as she searched for her daughter outside a shelter. “She and her father are still not out yet. They didn’t have water to save our building,” she sobbed, carrying her daughter’s graduation photo.
Authorities said they had brought the blaze in four of seven blocks under control, with operations continuing in three. Bamboo scaffolding is a mainstay of traditional Chinese architecture but has been subject to a phase-out in Hong Kong since March for safety reasons.
Three arrested
Police officers searched the housing estate’s building maintenance company on Thursday morning, seizing documents that mention Wang Fuk Court, local media reported. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“We have reason to believe that the company’s responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,” said police superintendent Chung.
Three men from the construction company, two directors and one engineering consultant, had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the fire, she added.
Police said in addition to the buildings being covered with protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not meet fire standards, they discovered some windows on one unaffected building were sealed with a foam material, installed by a construction company carrying out year-long maintenance work.







Indonesia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday that two Indonesian migrant workers “in the domestic sector” died in the fire and two others were injured.
The death toll is now the highest in a Hong Kong fire since 1948, when 176 people were killed in a warehouse blaze. Hong Kong’s corruption body said it has launched an investigation into suspected corruption related to the renovation.
China’s Xi urges ‘all-out’ effort against fire
From the mainland, China’s President Xi Jinping urged an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, China’s state broadcaster CCTV said.
Xi expressed condolences to the victims, including “the firefighter who died in the line of duty”, according to state media.







Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened at the tragic loss of lives and property.
“Our heartfelt condolences go out to President Xi Jinping and the Chinese nation, particularly the people of Hong Kong on this tragic incident,” he said.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families, and we wish a speedy recovery to all those injured,” he said.
“Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and government of China, especially the Hong Kong SAR (special administrative region), during this difficult time. May the affected families find strength and healing. Pakistan and China will always stand together,” he said.







Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also said he was deeply saddened to learn about the “devastating fire”.
“On behalf of the government and people of Pakistan, I extend our deepest condolences and profound sympathy to you, the Hong Kong special administrative region government, and especially to the families of the victims. Our thoughts are with those who have lost their loved ones, and we pray for the swift and complete recovery of the injured,” he said.







Searching for relatives
Harry Cheung, aged 66, who has lived at Block Two in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise at about 2:45pm (11:45am PKT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block.
“I immediately went back to pack up my things,” he said. “I don’t even know how I feel right now. I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight.”

Another long-time resident, a woman surnamed Chu, said she still had not been able to contact her friends who live in the next block. After staying over at a friend’s place on Wednesday night, the 70-year-old came back to see her home still burning.
“We don’t know what to do,” she said.
An online app showed missing persons reports submitted through a linked Google document that detailed residents of individual towers and rooms.
It includes descriptions like “Mother-in-law in her 70s, missing”, or “one boy and one girl”, or “Rooftop: 33-year-old male.” One description simply says “27th floor, room 1: He is dead”.
Reuters could not independently verify the information on the app.
The fire has prompted comparisons to the Grenfell Tower inferno that killed 72 people in London in 2017. That fire was blamed on firms fitting the exterior with flammable cladding, as well as failings by the government and the construction industry.
“Our hearts go out to all those affected by the horrific fire in Hong Kong,” the Grenfell United survivors’ group said on social media. “To the families, friends and communities, we stand with you. You are not alone.”







A Tai Po resident surnamed So, 57, said the fire was “heartbreaking”.
“There’s nothing that can be done about the property. We can only hope that everyone, no matter old or young, can return safely,” So told AFP.
An apartment owner in his 40s who did not want to give his name told AFP that the government needed to help those made homeless by the blaze.
“The fire is not yet under control and I dare not leave, and I don’t know what I can do,” he said.
Residents were seen being evacuated via large coaches, with local media reporting that adjacent blocks were also being cleared. Sections of a nearby highway were also closed by the firefighting operation.
Hong Kong’s sky-high property prices have long been a trigger for social discontent in the city and the fire tragedy could further stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December.

Deadly fires were once a regular scourge in Hong Kong, especially in poorer neighbourhoods. However, safety measures have been ramped up in recent decades and such fires have become much less commonplace.
Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with some 300,000 residents.
Occupied since 1983, the complex is under the government’s subsidised home ownership scheme, according to property agency websites. According to online posts, it has been undergoing renovations for a year at a cost of HK$330 million ($42.43m), with each unit paying between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000.</p><small>2025-11-27 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27124752363041a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957703/india-approves-800m-plan-to-boost-rare-earth-magnet-production' target='_blank'><strong>India approves $800m plan to boost rare earth magnet production</strong></a><br><p>India has approved a more than $800 million plan to boost production of rare earth magnets in an effort to secure supplies and cut its dependence on imports from countries like China.
Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs), some of the strongest types of permanent magnets, made from alloys of rare earth elements, are used in many critical sectors, including electric vehicles, aerospace and renewable energy.
New Delhi currently meets its demand primarily through imports, with the government estimating that the country’s needs could double by 2030.
India’s cabinet approved on Tuesday a $815.3m scheme to promote the production of REPMs, which the government said will help secure the “supply chain for domestic industries”.
The plan involves offering sales-linked incentives and subsidies to help establish a manufacturing capacity of around 6,000 metric tons per year.
“This first-of-its-kind initiative aims to establish 6,000 MTPA (metric tons per annum) of integrated REPM manufacturing in India, thereby enhancing self-reliance and positioning India as a key player in the global REPM market,” the government said in a statement.
Local industry groups welcomed the move, with the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) saying it will provide long-term resilience to the automotive supply chain.
It will encourage investments in advanced materials and give India a strong position in global value chains for EVs and clean energy, Vikrampati Singhania, ACMA president, said in a statement.
“This is a strategic and forward-looking intervention that addresses one of the most critical gaps in the EV and advanced mobility ecosystem,” he said.
While India sources rare earth magnets from multiple countries, China’s export curbs earlier this year raised alarm among some Indian firms.</p><small>2025-11-27 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635860-ecp-notifies-by-poll-winners-withholds-na-96-over-code-breach' target='_blank'><strong>ECP notifies by-poll winners, withholds NA-96 result over 'code breach'</strong></a><br><p>

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”.
“All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.
However, the FIA officer noted that a lot of people were those “who get deceived by various human smugglers in some way”.
Zia detailed that FIA immigration officials at airports check the travel documents of “all those people and profile them”, asserting that no one going abroad for a valid purpose was being stopped.
“All those who are denied from going abroad are refused due to them not having valid documents, or if they have permits or visas wherein the companies stated do not exist, and we have suspicions that human smugglers are trapping them and taking them abroad.’’



“We have seen cases where people get deceived by these human smugglers and change their routes mid-transit, or take an accomplice with them in the form of their mother or sister, through which they can exit here with the [safeguard] of an Umrah [visa],” Zia said.
He added there had been past cases where such people were deported from other countries, following which the FIA’s Anti-Human Trafficking Cell registers a case, conducts an inquiry and “such human traffickers are brought to a halt”.
He urged the public not to be fooled by migrant smugglers. The FIA officer said those networks were negatively portraying the matter to “create unrest” and secure financial gains for themselves.
He recalled the Mauritania and Greece boat capsize incidents, saying that innocent people were shown “dreams of Europe” and smuggled out of Pakistan via dunki (illegal land routes) or by transiting in other countries, only to be pressured into handing over exorbitant amounts of cash or even losing their lives.

 

“Not only does Pakistan’s name on an international level get maligned and the value of our green passport declines, but many countries have also created difficulties for us in obtaining visas,” the FIA Lahore director said.
Zia assured the public that immigration staff would facilitate all those who were travelling abroad for legitimate reasons with valid documents.
The FIA’s Facebook post said “such fabricated content aims to misguide the public and undermine institutional credibility”, and urged citizens to rely only on verified information from official FIA platforms.
Earlier this week, BBC Urdu reported that it spoke to some of the offloaded individuals, including a 25-year-old man from Hyderabad who had obtained a work visa for Saudi Arabia.
Another person, aged 35, who hailed from Punjab’s Sargodha, was stopped from travelling to Saudi Arabia from Karachi, and later also barred from travelling to Dubai from Lahore for work.
A resident of Punjab’s Jhang told BBC Urdu he was offloaded from Karachi as officials questioned why he was using that airport instead of the nearby one in Lahore, the reason for which he said was a cheaper ticket.
Earlier this week, it emerged that a number of genuine businessmen and tourists lodged a strong protest against the “harsh policy” to offload even those going for business trips or tourism.
Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters.
He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports.
When asked about the reasons of offloading, FIA Gujranwala Zone Director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.</p><small>2025-11-27 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635864-sanaullah-hints-at-accountability-of-those-who-harmed-country-in-past' target='_blank'><strong>Rana Sanaullah hints at accountability of those who 'harmed country in past'</strong></a><br><p>

The statement, issued late last night, said terrorists carried out a “cowardly attack on the Qazi Talab checkpost in the dark of the night”.
Responding to the attack, Hangu District Police Officer (DPO) Khan Zeb Mohmand led the operation against the terrorists, the statement said.
It added that while the operation was underway, police personnel “surrounded the area and stood firm against the enemy like a wall of lead”.
“Eventually, police foiled the attack,” the statement added. However, three policemen, Head Constable Wahid Shah, Head Constable Hikmat Khan and Abdul Samad, were martyred during the operation.
The CTD statement detailed that “intense fighting” had continued between police and the terrorists for two hours, and there were reports of several deaths among the terrorists.
“The terrorists took advantage of the darkness of the night and the rocky mountainous terrain and fled, taking their dead and wounded with them. However, the body of an armed terrorist was recovered during the search and strike operation,” the statement said.
Condemnations pour in
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi strongly condemned the attack, a statement issued by his office said, adding that the provincial chief executive had also issued instructions to “immediately send additional personnel” to the site of the incident.
“Terrorists have no religion. Cowardly attacks cannot demoralise us,” the statement quoted Afridi as saying. He further said that the terrorists would be brought to justice and the sacrifices of the martyrs “will not go in vain”.
He sought an immediate report on the incident from the KP police inspector general and also called for the immediate provision of medical treatment to those injured in the attack, the CM Office’s statement said.
“The fight against terrorism will continue with an even stronger resolve,” the statement further quoted the CM as saying, adding that he also prayed for the martyred personnel and their families.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred personnel.
A statement on the interior ministry’s X account said that Naqvi extended condolences to the bereaved families. “Sacrifice of the martyred personnel will not go in vain,” he was quoted as saying.
“These sacrifices are a testament to Pakistan’s unwavering resolve in the fight against terrorism,” Naqvi said, adding that KP police were on the front lines of this fight.







Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TPP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last night’s attack comes roughly three weeks after an improvised explosive device struck a police convoy conducting search operations near a cemetery in the Doaba area of Hangu. Three police officers, including a station house officer, were injured in the November 2 attack.
In a similar incident on October 24, three cops, including a superintendent of police, were martyred when back-to-back blasts rocked Hangu. According to the police, the TTP was behind the blasts.</p><small>2025-11-27 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635848-justice-najafi-links-noor-mukadam-case-to-rising-live-in-relationships' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Najafi links Noor Mukadam case to 'rising live-in relationships'</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan’s population now exceeds 241 million, growing at a rate still above 2 per cent per year, creating an ongoing mismatch between the pace of population expansion and the country’s ability to provide jobs, services, and infrastructure.
While total economic output (termed Gross National Product) has increased over time, rapid population growth continually erodes per capita gains, leaving people trapped in low-income cycles and limiting the state’s fiscal space to invest in development.
The demographic structure, with a noticeable decline in youth dependency from around 90 in 1990 to 70 in 2018-19, offers a potential demographic dividend. Yet, Pakistan has to struggle to translate this into economic productivity.
Millions of young people enter the labour market each year, but employment creation remains insufficient, resulting in high unemployment, underemployment, and a labour force dominated by low-skilled, informal work.
According to the Labour Force Survey 2020-21, 16 per cent of graduates remain unemployed, with a larger proportion of women.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Such high unemployment among university graduates, particularly women, highlights a dual dilemma—an economy too weak to generate high-skilled jobs, and labour markets still shaped by gender discrimination that restricts women’s entry even where skills exist.
Despite women making up nearly half the population, female labour force participation in Pakistan remains among the lowest in the world, hovering around 22-24 per cent.
High fertility, limited mobility, low education levels, and weak workplace protections all contribute to keeping women out of productive employment.
When women withdraw from the labour market due to childbearing or household responsibilities, the economy loses substantial human capital. This reduces household income, lowers national productivity, and further tightens the resource constraints that large families face.
The opportunity cost of excluding women from the labour market is enormous; no country has achieved sustained economic growth without fully integrating women into its workforce.
Even more troubling is the fact that 37pc of Pakistani youth, aged between 15 to 24 years, are neither employed nor participating in education or training (NEET), reflecting a significant loss of potential talent.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The pressure on households is equally intense. Large family sizes create resource dilution within the family, where parental time, income, nutrition, and attention are spread thinly across many children. As a result, each child receives fewer resources, weakening educational attainment, cognitive development, and health outcomes.
This dilution is visible in Pakistan’s alarming levels of child malnutrition, where more than 40pc of children under the age of five are stunted and around 17pc are wasted, contributing to statistics which are some of the highest rates in South Asia.
Stunting represents irreversible cognitive and physical harm, significantly reducing future productivity and earnings potential. A population with such compromised human capital cannot sustain long-term economic growth. Moreover, when children enter the labour force early, often due to economic pressures, Pakistan loses another generation of potential skilled workers, perpetuating poverty and limiting economic innovation.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

 The pressure of rapid population growth is visible not only in labour markets but across all public systems. Fiscal resources are stretched thin as the state attempts to provide schools, hospitals, roads, and energy to a growing population.
Per capita public expenditure on health and education remains extremely low. With more children competing for limited school spaces, learning outcomes suffer.
Pakistan already faces one of the world’s highest numbers of out-of-school children, over 23 million.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Similarly, health systems struggle with overcrowded facilities, inadequate immunisation coverage, and poor maternal health outcomes.
Environmental stress amplifies these challenges. Pakistan is among the top ten countries most vulnerable to climate change. Rapid population growth increases demand for water, food, and land at a time when climate shocks such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves are intensifying.
Water scarcity is becoming a structural threat as per capita water availability falls below international scarcity thresholds. Agricultural land is under growing pressure, and climate-induced crop failures threaten both livelihoods and food security.
 
 

Housing is another dimension where population pressures are acute. Pakistan faces a housing deficit estimated between 4.3 and 10m units—an estimate that varies across researchers but consistently signals a severe and widening gap.
Rapid urbanisation, driven by rising populations in both rural and urban areas, has led to overcrowded cities where informal settlements expand faster than planned infrastructure. Urban services, such as water, sanitation, transport, and energy, are unable to keep pace with demand. High population density without adequate planning leads to congestion, rising rents, slum proliferation, and environmental stress.
Without addressing housing needs, Pakistan will not be able to build healthy, productive urban centres capable of supporting economic transformation.
Provincial disparities further complicate the population–economy dynamic. According to the World Bank report 2025, Punjab has the lowest poverty rate at around 16.3pc. Yet, because of its sheer population size, it still contains about 40pc of all people living in poverty in Pakistan.
Three Punjab districts—Muzaffargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, and Dera Ghazi Khan—each have more than one million poor individuals. Sindh’s poverty rate stands at 24.1pc, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s at about 29.5pc, while Balochistan contains seven of the country’s ten poorest districts.
These patterns show that high population density and limited resource management can produce pockets of extreme poverty even within more developed provinces. 

Pakistan’s fertility story is also unique within South Asia. While neighbouring countries have achieved replacement-level fertility, Pakistan’s decline stalled after an initial drop from 6.2 children per woman in the 1980s to 4.8 by 2000.

Despite strong community outreach programmes, such as the Lady Health Workers initiative and social marketing campaigns, fertility remained high, at around 3.6 births per woman in 2018.
This stagnation is surprising because surveys consistently show that men and women desire fewer children than they actually have. The fertility-related health needs remain especially high in poorer regions, where unmet demand for family planning is widespread.

Persistent governance failures, stock-outs of contraceptives, and limited-service delivery have contributed to weak program implementation.
After the 2017 Census showed a 2.4pc annual population growth rate, the Supreme Court intervened, leading to the Council of Common Interests adopting the National Action Plan on Population in 2018.
The plan aims to reduce fertility to 2.8 by 2025 and 2.1 by 2030, with corresponding population growth declines to 1.5pc and then 1.2pc. These targets are achievable if Pakistan strengthens family planning, expands women’s education, improves service delivery, and prioritises demographic management at both federal and provincial levels.
Without these efforts, population growth will continue to dilute economic gains, weaken human capital, strain public finances, and limit the country’s ability to shift toward a stable, resilient, and productive future.

The organisation also rejected concerns linking “these changes” with harmful algal blooms or eutrophication.
“We believe that the green discolouration of the ocean is caused by large, naturally occurring, non-toxic bloom of Noctiluca scintillans, a small, free-floating organism that may appear in red, orange, green, or even colourless forms.
“Along Pakistan’s coast, blooms are most often green or orange and can spread extensively depending on seasonal conditions. Although the organism itself is not green, the colour comes from its internal symbiont, Protoeuglena noctilucae, which enables it to photosynthesise and grow rapidly.
“Because Noctiluca is naturally bioluminescent, its presence creates the glittering glow reported at night,” it stated. Similar seasonal blooms had been documented across the coasts of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan and western India.

“After the peaceful protest outside the Islamabad High Court until 1pm, lawmakers will march on Adiala Jail [in Rawalpindi] along with Mr Imran’s sisters and sit outside the jail,” Mr Afridi told PTI workers during a ceremony held here to “pay tribute to the PTI workers martyred on Nov 26, 2024” in the provincial capital.
He requested PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja to ensure the presence of all party members of the national and provincial assemblies and the Senate outside the high court on Tuesdays.
The chief minister also urged party workers to “ensure their elected representatives are present at the protest.”
“Wherever you [workers] are, make sure all your respective MNAs and MPAs are present at the peaceful protest. We’ll shame absent lawmakers afterward,” he said.
The chief minister said that those, who won elections in the name of the incarcerated prime minister Imran Khan to become parliamentarians, would protest to ensure justice is dispensed to the leader facing torture in the jail.
He said the party’s peaceful movement for the release of Mr Imran would continue and he himself would visit Adiala Jail on every Thursday until he met the detained leader.
Mr Afridi announced that a political gathering would be held in the provincial capital on December 7.
He said that Nov 26 was a painful day for PTI as its peaceful workers were fired at, martyred and wounded at D-Chowk in Islamabad.
The chief minister also complained that the police fired at and killed TLP workers in Punjab’s Muridke town.
“It’s a message for the entire country as powers-that-be want nobody to raise voice for rights. They do not want the supremacy of the Constitution, restoration of an independent judiciary and media,” he said.
Mr Afridi claimed that the PTI chief was illegally behind bars for over 850 days, just for the sake of the people’s rights.
He said that Mr Imran was waiting for people to do justice with him.
“The courts were paralysed through the 26th Constitutional Amendment and the rest was done in the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Now, the 28th Constitutional Amendment is in the works and it will be followed by the 29th Constitutional Amendment,” he said.
The chief minister said the PTI would continue the struggle for the release of its jailed activists and the people’s rights as allowed by the law and the Constitution. He said certain quarters wanted PTI to break the law for a crackdown, but that won’t happen.
Mr Afridi said that PTI protesters remained peaceful on May 9 and Nov 26 and would remain peaceful in the future as well but would never compromise on rights.
He said that party workers offered sacrifices, which wouldn’t go to waste.

THE presidency announced that a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels and halt deforestation would be presented at COP31.—AFP/file

• No mention of fossil fuel phase-out in final text• Vague promises for adaptation fund prompt call for reform• Multilateral process ‘being held hostage’, critics warn
THE script played out at COP30 in Belem was no different from that of previous climate conferences — some delegates left the venue with mixed feelings, while others were outright disappointed.
The conference, held in the Bra­z­i­l­ian city on the edge of the Amazon, overran its schedule and ended on Saturday, a day after its planned close.
One of the outcomes at this so-called implementation COP was a cause for celebration, particularly the just transition mechanism “to enhance international coo­­peration, technical assistance, capacity-building and knowledge-sharing, and enable equitable, inclusive just transitions”.

 

This agreement, widely celebrated by civil society as a “historic victory for people power”, came after days of protests and intense negotiations.
“This outcome didn’t fall from the sky; it was carved out through struggle, persistence and the moral clarity of those living on the frontlines of climate breakdown,” said Tasneem Essop, executive director at the Climate Action Network International.
“Governments must now honour this Just Transition mechanism with real action. Anything less is a betrayal of people, and of the Paris (agreement) promise,” she said.
However, adaptation finance for vulnerable communities left much to be desired. The conference was supposed to reach an agreement to triple adaptation finance to $120 billion by 2030.
However, the ‘mutirao’ decision — a Portuguese term for “collective efforts” — calls for efforts to “at least triple adaptation finance by 2035” without setting a baseline target, a move that does not match the level of ambition demanded by the developing countries and the civil society groups.
“The refusal to commit to scaling up finance to the necessary $300 billion annually for adaptation leaves the unprepared defenceless against inevitable ruin,” said Harjeet Singh, strategic adviser at the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative.
“By failing on their past commitment to double adaptation finance (to $40 billion) by 2025 and keeping the baseline of the new target vague, developed nations have attempted to diluted their responsibility, forcing the world’s most vulnerable to face the rising waters with empty hands,” he said.
Fossil fuel phase-out
The worst outcome was the fossil fuel phase-out, which did not even get a mention in the COP agreement despite robust support from more than 80 countries.
Instead, the COP presidency announced that a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels and halt deforestation would be presented at the next climate conference, ie COP31. The roadmap will be guided by a conference in Santa Marta in April to be co-hosted by Colombia and the Netherlands, according to Carbon Brief.
COP31 will be held in Turkiye, with Australia as its president.
According to CAN International, the decision to ignore the harmful impacts of fossil fuels was deeply disappointing. “Given that oil, coal and gas remain the root cause of climate breakdown, this omission represents a severe failure for COP30,” it said in a statement.
Tracy Carty of Greenpeace International said the negotiations were derailed by inadequate climate finance, weak leadership from G20 nations, particularly the developed ones, and the heavy hand of fossil fuel interests.
Like fossil fuels, the finance outcome was also dismal. In the absence of the US and the European Union’s focus on defence, it seems the responsibility for saving the planet has fallen to China and the developing world, said Dr Abid Suleri of the Islamabad-based Sustainable Devel­opment Policy Institute, about the reluctance of rich nations to pay for loss and damage.
Calls for reform
The presence of fossil fuel lobbyists and a dilute outcome also brought the wider UNFCCC process under scrutiny. Still, some hailed the mutirao text as a win for multilateralism.
“COP30 has proven that the current consensus model has become a veto for vandals. We are trying to put out a planetary fire, but the UN rules allow the arsonists — the petrostates and their 1,600 lobbyists — to stand in the doorway and block the fire trucks,” Mr Singh told Dawn.
He said the ‘consensus’ becomes a synonym for capitulation if a handful of countries, like Saudi Arabia and Russia, can simply erase the mention of the fossil fuel phase-out from the final text. “The multilateral process is alive, but it is being held hostage,” he added.
Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Centre for International Env­i­r­onmental Law, also called for reforms in the UN process. “Petrostates and industry lobbyists use the consensus rule to block action and ambition. We now need to reform the UNFCCC so the global majority can act, starting with conflict of interest rules and allowing majority voting,” she said.
Dr Suleri agreed. He said the “polarised” conference ended in a compromise despite tall claims at the outset. “President Lula called COP30 the COP of truth; the truth, however, is hard to ignore. This COP still lacks both the money and the ambition needed to match the promises made at the start,” he added.
The conference also launched the Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change, which establishes shared international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote accurate, evidence-based information on climate issues.
This initiative aims to mobilise resources to fund research projects and investigative journalism ideas that can produce evidence in a coordinated manner, offering more inputs for better climate policies, said the Unesco Division for Digital Inclusion and Policies and Digital Transformation Director Guil­herme Canela in an email to Dawn.

It took courage for IAF Wing Commander Namansh Syal to die with his plane, when his Tejas Light Combat Aircraft malfunctioned on Nov 21 during the Dubai Air Show 2025. (The Sanskrit word ‘tejas’ is used in the Devi Mahatmya and refers to “the divine, fiery energy or brilliance of the gods that coalesced to form the goddess Durga”.)
It took courage of a special sort for a retired PAF air commodore (Pervez Akhtar Khan) to pay a tribute to his comrade in wings Namansh Syal. His requiem will never be as famous as other tributes like, for example, Abraham Lincoln’s immortal Gettysburg address of November 1863. It is twice as long as Lincoln’s succinct 271 words, but it deserves a wide audience, for writers in the armed forces are a rare breed. Warrior poets who can distil their emotions into words are even rarer.

 

In the first year of the 1914-18 war, the young poet Rupert Brooke wrote The Soldier, for which he has remained famous. He died the following year, not in combat but unpoetically, of septicemia (blood poisoning) from a mosquito bite.

Aviation history is replete with loss and poetry.

His contemporary T.E. Lawrence (of Arabia) opened his memoir Seven Pillars of Wisdom: A Triumph (1926) with these lyrical words:“So I drew these tides of men into my hands/ and wrote my will across the sky in stars.”
Another poet of their time — the Irishman W.B. Yeats — took a more prosaic view of war: “I think it better that in times like these/ We poets keep our mouths shut, for in truth/ We have no gift to set a statesman right.”
Two notable British author/ warriors of World War II were Lt-Col Airey Neave and Wing Commander Douglas Bader. Neave succeeded in escaping from the impenetrable Colditz Castle and recounted his feat in his book They Have Their Exits (1953). Douglas Bader, despite having lost the lower part of both his legs, flew in the RAF until he crashed over France in 1941 and was imprisoned by the Germans, also in Colditz Castle. His story — Reach for the Sky (1954) — became a best-seller.
Here, in Pakistan, senior officers have inflicted their memoirs on a credulous readership. Most of these recollections are self-serving. Exceptions are those by lower ranking officers such as Col (later brigadier) Siddique Salik. A student of English literature before he joined the army, Salik wrote with moving candour of his incarceration as a prisoner of war in India after the 1971 war. His books include Witness to Surrender (1977) and in 1984, The Wounded Pride: Reminiscences of a Pakistani Prisoner of War in India (1971-73). He died with his commander-in-chief Gen Ziaul Haq in the Bahawalpur air crash in 1988.
More of us should remember the late Sq Ldr Sayed Sajjad ‘Nosey’ Haider — one of our ace fighter pilots, honoured for his “exceptional leadership, courage and flying skill” when, in 1965, he destroyed “four enemy aircraft, 11 enemy tanks and damaged three tanks”. His distinguished career came to an abrupt end when he told Gen Ziaul Haq some unwelcome truths about the perils of dictatorship. Haider’s candid memoir Flight of the Falcon (2009) deserves better recognition.
And the most recent achievement of his PAF was demonstrated during the aerial skirmish in May this year, when a number of Indian aircraft (Don­ald Trump swears se­­ven) were downed by Pakistani pilots.
Air Commodore Per­vez Khan’s tribute shou­­ld be viewed against this backdrop. “Coura­­ge,” Khan writes, “ne­eds no passport”. He lauds the daring of such pilots: “These are not performances for cameras [at air shows]; they are testimonies of human mastery, flown by souls who accept the unforgiving contract between gravity and grace… .”
He continues: “The sky demands everything and promises nothing. At the moment an aircraft goes quiet, there are no nationalities, no anthems, no flags. There is only the terrible democracy of loss, and families left clutching photographs of men who once touched clouds.” And finally, he reminds us that we are “all of us trying to touch something infinite before gravity reclaims us”.
Lord Tennyson defined the fatal union of obedience and patriotism in these lines, familiar to every schoolboy: “Theirs not to reason why, Theirs but to do and die.” Rupert Brooke, in his less well-known poem Second Best (c. 1908) echoed the same call: “Go to greet/ Death as a friend.”
That friendship ends only when eternity ends.

The new policy is being taken as a major blow to the efforts of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to provide the aspiring young women, particularly those having underprivileged background, access to free nursing education.

 

The critics hold Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique and Health Secretary Azmat Mahmood responsible for the flawed policy as they had formulated the recommendations with regard to it and sent the same to the chief minister for her final approval.
The experts say that Ms Nawaz has been kept in dark about the policy’s financial fallout for, mostly, poor parents of aspiring nurses, who will have to bear the brunt of these controversial changes.

Policy change adds to the financial burden of their families

The experts also see it as a gradual and systematic shift by the health authorities towards privatising the nursing education, which, they apprehend, could have long-term drastic consequences for the public healthcare sector that was already facing an acute shortage of qualified and experienced nurses across the province.
They fear that the new policy may also leave an adverse impact on the patient care at the massively-burdened state-run hospitals of Punjab.
According to the newly-introduced policy, the University of Health Sciences (UHS) Lahore has been notified as admission authority for Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN Generic – the four-year degree programme. The admissions will be offered on 3,100 seats (in the morning batch) across 45 public nursing colleges in Punjab.
Similarly, the Punjab government has added 1,400 new seats for the evening programmes in 15 public sector nursing colleges. Of these 1,400 seats, 100 have been allocated to each government nursing college. These included College of Nursing Mayo Hospital/King Edward Medical University, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital/Fatima Jinnah Medical University, Jinnah Hospital/Allama Iqbal Medical College, Lahore General Hospital/Ameerud Din Medical College, Allied Hospital, Faisalabad, Nishtar Hospital, Multan, DHQ Hospital, Dera Ghazi Khan, etc.
Under the changes to the policy, free hostel facility in the government nursing colleges have been withdrawn, allowing these institutions to charge annual fees, on par with the private institutions.
“There shall be no stipend for the students enrolled for BSN Generic programme, in both the morning and evening batches,” reads the notified policy.
A senior official says that with these changes to the policy, nursing education has become very expensive in Punjab, apprehending it may aggravate the shortage of the trained health professionals in the cadre.
He says the female nursing students, mostly coming from rural or urban low- and middle-income families, will have to either pay the hefty hostel fees or opt for costly private lodging far away from their hometowns, risking their own safety.
He says that previously, through subsidised nursing education, even girls from financially-challenged families had an opportunity to seek a bright future in the nursing profession.
Withdrawing of financial support by the government has caused resentment among the students, as well as their parents.
On the other hand, the policy also elaborates the eligibility, scoring criteria and application process for admissions to nursing colleges.

“One of the children stepped on the landmine, resulting in a powerful blast. Three children died on the spot,” senior police officer Jan Muhammad Khosa told Dawn, adding that three others, including two boys and a young girl, were seriously injured.
Security forces and police reached the site soon after the incident and shifted the bodies and the injured to the district hospital.
The deceased were identified as Nadeem Ahmed, Soma Khan and a teenage girl, Bakhtawar Bibi. Police said an investigation was under way to determine how the landmine was planted inside the house.

“We have now completely restricted passenger vehicles, motorists and tourists from travelling to neighbouring GB for their safety,” Assistant Commissioner Balakot Hasrat Khan told reporters on Wednesday. He said the decision to impose a travel ban between KP and GB was taken in a meeting attended by the heads of all relevant departments.
The AC said that the Chilas (GB) district administration and police were in contact with Mansehra’s administration, and they too had imposed a ban on travel along Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad road. “
We have decided to allow tourists to travel only up to Battakundi and Saiful Muluk between 11am and 3pm, and only with chained tyres, as vehicles cannot move safely on icy roads before or after the four-hour period,” Mr Khan said.
He clarified that no restrictions had been placed on travel up to Naran until the next spell of snowfall. The official said most of the indigenous community settled in Barawai, Battakundi, and other areas beyond Naran had already migrated, while the remaining people were expected to leave within a week or after the second snowfall in Kaghan valley.
He stated that police posts in the upper reaches of the valley had also been closed for the winter. “We expect the Kaghan–Babusar Top section of the MNJ road to reopen in early May next year, and until then the valley will remain completely closed to movement,” he said.

During the hearing, Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra noted that despite multiple summons, Omar Ayub failed to appear before the court, prompting the judge to invoke proclamation proceedings.
The court also sought complete details of his movable and immovable properties and issued directions to block his passport and Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC).
The case concerns a PTI demonstration held last year, for which Mr Ayub and other senior party figures have been nominated under anti-terrorism charges.

Defence, prosecution clash after Aleema Khan briefly detained for attempting to leave courtroom

Earlier this year, prosecutors submitted a challan formally naming several top PTI leaders, accusing them of inciting violence and causing disruption during the protest.
The court adjourned further hearings while ordering officials to complete the requirements associated with the proclamation process.
Aleema briefly in custody
Separately in Rawalpindi, proceedings in a different protest-related case took an unexpected turn when Aleema Khan, sister of former prime minister Imran Khan, was briefly detained by women police officers inside an Anti-Terrorism Court.
Aleema, one of 11 charged with arson and obstructing government operations during a protest on 26 November last year, appeared before ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah.
At the outset of the hearing, the court was informed that lawyers would be arguing on an application filed by an accused named Safai regarding the jurisdiction of the ATC over the matter. The court noted that 11 accused, including Aleema Khan, had already been indicted in the case.
Prosecutor Zaheer Shah informed the court that the accused were facing charges under terrorism-related laws due to allegations of arson and encirclement during last year’s protest.
During the hearing, Aleema Khan attempted to exit the courtroom. “Our lawyers are busy in the Supreme Court, we should be allowed to go,” she said.
Women police officers, however, intercepted her and brought her back inside. Prosecutor Zaheer Shah insisted that the accused was “in judicial custody under Section 351” and therefore could not leave without the judge’s explicit permission.
Defence lawyer Faisal Malik strongly objected, arguing that Aleema Khan had voluntarily surrendered before the court and that there was “no order to take her into custody”. He termed the police action “unacceptable” and urged the court to initiate proceedings against the officers involved.
The judge, responding to the defence protests, remarked, “If you had come on time, this might not have happened”.
The courtroom witnessed heated exchanges as the prosecution maintained that the accused and her lawyers were creating hurdles in the trial.
Prosecutor Zaheer Shah added that eight police witnesses were present in court despite their official duties and that unnecessary delays were obstructing proceedings.
Following arguments, the court allowed Aleema Khan to proceed with filing her bail bonds. Additionally, the court ordered the accused to pay Rs 10,000 each to the eight police witnesses, citing the inconvenience caused by repeated adjournment requests.
During the proceedings, defence lawyers also requested that the court direct authorities to unfreeze the bank accounts of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust and Namal University, Mianwali.
The prosecutor, Zaheer Shah, responded sharply. “We regret that Shaukat Khanum’s account had to be frozen due to the irresponsible behaviour of the accused,” he said.
In a brief interaction with the judge, Aleema Khan said she had faith in the court and believed justice would prevail.
After hearing arguments, the court accepted the defence’s request and adjourned the hearing until Dec 1.

ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has signalled a clear shift in the government’s economic direction, saying the goal is no longer to pursue short bursts of five to six per cent GDP growth that have repeatedly led to instability.
“We do not want to repeat the past cycles of unsustainable growth,” he said while addressing a two-day economic dialogue organised by the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) on Wednesday. The focus, he added, is moving towards steady, sustainable growth that can break recurring boom-and-bust cycles and place the economy on firmer footing.
He said the growth trajectory itself is not the issue; the real challenge is maintaining momentum once achieved. Previous attempts, he noted, proved unsustainable.
He cautioned against repeating earlier patterns and reiterated that export-led growth remains the only path to stronger performance.
Without naming the country, he referred to a neighbouring economy moving towards 8pc growth but facing high unemployment. In Pakistan, he said, the debate centres on equity and representative growth.
Discussing sectoral performance, Mr Aurangzeb highlighted the government’s aim to revive industrialisation, saying the upcoming industrial policy will place special emphasis on this effort. He expressed hope for 3.5pc GDP growth in the current fiscal year.
He projected growth of around 4pc over the next two to three years, with the potential to reach 6-7pc over the medium term, provided the momentum in agriculture, manufacturing and services continues.
He also gave updates on remittances and external inflows, noting stable monthly remittance levels through formal channels and strong performance of the Roshan Digital Account. He said remittances this year are expected to reach around $41 billion.
The minister said easing monetary conditions would help reduce financing costs, but urged corporate leaders to diversify beyond bank borrowing and make greater use of capital markets for longer-tenor, more competitive financing.
Mr Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing structural issues in taxation and energy. “We are going to hold the first tax advisory council meeting on Thursday. The council will now reach out to businesses for input ahead of the next budget.”
Responding to concerns about security raised by foreign investors, the minister stressed that national security is non-negotiable. Security, macroeconomic stability, and smooth profit repatriation, he said, are the basic prerequisites for attracting and retaining global investment.
He said the inaugural meeting of the 11th NFC will be held on Dec 4. “We will engage provinces to come up with some tangible results.”
He also announced that Pakistan is preparing for its first Panda Bond issuance, expected before the Chinese New Year.
Mr Aurangzeb pointed to renewed interest from global companies such as Aramco, and firms from Turkiye and Abu Dhabi, which have begun investing in energy, mining, technology, logistics and automotive sectors. He described this as a sign of growing confidence in Pakistan’s economic direction.
Dr Zeelaf Munir, chairperson of the PBC, highlighted the role of productive businesses in national progress. “Pakistan’s economic strength depends on evidence-based policy, stability and long-term reform,” she said.
She added that growth requires predictability, fairness and confidence for business, and that sustainable progress needs partnership between government, business, academia and civil society.
Long-term stability
At another session, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said exports must grow faster than imports to ease pressure on the economy and secure long-term stability. He described industrial development as essential for national prosperity and called industry the backbone of economic progress.
He said stronger export performance requires support for manufacturing and local production, adding that producing key inputs such as steel domestically is necessary to expand export capacity. He was of the opinion that Pakistan should strengthen domestic investment before relying on foreign investors. Faster economic progress, he said, is needed to create employment.
Mr Haroon said a tax package under the upcoming industrial policy will be presented to the IMF. The reform measures being prepared, he added, are intended to support long-term, sustainable economic growth.

The committee, headed by Muhammad Farooq Sattar, asked the privatisation commission to present the timeline at its next meeting. The committee also emphasised safeguarding PIA employees’ jobs before the sale.
It called for retaining staff based on performance and merit and ensuring benefits, such as pensions and gratuity, are processed fairly. Officials were instructed to consult the PIA employees’ union and address their concerns to ensure a transparent process.

 

The privatisation commission has already approved a transaction structure to sell a stake of 51 per cent to 100pc in PIACL, along with management control.
Four bidders have been pre-qualified for the sale: Lucky Cement Consortium, Arif Habib Corporation Consortium, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited Air Blue Limited.
According to the commission, the pre-qualified bidders now have access to a virtual data room, can conduct site visits and participate in the pre-bid conference. Negotiations are ongoing to finalise commercial terms, advancing the privatisation process.
In a separate matter, an additional secretary for the power division told the committee that the government has begun the phased privatisation of public sector power generation companies (GENCOs), under a 2024–29 programme.
He said only operational plants will be offered, with the Guddu (747MW) and Nandipur (525MW) facilities identified for privatisation once pre-conditions are met. Non-operational units are proposed for delisting from the programme.
The privatisation commission advised GENCOs may dispose of old, non-functional assets with the board and ministry’s approval.
The committee also sought a detailed report from the power ministry on the installation of 1.5 million smart meters nationwide and requested a formal briefing for Karachi’s elected representatives about the project’s progress and to explain why Karachi is not included in the current phase.

More than 10 hours after the fire started in the northern Tai Po district, flames and thick smoke still engulfed the 32-storey towers as rescue workers swarmed the site and shocked inhabitants watched nearby.
The cause of the blaze was not immediately known, but it was fanned by green construction mesh and bamboo scaffolding which the government began phasing out in March for safety reasons.
Working through the night, firefighters were struggling to reach upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex, which has 2,000 apartments in eight blocks, due to the intense heat.
One 71-year-old resident surnamed Wong broke down in tears, saying his wife was trapped inside.
A firefighter was among the 36 killed, and 29 people were in hospital, Hong Kong leader John Lee told reporters. Some 900 people were in eight shelters.

“The priority is to extinguish the fire and rescue the residents who are trapped. The second is to support the injured. The third is to support and recover. Then, we’ll launch a thorough investigation,” Lee told reporters.
Harry Cheung, 66, who has lived at Block Two in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise about 2:45 p.m. (0645 GMT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block.
“I immediately went back to pack up my things,” he said.
“I don’t even know how I feel right now. I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight because I probably won’t be able to go back home.”
China’s Xi urges ‘all out’ effort against fire
Frames of scaffolding were seen tumbling to the ground as firefighters battled the blaze, while scores of fire engines and ambulances lined the road below the development.
From the mainland, China’s President Xi Jinping urged an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, China’s state broadcaster CCTV said.

Hong Kong’s sky-high property prices have long been a trigger for social discontent in the city and the fire tragedy could stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December.
Hong Kong’s Transport Department said that due to the fire, an entire section of the Tai Po road, one of Hong Kong’s two main highways, had been closed and buses were being diverted.
At least six schools will be closed on Thursday due to the fire and traffic congestion, the city’s Education Bureau said.
It was Hong Kong’s worst fire since 41 people died in a commercial building in the heart of Kowloon in November 1996.
That fire was later found to be caused by welding during internal renovations.
A public inquiry yielded sweeping updates to building standards and fire safety regulations in the city’s high-rise offices, shops and homes.
Bamboo scaffolding being phased out
Hong Kong is one of the last places in the world where bamboo is still widely used for scaffolding in construction.

 

The government moved to start phasing that out in March, citing safety. It announced that 50% of public construction works would be required to use metal frames instead.
Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with some 300,000 residents.

Occupied since 1983, the complex is under the government’s subsidised home ownership scheme, according to property agency websites. According to online posts, it has been undergoing renovations for a year at a cost of HK$330 million ($42.43 million), with each unit paying between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000.
Owning a home is a distant dream for many in Hong Kong, one of the world’s most expensive housing markets and where residential rents are hovering around record highs.</p><small>2025-11-26 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635771-imran-khan-healthy-not-shifted-anywhere-adiala-jail-admin' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan healthy, not shifted anywhere: Adiala jail admin</strong></a><br><p>

According to the Kashmir Media Service (KMS), the institute was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats for the current academic year. Of the 50 seats, 42 were allotted to Muslim students based on merit, sparking protests from right-wing Hindu groups and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who said Hindu students should be prioritised as the institution’s funding came from donations to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine.
Speaking at the golden jubilee programme of Jamia Ziaul Uloom institute in Poonch, Abdullah said that Constitution Day “should not be reduced to a symbolic observance”.
“Today, Constitution Day is being celebrated. The meaning of Constitution Day is not that we remember the Constitution for an hour … its meaning is that every day of the year, we must keep it alive,” Abdullah was quoted as saying by the Kashmir Observer.
The chief executive of the occupied territory noted that the Indian constitution’s preamble grants equal status to all religions, ensures democratic rights for every citizen and guarantees protection under the law, according to the Observer’s report.
It added that he expressed concern that the country was witnessing a trend where even educational institutions were being viewed through a communal lens.
“Today, in one of the medical colleges, it is being said that Muslims and non-Hindus should not study here. If we set aside merit and start making decisions on the basis of religion, then where will the Constitution go?” he was quoted as saying about the rejection of the student list.
On Monday, Abdullah said that when the bill to establish the university was passed, there was no mention of people being excluded from admissions based on their religion.
“Where was it written?” he asked the press. “It was said that admissions will be based on merit and not religion. When admission is granted based on merit, then some people don’t like that. If they are not in favour, then they can approach the Supreme Court.”
He added that admissions cannot be decided without merit and said that admitting students based on religion would violate the Indian constitution.
“Will social welfare schemes be handled based on religion?” He asked. “Will ration shops ask about [the customer’s] religion? Will policemen work based on religion?
“Right now, secularism remains a key part of our constitution. If you do not want to keep the nation secular, then remove that from the constitution,” he added. “You (BJP) do what you will, we’ll do what we will.”
In response to a question, Abdullah reiterated, “When students will be granted admission, it will be on merit. Some students will excel, while others will be left behind. It’s nobody’s fault.”
 






In another press talk on Tuesday, the CM said that when the college was being built, it should have been classified as a “minority institute” in order to allow admission to any one religious group.
“Admissions are based on NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Test) and entrance tests, not on religion,” he reiterated. “If you don’t want Muslims to study here, then declare it a minority institute. They’ll get admission elsewhere … they’ll go to Bangladesh or Turkiye.
“But, if you point the finger at Muslims and call them communal, sectarian and don’t tolerate their children, then remember this situation,” he added.
“When children are ready to attend an institution like Mata Vaishno Devi, they are not concerned about the name or where the funding comes from; they want to study and become doctors,” the CM said. “Now you want them to be denied admission based on their religion.”

A protest camp was established by the Baloch Students Council (BSC) against the enforced disappearance of a sixth-semester student, Saeedullah Baloch.
The BSC students had earlier reached out to students from other councils and groups to join the camp.
However, fearing a larger protest campaign, the administration of QAU suspended all academic activities at the varsity.
The BSC students participating in the sit-in remained wary of certain consequences and declined to disclose their names to the media.
However, speakers at the protest camp said they had remained firm in their stance for the past three days and refused to remain silent. They added that these three days have shown that students cannot be intimidated when justice is denied.
 
 

Mohammad Azam, brother of missing Saeedullah, said that the protest camp has become more than a protest site; it is a symbol of collective resilience.
“With every hour that passes, our message grows louder, we will not accept enforced disappearances, we will not accept fear, and we will not walk away until our voices are heard,” he added.
There was no official reply from the QAU administration over the situation and the continued suspension of studies on campus.
However, a senior QAU official said the administration had reached out to the BSC, offering assistance and requesting that they not establish a protest camp over the enforced disappearance
“But they flatly refused because the (varsity) administration was not in a position to offer any help, secondly, the BSC maintained that the protest camp was not a political activity but a demand for the recovery of a student of the university,” the official added.
Saeedullah Baloch was a student of the Defence and Strategic Studies (DSS) department.
The speakers at the camp highlighted that Saeedullah was forcibly taken away by unknown men in civil dress on July 8, 2025, between 7 and 7.30pm, from the Islamabad toll plaza when he and his friend were travelling to Quetta on a public bus.
The protestors added that the abductors were accompanied by officials of law enforcement, and they offloaded the two from the bus.
While Saeedullah’s friend was allowed to proceed on the same bus, he was taken away.
The speakers, who preferred not to be named in the media, said that they were students, but they were also witnesses to illegal acts by the authorities.
In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament held the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.</p><small>2025-11-26 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635750-irans-top-security-adviser-urges-stronger-islamabad-tehran-joint-security-mechanism' target='_blank'><strong>Iran's top security adviser urges stronger Islamabad-Tehran joint security mechanism</strong></a><br><p>

The leaders believe that the internal memo is undemocratic and ensures one-man rule instead of decentralisation. They also claimed that the original constitution of PTI had a core committee and nothing like a political one.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that “the internal memo was the need of the hour and was issued by Additional Secretary General PTI Firdous Shamim Naqvi to streamline recent issues faced by the party.”
The memo, available with Dawn, states that in the centre, provincial presidents and general secretaries or equivalent office bearers will report to the party’s secretary general.
Similarly, at the provincial level, the regional president and general secretary will report to the secretary general of the party on organisational matters. District and tehsil presidents will report to the general secretary of the region and district.
“To clarify further, no tier can break this chain of command. For the party to function properly, the office bearers must recognise their domain,” the memo, signed by party leader Firdous Shamim Naqvi, stated.
“At each tier, their many functions which are the purview of the tier as per the general directions called out above. The functional duties of the office bearer will be decided by the [secretary general] with the approval of the cabinet of the tier.”
The memo added that all provincial or regional heads’ complaints would be addressed to the centre and to the respective office bearer, as the case may be.
A leader of the party, wishing not to be quoted, said that the PTI was going under “one-man rule” with this move.
“Now, no decision can be taken without getting the approval from the secretary general. However, it is a fact that currently there is no secretary general in the PTI, and that is why Additional Secretary General Mr Naqvi has signed the internal memo,” he explained.
Another leader said that the PTI had a core committee, and there was no mention of the political committee in the party’s constitution.
“Now, there is no room for dissent or difference with the secretary general,” he said. “Once, PTI leaders had their own opinion, and Imran Khan used to say that the difference of opinion was the beauty of the political party.
“Unfortunately, now the political party will be run like an army unit in which there will be a ‘chain of command’. I can foresee that the differences within the party will further increase,” he said.
Information Secretary Akram, while talking to Dawn, said that the chain of command was already defined in the constitution of the PTI.
“The internal memo is basically related to block code, which is related to Election Management and Assessment Cell (EMAC),” he explained.
“We had to issue the internal memo as at different places, appointments for EMAC were not being understood by party wings. So Mr Naqvi has given just a clarification to streamline the issues related to appointments regarding EMAC.”

Akram emphasised that the hierarchy of the PTI was arranged according to the party constitution was submitted to the Election Commission of Pakistan in 2019, further stating that all have to perform their roles as per the constitution.
“Chain of command has to be recognised to run any party smoothly. Parties cannot be run without a chain of command. Otherwise, there is a structure including Centre, Province, Region, District, Tehsil and then Unions,” the PTI Information Secretary said.</p><small>2025-11-26 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/26210240b32fd5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957514/nawaz-calls-for-accountability-for-those-who-brought-imran-to-power-terms-them-bigger-criminals' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz calls for accountability for ‘those who brought Imran’ to power, terms them bigger ‘criminals’</strong></a><br><p>PML-N president and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday called for accountability for “those who brought Imran” into power, claiming that they were bigger “criminals” than the PTI founder.
“Imran Khan was not the only criminal; the ones who brought him to power were the bigger criminals, and they should be held fully accountable,” said the PML-N supremo while addressing a gathering of newly elected lawmakers today.
Nawaz has generally maintained a low profile since the PML-N, following the formation of a coalition with the PPP, came into power after the 2024 elections.
In 2018, according to figures provided by the Election Commission of Pakistan, PTI had emerged as the largest political party in the country, winning 115 of the 270 National Assembly seats on which the elections were held.
During a session in parliament following the election of then-PM Imran, PML-N leader Shehbaz brought up allegations of rigging in the July 25 polls. Alleging that 1.6 million votes were rejected, he questioned the discovery of ballot papers from gutters and streets across the country.

“You know their (PTI’s) narrative well, they used to call others robbers and dacoits while they were the bigger robbers.”
Nawaz added that the people of the country are now aware of what the previous government did and further said, “they only indulged in chaos, anarchy and fights, including slandering others”.
He asked if a country can progress under such circumstances and with such people residing in the corridors of power.
The PML chief lamented that prior to the change of power in 2018, the country was on a path of progress with low inflation and higher growth rates.
Nawaz recalled that the Saudi riyal was valued at Rs11 when Pervez Musharraf imposed martial law in 1999, compared to around Rs78 today (as pointed out by an audience member). He said currency depreciation had made life unaffordable for Pakistanis.
The PML-N supremo added that Pakistan cannot make decisions independently due to its reliance on the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“If our rate of progress had remained the same, who knows where we would’ve reached today. There would be no worries about IMF or about foreign exchange,” Nawaz said.
“Now we have all these worries; what are our reserves, whether IMF will let us do this or not. We cannot make any decision ourselves. Our personal decisions are in the hands of foreigners,” he stated.
The PML-N leader claimed that people voted for the party on the basis of its performance, praising both PM Shehbaz and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for their efforts to “reach the level that we had lost”.
He said the two were “working hard” to restore economic stability, saying the government had “taken the economy out of the trenches” and moved the country away from default.
Nawaz said provincial schemes, including low-cost housing, hospital projects, student laptops, scholarships and the “Suthra Punjab” and green bus initiatives, are evidence of progress.
He also highlighted what he described as improved security and social protection in Punjab, stating that ration cards and health facilities were being distributed to vulnerable families without discrimination. “People of all beliefs and religions are our brothers and sisters,” Nawaz stated.</p><small>2025-11-26 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635729-pm-shehbaz-eyes-1bn-pakistan-bahrain-trade-within-three-years' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz eyes $1bn Pakistan-Bahrain trade within three years</strong></a><br><p>
