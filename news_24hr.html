Separately, Karachi is expected to receive rainfall on June 27 (Friday), the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said — potentially ending an ongoing wave of extreme heat and humid weather.
The PMD has already forecast monsoon rain across the country from Wednesday, June 25. Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies.
Monsoon rains have commenced in Punjab and first spell will continue till July 1, the PDMA said in a statement, adding that rainfall with strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted in most districts of the province.
Relief Commissioner Punjab Nabeel Javed has instructed commissioners and deputy commissioners across the province to remain alert. He said all relevant departments including Rescue 1122 and WASA are on alert.
The PDMA said rains with strong winds are predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujarat, Jhelum, and Gujranwala.  Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha and Mianwali are also expected to receive rain.
Rainfall is predicted in south Punjab including Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Bahawalnagar from June 26-28.
The PDMA director general has issued a alert to the district administrations on the instructions of the chief minister. “Monsoon rains are predicted to be 25pc more this year,” he said.
“An alert has been issued to the Department of Health, Irrigation, Construction and Communications, Local Government and Livestock,” he added.
“Citizens are requested to take precautionary measures in extreme weather conditions, stay in safe locations during thunderstorms and avoid unnecessary travel.” He said tourists should plan their travel as per weather conditions.
He warned of landslide risk in Murree, Galiyat and other mountainous areas due to heavy rains. Citizens should stay in safe places to protect themselves from lightning and call the PDMA helpline 1129 in case of emergency.
Rain expected in Karachi
In a related development, the PMD has issued a three-day weather forecast for Karachi division which predicts isolated rain and thunderstorm on Friday evening.
The weather will remain partly cloudy, hot and humid, today with the maximum temperature between 34-36 degrees Celsius and humidity level at 72pc in the morning.
For tomorrow, the weather in the city has been forecast as partly cloudy and humid, with chances of isolated light rain and drizzle. The maximum temperature will remain between 35-37 degrees Celsius and humidity levels of 70-80pc.
On Friday, the Met Office has forecast hot and humid weather with chances of isolated rain and thunderstorm in the evening. The maximum temperature will remain between 35-37 degrees Celsius with humidity level between 70-80pc in the morning with southwesterly winds blowing.
According to the Met Office, “monsoon currents are penetrating upper and central parts of the country and likely to intensify further.
“A westerly wave is moving toward the upper parts of the country and is likely to become more active by tomorrow (Thursday).”
Under its influence, dust storm and rainfall with thundershower is expected in Tharparker ,Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Badin, Thatta and Dadu districts tomorrow.
It added that rainfall with thunderstorm is likely in Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Khairpur, Ghotki, Kashmore, Dadu, Nosheroferoz, Shaheed Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Tharparker, Mirpur Khas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Thatta, Badin and Karachi division on June 27 with occasional gaps.</p><small>2025-06-25 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1215475272d3a61.jpg?r=120907' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915180/malformation-pests-and-water-shortage-the-mango-meltdown-in-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>Malformation, pests and water shortage: The mango meltdown in Sindh</strong></a><br><p>It was a sultry summer morning. Mir Shah Mohammad Talpur was visiting his sprawling mango orchards, located on the outskirts of Hyderabad, to inspect the year’s produce. However, the ruthless sun glaring on his back and mercury rising to 43.2 degrees Celsius were making things difficult for Mir.
For the mangoes, though, these climatic conditions were in tandem with their harvest.
Mir’s orchard is spread across 450 acres of land. “I have been looking after the bagh since my father’s demise … many trees here are around 50 years old,” he told Dawn.com. The 49-year-old wore a black sun cap along with a neck flap to avoid exposure to the intense heat.
Like many in the area, Mir too sublets his mango orchard — a practice in vogue, by and large, in Sindh. Only a few growers, including those who believe in progressive farming, manage their own orchards. The province is known for its Sindhri mangoes, harvested in the first week of June.
 

Two workers moving from one part of the orchard to other for picking of fruit.

Despite other varieties such as Saroli, Dasehri and Langra, which are harvested as early as mid-May, Sindhri remains the most preferred choice of mango lovers. It is not just an export favourite, but also used as a ‘seasonal gift’ by politicians and top-level government functionaries.
“This time, Sindhri is being picked quite early thanks to the market dynamics,” said Mir. “The falling of the fruit from trees indicates that it is now ripe and ready for harvest.”  For this year’s harvest, he signed an agreement with Haji Ramazan Siyal, a contractor from Multan.
From trees to plates
At Mir’s orchard, labourers from Punjab, who routinely cross over to this side of the provincial border during the season, are busy with various chores — climbing trees to pluck mangoes, sorting the fruits for export consignments and local market consumption, and cooking food.
These labourers — many of them hailing from southern Punjab’s districts of Muzaffargarh, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan and Multan — stay in the orchards for over a month until the end of the harvesting season and the subsequent marketing.
 

A couple of workers busy plucking mangoes.

They then leave for Punjab, where harvesting begins relatively late. These workers have expertise in preparing bardana (wooden boxes), bharawa (filling of mangoes in boxes), thukawa (packing of mangoes) and turawa (plucking). Their dexterity is on show as they swiftly move through the orchards.
Picking of mangoes is conventionally known as ‘pattaee’ in the Sindhi language. A few farm workers climb the trees, while others stand underneath with polypropylene bags in their hands. These specific bags are used to ensure that not a single mango touches the earth below, which can damage the shape and quality of the king of fruits.

The mangoes plucked thus far are collected at a separate location to make a mound of them before they are graded. The ubiquitous sweet smell of unripe mangoes pervades this part of the orchard.
Shift from conventional to modern ways
At Mir’s farm, however, Siyal’s labourers, including his young son, Mudassir Siyal, have shifted away from conventional harvesting or pattaee. Instead, they pick every mango in a small bag, whose edge is fixed with a sharp cutter. This process reduces the labour, because the fruit is collected in a basket and then shifted for manual sorting and grading.
“I feel the fruit suffers shock inside in the pattaee way of harvesting,” says Mir, seated under the canopy shade of an old mango tree. “This year, labourers are clearing trees in quite an efficient way to avoid losses.” Soon, Siyal’s men bring out servings of mangoes.

According to Siyal, Mir’s orchard needs massive pruning of stems to let sunlight and air pass through easily. “I have given some advice to Mir saheb on how to cut large branches of trees that are at present entangled considerably. It should be done across the orchard,” he says.
“I started working as a labourer to climb trees for picking mangoes, and then went on to become a contractor. I bought my first bagh in the early 1970s for Rs30,000 and now my son works with me,” he adds.

The contractor provides high-quality mangoes to exporters, besides selling them in domestic wholesale markets across Sindh, under a business deal for export to Iran. Each carton invariably carries eight to nine kilogrammes of mangoes. Exporters usually arrive in orchards after contacting contractors, while some are now working as orchard contractors themselves.
However, many growers avoid managing orchards themselves. “Handling a mango orchard and then marketing the fruit is not everyone’s cup of tea,” said Nadeem Shah, who owns an orchard in Matiari. “I tried managing it sometime back, but then backed out. It’s a tricky business that I find difficult to deal with.”
Threat to mangoes
The acreage of mango orchards has dwindled in the last five years, from 59,100 hectares in 2019-20 to 58,900 hectares in 2023-24. Mango production, however, showed a slight increase from 329,300 tonnes in 2019-20 and 387,200 tonnes in 2023-24. These figures, however, present a dismal picture when compared to a decade ago, when the acreage stood at 63,144 hectares with production of 402,514 tonnes, according to data from the Sindh agriculture department.

Mango producers fear that the fruit’s production will drop considerably this year due to various factors. Earlies this year, mangoes suffered shocks apparently due to climate change-driven weather patterns. Severe water shortage at critical stages of flowering and fruiting in February and March was another major factor that affected the mango crop.
The water shortage has also affected Mir’s mango orchards. “Look at the size of the mango … it’s 970 grams, but this could have been more than 1,000 grams or even closer to 1,100 grams if we provided water to the orchard before harvesting,” he lamented. Watering trees before plucking makes the land underneath marshy, thus restricting the mobility of workers.

If this was not enough, a disease called malformation and a pest known as hopper damaged the crop. It was again followed by substantial damages due to powerful wind storms that visited Hyderabad, Tando Allahyar and Mirpurkhas — hub of mango production — causing massive dropping of unripe mangoes. Some signs of malformed flowers were still present in the trees.
Malformation is a disease, and growers can only control it by removing the malformed flowers as soon as they appear in the trees. According to Mahmood Nawaz Shah, a progressive grower and Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) president, hopper is most lethal at the time of flowering.
“For the last few years, hopper attacks have become quite common. We don’t get research-oriented and evidence-based advice from the agriculture department on how to deal with it,” he regrets.
‘Axe to grind’
Zulfiqar Ali Kachelo has inherited a hefty legacy of the mango farming business in the lower Sindh region. He is a member of the fifth-generation Kachelo family, running the mango orchard trade and diversifying it from conventional trade to e-commerce. Ali’s family cumulatively owns a couple of thousand acres of mango farms in Mirpurkhas.
“I primarily stand for managing orchards myself, as it helps grow the local area’s economy,” he told Dawn.com. “We need to train local farm workers instead of relying on their counterparts from parts of the country.” He also sublets his farm, but on an alternative basis. “If I let out some part of the orchard to a contractor some year, the next year I handle it myself, which helps me learn the trade dynamics and trends.”
 

Workers are busy filling cartons with harvested export quality mangoes.

The issues of malformation and pets are affecting farms regularly, he said. “And we find no solution for it at the government level. The only activity the government is associated with is an annual mango festival with no productive discourse being seen there except for routine mango season’s celebrations,” he criticises.
So, he lamented, the growers depend on their own wisdom or the private sector. “But then the private sector has its axe to grind,” he said, adding that the government’s support for mango orchards, by and large, is almost zero.
SAB’s Nawaz concurred that the government’s support for farmers when it came to tackling diseases was missing. For the past three years, consistent pest attacks along with malformation have been witnessed, making farmers following progressive farm protocols extraordinarily cautious.
 

Export quality mangoes kept in cartons.

“They regularly used sprays to control these issues,” he says, recalling that when malformation was reported in 2023, it caused substantial losses — 20pc to 25pc in the overall mango production.
“Learning from the past, these farmers had somewhat better control in 2024,” Nawaz says. “This year again, malformation was quite massive. Growers having some knowledge applied the required sprays, but those lacking awareness lagged and suffered losses.”
This is the reason why mangoes remain undersized. The incidence of pest attack was also quite evident on the fruit in terms of its quality.
For now, however, Sindh’s mangoes continue their journey — from branches to plates and gift boxes — bringing a touch of sweetness that makes the sweltering summer heat a little more bearable. Across the board, there’s agreement: mangoes, in all their forms, sizes, and flavours, are the season’s greatest joy. But if the pressing issues plaguing mango production are not urgently addressed, we may soon risk losing the king of fruits.

ENGLAND opener Ben Duckett plays a shot during the first Test against India at Headingley on Tuesday.—Reuters

LEEDS: A superb century from Ben Duckett helped steer England to a sensational five-wicket win in the first Test against India after a thrilling day five on Tuesday, the hosts reaching a target of 371 — the 10th highest successful run chase in Test history.
Having turned the match on its head at Headingley after India had been 430-3 in their first innings, England appeared to be cruising to a dramatic win as openers Duckett and Zak Crawley eased their side to lunch on 117-0 in their second innings.
 






Duckett continued his imperious form with another four through the covers to reach his sixth Test hundred, before Crawley fell for 65, their 188-run partnership the second-highest England opening fourth-innings stand in Tests.
Two wickets in two balls — Duckett and Harry Brook — dragged India back into the enthralling contest and when Ben Stokes fell for 33 attempting an ambitious reverse sweep, England’s hopes of victory lay precariously in the balance.
Joe Root’s unbeaten 53 calmed the nerves around his home ground, with the former skipper and Jamie Smith, who hit a six to seal victory, seeing England home as India, having scored five centuries in the match, somehow contrived to start the five-Test series in defeat.
“Incredible, what a Test match. It was a huge number of runs and we have been lucky with the weather,” Duckett said. “I am lost for words.
“We only had to look at the scoreboard to know that if we batted the overs, we would win the game. There were moments when I thought about stepping into another gear but the breaks in the game helped us to stay calm.
“To start this series with a 1-0 win is huge for us. It felt calm in the dressing room. To have Root out there, it’s pretty easy to be calm.”  Resuming day five on 21-0, uncharacteristically for a team renowned for their ultra-aggressive batting, Crawley and Duckett took 99 balls to bring up their 50 partnership — the longest it has taken the pair to do so for England — before upping the ante.
There was slight concern for England when first-innings centurion Ollie Pope quickly followed Crawley back to the pavilion midway through the afternoon session, the number three becoming Prasidh Krishna’s next victim in back-to-back overs.
Duckett continued to accumulate runs quickly, however, before attempting one big shot too many to fall to Shardul Thakur for 149 — the second-highest test fourth-innings score by an English opener.
The contribution of Duckett, in such a pressurised situation, cannot be underestimated — it is 15 years since an England opener last scored a fourth-innings hundred: Alastair Cook at Mirpur in 2010.
Nerves set in around the ground when Brook departed for a golden duck, two in two balls for Thakur, with further scares forthcoming as England looked edgy.
Stokes was left shaking his head at the way he fell to Ravindra Jadeja shortly after tea, but Root and Smith both dug in, stopped offering up chances and got the runs required, with Smith rounding off a remarkable victory in style.
Plenty of dropped catches and two batting collapses ultimately cost India. From 430-3 in the first innings, they lost their final seven wickets for just 41 runs, with the tail crumbling again in the second innings, 31 runs accumulated for the fall of the final six wickets.
It is the first time in history a team has managed five centuries in one Test and not emerged victorious, but also the first time those five centurions have been joined by six batsmen who fell for ducks three in each innings — in the same match.
“We had our chances,” Indian captain Shubman Gill said. “A few dropped catches and the lower order not contributing as much as we would like (cost us) but I am proud. Our young team is learning.
“It just didn’t go our way in this match. We have to rectify (the batting collapses) in the upcoming matches.”
For England, at the start of a crucial period with the Ashes to come later this year, their summer could not have got off to a more promising start, with their aggressive approach, even if it has been toned down and refined, achieving their second-highest run chase in their Test history.

Earlier on Tuesday, both Iran and Israel signaled that the air war between the two nations had ended, at least for now, after Trump publicly scolded them for violating a ceasefire he announced at 5am GMT (10am PKT).
As the two countries lifted civilian restrictions after 12 days of war — which the US joined with an attack on Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities — each sought to claim victory.
Trump said over the weekend that the US deployment of 30,000-pound bombs had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme.
But that claim appeared to be contradicted by an initial assessment by one of his administration’s intelligence agencies, according to three people familiar with the matter.
One of the sources said Iran’s enriched uranium stocks had not been eliminated, and the country’s nuclear programme, much of which is buried deep underground, may have been set back only a month or two.
Iran says its nuclear research is for civilian energy production.
The White House said the intelligence assessment was “flat out wrong”.
According to the report, which was produced by the Defence Intelligence Agency, the strikes sealed off the entrances to two of the facilities, but did not collapse underground buildings, said one of the people familiar with its findings.
Some centrifuges still remained intact after the attacks, the Washington Post said, citing an unnamed person familiar with the report.
Trump’s administration told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that its weekend strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had “degraded” Iran’s nuclear programme, short of Trump’s earlier assertion that the facilities had been “obliterated”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that the attack on Iran had removed the threat of nuclear annihilation and was determined to thwart any attempt by Tehran to revive its weapons programme.
“We have removed two immediate existential threats to us: the threat of nuclear annihilation and the threat of annihilation by 20,000 ballistic missiles,” Netanyahu said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said his country had successfully ended the war in what he called a “great victory,” according to Iranian media.
Pezeshkian also told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Tehran was ready to resolve differences with the US, according to official news agency IRNA.
Israel launched the surprise air war on June 13, attacking Iranian nuclear facilities and killing top military commanders in the worst blow to the Islamic Republic since the 1980s war with Iraq.
Iran, which denies trying to build nuclear weapons, retaliated with barrages of missiles on Israeli military sites and cities.
‘Great victory’
Israel’s military lifted restrictions on activity across the country at 8pm local time (10pm PKT), and officials said Ben Gurion Airport, the country’s main airport near Tel Aviv, had reopened.
Iran’s airspace likewise will be reopened, state-affiliated Nournews reported.
A White House official said Trump brokered the ceasefire deal with Netanyahu, and other administration officials were in touch with the Iranian government.
The truce appeared fragile: Both Israel and Iran took hours to acknowledge they had accepted the ceasefire and accused each other of violating it.
Trump scolded both sides but aimed especially stinging criticism at Israel, telling the close US ally to “calm down now.”
He later said Israel called off further attacks at his command.
Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said he told his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, that his country would respect the ceasefire unless Iran violated it.
Pezeshkian likewise said Iran would honour the ceasefire as long as Israel did, according to Iranian media.
Whether the Israel-Iran truce can hold is a major question given the deep mistrust between the two foes. But Trump’s ability to broker a ceasefire showed Washington retains some leverage in the volatile region.
Israeli armed forces chief of staff Eyal Zamir said a “significant chapter” of the conflict had concluded but the campaign against Iran was not over. He said the military would refocus on its war against Hamas in Gaza.
Iran’s military command also warned Israel and the US to learn from the “crushing blows” it delivered during the conflict.
Iranian authorities said 610 people were killed in their country by Israeli strikes and 4,746 injured. Iran’s retaliatory bombardment killed 28 people in Israel, the first time its air defences were penetrated by large numbers of Iranian missiles.
Oil prices plunged and stock markets rallied worldwide in a sign of confidence inspired by the ceasefire, which allayed fears of disruption to critical oil supplies from the Gulf.
Ceasefire violations?
Earlier on Tuesday, Trump admonished Israel with an obscenity in an extraordinary outburst at an ally whose air war he had joined two days before by dropping massive bunker-buster bombs on Iran’s underground nuclear sites.
Before departing the White House en route to a Nato summit in Europe, Trump told reporters he was unhappy with both sides for the ceasefire breach but particularly frustrated with Israel, which he said had “unloaded” shortly after agreeing to the deal.
“I’ve got to get Israel to calm down now,” Trump said. Iran and Israel had been fighting “so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing.”

Netanyahu’s office acknowledged Israel bombed a radar site near Tehran in what it said was retaliation for Iranian missiles fired three-and-a-half hours after the ceasefire was due to begin.
It did not explicitly say whether the strike on the radar site took place before or after they spoke. The Islamic Republic denied launching any missiles and said Israel’s attacks had continued for an hour-and-a-half beyond the time the truce was meant to start.
“Who mediated or how it happened doesn’t matter,” said Reza Sharifi, 38, heading back to Tehran from Rasht on the Caspian Sea, where he had fled with his family.
“The war is over. It never should have started in the first place.”</p><small>2025-06-25 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610825-aleemas-control-over-pti-social-media-makes-her-all-powerful-within-imran-founded-party' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema's control over PTI social media makes her all-powerful within Imran-founded party</strong></a><br><p>

DPO Habibullah said police teams reached the site of the explosion in Sharamkhel, Pewar, and launched an investigation. He confirmed that four people were killed and four others were injured in the explosion.
The medical superintendent of DHQ Parachinar Hospital Mir Hassan Jan identified the victims as Nawab Ali, Amir Hussain, Hidayat Hussain, and Manzar Ali.
He added the injured namely, Muhammad Konain, Shafaat Hussain, and Hassan Ghulam were provided first aid and have been taken to Peshawar for further treatment.
Speaking to media, an injured victim Hassan Ghulam said they were heading towards a hill to collect firewood when the explosion occurred on the roadside.
“The incident is very unfortunate. The terrorists should be caught and punished,” he said. Besides his four companions, two horses were also killed in the explosion.
The tribal elders of the area condemned the incident and called for arresting the terrorists immediately for attempting to sabotage peace efforts. They called for conducting a high-level investigation into the incident.
In December last year, Kurram remained cut off from the rest of the country due to violent tribal clashes that claimed more than 100 lives.
All roads in Kurram, including the Parachinar-Peshawar highway, remained closed to traffic for a month after a vehicular convoy was attacked in Bagan area, in which at least 50 people were killed.</p><small>2025-06-25 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/25111951898da38.jpg?r=112251' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919991/trump-says-china-can-buy-iranian-oil-but-urges-it-to-purchase-us-crude' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says China can buy Iranian oil, but urges it to purchase US crude</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that China can continue to purchase Iranian oil after Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire, a move that the White House clarified did not indicate a relaxation of US sanctions.
“China can now continue to purchase oil from Iran. Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the US, also,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, just days after he ordered US bombings of three Iranian nuclear sites.
 


Trump was drawing attention to no attempts by Iran so far to close the Strait of Hormuz to oil tankers, as a closure would have been hard for China, the world’s top importer of Iranian oil, a senior White House official told Reuters.
“The president continues to call on China and all countries to import our state-of-the-art oil rather than import Iranian oil in violation of US sanctions,” the official said.
After the ceasefire announcement, Trump’s comments on China were another bearish signal for oil prices, which fell nearly 6 per cent on Tuesday.
Any relaxation of sanctions enforcement on Iran would mark a US policy shift after Trump said in February he was re-imposing maximum pressure on Iran, aiming to drive its oil exports to zero, over its nuclear program and funding of militants across the Middle East.
Trump imposed waves of Iran-related sanctions on several of China’s independent “teapot” refineries and port terminal operators for purchases of Iranian oil.
“President Trump’s greenlight for China to keep buying Iranian oil reflects a return to lax enforcement standards,” said Scott Modell, a former CIA officer, now CEO of Rapidan Energy Group.
In addition to not enforcing sanctions, Trump could suspend or waive sanctions imposed by executive order or under authorities a president is granted in laws passed by Congress.
Trump will likely not waive sanctions ahead of coming rounds of US-Iran nuclear talks, Modell said. The measures provide leverage given Tehran’s demand that any deal includes lifting them permanently.
Jeremy Paner, a partner at law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed, said if Trump chooses to suspend Iran oil-related sanctions, it would require lots of work between agencies.
The US Treasury would need to issue licences, and the State Department would have to issue waivers, which require Congressional notification.
Oil traders and analysts in Asia said they did not expect Trump’s comments to have a near-term impact on Chinese purchases of oil from either Iran or the US.
 
 

Iranian oil accounts for roughly 13.6pc of China’s oil purchases this year, with the discounted barrels providing a lifeline to margin-squeezed independent refineries. US oil accounts for just 2pc of China’s imports, and Beijing’s 10pc tariffs on US oil deter further purchases.
Pressure on China
China has long opposed what it has called Washington’s “abuse of illegal unilateral sanctions”. China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump’s post.
Larger purchases of Iranian oil by China and other consumers could upset US ally Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter.
The impact of US sanctions on Iran’s exports, however, has been limited since Trump’s first administration when he cracked down harder on Tehran.
Trump has “flashed the Glock” this year with sanctions on Chinese trading companies and terminals, Modell said, referring to revealing a gun. But the results have been far more “minimum pressure” than maximum, Modell added.
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters that Trump had signalled what he wanted to happen and that his administration is focused on delivering that. She would not say what the process would entail.
“But clearly we are focused on making sure that (the) guiding hand of President Trump prevails and moves this government forward, so we will have to wait and see when it comes to what that ends up looking like,” Bruce said.</p><small>2025-06-25 06:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/25111016ff48b82.jpg?r=111158' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919858/court-blocks-trumps-ban-on-foreign-students-at-harvard' target='_blank'><strong>Court blocks Trump’s ban on foreign students at Harvard</strong></a><br><p>BOSTON: A federal judge on Monday blocked President Donald Trump’s administration from implementing his plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University.
US District Judge Allison Burroughs in Boston issued an injunction barring Trump’s administration from carrying out its latest bid to curtail Harvard’s ability to host international students amid an escalating fight pitting the Republican president against the prestigious Ivy League school.
The preliminary injunction extends a temporary order the judge issued on June 5 that prevented the administration from enforcing a proclamation Trump signed a day earlier that cited national security concerns to justify why Harvard could no longer be trusted to host international students.
She ruled after Friday’s announcement that his administration could announce a deal with Harvard “over the next week or so” to resolve the White House’s campaign against the university, which has waged a legal battle against the administration’s various actions against the school.
Trump signed the proclamation after his administration had already frozen billions of dollars in funding to the oldest and wealthiest US university, threatened Harvard’s tax-exempt status and launched several investigations into the school.
The proclamation prohibited foreign nationals from entering the US to study at Harvard or participate in exchange visitor programs for an initial period of six months, and directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider whether to revoke visas of international students already enrolled at Harvard.
But Burroughs said Trump’s administration was likely violating Harvard’s free speech rights under the US Constitution’s First Amendment by retaliating against it for refusing to meet its demands to cede control over the school’s curriculum and admissions.
The judge said that “at its root, this case is about core constitutional rights that must be safeguarded: freedom of thought, freedom of expression, and freedom of speech, each of which is a pillar of a functioning democracy and an essential hedge against authoritarianism”.
“Here, the government’s misplaced efforts to control a reputable academic institution and squelch diverse viewpoints seemingly because they are, in some instances, opposed to this Administration’s own views, threaten these rights,” she wrote.
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard said the ruling will allow it to continue hosting international students and scholars while this case moves forward.

In a decision with the potential to set legal precedent, District Court Judge William Asup ruled that Anthropic’s training of its AI creation, Claude, with millions of pirated books was allowed under a  “fair use” doctrine in a law called the Copyright Act.
“Use of the books at issue to train Claude and its precursors was exceedingly transformative and was a fair use,” Alsup wrote in his decision.
 
 

Tremendous amounts of data are needed to train large language models powering generative AI. Musicians, book authors, visual artists and news publications have sued AI companies that used their data without permission or payment.
Along with downloading for free millions of books from websites offering pirated works, Anthropic bought copyrighted books, scanned the pages and stored them in digital format, according to court documents.
Anthropic’s aim was to amass a library of  “all the books in the world”, training AI models on content as deemed fit, the judge said in his ruling.

Presiding over a meeting to review arrangements regarding Muharram here on Tuesday, the CM sought an emergency plan from the administration.
“Those found involved in spreading hateful content on social media should be arrested forthwith,” the CM said and directed the authorities to ensure a complete ban on displaying banners, posters and wall-chalking throughout the province. She also directed to arrest of those violating the ban on flying drones during Muharram.
She asked the ministers, commissioners, deputy commissioners, RPOs and DPOs to personally oversee the security arrangements for Muharram.
The CM sought the strict implementation of the code of conduct and a zero-tolerance policy. She asked the officer to launch mock drills of security arrangements and install sabeels for processions and gatherings of Muharram. She also directed to provide refreshing drinks, lemon water and cold water bottles during processions along with identification and monitoring of sabeels.
The CM said that water sprinklers should be set up to protect the mourners from the heatstroke and humidity. She instructed the officials to set up field hospitals and clinics on wheels for Ashura processions and further directed to issue effective traffic management plans as well as timely traffic advisories. She also instructed the authorities to make arrangements for the timely drainage of water in case of rainfall.
“The spirit of Muharram should be implemented. Hanging electric wires poses a big risk; emergency operations should be carried out in this regard. There should be no power outage during Ashura and streetlights should not be turned off,” she said and directed the officers to ensure that the manholes were properly covered in all areas, including private housing societies.
“Patchwork is done every year on Muharram, how come potholes resurface on the procession routes again? In the context of war, Muharram should be considered highly sensitive; Pakistan’s enemies will not let this opportunity go. Negative forces are unnerved at the success of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos. All stakeholders must remain alert,” she said.
PUNJAB POLICE: The Punjab Police finalised security arrangements for Majalis and mourning processions across the province during Muharram.
Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar chaired a meeting via a video link at the Central Police Office to review the security arrangements.
Punjab Additional IG Operations Shahzada Sultan briefed the meeting about the security measures taken to ensure a peaceful and safe Muharram.
According to the Punjab Police spokesperson, over 38,000 Majalis will be held and more than 9,200 mourning processions will be taken out across Punjab during Muharram. He said over 232,000 officers and personnel would perform security duties during the first 10 days. In Lahore, he said, more than 28,000 officials would be deployed for Muharram security.
Similarly, over 53,000 community volunteers and more than 38,000 volunteers would assist in the security of majalis and mourning processions, respectively.
Addressing the meeting, the IGP directed the officers to ensure implementation of security SOPs, saying that due to the prevailing situation in the region, the security of Muharram had become more challenging. Any attempt by anti-state elements to incite sectarianism, religious hatred, or disturb law and order should be thwarted by using all the available resources, he said.
“Any trouble or flash points should be resolved in consultation with stakeholders before Muharram,” he said.
The IGP directed the RPOs and DPOs to ensure coordination with peace committees, scholars of various sects and organisers of mourning processions and majalis.
The Punjab Police would have the full support from the Pakistan Army and Rangers, as well as other security institutions during the first 10 days of Muharram, he said.

The State Bank’s latest update for May shows that foreign inflows in T-bills during the month (up to May 23 of FY25) reached $73.6 million. This was strange since India attacked Pakistan on May 6. It is believed that foreign investment quickly leaves a country during an international crisis.
The war did not hurt inflows in t-bills, but outflows from the equity market reflected its negative impact.
The State Bank data for May shows that while inflows in T-bills were $73.5m, outflows amounted to $66m.

The highest inflow of $50 million came from UAE, while Britain received the biggest outflow of $62m

But figures for foreign investment in equity market show that during May, inflows were $38.7m and outflows totaled $64.6m.
Although the situation has remained calm in Pakistan so far despite the war, India has hurling threats of another attack. But the threats have not scared away the investors.
The highest inflow of $50m came from the UAE, while the biggest outflow of $62m went to Britain.
Since Pakistan has not been a popular choice for foreign investors for over a decade, foreign direct investment has stagnated around $2bn every year.
The Indian aggression did not, however, change the scenario.
Pakistan has been trying hard to attract foreign investments and a council has been established to persuade investors with lucrative incentives, but the result has remained insignificant so far.
The July-May period of FY25 saw an inflow of $1.247 billion through T-bills while outflows amounted to $1.447bn during the same period. The big outflow was due to declining returns on T-bills.
Since the State Bank has slashed the interest rate to 11 per cent from 22pc since June last year, the diminishing returns on T-bills has taken the shine off the instrument for investors.
The financial sector believes that overseas Pakistanis were making investment in T-bills as the instrument is secure and risk-free. The government is also borrowing through the stock exchange by selling Sukuk bonds.
The State Bank’s data shows that so far the government has borrowed Rs3.7 trillion from banks despite a hefty profit of Rs2.7tr provided by the State Bank in the beginning of the current financial year.
Borrowing through banks during July-May FY25  was, however, much lower than last year. The government had borrowed Rs7.76tr during the same period of the previous fiscal.

The 11-member Consti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court held a hearing last Friday and adjourned the case until Monday. However, the hearing didn’t take place due to the demise of the mother of Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, a member of the bench. Later, the proceedings were adjourned until further directions.
On Tuesday, the court announced the proceedings would resume on Thursday.
As the hearing was announced through a supplementary cause list, senior counsel Hamid Khan moved an application for adjournment from June 23 to Aug 5.
Mr Khan, who is representing the Sunni Ittehad Council, sought the postponement since he is on a vacation until Aug 5.
Under these circumstances, the application said, the case may be adjourned “in the interest of justice”.
Earlier, it was decided that Salman Akram Raja, who is appearing on behalf of PTI leader Kanwal Shauzab, will conclude his arguments whenever the case resumes. After that, Mr Khan was expected to present his arguments for a day or two.
Now, with the filing of the adjournment application, it is unclear whether the constitutional bench will continue the hearing or postpone it on general adjournment.
The 11-judge bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, also included justices Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.
The bench is hearing nine review petitions moved by the PML-N, PPP, Election Commission of Pakistan and other applicants.

In brief remarks to supporters, Cuomo, 67, who had been seeking a political comeback four years after resigning amid sexual harassment allegations, said he had called Mamdani to congratulate him.
“Tonight is his night,” Cuomo said while conceding the race to Mamdani.
 






Mamdani, who entered the campaign as a virtual unknown, was ahead of Cuomo 43.5 per cent to 36.4pc with nearly 95pc of ballot scanners reporting, according to the city’s elections board. Nine other Democratic candidates trailed far behind.
The outcome will not be final until next week, due to New York’s ranked-choice system that allows citizens to pick up to five candidates in order of preference.
But Mamdani’s lead in Tuesday’s preliminary results appeared too large for Cuomo, or any other candidate, to overcome, particularly since the third-place finisher on Tuesday, City Comptroller Brad Lander, encouraged his supporters to list Mamdani second.
The race was seen as an early read on the direction Democrats believe the party should take five months into Republican President Donald Trump’s tumultuous second term.
Their differences were clear: Cuomo, a moderate backed by the establishment who served a decade as governor, or Mamdani, a progressive newcomer who promised a break with the past.
Mamdani will likely be the favourite in November’s general election in a city where Democrats dominate. The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, will also appear on the November ballot as an independent, but a series of corruption scandals and his perceived ties to Trump have weakened his standing.
The Republican candidate is Curtis Sliwa, a radio host best known as the founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol, who lost to Adams in 2021.
For some voters, Mamdani represented a chance to usher in a new era for the party.
“I think it’s time for somebody young, a person of colour, something different,” Ignacio Tambunting, a 28-year-old actor, told a Reuters reporter outside a polling station in Manhattan after putting Mamdani atop his ballot.
Another voter, Leah Johanson, said she listed Mamdani first even though she was concerned he was too liberal. But she did not rank Cuomo.
“No. God, no,” said Johanson, 39, who voted on Tuesday in Queens, where Mamdani lives. “I’m not gonna vote for a man who is credibly accused of molesting women.”
Cuomo has denied the harassment accusations, which he has characterised as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous.
Self-described democratic socialist
Born in Uganda to a family of Indian descent, Mamdani, who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor, has a history of pro-Palestinian activism.
He was elected to a state assembly seat in New York’s Queens borough and has garnered the support of US Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two prominent progressives.
Cuomo accused Mamdani of lacking the experience required, while Mamdani attacked Cuomo over the harassment allegations.
 
 

Cuomo, who emerged as a vocal critic of Trump during his first term as president, won the endorsements of former President Bill Clinton and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
In ranked voting, the last-place candidate is eliminated after each round, and their votes are redistributed to the second choice marked on the ballots of their supporters. The process is repeated until one candidate achieves 50pc of the total.
Mamdani seems likely to expand his lead when the additional counts are conducted, after he and Lander endorsed one another and urged their supporters to rank the other as their second choice.
Lander, who was the first choice on 11.6pc of ballots counted on Tuesday, made national headlines last week when he was briefly detained while escorting a defendant out of an immigration court.</p><small>2025-06-25 05:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/250947281b17624.jpg?r=094804' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919903/malala-to-invest-in-womens-sports-through-new-initiative' target='_blank'><strong>Malala to invest in women’s sports through new initiative</strong></a><br><p>NOBEL laureate and activist Malala Yousafzai has launched a new initiative to invest in women’s sports around the world.
Recess — launched by Ms Yousafzai and her husband, Asser Malik, on Tuesday — will invest in professional and amateur teams to ensure more women participation in sports.
In an interview with CNN, Ms Yousafzai, who was born in Swat, recalled her school days in Pakistan when women had limited opportunities to participate in sports.
 






“I remember in school recess time when boys would go off to the local cricket playground and girls had to stay behind,” she said.
“From that point onwards, I knew that sports was something that girls did not have easy access to.”
The rights activists said sports is a “powerful way of bringing communities together”.
“We could be competitive, but at the same time, when the game is over, we can hug each other, shake hands, and recognise that we’re all one humanity.”
Ms Yousufzai said female sports lack investment, which deprives women of opportunities to compete.
The couple wants to change this.
“We were looking for an opportunity where we could bring in our expertise, our platform to benefit women’s sports…,” she said.
They have identified the US football league, National Women’s Soccer League and the basketball league, the Women’s National Basketball Association, as two leagues in which they are looking to invest.

Flight operations in the Gulf were affected on Monday due to the regional “war situation,” a spokesman for PIA said.
PIA had suspended flights to Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates on Monday night after Iran attacked American forces at Qatar’s Al-Udeid air base.
However, Qatar reopened its airspace on Tuesday, issuing a NOTAM, enabling flights to resume.
“PIA’s air operations to Gulf countries is moving towards resumption,” a spokesman for the national flag carrier said on Tuesday.
 






After operations resumed, PIA flight PK 245 from Islamabad to Dammam departed at 12:30pm with a 15-hour delay.
Flight PK 743 from Karachi to Madina, diverted on Monday, departed at 1pm with a 14.5-hour delay.
PIA flight PK 713 from Lahore to Madina also departed at 1pm with a seven-hour delay and flight PK 209 from Sialkot to Sharjah departed at 1pm with a 15-hour delay.
Additionally, flights from Multan to Dubai PK 221, Sialkot to Doha PK 251, Karachi to Jeddah PK 761 and Islamabad to Abu Dhabi PK 261 departed for their destinations at 1pm.
“With the departure of these flights, PIA’s air operations to Gulf countries have been restored,” the spokesman said.
However, he noted: “Due to the delayed departure of these flights, returning will also be delayed.”
Passengers are requested to contact PIA’s call centre or website for timely flight information.
“We apologise for the inconvenience caused to passengers; however, the decision to restrict operations last night was taken in accordance with air safety regulations,” the spokesman added.
PAA e-Gates project
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) has concluded the design phase of its e-Gates project for Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore international airports after a series of stakeholder workshops.
A PAA spokesman said the initiative aims “to introduce biometric-based automated border control at major airports to significantly enh­ance passenger facilitation, reduce wait times, and improve security”.
German consultancy M2P Consulting will now develop technical specifications and tender documents to invite proposals from global e-Gate providers.
The project reflects PAA’s vision “to integrate smart technologies into airport operations, ensuring seamless and secure travel experiences,” the spokesman said.

• Rights groups, UN agencies slam US-backed food distribution system; UNRWA calls it ‘abomination’
• UN rights office says weaponisation of food constitutes war crime
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed another 46 people waiting for aid in the Palestinian territory on Tuesday as rights groups and UN agencies slammed the US-backed food distribution system.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that 21 people were killed and around 150 wounded by Israeli fire near an aid point in central Gaza early Tuesday, and that another 25 were killed in a separate incident in south Gaza.
“Every day we face this scenario: martyrs, injuries, in unbearable numbers,” paramedic Ziad Farhat told AFP at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza.
“Hospitals cannot accommodate the number of casualties arriving,” he said.
The latest deaths came as Israel’s opposition leader and the families of Israeli prisoners called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to widen a ceasefire with Iran to include the Palestinian territory.
Pressure also grew on the US- and Israeli-backed privately run aid group Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was brought into the Palestinian territory at the end of May to replace United Nations agencies.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) called the system an “abomination” while a spokesman for the UN human rights office, Thameen Al-Kheetan, condemned the “weaponisation of food” in Gaza.
According to figures issued on Tuesday by the health ministry in the Gaza Strip, at least 516 people have been killed and nearly 3,800 wounded by Israeli fire while seeking rations since late May.
The territory of more than two million people is suffering from famine-like conditions after Israel blocked all supplies from early March to the end of May and continues to impose restrictions, according to human rights groups.
‘Tank shells’
Gaza civil defence spokesman Bassal reported a first deadly shooting “with bullets and tank shells” near the Netzarim corridor in central Gaza where thousands of Palestinians gather each night for rations from a nearby GHF distribution point.
France condemned what it called deadly “Israeli fire” against civilians in a statement from the foreign ministry apparently referring to the Netzarim corridor incident.
Witness Ribhi Al-Qassas told AFP that troops had “opened fire randomly” at a crowd he estimated at 50,000 people.
The second incident took place in south Gaza about two kilometres from another GHF centre in Rafah governorate, Bassal said. “Israeli forces targeted civilian gatherings near Al-Alam and Al-Shakoush areas with bullets and tank shells,” he told AFP.
“The weaponisation of food for civilians, in addition to restricting or preventing their access to life-sustaining services, constitutes a war crime,” Al-Kheetan said in Geneva.
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with GHF over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
In a statement on Saturday, GHF said it was “delivering aid at scale, securely and effectively”, but it acknowledged it “cannot meet the full scale of need while large parts of Gaza remain closed”. GHF has denied responsibility for deaths near its aid points.
On Monday, more than a dozen human rights organisations called on the organisation to cease its operations, warning of possible complicity in war crimes.
Ceasefire calls
After Israel agreed to a ceasefire with Iran on Tuesday after a 12-day war, Netayahu faced renewed calls to agree a ceasefire with Hamas after more than 20 months of war in Gaza.
“And now Gaza. It’s time to finish it there too. Bring back the hostages, end the war,” opposition leader Yair Lapid of the centre-right Yesh Atid party wrote on X.
Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel’s war against Iran was “contributing to the successes in Gaza, but it will still take a bit more time”.
Israel’s retaliatory military campaign since October 2023 has killed at least 56,077 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, according to the Gaza health ministry. The United Nations considers its figures reliable.

The urgent meetings, held in Islamabad, followed directives from the Lahore High Court (LHC) to address flaws in the marital contract that have led to property disputes, particularly affecting women.
Participants requested the official version of the Nikahnama from all provinces to identify any discrepancies and to solicit proposals for streamlining issues concerning matrimonial assets.
However, they were surprised to learn that no official Urdu translation of the Nikahnama could be found, according to sources familiar with the discussions.
“In some areas of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtu­nk­hwa, the Nikahnama is being registered in local languages without any lawful backing,” the source added.
The lack of a standardised Urdu version has led to inconsistencies in translation, which officials say is fuelling a rise in disputes over dower and property rights.
 
 

A separate high-level meeting, chaired by the Federal Law Secretary, also examined issues related to matrimonial assets and sought proposals from stakeholders to streamline the resolution of marital disputes.
The LHC has tasked an eight-member committee with reviewing proposed amendments to Pakistan’s Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, focusing on the contentious Section 10A regarding matrimonial property rights.

Power was fully restored to all three districts at 1am on Tuesday through the 132-KV Pishin-Mand and Polan-Jiwani transmission lines, according to Qesco.
Electricity has now returned across the Makran Division, with regular supply restored to grid stations in Mand, Tump, Turbat, Hoshab, Panjgur, Jiwani, Gwadar Door, Gwadar Deep Sea Port, New Gwadar International Airport, Pasni and Ormara.
The power utility said the electricity was suspended on Sunday at around 2:30pm, plunging the entire Makran Division and districts of Gwadar, Kech and Panjgur, into darkness
“Power suspension caused difficulties for people in 50C temperature which persisted throughout the last week,” a spokesman for Qesco said.
 
 

The company responded by connecting affected grid stations to the national grid to maintain electricity supply during the outage, the spokesman added.

• Party decries ‘miscarriage of justice’ by Lahore High Court
ISLAMABAD: As the Khyber Pakht­unkhwa government passed the budget for the upcoming financial year without the approval of PTI’s patron-in-chief, Imran Khan, his sister Aleema Khan claimed on Tuesday that a “minus Imran” formula was now in effect.
Separately, the party’s Punjab chapter has expressed strong disappointment over the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) decision to deny bail to Imran Khan in the May 9 cases.
Speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail, Aleema said that if KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur lacked the courage to stand his ground, he should have resigned.
The KP chief minister had earlier said that the budget would be discussed with Imran Khan before its passage.
Aleema Khan claimed the authorities had made it routine to deny meetings with her brother but vowed she would not relent and would continue visiting him in line with court orders, which allow family meetings on Tuesdays.
Responding to a question on the budget approval, she said Imran Khan had made it clear that the people of KP had voted for him and he wanted to personally allocate funds to ensure they were used appropriately.
“We are not aware of what is in this budget. They should have waited. Salman Akram Raja had informed us that, according to his information, the budget would be passed on June 27,” she said.
Aleema questioned why the KP government had not waited and discussed the budget with Imran Khan. She said the budget’s passage could have been delayed by two weeks and alleged that the KP government must be hiding something.
When asked why Imran Khan had not issued a strong statement against Israel, she said her brother’s message was for unity. “However, we don’t know what may happen tomorrow; Iran and the US might strike a deal. Those who are polishing boots want Imran Khan to speak out so they can complain (by saying that he is against the interest of Pakistan).”
Aleema added that Imran Khan was fully aware of the Iran-Israel situation and had predicted the conflict would not last long, as talks would inevitably resume due to the prevailing geopolitical situation.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared unaware that the KP Assembly had already passed the budget. Speaking to journalists, he said he believed the budget would be passed after one week but was informed on the spot that it had already been approved.
However, he maintained that if Imran Khan directed it, the KP government and all party legislators would resign immediately.
Reaction to LHC decision
PTI expressed strong disappointment over the LHC’s decision to deny bail to Imran Khan in the May 9 cases.
In a statement, the party said that despite months of proceedings, no credible evidence had been presented in these “politically motivated” cases.
“Today’s ruling amounts to a blatant miscarriage of justice,” the statement read, alleging that “politically controlled” courts continued to deliver verdicts while failing to uphold the principles of justice.
The party claimed that it remained resilient despite enduring extreme repression over the past three years. “We will continue to fight our legal battles in the courts while simultaneously preparing to launch a peaceful protest movement to demand justice,” it said.

This was decided at a meeting of the Kohat divisional jirga presided over by General Officer Commanding of the Army’s 9th Division Maj-Gen Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti.
The handing over of Kurram to army was because the district has witnessed worst sectarian killings in the past.
Held at the Kohat Police Club, the jirga was also attended by chief secretary Shahab Ali Shah, IGP Zulfiqar Hameed, regional police officer Abbas Majeed Marwat, divisional commissioner Syed Mutasim Billah Shah, deputy commissioners, and district police officers of Kohat, Hangu, Orakzai, Karak, Kuram districts, and prominent elders of the Shia and Sunni sects.

Jirga also decides to deploy 10,000 personnel across Kohat division

Provincial law minister Afab Alam Advocate, MNAs Shehryar Afridi, Hameed Hussain, and Yousaf Khan, MPAs Shafi Jan, Aurangzeb Orakzai, and Ali Hadi were also in attendance.
“Our enemy cannot defeat us militarily, but it continues its efforts to weaken us internally,” the chief secretary said, pointing specifically to the involvement of the Indian intelligence agency RAW in fomenting sectarian divisions.
He strongly denounced the use of violence in the name of religion, stating, “When we all share the same faith, there is absolutely no justification for taking up arms against one another,” chief secretary noted.
Regarding the situation in Kurram district, Shahab Shah shared that peace was gradually being restored in the region, and expressed the hope that the main highway would soon be reopened to traffic. He urged locals to expedite the voluntary surrender of illegal arms, warning that failure to do so would result in confiscation by the state.
The chief secretary said sustainable and lasting peace in any region was only possible through the sincerity, hard work, and mutual cooperation of people.
He emphasised the importance of inclusive dialogue and trust-building among all stakeholders to ensure enduring peace.
Shahab Shah said that community leaders were united in their message of solidarity, adding that such sentiments of patriotism must also be inculcated in youth. “We must remind our younger generation that we are all Muslims and brothers; there is no room for division among us,” he said.
Shahab Shah warned of threats aimed at destabilising the country from within.
Expressing optimism for the upcoming holy month, he hoped that, as in the past, both Sunni and Shia communities would observe Muharram with mutual respect and brotherhood.
“God willing, not only Muharram but every coming month will pass peacefully, and our enemies will never succeed in their malicious designs,” he concluded.
The Sunni and Shia elders assured the participants that they would abide by the agreements reached between them to restore calm and avoid fighting in Kurram.
Meanwhile, a control room was established for the monitoring of central mourners’ processions through CCTV cameras in Kohat.
Mohammad Waqas, the tehsil in-charge of the municipal service, while briefing tehsil municipal officer Mohammad Shoeb on Tuesday, said the control room would also provide backup power supply, wireless connectivity, and other technical facilities.
The control room has been set up by TMA.
TALENT HUNT: Lahore Qalandars cricket team announced on Tuesday to launch a talent hunt in the Kohat division from July.
Rana Atif, chief executive officer and owner of Lahore Qalandars, visited the new cricket ground prepared by the army at the regional sports complex, where he along with players inspected the preparations for organising the talent hunt programme.
He visited the district on the special invitation of regional sports officer.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari calls on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Hours after a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, brokered by US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Tues­day reiterated Paki­stan’s unwavering support for Iran at all diplomatic for­ums, including the United Nations.
Welcoming the ceasefire, the Foreign Office also pledged to support all efforts to bring peace and stability in the region, in line with the principles of the UN Charter.

During the meeting with Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Pakistan, Ambassador Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, the prime minister assured that Pakistan would continue to work closely with Saudi Arabia for peace in the region through dialogue and diplomacy.
In the meeting with Ambassador of Qatar Ali Mubarak Ali Essa Al-Khater, the prime minister expressed solidarity with Qatar’s emir and the people following Monday night’s attacks on a US military base. “We pray for the safety and security of our Qatari brothers and sisters, and the entire region,” he added.

The Qatari ambassador thanked the prime minister for immediately reaching out to him after this “most unfortunate development” as well as for the expression of solidarity at that critical time.
Meanwhile, Ambassador of China to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong on Tuesday lauded the proactive and positive role being played by Pakistan at every diplomatic forum, including at the United Nations Security Council, for a peaceful settlement of the regional security situation through dialogue and diplomacy.

Both leaders also exchanged views on the Middle East crisis and agreed on the need for de-escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the crown prince thanked PM Shehbaz for the telephone call and appreciated Pakistan’s expression of solidarity and support for the Kingdom.

While exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka recorded notable growth — buoyed in part by changing political dynamics in the region — the overall trade gap continued to expand due to surging imports, particularly from China, India and Bangladesh.
The most concerning trend for policymakers remains the sustained decline in exports to China, Pakistan’s largest trading partner in the region, despite imports from the country surging. This has further deepened the bilateral trade imbalance, with similar patterns observed in trade with India and Bangladesh.
In FY24, Pakistan’s trade deficit with these nine neighbours stood at $9.506bn, reflecting a 49pc increase from $6.382bn in FY23.

Surge in imports from China, India deepens regional trade imbalance

According to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan, exports to the region in July-May FY25 edged up 0.98pc to $4.085bn from $4.045bn in the same period last year. In contrast, imports jumped 22.52pc to $15.255bn from $12.451bn a year ago.
A deeper analysis reveals that imports from China surged 22.59pc to $14.890bn in July-May FY25 from $12.146bn. In FY24, imports from China had already risen 39.78pc to $13.506bn from $9.662bn the previous year. China accounts for the bulk of Pakistan’s regional imports, followed by India and Bangladesh.
 
 

Exports to China, however, fell 11.18pc to $2.270bn in the first 11 months of FY25, down from $2.556bn in the same period last year.
Imports from India rose 11.82pc to $211.42m during July-May FY25, compared to $189.07m a year earlier. In FY24, these imports totalled $206.89m, up from $190.04m in FY23. Meanwhile, exports to India remained negligible at $0.51m in 11MFY25, compared to $3.43m last year. In FY24, Pakistan’s exports to India stood at $3.669m, having risen sharply from $0.329m in the preceding year.
Exports to Afghanistan grew significantly by 41.39pc to $723.44m, up from $511.63m in the previous year. Imports from Afghanistan also increased sharply by 142pc to $24.72m from $10.18m. Pakistan’s main export to Afghanistan during FY25 was sugar, with over 700,000 tonnes exported over the past four months alone.
Exports to Bangladesh rose by 21.45pc to $728.31m from $599.65m. Imports from Bangladesh climbed 41.95pc to $73.55m from $51.67m. This boost in trade followed political upheaval in Dhaka and the resumption of rice exports to Bangladesh. Exports to Sri Lanka declined slightly by 3.02pc to $352.37m, compared to $363.36m last year. The drop was attributed to recessionary pressures in Sri Lanka. Imports from the island nation remained unchanged at $54m.

PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan.

• PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan asks whether decision had cabinet nod  • Demands parliament be briefed on Trump-COAS meeting
• Sibghatullah criticises Trump’s role in Israel’s war on Palestine  • NA approves demands for grants of Rs51.6tr for various ministries
ISLAMABAD: Opposition lawm­akers on Tuesday strongly condemned the government’s decision to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, demanding an explanation for the controversial move.
The government recently posted on X that Mr Trump deserved the award “in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership during the recent India-Pakistan crisis”.
 






Opposition members questioned the basis of the nomination and sought clarification on what led to such a decision.
Meanwhile, in a significant development towards the passage of the upcoming fiscal year’s budget, the National Assembly approved 108 demands for grants for various ministries and divisions, amounting to over Rs51.6 trillion. The government rejected all 405 cut motions moved by opposition lawmakers, clearing a path for the passage of the budget.
The National Assembly also approved 29 demands, totalling over Rs81.75 billion, for the Cabinet Division for the upcoming fiscal year, dismissing 112 cut motions from the opposition.
During the debate on the cut motions, opposition lawmakers raised the issue of the US president’s Nobel nomination.
PTI leader Ali Muhammad Khan asked if the decision had been approved by the cabinet. Referring to the recent meeting between Mr Trump and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, he said the cabinet and parliament should be briefed on what was discussed during that meeting.
Mr Khan also took the opportunity to clarify the issue of Taliban resettlement in Pakistan, which had been the subject of much controversy. He denied the notion that the repatriation was ordered by Imran Khan during PTI’s tenure, explaining that the matter had been discussed in a 2021 cabinet meeting attended by key federal ministers, and the then army chief and ISI director-general.
He asserted that the proposal was opposed by cabinet members and no decision had been made before the “regime change”, following which Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari became the prime minister and foreign minister, respectively.
Sahibzada Sibghat Ullah also demanded that the people of Pakistan want to know if the decision to nominate Mr Trump for Nobel Peace Prize had been taken by the cabinet or an individual. He questioned the rationale behind the nomination, insisting that Israel devastated Palestine “at the behest of Donald Trump” and also attacked Iran.
Jamshed Dasti also raised the issue, asking if the government had any shame in nominating Mr Trump for the peace prize.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif briefly attended the session but left during Mr Dasti’s speech.
‘Bloated cabinet’
Aliya Kamran of JUI-F pointed out that under Article 92(1) of the Constitution, the number of cabinet members cannot exceed 11 per cent of the total strength of parliament, meaning the limit should be 48 members.
However, she noted that the current cabinet had over 80 members, which she said violated the spirit of the 18th Amendment. She called for a reduction in the cabinet’s size and suggested that the savings should be directed towards public welfare.
Ms Kamran also claimed that the Special Investment Facilitation Council and the Board of Investment were doing overlapping job and funds were being allocated to both. “This anomaly should be removed,” she stressed.
 
 

Winding up the discussion on the cut motions for the Ministry of Commerce, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan said the government planned to increase exports to $60bn over the next four years, nearly doubling the current $30.3bn.
He said the government was introducing the Strategic Trade Policy Framework (STPF) 2024-30 to boost exports. “We identified challenges in each sector, proposed legal and institutional reforms and created a clear roadmap,” he said.
Mr Khan also emphasised the importance of agro-food and food technology exports, saying the government was incorporating food tech into export policies to meet global market demands.
Energy sector
Responding to the opposition’s criticism of the energy sector, Minister for Power Awais Leghari defended the government’s energy policies, claiming that the current administration had reduced electricity prices for 20 million of the 30 million metered consumers. He said that tariffs for consumers using up to 200 units had been reduced by 58pc.
Mr Leghari criticised the previous PTI-led government’s energy deals, particularly those with independent power producers (IPPs). “We have reversed plans that would have burdened consumers with Rs4,500 billion over the next six to seven years,” he claimed.
He also pointed out that losses in power distribution companies (Discos) had decreased by Rs180bn within 11 months under the current administration.
About circular debt, Mr Leghari said the government had developed a six-year plan to eliminate the Rs1.26tr debt and that Rs110bn in overbilling had been refunded to consumers. He also vowed to rationalise the net metering system.

• Salman Akram Raja ‘blindsided’; Saif claims Imran okayed budget from Adiala
PESHAWAR: The midnight passage of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa budget has exposed deep divisions within the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur claiming that any delay could have paved the way for the imposition of governor’s rule in the province.
The KP Assembly approved the budget around midnight on Monday, bulldozing cut motions on demands for grants, prompting opposition lawmakers to boycott the proceedings.
On Tuesday, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja expressed his surprise at the move. “Passing of the KP budget yesterday has come as a complete surprise to me. On June 22, the Political Committee of the PTI endorsed the decision of the KP parliamentary party to pass the budget, if no meeting with (Imran) Khan Sb is allowed, by the latest date possible to prevent financial chaos,” he wrote on X.
 






Mr Raja said that a meeting with Mr Khan was scheduled on Monday. “The outcome of this meeting and further possible meetings before the 30th should have been awaited before the passing of the KP budget,” he said.
Former KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra said in a X post that the party needed to put its house in order, adding that the mishandling of the issue had harmed both the party and Imran Khan.
 






“The political committee meeting was called at the last minute, and on Iran. Many of us weren’t able to attend it, including me, and were even surprised that the budget was put up for discussion. Many individuals I heard from later told me they were blindsided by the discussion,” he said.
Mr Jhagra noted that the budget was presented as late as June 18 and that KP was the only government so far to have passed its budget, while Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan and the federal governments were yet to do so.
“The passage of the budget could easily have been extended till the 26th and 27th, and space made to get instructions from Imran Khan today,” he said, adding that the budget needed to be passed before June 30 to prevent the federal government from having an excuse to impose an emergency.
‘Minus-one campaign’
On the other hand, KP Chief Minister Gandapur, in a video message posted on social media, accused unnamed people of conspiring to weaken Imran Khan and his agenda.
He said there was a conspiracy to impose governor’s rule in the province in case of the non-passage of the budget. He alleged that some party members also became part of this plan and ran a “minus one” campaign. “Those people are supporting someone else’s agenda,” Mr Gandapur said.
He said the provincial government had the authority to incorporate the party founder’s direction into the budget. However, he said that the budget must be passed according to a schedule.
He said Imran Khan had made it clear on Monday that he was okay with the provincial government’s decision to pass the budget.
KP government spokesperson Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, who met the party’s incarcerated founder in Adiala Jail on Monday, said in a statement that they discussed the provincial budget and other issues in detail.
Barrister Saif said he informed Imran Khan about the legal and constitutional issues related to the budget. He stated that failing to pass the budget on schedule would have resulted in a serious legal and constitutional crisis, leading to the non-payment of salaries and other government expenditures.
He claimed Imran Khan had consented to the budget’s passage and that following further discussions with the chief minister and finance adviser, amendments could still be made. However, he alleged that these officials were not being allowed to meet Mr Khan.
In a jibe directed at Barrister Saif, Mr Jhagra posted on social media: “On a lighter note, everyone should go to Adiala with a Barrister Saif mask on. Maybe that will help.”
A KP cabinet member told Dawn that although the budget had to be passed on Monday as per the official schedule, the Assembly secretariat’s agenda indicated that voting on demands for grants and consideration of Finance Bill amendments was scheduled for Tuesday.
