Addressing a press conference on Sunday in Hyderabad, Rizvi said that MQM chairman Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui had also written a letter to the prime minister to seek the formation of an inquiry commission under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act 2017.
“This commission must comprise representatives from FIA, IB, ISI, MI, NDMA and other federal bodies to find whether it is an act of subversion or an incident of fire”.
He lambasted the Sindh government and Karachi administration for throwing debris of the fire, which also included remains of the deceased, at the Meva Shah ground, saying it would “compromise forensic investigation of the tragedy”.
“It looks like evidence is being stolen, although the crime scene’s sanctity should be protected and preserved under international standards.”
“This debris includes remains of the deceased. Those were not bones and limbs of cats and dogs. They all were humans”, Rizvi said.
“Gul Plaza is a crime scene which needs to be preserved and kept intact till the inquiry is completed”, he said, adding it was not done yet. “If I use the least possible terms, then I will say that Karachi administration and the Sindh government are accused of serious criminal negligence in this case.”
Rizvi said that to make matters worse, the Sindh government had been a judge of its own cause. “You are accused in this case. You face charges of this tragedy, yet you are holding investigations yourselves. You should have asked the federal government to come clean on it and let there be a federal probe”, he maintained.
However, MQM-P leader said, it was interesting that while the government faces the charges, it would become a complainant too in the matter and then give its own verdict. “The government itself is registering FIR. Why is there so much haste in registering a first information report (FIR)? And why the debris is dumped at the Meva Shah graveyard when it includes remains of deceased”, he wondered.
“When we raise a question, you find it politicking”
He asked the government whether it could identify 83 bodies using DNA samples.
“You are not even able to perform DNA tests and seek the help of the Punjab government”, he said.
Rizvi said it was quite disappointing to say that while e-challan could be issued for not using a seat belt in Karachi, the city lacked an effective firefighting system.
He said that Karachi was not “a colony of the Sindh government”.
Former MNA said even before the Jan 17 tragedy, MQM had launched its ‘Karachi bachao’ campaign and urged people to share their civic amenities-related and other problems in their short videos, which would be channelised by MQM accordingly so that people would know the PPP government’s “achievements” in Karachi even after receiving billions under the new NFC in the last 15 years.
“Nobody knows where this huge amount is spent”, he claimed and sarcastically said that Karachi used to be Sindh’s capital, but now this ‘capital’ had been shifted to Dubai. “Everything is being invested in Dubai now.”
He questioned the PPP government’s performance, especially in the backdrop of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s long presentation to diplomats in Islamabad.
“One must understand that PPP capitalises on the Gambat hospital, SIUT (Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation) Karachi and the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD).”
MQM-P leader said people know that NICVD had been a federal institution and was performing well even then, and likewise, SIUT was a product of Dr Syed Adeebul Hassan Rizvi.
“MQM will launch the Sindh Bachao campaign, which will start from Hyderabad today (Sunday).”
‘28th Amendment’
Former MNA said MQM was actively working with the federal government over the 28th amendment in order to ensure inclusion of implementation clauses of Article 140-A in the Constitution.
He said that this was agreed upon at the time of the 26th and 27th amendment but PPP blocked it.
“MQM is demanding formation of fully empowered local governments for the entire Sindh, but PPP doesn’t want it as it believes in colonial era local government bodies and that’s why PPP and MQM were poles apart on this issue”, he told a questioner.
Raizvi said MQM believed in participatory democracy, whereas PPP’s democracy revolves around provincial and federal governments alone.</p><small>2026-01-25 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/25201854b6f2655.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968996/death-toll-from-karachis-gul-plaza-fire-rises-to-73-23-identified-so-far' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from Karachi’s Gul Plaza fire rises to 73; 23 identified so far</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The number of lives lost in the tragic Gul Plaza fire rose yet again on Sunday as two more bodies were recovered from the rubble, taking the death toll to 73.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to Dawn that the death toll has increased to 73.
She added that so far, 23 deceased individuals have been identified, including 16 through DNA matching, six through facial identification and one because of their CNIC.
Dr Syed stated that all DNA tests were being conducted at the Sindh Forensic DNA and Serology Lab at the University of Karachi.
She shared a list of those identified so far:

Kashif, son of Younus
Aamir, son of Sulaiman
Faraz, son of Anas
Farooq, son of Anwar
Furqan, son of Shoukat
Mohammad Ali, son of Haji Habib
Tanveer, son of Abdul Kaleem
Mohammad Sharoz, son of Muhammad Iqbal
Mohammad Athar, son of Shoukat Ali
Sarfaraz, son of Noor Muhammad
Mohammad Hanif, son of Abdul Ghani
Misbah, daughter of Irfan
Kausar Parveen, wife of Irfan
Mohammad Saad, son of Muhammad Irfan
Mohammad Ramzan, son of Muhammad Ali
Mohammad Usman, son of Gul Faraz Khan

Marium Wafa, daughter of Noor Ahmed
Mohammad Arif, son of Muhammad Rafiq
Mohammad Shees, son of Muhammad Haroon
Churchill, son of Nadeem Masih
Mohammad Rafiq, son of Anwar Ali
Abdul Haseeb, son of Abdul Waheed

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has so far claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Over a week later, efforts to scour through the debris for the remains of the dead are still underway.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal Shaikh told Dawn that the search operation was in the final phase and would likely be completed on Sunday night.
He pointed out that five per cent of the basement was yet to be searched, which was under debris.
The Rescue 1122 COO said that the operation was halted briefly as the district administration arranged a visit from forensic experts, who collected samples.
The search efforts were resumed when the experts left the premises.

 

In a first information report (FIR) of the incident, dated January 23, the Karachi police said the fire was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”.
The case was registered against unknown persons as the police have not nominated anyone in the case.



Funerals held in Karachi, Sukkur
On Sunday afternoon, the funeral prayers of four individuals of a family — out of six who had come to Gul Plaza for shopping when the fire erupted — were offered at Eidgah Ground in Delhi Colony.
Saad, Kausar, Mariam and Misbah were among those identified, while two remained missing.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Dr Farooq Sattar, Jamaat-i-Islami’s Monem Zafar and PPP’s Syed Najmi Alam were among several politicians who attended the prayers.







Separately, the funeral prayer of one of the victims, Shees, was held near Kashti Chowk in the Garden area. It was also attended by residents and political leaders.
Meanwhile, Sukkur Mayor Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh attended the funeral of Mohammad Athar, a resident of Sukkur who lost his life in the incident.
According to the state-run APP, Athar, a father of two sons and two daughters, had gone to Gul Plaza to purchase necessary items for arranging Taraweeh prayers during Ramazan.
The Sukkur mayor announced that a special fund has been established to support the bereaved family, providing them with financial assistance.
‘I just want the body of my child’
Speaking to the media, grieving families recalled details of their near and dear ones still missing.
Among them was the mother of Imran Ibrahim, a married man who resided in Lyari’s Naya Abad area.
“I am coming to Gul Plaza daily, but being pushed away. I don’t want anything, I just want the body of my child,” said the grieving mother.
She said her son had been working at a crockery shop for the last three years.
Recalling events of the incident, the mother said she spoke to her son at around 10pm, who said he was working overtime and would return home at 2am.
She said all family members were asleep, assuming that her son might have returned, but they came to know in the morning that a huge fire had erupted at Gul Plaza.
The mother lamented that she is asked to go home when she visits Civil Hospital Karachi, and no one informs her about her, so when she comes to Gul Plaza.



Meanwhile, the father of another missing man, namely Hafiz Arif, told the media that he and family members have been visiting Gul Plaza for the last nine days, but no one has responded to their plight.
The father, a resident of Godhra Colony in the New Karachi area, wondered what steps the government was taking.
Sharing harrowing details of his son’s last call to him and his mother, the aggrieved father said Arif was uttering words, “Please Abu, Ami, (father, mother) save my life, as I cannot comprehend anything.”
The father recalled that they asked their son to recite the Kalma (declaration of faith).
He added that when they reached Gul Plaza on the night of January 17, they saw that fire had spread throughout the entire building.
“We would leave the place if any sign of our son was given, even remains,” said the grieving father.
Arif was the father of two children, including a 20-day-old son.
Governor visits bereaved family
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori also paid a visit to the bereaved family of Aftab, where he announced that he would sponsor the education for all four of his children.
Tessori further said that Khizar Tahneel, a builder who was accompanying him, had announced a plot for the family of each deceased person.
“It has been seven days today, but his brother’s body has not been found,” the governor said, referring to Aftab.
Addressing the Sindh government, he said, “You are having them make rounds to get the DNA report from so and so place, and the death certificate from so and so department. [Instead,] make a counter there.”
He urged the administration to deliver such documents at the doorsteps of the affected families.

 

Tessori raised questions about why the bodies were “not being recovered” and why DNA reports and death certificates were “not being issued”.
“Do we have the power or administration? Give it to us, then see how the city shines,” he said.
The governor wondered why the closed doors of Gul Plaza were not broken, noting that machinery was available to “demolish buildings” when needed.
Tessori calls for judicial commission
Tessori called for a judicial commission comprising Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, MPAs and others.
“If he is not at fault, I will hug the mayor,” he quipped.
“I am not saying anyone deliberately sparked the fire. I am only saying that fix responsibility for whose mistake or incapability it was, or who was inadequately equipped, and take them to justice.”



The MQM-P leader assailed the PPP-led Sindh government for terming questions and concerns raised over the fire as “politics”.
“Their aim is not to talk about it, as if what has happened has happened, leave it behind and wait for the next incident. And then again they will say ‘do not do politics on it’,” Tessori said.
He remarked, “Your statements reflect pride. Your statements show power, that no one can do anything to us.”
The governor also denied he had a protocol accompanying him when he visited Gul Plaza after finding out about the fire. “Be afraid of that day when I will bring out the suitcases filled with evidence,” he said.
Separately, speaking at the convocation of a seminary on late Saturday night, Tessori announced the launch of a free fire-safety training programme at the Governor’s House.
He said all associations and market organisations may contact the Governor’s House to benefit from this initiative.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/25222522272bf4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969009/kp-cms-aide-insists-tirah-military-operation-was-being-imposed-by-federal-govt' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM’s aide insists Tirah military operation was being ‘imposed’ by federal govt</strong></a><br><p>Shafi Jan, the special aide to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister for information, on Sunday doubled down on the stance that the federal government had planned a military operation in Tirah, contrary to the latter’s recent clarification that the relocation was “voluntary”.
The PTI-led KP government has repeatedly opposed military operations in the province, an issue that has created friction between the party, the centre and the establishment, with the latter accusing PTI of providing sanctuary to militants.
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan with Shehzad Iqbal, Jan said the 24-member Jirga, which agreed on the displacement from Tirah before the operation, was “forced” to sign.
When asked about Khyber district’s deputy commissioner’s (DC) signatures, he said the DC signed the deal just to facilitate the people, because the government “knew that the people would be evacuated”.
“KP’s cabinet approved Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah, because we knew that they were going to be displaced.”
Jan insisted that the operation was permitted by the Inspector-General Frontier Crops, Core Commander and KP’s Chief Secretary, saying that “Chief Secretary is the representative of the federal government.”
Referring to the federal government’s statement that the displacement of people from Tirah was based solely on rumours, he said there were no routine intelligence-based operations in the area, but rather a large-scale military operation that was “imposed”.
“We will never be part of this military operation; neither do we support it, nor have we been taken into confidence,” he said.
He criticised that, “They [government] don’t want to curb terrorism, people have doubts about their intentions.”
“They wanted to damage KP CM Sohail Afridi’s political esteem.”
Jan further alleged that, “It is a war of narrative,” saying, “They are trying to build a new narrative.”
He reiterated that KP CM would call a Jirga on Sunday, and people would testify by themselves.
He claimed that the federal government had offered Rs17 billion for internally displaced persons, and the provincial government received this amount for three years; however, for the past three years, the KP government has received nothing.
“There are 17,000 families in total, and 12,000 of them have been registered.”
“The snowfall has made the relocation really difficult,” he said.
He further mentioned that the federal government was now running from its own narrative.
“We will call the Pashtun jirga and reveal all the facts.”
‘No large-scale military operation in Tirah’
Speaking on the same platform, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal denied any large-scale military operation in Tirah, saying, “people are relocating due to the deteriorating law and order situation, which was a provincial government’s failure.”
He recalled the federal government’s statement that was only routine intelligence-based operations in Tirah to target the terrorists’ pockets.
“The PTI government is not paying attention to ensure law and order in the province,” he said. “Law and order is a provincial subject.”
He recalled that back in 2018, the federal government had terminated terrorism from KP; however, “PTI allowed terrorists to return and get settled there.”
Iqbal blamed the PTI government for shielding Fitna Al Khawarij, the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“PTI wants to give a free hand to terrorists in KP,” he said.
The planning minister said that PTI had to choose between the terrorists and Pakistan and that the party was “trying to create a rift between the state and the people.”</p><small>2026-01-25 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/252224078e0e1ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969007/bannu-peace-committee-member-killed-cousin-injured-in-targeted-attack-near-afghan-refugee-camp' target='_blank'><strong>Bannu peace committee member killed, cousin injured in targeted attack near Afghan refugee camp</strong></a><br><p>A peace committee member in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district was shot dead in a targeted killing near an Afghan refugee camp, while his cousin sustained serious injuries, the police said on Sunday.
“The incident took place at the Afghan Refugees Camp in Domel tehsil, and the victims have been identified as Khwajatullah and Naseemullah,” the police said.
“Both belonged to Gangi Khel.”
The statement added that the incident occurred when Khwajatullah and Naseemullah were at a shop in Tehsil Colony to purchase groceries.
“At that moment, two unidentified armed men arrived and opened indiscriminate fire on them,” it read.
“As a result of the firing, Khwajatullah died on the spot, while Naseemullah was injured. The injured person was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where he is currently under medical treatment.”
In his statement to Domel Police, Naseemullah stated that the attack was sudden and that they had no personal enmity or dispute with anyone.
District Police Officer Yasir Afridi said, “Investigations are underway, and all possible angles are being examined to ascertain the motives behind the incident.”
Separately, police neutralised explosive material planted by unknown terrorists on Eidgah Road in Domel.
According to a police official, the highly dangerous explosives weighed between three and four kilogrammes and were fitted with a remote-controlled device.
“Thanks to the professional expertise and prompt response of the Bomb Disposal Squad, the area was saved from a major tragedy,” he said.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
Armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee on January 13, police confirmed.
Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/25235156f87690f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969012/indonesia-resumes-search-for-80-after-landslide-kills-10-in-west-java' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia resumes search for 80 after landslide kills 10 in West Java</strong></a><br><p>Indonesian authorities resumed search-and-rescue efforts for 80 people missing after a landslide killed 10 in a residential area of West Java province.
The landslide early on Saturday was triggered by heavy rains starting the day before, which the weather agency warned could continue for a week in the province and several other regions.
Resident Dedi Kurniawan, 36, said it was the first big landslide he had witnessed in Pasir Langu village in a hilly area of the province about 100 km (60 miles) southeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
“Sometimes we have only small floods from the nearest river, but this time (the landslide) came from the forest,” he told Reuters.
Rescuers were hampered on Saturday as unstable terrain and rain hindered them from deploying heavy machinery, Kompas TV reported, citing authorities.
There were multiple reports of floods in West Java, including Jakarta. The floods have caused residents in heavily impacted areas to evacuate to higher ground or unaffected places.
The landslide occurred two months after cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra killed 1,200 people, destroyed homes and displaced over a million residents.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2510234104e7354.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968991/armed-forces-federal-govt-have-not-issued-any-orders-for-depopulation-of-tirah-information-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Armed forces, federal govt have not issued any orders for ‘depopulation’ of Tirah: information ministry</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Information has said that neither the armed forces nor the federal government has issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, where residents have been vacating their houses amid concerns about a planned military operation against militants.
“The government has taken notice of misleading claims in circulation regarding alleged ‘depopulation’ from Tirah Valley on the orders of the army.
“These assertions are baseless, malicious, and driven by ulterior motives aimed at creating alarm among the public. No directive has been issued for the depopulation of Tirah by the federal government and the armed forces,” a post on the ministry’s X account said on Sunday.







The ministry further maintained in its statement that law enforcement agencies had been routinely conducting “targeted, intelligence-based operations, strictly against terrorist elements, with full care to avoid disruption to civilian life, for which no migration is needed or being undertaken”.
“It may be noted that the local population is increasingly concerned over the presence of khawarij (a term that the state uses for terrorists) and desire peace and stability in Tirah,” the ministry said.
It recalled that the KP government’s Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Department had issued a notification for the release of funds — reportedly Rs4 billion — on December 26, 2025.
The ministry said the purpose for the release of the funds was stated to be the “anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh)”. Moreover, the ministry continued, the provincial department had also “requested the facilitation of advance preparedness and relief-related arrangements, including transportation, food support, cash assistance, and establishment and management of transit and registration points”.
It further quoted the notification as stating that “the deputy commissioner, Khyber (where Tirah is located), has further conveyed that the proposed voluntary movement reflects the views and preferences of the local population, articulated through a representative jirga convened at the district level, taking into account seasonal, logistical and contextual considerations, as well as a on-camp based modality”.
“Hence, any stated position of the provincial government or their officials being conveyed to the media that the said migration has anything to do with the armed forces is false and fabricated, given with mala fide intent to gain political capital and, unfortunately, malign security institutions and, therefore, highly regrettable,” the ministry’s statement said.
While the ministry’s statement does not specifically refer to any statement by the KP government or its officials in particular, it comes against the backdrop of the PTI-led provincial government distancing itself from the developments in Tirah.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also reiterated the clarification while speaking to reporters in Kot Momin later in the day.
He asserted that people “relocate voluntarily” every year when the winter weather gets harsh.
Stressing that any operations conducted are intelligence-based and “area-specific”, Tarar said, “Those elements giving the impression that it is a forced evacuation are giving a wrong impression and spreading misinformation.”
Asked about the objections raised by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, Tarar advised him to “pay attention to the public’s issues”.
“Establish Safe City [project], CTD force and forensic labs, make people’s lives easier, improve law and order, counter terrorism,” the minister said. “Put all resources to use is my advice to him.”
PTI reacts
KP CM Afridi has repeatedly voiced his opposition to military operations, objecting to “decisions taken behind closed doors”.
He particularly mentioned Tirah in a post on social media platform X on January 15, alleging that the decision of “operation in Tirah and forced displacement of people was taken behind closed doors”.
The CM further alleged that “terrorism has been foisted on us” and “people are being forcibly displaced due to a military operation, the decision for which was taken behind closed doors”.
Following today’s statement by the Ministry of Information, he said it would lead to “conflict between the provincial government and institutions and the Centre”.
Addressing a rally in KP’s Barikot, he said, “Whatever little trust among ourselves is no more. It is my order that from now onwards, I direct my government that from now onwards, all our correspondence with any institution or the federal government will be in writing and its evidence [will be kept]” so that they don’t walk back.
“They impose decisions taken behind closed doors and walk back when the damage is done.
“They issued a notification [sic] that the people of Tirah are relocating voluntarily. So, I now announce that coming Sunday, I will call a jirga of the Afridis and ask them whether they left willingly or were expelled.
“And if it emerges that the [ministry’s statement] is a lie, I will personally take my people back to Tirah,” he said.
“If this statement is not withdrawn or an apology is not issued within the next two days, I will call a jirga of the Afridis followed by one of the Pakhtuns,” he added.
Separately, the PTI’s KP chapter posted on X that the federal government’s assertion that people had been relocating from Tirah voluntarily was “ridiculous”.
“Who would leave their home willingly while taking into account the weather conditions, extreme cold and snowfall?” the party questioned.
It said that “security and government officials had asked for holding a jirga of tribal elders, which decided that people should relocate to prevent collateral damage during an operation by security forces”.
“Some people left willingly, and those who stayed back were expelled forcefully,” the party alleged.
Displacement from Tirah
Tribal elders from the restive valley had agreed to the vacation of houses by its residents from January 10. The agreement was reached on December 20, 2025 after weeks of talks with security and administration officials.
Sources in a 24-member jirga that negotiated the agreement regarding displacement with the district administration had told Dawn at the time that all residents would vacate the Tirah valley by January 25, 2026, paving the way for the military operation against all proscribed terrorist groups currently holed up in the valley.
The federal government’s clarification today comes on the same day as the reported deadline of January 25 for evacuation.
Earlier this week, the Khyber district administration had suspended the evacuation process in view of the heavy snowfall, asking families to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather. Meanwhile, heavy snowfall and a snowstorm had left scores of displaced families stranded on the road, following which a rescue operation was launched.

As snow, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures swept into the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday, the number of power outages continued to rise. As of 10:47am EST (8:47pm PKT) on Sunday, more than 850,000 US customers were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us, with at least 290,000 in Tennessee and over 100,000 each in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana. Other states affected included Kentucky, Georgia, Virginia and Alabama.
More than 10,200 US flights scheduled for Sunday were cancelled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Over 4,000 flights were cancelled on Saturday.
Washington, DC’s Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had cancelled all flights at the airport on Sunday.
Delta Air Lines on Sunday said that it intended to operate on a reduced schedule “subject to real-time frozen precipitation and afternoon storm conditions.”
The airline had adjusted its schedule on Saturday, with additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City, and said it would move experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.
The National Weather Service’s latest forecast for Sunday through Monday morning calls for heavy snow from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast, including up to 18 inches in New England. Much of the Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic are expected to get rain and freezing rain.
Forecasters predicted “bitterly cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills” from the southern plains to the Northeast in the wake of the storm, bringing “prolonged hazardous travel and infrastructure impacts.”
Federal, State govts declare emergencies
Calling the storms “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.
“We will continue to monitor and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.
Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security said.
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, at a news conference on Saturday, warned Americans to take precautions.
“It’s going to be very, very cold,” Noem said. “So we’d encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together.”
The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorising the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centres and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.
On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorise grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.
US electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts.
Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centres in the world, said if its ice forecast held, the winter event could be among the largest to affect the company.

On January 11, as the cold wave gripped the province, the education minister announced to revise school opening timings for two weeks, ending today (Sunday). The schools were directed to open at 9am instead of the earlier timings.



According to a notification, “The timings for all public and private educational institutions under the administrative control of the School Education and Literacy Department shall continue till February 4.”
As per the directives, the schools across Sindh will continue to open at 9am till the 4th of next month.
Last week, the Education Deparment had issued warning letters to several schools for “completely ignoring” the government’s directives regarding the new school timings.
An Education Department official also warned that all private schools were obliged to follow the directives.
Meanwhile, the school’s administration and parents were seen in disarray over the revised timings due to the protracted school hours and routine adjustments.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647147-interpol-clears-shahzad-akbar-in-190m-al-qadir-trust-case' target='_blank'><strong>Interpol clears Shahzad Akbar in £190m Al-Qadir Trust case</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, the Met Office said that in the next couple of days, “heavy snowfall may cause road closure/slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galliyat, Neelum valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Nushki, Harnai and Zhob.”
It further cautioned that there was a “possibility of landslides/avalanches in hilly areas of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir” during the period.
The PMD advised tourists to “remain extra cautious and avoid unnecessary travel during the next two days.”
Heavy snowfall, avalanches and landslides have brought life to a standstill across KP, Balochistan, GB and Azad Kashmir (AJK), blocking roads, stranding travellers and disrupting electricity and relief operations amid freezing temperatures.
On Friday, at least nine members of a family were killed when a snow avalanche buried their house in Chitral.
’Cold winds likely in most parts of country’
According to the Met Office, “The western system is likely to affect southwestern Balochistan from tonight (Sunday) and grip the western and upper parts of the country from Monday.”
Setting off today, “mainly cold and dry weather” was expected in most parts of the country, while “very cold and partly cloudy” in upper KP, AJK and GB, the Met office added.
“Cold winds are also likely in most parts of the country,” it said. “However, partly cloudy weather with rain-wind/thunderstorm and snowfall is likely in southwestern Balochistan.”
For tomorrow, it also forecasted cloudy weather with intermittent rains, thunderstorms, and snowfall in KP, Kashmir, GB, Balochistan and upper Punjab. “Heavy falls with moderate to intense snowfall” were likely to hit hilly areas, the PMD added.
Furthermore, rains and thunderstorm was also likely in South Punjab and upper Sindh on Monday, the Met Office said.
Roads blocked, power disrupted in Shangla after snow
Meanwhile, life in KP’s Shangla has been at a standstill for the fourth consecutive day as most key and link roads have been blocked to traffic, and power supply has been disrupted across the district.

Upper parts of the district had received up to four feet of snow in the recent spell of snowfall, which was termed the heaviest snowfall in 13 years by residents.
The snowfall caused road blockades and suspension of power supply, paralysing the local routine life.
Residents say that most major and link roads, including the Bisham-Swat and Alpuri-Puran roads, have been closed to all types of traffic for the fourth day since the snow blanketed the area.
Local Jamaat-i-Islami leader Dayan Ghafar told Dawn that life has been “completely disrupted” in the Puran tehsil as all entry and exit routes of the district remained blocked due to heavy snowfall.
He further said power supply poles and transformers had collapsed in more than 20 places alone in the Puran tehsil.

Mazhar Ali, a resident of Lilownai village, told Dawn that their link road has been closed for all sorts of traffic, confining them to their houses.
He said the KP Communication and Works Department had started work on snow removal, but they were taking time because there was massive snow on the roads and limited machinery was available withthe district administration.
Meanwhile, the Chakesar Tehsil administration said in its statement that four roads had been cleared for traffic on Sunday and work on others continued.
However, the residents of Shangla demanded that the elected representatives — including MNA Amir Muqam, his son Senator Niaz Ahmad Khan, and his brother, KP Assembly Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan — come forward and play their due role in rehabilitation work.</p><small>2026-01-25 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2519064221233d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969005/pcb-announces-player-auctions-for-upcoming-pakistan-super-league-on-feb-11' target='_blank'><strong>PCB announces player auctions for upcoming Pakistan Super League on Feb 11</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Sunday announced that the player auction for the 11th edition of Pakistan Super League (PSL) will be held on February 11.
Earlier this week, the PCB had announced that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.
On Sunday, the cricket board conducted a detailed workshop for the upcoming PSL player auction at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, which was presided over by PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and attended by representatives from all eight franchises, PSL officials, and members of the T20 World Cup squad.
During the workshop, the management shared a detailed presentation on the mechanics of the retention and the auction process and consulted with all the participants, the PCB said in a press release.







“It was agreed that the HBL PSL Player Auction will take place on Wednesday, 11 February.”
The PCB further revealed the base prices of the players, saying that “auction price and minimum incremental bids for the players were to be in Pakistani Rupees”.
The base price of the top bracket was set at Rs42 million, Rs22m, Rs11m and Rs6m.
The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:

Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m
Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m
Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m
Rs15m for bid amounts above Rs42m

“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.







It added that the squad composition would be a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”. The number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size. It would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.
Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.
The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”
“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.
PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.
“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”
“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.
While hailing the major shift from draft to auction, Naqvi said, “The Player Auction model is a landmark step for the HBL PSL, offering players better financial opportunities through an increased salary purse and a transparent acquisition process, while making the league more competitive and attractive.”
The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8. It was announced that PSL’s 11th edition would be held from March 26 to May 3, 2026.</p><small>2026-01-25 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2512005596c5692.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968995/babar-shaheen-to-play-for-pakistan-in-t20-world-cup-haris-rauf-left-out' target='_blank'><strong>Babar, Shaheen to play for Pakistan in T20 World Cup; Haris Rauf left out</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) left out express pacer Haris Rauf from the 15-man squad named on Sunday for next month’s ICC T20 World Cup jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka, although former captains Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi were named.
The announcement was made in a press conference by PCB High Performance Director and member of the men’s national selection committee Aqib Javed, who was speaking alongside skipper Salman and white-ball head coach Michael James Hesson at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.
Rauf finished with 20 wickets in the Big Bash League (BBL) in Australia, but selector Javed said he doesn’t fit in the combination.
“Rauf has played a lot of cricket for Pakistan, but we kept conditions in Sri Lanka in mind while selecting the squad,” Javed told a press conference in Lahore.
Rauf is also the highest wicket-taker for Pakistan in T20I cricket with 133 in 94 matches.







Among the players, Salman, Faheem Ashraf, Khawaja Mohammad Nafay, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Sahibzada Farhan and Usman Tariq have received their maiden mega-event call-ups to the Pakistan squad, PCB said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Abrar Ahmed, Babar, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shaheen, Shadab Khan and Usman Khan have played in at least one or more editions of the tournament since 2021, the statement added.
In the 20-team tournament, each team is set to play four group games before the Super Eight and Knockout Stage, all between February 7 and March 8.
Pakistan are also set to face Australia in a three-match T20I series at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore on January 29, 31 and Feb 1, with the preparation camp starting today, the PCB statement said.
Babar and Shaheen were also named in Pakistan’s squad for the three-match series after being dropped from the T20I series against Sri Lanka last month.
When asked during the presser about Babar’s inclusion in the World Cup squad despite “not meeting international standards”, Javed said he has been “the most consistent batsman”.
On Thursday, Babar announced that he would miss the remainder of the Big Bash League in Australia since he had been recalled to Pakistan for a national team camp ahead of the T20I series with Australia.
Salman, on being asked if Pakistan stood to gain an advantage similar to “the way India did during the previous ICC Champions Trophy, as all their matches were in the UAE,” the captain admitted that Pakistan did have an advantage this time. However, he maintained that winning depended on whether the team played well.
“India won because they played good cricket. If we do the same, we will win as well,” Salman said.
Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India played all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
As per the compromise, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, though PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday their participation was still not confirmed.
Salman further said that “in the past three tournaments, the team had not performed well”.
He continued: “When you play a world cup, it is always going to be tough[..] you can not stay relaxed in any situation [..] it will be challenging, and we are both ready and excited for it”.
When asked “why Muhammad Rizwan was not chosen to be in the squad despite having more experience in Sri Lanka than Babar,” Javed said, “You have to take into account the batting composition of your team — both the coach and captain think that babar can play a vital role in the team — so it does not mean that one is being given a chance and the other is not, we have to look at how the team can have a more competiteive batting line up”.
He went on to say that the argument had “no logic”.
“You have to look at who fits better in the squad and which player can make the team better,” he added.
Head coach Hesson, responding to a question about the inclusion of Khawaja Nafay and Usman Khan as the wicket keepers despite Nafay’s “inexperience, and Usman’s “poor performance”, maintained that “Usman Khan has been exceptional since he has come back in the squad”.
“His wicket-keeping has probably been better than expected,” Hesson said.
He continued: “As for Khawaja Nafay, we looked at Sahibzada Farhan as the backup keeper, but unfortunately, he became a bit vulnerable to injury with the extra load from a keeping perspective. That was something we did not want to risk”.
The head coach stressed that Farhan was a “big player” for the team.
“The fact that we would have to put him in a difficult situation forced our hand a little bit […] that is where Nafay came in as a power player,” the head coach said.
“We are very comfortable with the two keeping options we have,” he added.
Salman, in response to a question over whether Babar’s “performance was a cause for concern”, said that the player’s performance “has not been as bad as you people portray it to be, his performance in the Big Bash did not go well, but it was in different conditions”.
“I think since his comeback, he has been performing well in the T20s and all that matters to me is that he performs well for Pakistan,” the captain added.
Detailing the batting plan, the captain said that “other than the openers, the rest of the line can only be decided given what the situation is”.
“In T20, other than openers, you have no idea what situation you will find yourself in,” he added.
Speaking about the line-up, Javed maintained that it was the same squad “which had been in continuity for the past three to four series”.
“It is not like we have formed a special or different team for the World Cup. However, different conditions are always taken into account, and changes can be made,” he said.
Head coach Hesson, talking about Rauf’s exclusion from the squad, said, “Firstly, when we decided to take three seamers to Sri Lanka, there were obviously going to be some unlucky seamers, and Waseem Junior, Ahmed Daniyal, and Haris Rauf are three that were certainly considered, but there was no spot unfortunately”.
He said that the three seamers included in the squad — Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, and Naseem Shah — “can bowl in all three phases of the game”.
He added: “In previous World Cup tournaments, we have always taken an extra seamer because conditions have dictated that, whereas in this situation we haven’t gone down that path”.
Detailing Babar’s role in the squad, the head coach stated, “We see a very different role for Babar than what you have in the BBL”.
“Babar Azam has a lot of other skills to offer,” he said, recalling that the decision to add Babar was also taken “to complement the other players we have”.
“We know what a world-class player he is and how flexible he can be, depending on what the team requires,” he added.
Asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup by Pakistan, following a statement made by the PCB chief, Javed said that their role was limited to selecting the team.
“Ultimately, it is up to the government to decide, and we will wait for their decision,” he said.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On January 25 (Sunday), security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Panjgur District of Balochistan, on [the] reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan.”
Fitna al Hindustan is a state-designated name for the Balochistan-based terror groups allegedly supported by India to target military personnel in Pakistan.
The statement said that during the conduct of the operation, the security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an “intense fire exchange, three Indian sponsored terrorists were eliminated.”
Among the killed was a local terrorist commander, Farooq alias Soro, the ISPR said.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.”
It stated that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, adding that the security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue their counter terrorism campaign at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country under the vision of “Azm e Istehkam”.
In 2025, despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militancy, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies.
Earlier this month, four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district.</p><small>2026-01-25 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647119-security-forces-gun-down-three-india-backed-terrorists-in-balochistans-pangjur-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces gun down three India-backed terrorists in Balochistan's Pangjur: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after the shooting said Alex Pretti had “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semi-automatic handgun” and “violently resisted” when they attempted to disarm him.
Administration officials did not say whether Pretti had the gun in his hands at the time.
Video shared widely by US media, which AFP has not verified, however, shows Pretti with a phone in his hands, filming agents in a snow-lined street and directing traffic.
After an agent shoves a woman protester to the ground on the sidewalk, Pretti steps in between them and is sprayed in the face by a chemical irritant.
The agent then pulls Pretti to the ground and several officers struggle to detain him on the icy roadway.
Seconds later, as an officer in grey appears to pull something from Pretti’s waist while Pretti is bent forward on his knees with multiple officers on top of him, agents open fire.
They shoot his motionless body several times from a distance after initially dispersing. At least 10 gunshots can be heard in the footage.
In one clip, a man can be heard saying, “Where’s the gun?” as Pretti is motionless on the ground.
DHS, after the shooting, posted on X a photo of the handgun purportedly found on Pretti.
The department said it looked “like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”







But Pretti’s parents in a subsequent statement denounced what they called “sickening lies” from the Trump administration.
“Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked by Trump’s murdering and cowardly ICE thugs,” they said.
“He has his phone in his right hand and his empty left hand is raised above his head while trying to protect the woman ICE just pushed down, all while being pepper-sprayed.”</p><small>2026-01-25 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2515471239f65a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969001/eu-council-president-arrives-in-india-to-seal-trade-pact' target='_blank'><strong>EU council president arrives in India to seal trade pact</strong></a><br><p>European Council president Antonio Costa arrived in India on Sunday, as the EU and New Delhi seek to seal a free trade pact, capping nearly two decades of negotiations between the economic behemoths.
Costa and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen are chief guests for this year’s Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi on Monday before an EU-India summit on Tuesday, where they hope to shake hands on the accord, described as the “mother of all deals”.
“President Costa is in New Delhi for the 16th EU-India summit taking place on Tuesday,” the EU Council said on X.







“The summit will be an opportunity to build on the EU-India strategic partnership and further strengthen collaboration across key policy areas.”
India, the world’s most populous nation, is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest economy this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections.
While the EU eyes India as an important market for the future, New Delhi sees the European bloc as an important source of much-needed technology and investment to rapidly upscale its infrastructure and create millions of new jobs for its people.
“We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement,” Leyen said ahead of the summit.

 

Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion ($139bn) in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 per cent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60bn ($69bn) in trade in services.
The pact would be a major win for Brussels and New Delhi as both seek to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls.
“The EU and India are moving closer together at the time when the rules-based international order is under unprecedented pressure through wars, coercion and economic fragmentation,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on Wednesday.
Negotiations, however, are still ongoing with talks focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU’s carbon border tax on steel exports and safety and quality standards in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors, according to people familiar with the discussions.
New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for decades for key military hardware, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base. Europe is doing the same vis-à-vis the United States.</p><small>2026-01-25 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/251423278e0c773.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999/bangladesh-absence-from-t20-world-cup-a-sad-moment-for-the-game-international-cricketers-association' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh absence from T20 World Cup a sad moment for the game: International Cricketers’ Association</strong></a><br><p>The absence of Bangladesh from next month’s T20 World Cup is a sad moment for the game and should serve as a call for stakeholders to work towards uniting the sport, not dividing it, the International Cricketers’ Association said on Sunday.
Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the 20-team showpiece on Saturday following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.
“The withdrawal of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup, and resulting absence of a valued cricketing nation from cricket’s pinnacle international T20 event, is a sad moment for our sport, the Bangladesh players and fans, and one that requires deep reflection,” World Cricketers’ Association (WCA) Chief Executive Tom Moffat said in a statement.
“Rather than allowing division or exclusion to take hold, we call on the games’ leaders to work with all stakeholders, including governing bodies, leagues and players, to unite the sport, not divide it.”
The events underline the current tension in South Asian cricket.
India’s fraught relations with Pakistan prompted the ICC to broker an arrangement allowing them to play at a neutral venue when their neighbour hosts a global tournament.
Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India played all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
As per the compromise, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, though the Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday their participation was still not confirmed.
“The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi, who is also the country’s interior minister, told reporters.
Moffat said the WCA had become increasingly concerned by agreements not being honoured in the sport and by a lack of meaningful consultation with players and their representatives.
“It also highlights significant issues with the game’s existing operating model at the global level,” he added.
“These issues, if continued to be left unaddressed, will weaken trust, unity, and ultimately the health and future of the game we love.”
Former Pakistani captain and all-rounder Shahid Afridi said on the replacement of Bangladesh by Scotland that he was “deeply disappointed” by ICC’s “inconsistency”.
“As a former international cricketer who has played in Bangladesh and in ICC events, I’m deeply disappointed by today’s ICC’s inconsistency. It accepted India’s security concerns for not touring Pakistan in 2025, yet appears unwilling to apply the same understanding to Bangladesh.
“Consistency and fairness are the foundation of global cricket governance. Bangladesh’s players and millions of its fans deserve respect — not mixed standards. The ICC should build bridges, not burn them,” Afridi said in a post on social media platform X.







Former Pakistani batsman Mohammad Yousaf expressed similar views, saying: “Very sad to see a cricket-loving nation like Bangladesh being deprived of cricket due to security concerns not being addressed.
“When similar concerns were raised earlier, a neutral venue was approved. Standards cannot change from country to country. ICC must act as the International Cricket Council, not appear to serve the interests of any single board. Fairness and consistency are the foundation of global cricket.”

Forecasters said snow, sleet, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures would sweep the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday and into the week.
Calling the storms “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.
“We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.
‘Crippling to locally catastrophic impacts’
Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security said.
“We do have tens of thousands of people in affected states in the South that have lost power,” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on Saturday.
“We have utility crews that are working to restore that as quick as possible.”
The number of outages continued to rise. As of 2:44am EST on Sunday, some 230,000 US customers had no electricity, the bulk of them in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee and New Mexico, according to PowerOutage.com.
The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorising the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centres and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.
On Sunday, the Department of Emergency issued an emergency order to authorise grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.
The National Weather Service warned of an unusually expansive and long-duration winter storm that would bring widespread, heavy ice accumulation in the Southeast, where “crippling to locally catastrophic impacts” can be expected.
Weather service forecasters predicted record cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills descending further into the Great Plains region by Monday.
As of 10:21pm EST, more than 4,000 US flights scheduled for Saturday had been cancelled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware.
More than 9,400 US flights originally set for Sunday also have been cancelled.
Airlines, grid operators scramble to prepare
Major US airlines warned passengers to stay alert for abrupt flight changes and cancellations.
On Saturday, Delta Air Lines continued to adjust its schedule and made additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City.
It added it was relocating experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.
JetBlue said that as of Saturday morning, it had cancelled about 1,000 flights through Monday.
United Airlines said its weather preparations included proactively cancelling some flights in places with the worst weather.
US electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts.
Dominion Energy, whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centres in the world, said if its ice forecast held, the winter event could be among the largest to affect the company.
Noem, at a news conference about US government preparations for the storm, warned Americans to take precautions.
“Its going to be very, very cold,” Noem said. “So we’d encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together.”</p><small>2026-01-25 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/250758087e36711.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968951/three-charged-in-uk-over-attacks-on-imrans-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Three charged in UK over attacks on Imran’s aide</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: British counter-terrorism police have charged three men in connection with a series of “highly targeted” attacks against Pakistani dissidents living in the United Kingdom, including a former adviser in the Imran Khan government.
The alleged assaults took place in Cambridgeshire and Buckinghamshire between Dec 24 and 31 and were directed at two prominent supporters of the jailed former Pakistani prime minister. Counter-terrorism police took over the investigation from local forces, citing the deliberate and targeted nature of the incidents.
One of the victims, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, a former accountability adviser in Mr Khan’s cabinet, said he was brutally assaulted at his home after an attacker confirmed his identity. He told British media that he had been punched repeatedly and is now in hiding, fearing for his and his family’s safety.
On Friday, police confirmed that three British nationals had been charged. Karl Blackbird, 40, and Clark McAulay, 39, face charges of conspiracy to cause actual bodily harm in relation to separate incidents. A third man, Doneto Brammer, 21, has been charged in connection with the attack on Akbar’s home and faces additional charges, including possession of a prohibited weapon and conspiracy to commit arson.
All three appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Saturday.
Several other suspects have been arrested during coordinated raids across London, the Midlands and Essex and later released on bail. Police said the investigation remains ongoing and that detectives are keeping an open mind regarding motive and possible links between the attacks.

“Players with Rawalpindi domicile will be included in the team purely on the basis of merit, and this team will not only participate in the PSL but will also be developed as a world-class team,” he said while addressing a press conference at his residence.
Accompanied by Lahore Qalandars Chief Executive Officer Atif Rana, the railways minister said the trials would be held on February 14 and 15. “Any youngster appearing in the trials will be selected on merit,” he added.
He said the Lahore Qalandars CEO would guide the initiative. He further stated that only youth with Rawalpindi domicile would be included in the Rawalpindi Tigers and that the team would participate in the Pakistan Super League (PSL).
Thanking the Lahore Qalandars CEO for visiting Rawalpindi, Mr Abbasi said the franchise had played an important role in promoting cricket among the youth. “Pakistanis have a romance with cricket. We are announcing the formation of the Rawalpindi Tigers team, which will be developed as a world-class team,” he said.
He said he had been a fan of Lahore Qalandars from the beginning. “We have provided sports facilities to the youth of Rawalpindi in colleges and schools. We are providing a major platform to the youth purely on merit,” he said, adding that the trials would be sponsored by Capital Smart City.
On the occasion, Lahore Qalandars CEO Atif Rana said he had a long-standing relationship with Hanif Abbasi, who had provided great support during Lahore Qalandars trials in the past. He also praised the cleanliness system in Rawalpindi.
He said Lahore Qalandars deserved credit for the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, under which trials were conducted for 300,000 children. He added that Hanif Abbasi was providing facilities to the youth while serving the public.
“We will conduct trials in Rawalpindi before the PSL auction. We have teams in every area and school of Rawalpindi,” he said, adding that all trials would be conducted on merit and talent would be introduced to the world.
He said a development squad would be called from outside to train the players. “Initially, a Rawalpindi Tigers club will be formed, and 20 players will be selected in the first phase,” he added.

As per details, the department seized 20 lions from a breeding farm in the Lahore division and arrested Fayaz alias Faizi and three others for violating the instructions that every lion pair should have at least 22 marlas of space for captivity.
While another 23 big cats, including 14 tigers, four lions and five ligers were seized from a facility in CITI housing, Jhelum and one Muhammad Aamir was arrested.

 

In Multan, a private wildlife breeding farm near the Askari Bypass in Cantonment area was also sealed for non-compliance of SOPs.
As many as nine lions and a monkey were seized from the facility and an FIR was registered against one Waqas Ayub.
Similarly in Gujranwala division, one person was arrested for possessing three lions in violation of the department’s guidelines at the Canal View Housing Society.
Two lions were retrieved from a home in Luther village in Sialkot district and one arrest was made. Meanwhile, another two lions being kept at the Imam Jalvi Darbar in Faisalabad were also seized.
Additional Chief Wildlife Ranger Mudassar Hassan told Dawn that the department had been issuing notices on the print and social media platforms that farms that failed to fulfill the standards for keeping wild animals would be sealed.
He said that the facilities that had not followed the guidelines had been sealed and the department would take care of the lions.
Sources claimed that the fate of the lions would be decided later.

As mercury dives to single digits, the government’s refusal to treat the biting cold as a climate emergency is claiming lives.
In Chitral, at least nine members of a family were killed when an avalanche consumed their house. Intense snowfall and landslides have crippled routine life in KP, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir. Households grapple with unannounced power and gas cuts; commuters contend with blocked roads and highways. Power outages, suspended water supply, and extremely low gas pressure turned homes into dark freezers in Balochistan where temperatures were as low as minus 13°C.
This month, nearly 50 people have reportedly died of the cold in Karachi alone — a city that usually experiences mild winters witnessed temperatures below 7°C. This weather system is expected to bring more rain and snowfall to the country but only Punjab seems prepared for it.
Cold snaps often take an unsparing toll on the human body. Medical experts say that as the cold forces the heart to work overtime, heart attacks, strokes, and kidney complications become more common, particularly among people suffering from heart disease, poor immunity and diabetes. Heat loss in the body causes chilblains, frostbite and hypothermia — treatable conditions that turn lethal due to the lack of knowledge about them.

 

A warm hearth in winter can help. But the scores that languish on cold, hard footpaths wrapped in rags or plastic die uncounted.
Welfare-centric policies and mechanisms that ensure uninterrupted gas and electricity and road safety in extreme weather events are crucial. The state’s inability to expand free shelter and meal programmes, such as panahgahs, must be tackled with the adoption of international models involving pavement shelters and drop-in facilities. For immediate relief, parts of public spaces should serve as refuge.
The antidote to widespread indignity is compassion.

The Pakistani parliamentary opposition makes a valid case that the matter should have been laid before the House for discussion and approval prior to any decision; but its view that joining the Board was not a prudent move is open to question. “It was the least worst [bad] option,” was the crisp comment of former ambassador Imran Ali Chaudhry, who had recently retired when the digital platform Naya Daur sought his opinion. There are a number of reasons why I tend to agree with him.
People around the world have been up in arms at the apartheid State of Israel’s genocide in Gaza starting after the Hamas attack of Oct 7, 2023. Calls from around the world fell on deaf ears as the West, led by the US, unconditionally supported, armed and facilitated the Zionist state’s assault on the Strip. Some 70,000 Gaza Palestinians were slaughtered, including about 20,000 children and a large number of women, elderly and the infirm, ie, non-combatants. But it remained business as usual as far as the genocidal apartheid state was concerned.
Whether in the hope of winning laurels or heeding his Gulf friends’ counsel, it was Trump who finally stopped the genocide. At the beginning, he was talking in terms of relocating the Gaza population and developing the Strip as the Middle East’s Riviera. Then, possibly the continuing street protests in the West, the US included, and the constant unhappiness of his well-resourced Gulf friends made him stay his hand and he made clear his plan did not envisage or include anyone being displaced from Gaza.

Pakistan has wisely sought safety in numbers and has joined the Board as part of an OIC bloc.

His announcements thus far have fallen way short of suggesting any pathway to Palestinian statehood. This is a major negative. Especially at a time when the apartheid state has accelerated evictions of Palestinians and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank.
But, despite some 450 murders of Gaza Palestinians since last October’s ceasefire by Israel, the mass killing that continued unabated for two years and claimed at the very least 70,000 lives has stopped. If joining the Board means that the magnitude of killing has stopped and many more lives saved, then perhaps it is worth it.
Pakistan has wisely sought safety in numbers and has joined the Board as part of an OIC bloc. This makes it easier in relative terms to have its voice heard. Perhaps, collectively, they can counter and dilute the apartheid state’s influence with Trump. And if the going gets too frustrating, then they can exit en bloc without one state having to face the seemingly unstable US leader’s wrath.
Let’s not forget, the US is Pakistan’s largest export market valued at between $5 billion and $6bn a year. Pakistan is also currently in an IMF programme — an institution with huge American influence, which has brought in badly needed foreign exchange injections. Coupled with meeting some of Pakistan’s military spares/upgrade needs such as the $640 million upgrade of PAF F-16 aircraft which extends their operational age to 2040, all these factors make Pakistan’s decision understandable.
In addition, Pakistan military’s performance during last May’s clash with India seems to have boosted the country’s standing in the region as well, with Trump constantly endorsing the PAF’s verified kill claims against its arch-rival, the IAF.
This element, along with effective diplomacy by the hybrid leadership, has opened up opportunities. While I wouldn’t go as far as to repeat what some analysts are saying about Pakistan being now the net security provider in the region, the defence pact with Saudi Arabia is a significant milestone.
The one interesting fact about this Board is that apart from the US, not a single UN Security Council member has joined it. Russia, China, Britain and France have so far not joined and don’t appear to be doing so either. The impact of this will become clear over time.
Many pragmatic decisions taken to safeguard the national interest may not pass the principled position test. My first and foremost concern is that the issues affecting the lives of the Palestinians in Gaza, and then the West Bank, are to be decided by an apex body that does not have a single Palestinian on it.
It will be left to other Muslim states’ representatives to carry the Palestinian mantle. Their past record of standing up for the rights of the Palestinians is not very inspiring, but the Gaza genocide seems to have shaken the most docile into sitting up and saying enough is enough. Let’s hope this isn’t wishful thinking.
As much as I want to, I don’t see this Board, with chairman Trump armed with the solitary veto and a large number of committed Zionist supporters of the apartheid state including Benjamin Netanyahu himself on it, making progress on Palestinian statehood.
But if it stops the genocide, and leads to some relief for the Gaza population and sets things on the path to reconstruction and rehabilitation it will be worthwhile. This is how powerless we are to see justice prevail in the world.
Since this Board is unlikely to last a day after Trump’s term ends, one can safely say it may not achieve much more except give the US leader another opportunity to blow his own trumpet and make largely unfounded claims of success and impact.
For Pakistan coming out unscathed at the end and more tightly aligned with Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Qatar and Indonesia would be a diplomatic and strategic win, particularly because the nation’s perennial ally China is reportedly fine with the decision.

Mr Trump has said that an “armada” of American ships is headed to the Gulf “just in case”, while adding that he did not want to “see anything happen” vis-à-vis Iran. There are also reports that the US has deployed more fighter jets to its bases in some regional states, while the Turkish foreign minister has said that Israel is “looking for an opportunity” to strike Iran. Senior Iranian officials, on the other hand, have indicated they will hit back hard if attacked.

 

The Trumpian threats could well be mere sabre-rattling designed to bring Tehran to the table on America’s terms. However, the problem with such brinkmanship is that it can very quickly spiral out of control, and have devastating real-world consequences.
It is also a fact that the US, Israel and many of their Western allies keep shifting the goalposts where Iran is concerned. At times they claim to be acting out of sympathy for the Iranian people and the alleged mistreatment they suffer at the hands of their rulers. But this sympathy is nowhere to be seen when the US and Israel lob missiles at Iran, killing innocent civilians.
At other times they have issues with Iran’s nuclear programme, its stockpile of missiles, and its support for ‘proxies’ such as Hezbollah, Hamas etc. The ultimate aim of the US-led bloc, though, seems to be to punish and bring down a regime that has been a geopolitical adversary for nearly five decades.
Assuming that Mr Trump is not bluffing, and his plans to attack Iran are still on the table, those states, including Pakistan and Turkiye, that have joined his Board of Peace need to talk him out of this disastrous plan.

 

Mr Trump fashions himself a peacemaker, yet his conduct against Venezuela and Iran is that of a warmonger. There is also some media commentary that the US president backed off from an attack on Iran in mid-January not out of any humanitarian compulsions, but because the US and its allies were then not militarily and logistically prepared for aggression against Tehran.
The latest military build-up may be to rectify that situation.
Saner minds in the world community that have Mr Trump’s ear must insist that plans for a Zionist-neocon war against Iran must be jettisoned. If the US and other Western states are serious about resolving their differences with Iran, they must treat it with respect, and refrain from violating its sovereignty. Above all, no one can afford a disastrous new war.

Rates issued by the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), based on interbank exchange rates, quoted the one-tola silver (24kt) rate at Rs10,801, up Rs526, while the 10-gram rate rose Rs451 to Rs9,260. This follows an increase in the world silver price by $5.26 per ounce to $103.26.
Gold and silver continue to attract global investors, including in Pakistan, as safe-haven assets amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and expectations of further US interest rate cuts. Previously, the Ukraine-Russia war, the Gaza-Israel conflict, and US-imposed tariffs under President Donald Trump had driven gold prices to record highs.
APSGJA President Qasim Shikarpuri said the recent rise in gold prices was also influenced by Trump’s statements on imposing higher tariffs on European countries that opposed his demand to take control of Greenland, followed by retaliatory measures from those countries.
“Any settlement between European countries and the US on tariff issues may trigger a downward correction in world gold prices,” he said.
Mr Shikarpuri claimed that gold in the domestic market is being sold under cost at Rs517,000-518,000 per tola, compared to Rs524,162 announced by the association. Domestic rates are also lower by Rs25,000 per tola compared to Dubai prices.
“A sort of profit-selling is taking place, as some investors who purchased gold at Rs450,000-455,000 per tola are now selling the metal,” he said, adding that some investors are making fresh purchases in anticipation of further increases in world gold prices.
Mr Shikarpuri said the gold market appeared deserted as genuine jewellery buyers have been absent due to the meteoric rise in prices and affordability issues amid the rising cost of living. Currently, only investors are actively buying and selling gold in the market.

Consequently, the apex court overturned the decisions of the lower forum and dissolved a marriage on the grounds of “talaq” (divorce) instead of khula, since the husband had contracted a second marriage. The Supreme Court also ordered awarding the wife her full unpaid dower of Rs1.2 million through the executing family court.
“We have noted that where a wife expresses aversion, the family court dissolves the marriage on the grounds of khula and the wife is deprived of her dower,” observed Justice Musarrat Hilali in a five-page judgment on Friday.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the two-judge Supreme Court bench had taken up an appeal by Naila Javed against the June 30, 2025 Peshawar High Court (PHC) Abbottabad Bench’s maintaining of the dissolution of her marriage by the family court on the basis of khula, with a decree to forego her remaining dower as a condition of khula.

Apex court says granting khula without petitioner seeking it legally unsustainable

The Supreme Court emphasised that if the aversion was the outcome of some reasons, then dissolution should be based on those particular reasons. The courts should not, on their own motion and without the statement of the wife, convert the demand for divorce into khula.
Through her petition, Ms Javed contended that she never sought khula and that her case was rather based on the grounds pleaded under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (DMMA). And, more importantly, her husband had contracted a second marriage without complying with the mandatory procedure under Section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO). Thus, she was entitled to dissolution of marriage under Section 2(iiia) of the DMMA with full retention of her dower.
The judgement noted that the marital union was solemnised between the parties on Dec 16, 2013, but irreconcilable differences arose between them. Upon the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, the petitioner instituted a suit before the family court seeking a decree of dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty, non-payment of the remaining dower, non-payment of maintenance, and that the respondent had contracted a second marriage during the pendency of the case without her permission.
The family court, however, did not rule on the merits of these pleaded grounds; instead, it concluded that the petitioner had failed to substantiate the allegations of cruelty and had expressed an unequivocal unwillingness to live with the respondent, the judgement observed.
Subsequently, the family court granted a decree of dissolution of marriage by way of khula, with a direction to the wife to relinquish her claim of outstanding dower.
During the hearing, the Supreme Court formulated a number of questions for consideration, namely whether the petitioner had discharged the burden of proof to establish her claim of cruelty, whether the court could exercise suo motu powers to convert the plaintiff’s claim for divorce into khula, and whether a wife’s averment of irreconcilable aversion towards her husband constituted a legally sufficient ground to initiate khula proceedings and relinquish dower.
The judgement said the petitioner did not plead for dissolution of marriage in her original suit. However, during the pendency of the suit, when the respondent contracted a second marriage without her permission, she sought dissolution of marriage.
Referring to the second marriage, the Supreme Court said Section 2(iiia) of the DMMA expressly provides that a woman is entitled to dissolution of marriage if the husband has contracted a second marriage in contravention of the MFLO.
Under Section 6 of the MFLO, contracting a second marriage without the written permission of the arbitration council constitutes a contravention, attracting both penal and civil consequences, including dissolution, the judgement noted.
In the present case, the respondent neither obtained the permission of the existing wife nor sought a declaration from the arbitration council. There is thus no dispute that the second marriage was contracted without obtaining the written permission of the council. This conclusively establishes a violation of the statutory ground under Section 2(iiia) of the DMMA, the judgement said.
The family court and the appellate court failed to adjudicate this ground despite its clear availability on the record, the judgement noted, adding that a lower court cannot convert a suit under the DMMA into one for khula in the absence of a clear and unequivocal statement by the wife. Thus, the concurrent judgements of the courts below granting khula without the petitioner seeking it are legally unsustainable, the Supreme Court held.

Police said a “clock/observation tower” near a residential home in Tangir Valley in Diamer collapsed on a house, resulting in the death of four members of a family and injuries to two other members.
Diamer Deputy Commissioner Ataur Rehman Kakar said heavy snowfall occurred in Tangir on Thursday, which might have caused the incident. According to police sources, the casualties could rise as the relief operation continued.

 

The Karakoram Highway (KKH), Baltistan Road, Ghizer–Shandur Road and other roads were opened to traffic on Saturday, while link roads in various areas of the region, including Astore, Skardu, Ghanche, Ghizer and Shigar, remained blocked.

Met office forecasts more rain, snow in parts of country

Due to the cold weather, people in Gilgit-Baltistan continued to face difficulties, which were compounded by road closures and electricity shortages. The GB government issued a travel advisory for tourists, stating that heavy snowfall had been recorded in Hunza, Nagar, Ghizer, Astore, Skardu, Shigar, Ghanche, Kharmang and Diamer.

 

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), meanwhile, predicted more rain and snowfall in various parts of the country till Tuesday. The advisory said that due to continuous snowfall, there was a risk that some roads in the upper and mountainous areas would be partially or completely closed. It asked tourists and residents to take precautions.
Zhob roof collapse
In Zhob, a child was killed and two sustained injuries in a roof-collapse incident, while more than six people were admitted to hospitals after accidents caused by slippery road conditions following snowfall.
In Quetta, the cold wave continued as Siberian winds lashed the provincial capital and other parts of northern and central Balochistan for the third day.

 

The sky was clear on Saturday, but the weather remained extremely cold amid low gas pressure, adding to people’s hardships. Business centres and roads in Quetta presented a deserted look as businesspeople and consumers preferred to stay indoors. Traffic was also thin.
LPG dealers, meanwhile, increased cylinder prices due to an increase in demand.
In order to provide relief, the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) announced the suspension of load-shedding in Quetta and the surrounding areas of the provincial capital for one week due to the severe cold weather, but people were not getting power supply in other cities of the province.
Due to the intense cold, water in pipelines froze in Quetta, Kalat, Chaman and Ziarat, leading to a shortage of drinking water in several areas. However, highways and inter-provincial roads that were blocked due to snow were opened by the local administration, but authorities asked people to check weather updates before travelling.
In many parts of the province, life had come to a standstill, particularly in Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Ziarat, Pishin, Toba Achakzai and other areas, as temperatures in the upper and Pak-Afghan border regions dropped to as low as minus 12 degrees Celsius.
The Met Office predicted that in the next 24 hours, more light and heavy rain was expected with icy winds in various districts, including Quetta, Kalat, Khuzdar, Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, Pishin, Naushki, Kharan, Sibi, Nasirabad, Kachhi, Washuk, Dalbandin and the coastal areas of Makran, while Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Pishin, Toba Kakari, Toba Achakzai and Kalat could receive snowfall.

• Both sides discuss cooperation in law enforcement, extradition and criminal justice
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Somalia on Saturday signed an agreement abolishing visa requirements for diplomatic passports holders of both countries.
The agreement was signed at the Presidency by Hamza Adan Haadoow, Permanent Secretary of Somalia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and Dawood Muhammad Baraech, Special Secretary at Pakistan’s Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control.
President Asif Ali Zardari witnessed the signing ceremony and later met Somalia’s Interior Minister Ali Yousuf, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening bilateral engagement. President Zardari said Africa was an important part of the world’s geopolitical landscape and that Pakistan sought to enhance its ties with African states, including Somalia.
He added that Pakistan valued its engagement with Somalia and supported closer collaboration in areas of shared interest. The president was informed that the visit by the Somali interior minister marked the first official bilateral visit from Somalia to Pakistan in 35 years.
Emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to regional and international efforts against transnational crime and narcotics trafficking, the president said broader geopolitical developments and opportunities for bilateral cooperation were also discussed during the meeting.
The Somali interior minister thanked the government of Pakistan, especially the Ministry of Interior, for the warm hospitality extended to him and his delegation. He said he was visiting Pakistan on the invitation of his Pakistani counterpart and conveyed his appreciation to the president and the people of Pakistan.
Mr Ali Yousuf also handed over a letter from the president of Somalia to President Zardari, conveying greetings and good wishes and reaffirming Somalia’s desire to further deepen bilateral ties.
He described Pakistan as a reliable partner and brotherly country since Somalia’s independence, recalling the sacrifices of Pakistani peacekeepers during UN missions in Somalia in the 1990s, where Pakistani personnel laid down their lives while serving under the United Nations flag.
During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on enhancing cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice. Discussions included the feasibility of negotiating a bilateral extradition treaty and the legal frameworks governing extradition in both countries.
The possibility of initiating talks on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters and the transfer of sentenced persons was also explored. The two sides further discussed cooperation in counter-narcotics efforts, including collaboration against drug trafficking and organised crime, information and intelligence sharing, as well as capacity building and training.
President Zardari was informed that Pakistan had offered assistance through the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), in advanced identity management, civil registration and secure documentation systems, as well as training for the Somali police force.
Federal Minister for Interior and Narcotics Control Mohsin Raza Naqvi and Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Talal Chaudhry were also present at the meeting. Other members of the Somali delegation included Sheikhnur Mohamed Hassan, Ambassador of Somalia to Pakistan, and Osman Abdullahi, Deputy Police Chief.

ISLAMABAD: The Privatisation Commission announced on Saturday that the outsourcing operation for the country’s three major airports — Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi — will move to an open bidding mode following a high level of interest from various investors.
The commission said the shift from a government-to-government (G2G) mode to open bidding aims to generate a competitive process wherein all domestic and foreign investors will have a level playing field to participate in the bidding process.
According to a commission statement, the envisaged competitive process priorities inclusivity by welcoming participation from all eligible entities, including those from partner nations, while affording equal opportunities to local and foreign investors.
This approach is designed to promote transparency and fair competition, deliver the most advantageous results for Pakistan’s economy and reinforce relationships with international partners, the commission said.
The government has been actively considering options for Islamabad International Airport, Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport and Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport through appropriate modes, including management contracts and long-term commercial concessions.
As part of this strategy, the Islamabad airport has been included in the active privatisation program, consistent with the ongoing process for the airports at Karachi and Lahore.
This follows constructive dialogue with entities from partner nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia, as well as other international stakeholders.
The commission noted that the primary objectives are to enhance efficiency, improve service delivery, maximise revenue generation, upgrade infrastructure and attract private sector investments. These efforts align with the nation’s economic vision to cultivate collaboration to modernise the aviation sector.
Roosevelt Hotel
Separately, the Privatisation Com­m­ission has invited technical and financial proposals for the appointment of a financial adviser for the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, aiming to secure a joint venture for mixed-use development of the elite Manhattan property owned by the Pakistan government.
According to the commission’s website, proposals can be submitted by Feb 16. The government intends for the transaction regarding the Roosevelt Hotel to be completed in one year.

 

The commission intends to offer the property for setting up a joint venture project through the “best suited transaction structure and mode of privatisation”.
The appointed financial adviser will be tasked with conducting market sounding to validate investor interest in the hotel.
The adviser must identify potentially interested parties and assess the level of interest in the transaction structure options covered in the transaction structure report and recommendations of the earlier financial adviser.
Additionally, the financial adviser will develop and implement an effective marketing strategy with the approval of the Privatisation Commission.
This includes developing and implementing a plan for introducing the Roosevelt’s site and projecting its image to bolster its value, “enabling expression of interest in the property from prospective investors”.
The adviser will also be required to arrange meetings with potential investors in order to develop a better understanding of investor profiles and the investment climate.
Located in midtown on Madison Avenue, the Roosevelt Hotel is the only real estate entity on the government’s privatisation program.
The 19-storey property is considered among the elite hotels in Manhattan, comprising 1,025 rooms with a covered area of over 600,000 square feet. It is wholly owned by PIA Investments Ltd (PIAIL), which is owned and managed by the Pakistan government.

The soaring deficit was mainly due to a decline in Pakistan’s overall exports to regional countries, led by a drop in shipments to China, followed by Afghanistan and Bangla­desh. Pakistan has suspended all kinds of trade, including exports, with Afghanistan since Oct 10, 2025. 
In percentage terms, exports to India increased marginally, but in value terms, it is negligible. The shipments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka registered negative growth during the period under review, according to the latest data compiled by the State Bank. 
In FY25, the trade deficit with these nine neighbouring countries widened by 29.42pc to $12.297bn, up from $9.502bn in the preceding year.
The value of exports to Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives dipped 18.56pc to $1.965bn in July-December FY26 from $2.413bn over the same period last year. Contrary to this, imports surged 24.76pc to $9.648bn in 6MFY26 from $7.733bn over the same period last year. Imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the preceding year. 
Imports from China grew by 25.61pc to $9.472bn in 6MFY26 from $7.541bn over the same period last year. The bulk of imports in the region is sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh. 
Exports to China fell by 5.59pc to $1.216bn in 6MFY26 from $1.288bn over the same period last year. Imports from India dipped by 12.73pc to $97.734m in 6MFY26 from $111.991m over the last year. In FY25, imports from India increased to $220.58m from $206.89m over the last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $2.926m in 6MFY26, up from $0.399m over the last year.

“The government is promoting a cashless economy, and executive orders have made QR codes mandatory in Islamabad and provincial regions, requiring every retail outlet to provide at least one digital payment option,” the state minister said on Saturday. 
He was speaking at a policy discussion organised by the Institute for  Public Opinion Research (IPOR) to present findings from its nationwide  study titled Track and Trace Compliance in the Tobacco Industry-Volume  II. 
The minister added that all retailers and merchants have been  instructed to adopt digital payment methods. He said federal and  provincial authorities were working on legislation to support the  initiative, which aims to formalise the economy and strengthen the  “Cashless Pakistan” programme. 
The study revealed significant  regulatory gaps in compliance with the Federal Board of Revenue’s Track and Trace System (TTS). 
Speaking about the IPOR study, Mr  Kiani emphasised the government’s commitment to enforcing the TTS in the  tobacco sector during the seminar. “The government will intensify  crackdown on illegal cigarette brands and focus on enforcing regulations  in the tobacco retail market,” he added. 
The minister clarified that  action would not be taken against retailers selling legal brands, but  non-compliant brands would be brought within the legal framework, and  monitoring and enforcement in the sector would be enhanced. 
He said retail outlets fall under the jurisdiction of provincial governments, which have the authority to take action against sellers of illegal cigarettes. “Warehouses and transportation channels in the tobacco sector are also being monitored, and strengthening enforcement is expected to improve compliance with laws and increase revenue,” he said.

In its annual perform­ance report, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs highlighted that these reforms ranged from modernising ports, shipping and fisheries sectors to unlocking the full potential of the blue economy.  
Karachi Port handled a record 54 million tonnes of cargo, while average vessel dwell time was reduced by 24 to 36 hours through closer coordination among port authorities, customs and other agencies, achieving an average turnaround of five days in line with regional benchmarks.  
Cost-cutting measures delivered substantial savings. Reduced overtime at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) saved about Rs70 million per month, while the abolition of 2,152 re­­d­undant posts across maritime entities lowered human resource costs by billions of rupees.  
The first bunkering facilities were also established at Karachi Port and Port Qasim, expected to save foreign exchange and attract transshipment traffic. The KPT and Port Qasim Authority reclaimed around 150 acres of encroached land, valued at roughly Rs110 billion.  
Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry said a central element of the overhaul was the finalisation of the National Maritime Policy, which brings shipping, ports, fisheries and maritime security under a single framework to guide sustainable growth.  
“The government also approved a National Shipping Policy aimed at expanding the Pakistan-flagged fleet to reduce reliance on foreign carriers, a longstanding drain on foreign exchange,” he added. He said stakeholder con­­s­ultations had been co­­mpleted on the Natio­n­­al Fisheries and Aquacul­ture Policy, which targets annual seafood exports of $2 billion and the creation of around two million jobs across coastal communities and allied industries.  
At the deep-sea port of Gwadar, 72 acres of free-zone land were handed over to operators, while bids were invited for an off-dock terminal on 100 acres to attract transit trade from Central Asia and beyond.
