The lawyer couple, who were arrested in a separate case on Friday and sent on judicial remand, briefly appeared via video link before the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka in Islamabad.
At the start of the hearing, the court sought compliance with earlier directions regarding the production of the accused for cross-examination, which the court had declared as the final opportunity in light of orders issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Citing security concerns, police submitted a report stating that it would take five to six hours to transport the accused from jail and requested permission for them to appear through a video link. The court accepted the request and directed that Imaan and Hadi be presented via video link.
However, technical issues, including internet connectivity problems at Adiala jail, delayed the proceedings. After a brief adjournment, Imaan and Hadi finally appeared before the court via video link.

 

When the judge asked whether the defence wished to begin cross-examination, Imaan questioned whether media representatives were present in the courtroom.
She then alleged that both she and her husband were being subjected to mistreatment in custody, adding that they were not being provided food or water.
Imaan addressed the judge directly, saying, “You are doing your job … everything is happening because of you.”
The incarcerated lawyer then announced that both she and her husband were boycotting the proceedings.
In response, Judge Majoka asked whether they no longer wished to participate in the trial and advised them to wait for the verdict. Despite this, both the accused left their seats before the conclusion of the hearing, effectively refusing to take part in further proceedings.
Following the boycott, the judge directed the court staff to record the entire proceedings and place them on the judicial record.
Defence counsel Ashraf Gujjar later moved a request for summoning a person relevant to the case. The judge noted that the individual had already appeared online and stated that the entire record would be reviewed.
Subsequently, Judge Majoka announced that he would pass a written order on the defence request and reserved the decision, while the trial remained pending.
Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday prompted criticism by rights bodies, politicians, and journalists, who stressed the couple’s right to a fair trial.
Amnesty International noted the “lack of adherence to due process” and said these were “retaliatory cases aimed solely at silencing Imaan and Hadi for their human rights work and dissent”.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also condemned the arrests, terming the case a “tool to harass, intimidate and ultimately muzzle dissent”.







Cases against the duo
Imaan and Hadi have recently defended themselves in a case that pertains to controversial social media posts. The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad.
They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year.
ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances.

 

Subsequently, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.
The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, relating to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case.
Separately, on Thursday, anti-terrorism court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025 — the same case in which they were arrested today.</p><small>2026-01-24 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/241443190e1847e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968791/china-says-top-military-official-under-investigation-for-serious-violations-of-discipline' target='_blank'><strong>China says top military official under investigation for ‘serious violations of discipline’</strong></a><br><p>China said on Saturday the senior vice chairman of its powerful Central Military Commission (CMC) and another high-ranking official were under investigation for suspected “serious violations of discipline”, a common euphemism for corruption.
The announcement marks the latest push in a sweeping drive to root out graft at all levels of the party and state since President Xi Jinping came to power more than a decade ago.
“Following a review… it has been decided to initiate an investigation into Zhang Youxia and Liu Zhenli,” the defence ministry said in a statement.
The two men were “suspected of serious violations of discipline and the law”, the ministry said.
Zhang Youxia, 75, is China’s highest-ranked general as the more senior CMC vice chairman.
He is also a member of the powerful Politburo, the 24-member executive body of the Chinese Communist Party.

He shares the vice chairman title with Zhang Shengmin, a general in Beijing’s secretive rocket force and who is no relation.
Zhang Shengmin was promoted to the post in October after Beijing expelled his predecessor in another sweeping corruption purge.
Both generals rank below Xi, who has held the CMC chairmanship since 2012.
Liu, 61, is the chief of staff of the CMC’s joint staff department, which oversees combat planning.
Rumours of a probe swirled this week after Zhang Youxia and Liu appeared to miss an official meeting chaired by Xi and attended by second-ranked CMC vice chairman Zhang Shengmin.

 

Xi has called graft the “biggest threat” to the Communist Party and said “the fight against corruption remains grave and complex”.
Proponents say the policy promotes clean governance, but others say it also serves as a tool for Xi to purge political rivals.
In October, China announced it had launched corruption investigations into nine military officials.
As part of those probes, the defence ministry said it had expelled two top generals from the military.
They were He Weidong, the former second-ranked CMC vice chairman, and Miao Hua, the former head of the military’s political work department.
In 2024, former Chinese defence minister Li Shangfu was expelled from the Communist Party after being ousted over offences including suspected bribery.
Li’s predecessor, Wei Fenghe, was also expelled from the party and passed on to prosecutors over alleged corruption.</p><small>2026-01-24 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24122911c205e5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968781/over-1500-people-rescued-after-heavy-snowfall-in-kps-tirah-valley-rescue-operations-continue' target='_blank'><strong>Over 1,500 people rescued after heavy snowfall in KP’s Tirah Valley; rescue operations continue</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: After heavy snowfall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, rescue teams continued operations to evacuate those trapped by the snow, a spokesperson said on Saturday.
A large number of displaced families leaving Tirah in preparation for an operation in the valley were stranded in a snowstorm in Khyber district on Friday.
KP’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement that the rescue operations were ongoing for those trapped in the valley.
“Rescue 1122 has so far rescued more than 1,500 people and 350 vehicles and shifted them to safe places during the rescue operation, while more than 100 people have also been provided medical assistance,” he said.

The spokesperson added that over 100 personnel and officers from Khyber, Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera and Swabi’s Rescue 1122 divisions were participating in the operation.
In a later statement, Faizi said that the rescue operation had been ongoing for more than 36 hours.
“Despite the severe cold, sub-zero temperatures and difficult routes, rescue personnel are in the field and are carrying out rescue activities without interruption,” he said.
The Khyber district administration on Thursday suspended the evacuation of more families from Tirah Valley in view of the heavy snowfall, asking them to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather.
Citizens advised to avoid travel
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) said that the Murree Expressway had been opened to limited traffic due to an improvement in the weather conditions.
“However, due to the changing weather conditions and increasing rush, there is a possibility of closing the Murree Expressway,” the spokesperson added, requesting the public to avoid unnecessary travel.







The spokesperson said that the motorway police had performed their duties with diligence during the heavy snowfall and that traffic was controlled via the “best strategy according to the situation”, adding that the relevant officers themselves were in the field taking the lead.
According to the motorways spokesperson, more rain and snowfall is predicted in Murree and Galiyat on Monday and Tuesday.
NHMP’s media department requested that tourists cooperate with the Motorway Police, who would be on alert 24 hours a day to prevent any sudden disaster.
“The Motorway Police will be present to guide and protect tourists,” it said.
It advised citizens to contact its helpline at 130 in case of emergency and obtain guidance from the Motorway Police’s social media accounts before starting the journey.</p><small>2026-01-24 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24091228b18aa16.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968774/iran-will-treat-any-attack-as-all-out-war-against-us-says-senior-iran-official' target='_blank'><strong>Iran will treat any attack as ‘all-out war against us,’ says senior Iran official</strong></a><br><p>Iran will treat any attack “as an all-out war against us,” a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a US military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days.
“This military buildup — we hope it is not intended for real confrontation — but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,” said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
“This time we will treat any attack — limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it — as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this,” the official said.
US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an “armada” heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.
“If the Americans violate Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond,” said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like.
“A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran,” the official said.
The US military has, in the past, periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive.
However, the US military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran’s nuclear program.
Air France suspends service to Dubai as KLM halts Middle East flights
At least two European airlines suspended flights to cities in the Middle East on Friday, with Air France saying it will temporarily stop service to Dubai due to the geopolitical situation.
Dutch airline KLM also halted flights until further notice to cities in the Middle East and would not fly through the airspace of several countries in the region, including Iraq and Iran, according to the Netherlands’ state broadcaster.
“Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the company has decided to temporarily suspend its service to Dubai,” France’s national carrier said in a statement to AFP.
The airline added it was “constantly monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft” to ensure “the highest level of safety and security” for its flights.
“Air France is monitoring the situation in real time and will provide further updates on its flight schedule,” the French airline said.
KLM told Dutch public broadcaster NOS on Friday that it had suspended flights until further notice to Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dammam and Riyadh and would not fly through the airspace of Iraq, Iran, Israel and several countries in the Gulf.
The airline did not disclose the reason for the suspensions and said it was in touch with Dutch authorities, according to NOS.
Trump has repeatedly threatened US strikes on Iran over the crackdown on the protest movement that recently erupted across the Islamic republic.
The prospect of military action appeared to recede last week after the White House said Tehran had halted planned executions of demonstrators, but Trump on Thursday confirmed continuing military preparations.
“You know we have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case… We have a big force going toward Iran,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-24 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24131108d7abad2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968782/mercury-may-drop-to-single-digits-in-karachi-over-weekend-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Mercury may drop to single digits in Karachi over weekend: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Saturday said temperatures in Karachi could fall to single digits over the weekend, adding that the city’s weather was likely to remain cold and dry with occasional winds.
The city saw its second spell of winter showers on Thursday afternoon under the influence of a westerly wave that brought about light to moderate rainfall in several areas. Strong winds blew through the city after the rains, making the weather chillier.
In a weather forecast, the PMD predicted a minimum temperature of 8.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, while it is expected to drop further between 7°C and 9°C on Sunday.
On Monday night, the minimum temperature is forecasted to rise slightly to 8-10°C.
Meanwhile, the maximum temperature is expected to remain between 19-21°C on Saturday and Sunday, rising further to between 20°C and 22°C on Monday.


Partial screengrab of the PMD weather forecast issued on Jan 24, 2026.

According to the Met Office, the humidity levels are predicted to remain between 40 and 55 per cent in the morning during the next three days, while at night, humidity can fall to between 10 and 25pc.
Northeast/easterly winds are expected to prevail till Monday, PMD added.
On Friday, the PMD predicted more rain and snowfall in various parts of the country from Sunday night to Tuesday, with daytime temperatures likely to drop during the period.
According to the Met Office, a westerly wave is likely to approach western parts of the country on January 25 (Sunday) and is expected to grip the upper parts on January 26 (Monday).

Under the influence of this weather system, rain, wind and thunderstorms with snowfall are expected in most parts of Balochistan on Sunday night and on Monday. Upper Sindh, including Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad and Dadu, is also likely to receive rain on Monday.
Rain, wind and thunderstorms with snowfall, including heavy snowfall at a few places, are also expected in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). The weather system is also expected to affect several parts of KP and Punjab.
The weather forecasts come as heavy snowfall, avalanches and landslides have brought life to a standstill across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, GB and AJK — blocking roads, stranding travelers, and disrupting electricity and relief operations.

The first known direct contact between Ukrainian and Russian officials on the proposal began Friday. Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said the discussions focused “on the parameters for ending Russia’s war and the further logic of the negotiation process”.
An initial US draft drew heavy criticism in Kyiv and western Europe for hewing too closely to Moscow’s line, while later iterations prompted pushback from Russia for floating the idea of European peacekeepers.
Both sides say the fate of territory in the eastern Donbas region is one of the main outstanding issues in the search for a settlement to a war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated parts of Ukraine.
The UAE foreign ministry said in a statement that the talks were scheduled to last two days and were “part of ongoing efforts to promote dialogue and identify political solutions to the crisis”.
Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday and US envoy Steve Witkoff later held talks with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin.
Donbas dispute
The Emirates meeting began as thousands of people in Kyiv were without heating in sub-zero temperatures due to Russian strikes.
The European Union, which has sent hundreds of generators, accused Moscow of “deliberately depriving civilians of heat”.
Further Russian strikes killed one person and injured 22 others in Ukraine’s capital and the northeastern city of Kharkiv overnight, authorities said early Saturday.
“Kyiv is under a massive enemy attack,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted on Telegram, adding that several non-residential buildings had been hit and telling residents to remain in shelters.
While diplomacy to end Europe’s worst conflict since World War II has gained pace, Moscow and Kyiv appear deadlocked over the issue of territory.
Hours after Putin met Witkoff — and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — in Moscow, the Kremlin said its maximalist demand that Kyiv withdraw from the eastern Donbas region still stood.
“Russia’s position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
“This is a very important condition,” he added.
Kyiv, which still controls around 20 per cent of the eastern region, has rejected such terms.
‘Desire to end the war’
Ahead of the talks Zelensky told reporters territory remained a “key issue” — with Moscow having said it is not dropping its demand that Kyiv pull out of its eastern Donbas region.
In a post online, he later added: “It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end the war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well.”
Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are last known to have met face-to-face in Istanbul last summer, in talks that ended only in deals to exchange captured soldiers.
The Abu Dhabi meeting is the first time they have faced each other to talk about the Trump administration’s plan.
Putin has repeatedly said Moscow intends to get full control of eastern Ukraine by force if talks fail.
After the Russia-US talks in the Kremlin, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov insisted Moscow was “genuinely interested in resolving” the war diplomatically.
But he added: “Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives… on the battlefield.” Trump has in the past pressured Ukraine to agree to terms that Kyiv sees as capitulation.
Trump repeated on Wednesday his belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.
“I believe they’re at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don’t, they’re stupid — that goes for both of them,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-24 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2413001153662fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968784/europe-and-india-seek-closer-ties-with-mother-of-all-deals' target='_blank'><strong>Europe and India seek closer ties with ‘mother of all deals’</strong></a><br><p>India and Europe hope to strike the “mother of all deals” when European Union (EU) chiefs meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi next week, as the two economic behemoths seek to forge closer ties.
Facing challenges from China and the United States, India and the European Union have been negotiating a massive free trade pact — and talks, first launched about two decades ago, are nearing the finishing line.
“We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week.
Von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa will attend Republic Day celebrations on Monday before an EU-India summit on Tuesday, where they hope to shake hands on the accord.
Securing a pact, described by India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal as “the mother of all deals”, would be a major win for Brussels and New Delhi as both seek to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls.
But officials have been eager to stress there is more to it than commerce.
“The EU and India are moving closer together at the time when the rules-based international order is under unprecedented pressure through wars, coercion and economic fragmentation,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on Wednesday.
‘Untapped potential’
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and US President Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs have brought momentum to the relationship between India and the EU, said Praveen Donthi, of the International Crisis Group think tank.
“The EU eyes the Indian market and aims to steer a rising power like India away from Russia, while India seeks to diversify its partnerships, doubling down on its strategy of multi-alignment at a time when its relations with the US have taken a downward turn,” he said.

The summit will offer Brussels the chance to turn the page after a bruising transatlantic crisis over Greenland — now seemingly defused.
Together, the EU and India account for about a quarter of the world’s population and GDP.
Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion ($139bn) in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 per cent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60bn ($69bn ) in trade in services.
But both parties are eager to do more.
“India still accounts for around only around 2.5 per cent of total EU trade in goods, compared with close to 15 per cent for China,” an EU official said, adding the figure gave a sense of the “untapped potential” an agreement could unlock.
EU makers of cars, machinery and chemicals have much to gain from India lowering entry barriers, said Ignacio Garcia Bercero, an analyst at Brussels think tank Bruegel, who led EU trade talks with New Delhi over a decade ago.
“India is one of the most heavily protected economies in the world, with very, very high tariffs, including on many products where the European Union has a competitive advantage,” he told AFP.

 

With its economy in the doldrums, the 27-member EU is also pushing to ease exports of spirits and wines and strengthen intellectual property rules.
India — the fastest-growing major economy in the world — wants easier market access for products such as textiles and pharmaceuticals.
Defence pact
EU officials were tight-lipped about the deal’s contents as negotiations are ongoing.
But agriculture, a sensitive topic in both India and Europe, is likely to play a limited role, with New Delhi eager to protect its dairy and grain sectors.
Talks are focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU’s carbon border tax on steel exports and safety and quality standards in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Still, EU officials said they were confident negotiations could be concluded in time for the summit.
An accord on mobility to facilitate movement for seasonal workers, students, researchers and highly skilled professionals, is also on the menu, alongside a security and defence pact.
The latter envisages closer cooperation in areas including maritime security, cybersecurity and counter-terrorism, an EU official said. It is also a “precondition” for the possible joint production of military equipment, said a second EU official.

 

New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for decades for key military hardware, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base.
Europe is doing the same vis-à-vis the US.
“We’re ready to open a new chapter in EU-India relationships, and really to unlock what we think is the transformative potential of this partnership,” said another EU official.</p><small>2026-01-24 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646891-gul-plaza-inferno-ignored-warnings-delayed-response' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza inferno: Ignored warnings, delayed response</strong></a><br><p>

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has claimed at least 71 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said the citizens of Karachi had “questions of a very serious nature regarding the responsibilities of the Sindh government in this incident”, as well as those of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and the mayor.
He called for an “independent judicial inquiry” into the Gul Plaza tragedy to ensure the truth comes to light. Sattar questioned what the “fear and obstruction” was in setting up a judicial commission.
“Incapability, mistake, apathy, shamelessness, impudence — these should be exposed,” Sattar demanded.
Sattar further demanded that the top officials of various departments be included in the commission, echoing a letter written by MQM-P Convener Khalid Maqbool to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday.



In a letter dated January 23, Maqbool Siddiqui called on the premier to notify a “high-powered independent, transparent, and impartial commission of inquiry” under Section 3 of the Pakistan Commissions of Inquiry Act 2017 (PCIA).
The MQM-P leader called on the premier to take “serious notice in exercise [of] your constitutional powers” for providing justice to the Gul Plaza victims.
The commission would aim to “inquire comprehensively into the said incident and to fix the [responsibility] and to bring to justice […] all those Sindh Govt. officials and other culprits, private persons, etc, who have been found to be involved in the happening and the subsequent deaths and loss of valuable lives of hundreds of victims, injured etc, either directly or indirectly in any manner, specially due to criminal professional negligence of Sindh Govt. officials”, the letter added.
It further urged the premier to make the inquiry commission’s report public under Section 15 of the PCIA to “ensure transparency and accountability, such that no said tragic, traumatic and inhuman incident” will take place in the future.
“It is also requested on behalf of the victims and injured affectees and their families of the said incident that federal government may immediately take into custody all the incident area into its custody and thereby direct federal departments and armed forces help to search and rescue operation the remains and scattered body parts and valuable of the victims such that the same may be securely preserved and thereby properly delivered after identification to their relevant heirs and families,” the letter added.
Siddiqui also requested that “necessary actions for immediate rehabilitation and financial assistance of the victims and injured persons’ immediate families and dependents” be taken, including the establishment of a “relief and rehabilitation fund” at the federal level to minimise the affected people’s economic hardships.
He suggested that the commission include the director generals (DGs) of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Intelligence Bureau (IB), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and Sindh National Accountability Bureau (NAB); the directors of Military Intelligence (MI) and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI); the State Bank of Pakistan joint director; as well as members from Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), Pakistan Council of Architects and Town Planners, and National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak).
The MQM-P convener, who is also the federal education minister, highlighted the alleged “severity, intensity, and the scale of criminal professional negligence, mismanagement, professional misconduct by the [Government] of Sindh and its allied [government] machinery” during the incident.
He contended that “economically approx. 12,000 plus families have been directly affected, whereas thousands have been indirectly affected, prima facie due to gross criminal professional negligence, mismanagement, professional misconduct, rampant cancer of corruption, of the Sindh Govt. and its relevant officials, as per their respective domains”.
Those officials “primarily” included the local government secretary; the Karachi mayor; the deputy mayor; KMC and its Fire and Rescue Department; the Karachi municipal commissioner; the Karachi commissioner; the Sindh Building Control Authority (SCBA) DG, director (South), deputy director (South) and building inspectors; the district administration; and the Civil Defence Organisation.
The letter contended that lives could have been “saved if timely and effective, organised rescue and recovery actions had been taken on the said day”.
“However, unfortunately it reportedly took approximately 03 days to control the fire in the said incident, leading to hundreds of tragic deaths on record whereas, dozens of missing perons whose remains have been reportedly lying there at the incident area in the forms of thousands of bones and scattered body parts showing how the tragic and catastrophic deaths were happened there solely due to failure of Govt. of Sindh and its [government] machinery,” it alleged.
Claiming that the Sindh government was not “cooperating” with the victims’ families, the MQM-P leader called for the federal government’s “intervention on war-footing basis as per constitutional mandate before it’s too late”.
Siddiqui asked PM Shehbaz to take the said actions for the protection of citizens’ fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 9 (security of person), 10A (right to fair trial), 14 (inviolability of dignity of man), 18 (freedom of trade, business or profession), 24 (protection of property rights) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution.
Farooq Sattar responds to CM Murad
He contended that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah was “misleading the people” and diverting attention away from the Gul Plaza incident, mentioning his remarks on the floor of the Sindh Assembly.
On Friday, while detailing the history of Gul Plaza’s construction, CM Murad had pointed out that Sattar had approved the regularisation of building violations as the mayor in 2003.
In response, Sattar argued that regularisations were also done by his successor, Naimatullah Khan and that the PPP had been in power in Sindh since 2008.

 

Sattar also lashed out at the chief minister for reaching the site “22 hours” after the incident occurred, adding that Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab visited “after 23 hours”.
He criticised the Sindh government for terming the questions raised by them as “politicising” the matter. “Should someone not ask where the mayor was, when he did not arrive until 23 hours later? Should someone not ask why the deputy mayor did not come at all?”
Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad had paid a visit to the site by the afternoon of January 18.
“Make no mistake, chief minister Sindh. Make no mistake, mayor Karachi. The time is coming; the noose of accountability on your neck is tightening. The people of Karachi would not let you escape so easily,” he said.
“You can fool some people sometimes. You can fool some people all the time. You can fool all the people sometimes. But you can’t fool all the people all the time. Enough is enough.” Sattar quipped.</p><small>2026-01-24 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24121429f153537.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968780/gul-plaza-inferno-came-after-ignored-warnings-delayed-response' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza inferno came after ignored warnings, delayed response</strong></a><br><p>Muhammad Imran did not take the fire at Karachi’s Gul Plaza seriously at first, thinking it was another small spark that would be quickly extinguished by fellow shop owners.
But smoke seeped through ducts and blackened the air in seconds. The lights went out soon after and phone flashlights turned useless, people could no longer see their own hands, he said.
Imran, who has diabetes and has undergone heart surgery, managed only a few steps before nearly giving up.
“It felt like doomsday,” he said. “You couldn’t see the person next to you.”

The blaze would rage for nearly two days and reduce Gul Plaza, a multi-storey complex of 1,200 family-run shops selling children’s clothes, toys, crockery and household goods, to ash.
At least 71 people were killed, with 15 still missing and feared dead, police official Asad Ali Raza said, in the January 17 blaze — Karachi’s largest in over a decade.
Imran’s escape from the inferno, along with more than a dozen others who spoke to Reuters, was hampered by locked doors, poor ventilation, and crowded corridors. When they eventually got out, the survivors watched Gul Plaza crumble as rescue efforts faced delays and poor resources.
Police said the fire appeared to have started at an artificial flower shop and may have been caused by children playing with matches. They added that all but three of the 16 exits were locked, which was routine practice after 10pm.
Documents reviewed by Reuters showed Gul Plaza, located on a major artery in Karachi’s historic city centre and built in the early 1980s, had violated building regulatory standards for over a decade, with authorities warning the situation was dire in the last review two years ago.
Gul Plaza’s management did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Long paper trail
Records from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) showed court cases filed over Gul Plaza’s lack of safety compliance in 1992, 2015 and 2021, as well as records of unauthorised construction.
The files reviewed by Reuters do not detail the outcomes of those cases, including whether fines were imposed or whether violations were fully remedied. SBCA did not respond to queries on enforcement action taken.
A Nov 27, 2023, survey by the fire department, covering more than 40 commercial buildings in the area, cited inadequate firefighting equipment, blocked escape routes, faulty alarms, poor emergency lighting and a lack of fire safety training for occupants and staff.
A follow-up audit by the fire department in January 2024 placed Gul Plaza among buildings that failed to meet regulations, with inspectors marking key safety categories, including access to firefighting equipment, alarm systems and electrical wiring conditions, as “unsatisfactory”.
Separately, documents describing inspections by Karachi’s Urban Search and Rescue teams in late 2023 and early 2024 that were reviewed by Reuters also showed Gul Plaza was among several markets and commercial buildings flagged for deficiencies in one or more fire safety categories.
‘People were panicking’
“Young boys were crying. People were panicking,” Imran said, when they were confronted by locked exits.
Others smashed doors and locks as they moved through the darkness, holding hands and forming human chains to avoid getting lost.
With no way down, they ran to the roof, where 70 people, including families and children, were trapped for nearly an hour, survivors said.
The smoke was even worse there, funnelled upward by the building’s design, making it impossible to see even the neighbouring buildings.
Then the wind changed.
A sudden gust pushed the smoke aside, revealing Rimpa Plaza next door. Young men crossed first, found a broken ladder and began ferrying people across one by one.
“I was the last to leave. I wanted to make sure everyone was safe,” Imran said. An ambulance from the Edhi Foundation charity was waiting on the other side.
Watched it burn
Many survivors said the response by the fire brigade was delayed and inadequate. Imran and other shop owners said they had escaped from the building and watched Gul Plaza turn into a molten inferno as the first firefighters arrived.
The first emergency call came at 10:26pm from a teenager, with two fire vehicles reaching the site within 10 minutes and classifying the blaze as a Grade 3 fire, “the highest category for an urban area”, said a provincial government spokesperson Sukhdev Assardas Hemnani.
A citywide emergency was declared by 10:45pm, triggering the mobilisation of resources from across Karachi, he said.
Shopkeepers said the first engine soon ran out of water and left to refill, but Hemnani said those allegations were inaccurate.
Firefighters used “water, foam, chemicals and sand”, he said, adding the blaze was difficult to control because the building contained more than 50 gas cylinders and flammable material such as perfumes, generator fuel and car batteries.
Many of the shops were stocked to the brim because of Ramazan in February-March, Pakistan’s biggest shopping season.
The first fire truck was not delayed, Hemnani said, but later arrivals were slowed by heavy traffic on a busy Saturday night and a crowd of over 3,000 people that had gathered outside the mall.
The fire department did not respond to requests for comment.
‘No longer among us’
Survivors said many of the missing were shop employees and traders who tried to help others escape or went back inside looking for family members.
Abdul Ghaffar, a toy store employee who had worked in Gul Plaza for two decades, said one of his cousins was among those still unaccounted for after helping others flee.

His cousin’s mobile phone voice message, in which he can be heard apologising to his family, was circulated widely on social media.
“He was helping people escape,” Ghaffar said. “That’s how he died.”
Three other relatives remain missing, he said, with the family still waiting for identification through DNA testing.
Several shopkeepers said the losses have scarred the market’s tightly knit community.
“All of this keeps replaying in front of my eyes. People we saw daily are no longer among us. God was kind to us our lives were saved but I still cannot understand what kind of fire this was,” said Imran.</p><small>2026-01-24 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24113325da95c18.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968701/deploy-cold-paraphernalia-dust-off-woollies-bring-yakhni-winter-is-here' target='_blank'><strong>Deploy cold paraphernalia, dust off woollies, bring yakhni, winter is here!</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The people of the city are not used to very cold weather. Therefore, the mercury drop after the recent light showers is a surprise. Many were in denial when knowledgeable friends warned them that “winter is coming” until it actually came.
Just a hoodie or sweatshirt, a sweater over normal cotton clothes or a single blanket or quilt will not do anymore. The shivering, the chattering of teeth, the cold breaths yearn for mittens, woollen socks, beanies, earmuffs, thicker blankets, quilts with extra filling, fur-lined jackets and heaters in the house. Instead what we have is a head start on freezing early in the morning when you turn on the tap to the torture of washing your hands with ice-cold water (the geysers are still off because of nightlong gas loadshedding) and it is all down a snowy hill after that.
Karachi roads wore a deserted look soon after sundown as most people preferred remaining indoors. “It’s the end of winter. It won’t get any colder than this. So better to wait it out indoors,” said one Karachiite, speaking for millions of others who also stayed back home.
“We can’t hide ourselves behind closed doors and shut windows. We have to face the Siberian winds the best we can as we can’t stop working. We need to go out to earn our living,” said another, speaking for the ones who needed to go out for one reason or the other. They braved the cold with jackets and shawls over sweaters, mittens, beanies and earmuffs.
Desperate times called for desperate measures when things became too much, especially at night. Then dried tree branches, wood and cardboard from old fruit crates were brought to use to begin a nice little campfire to sit around.
The usual evening crowd of friends outside tea stalls moved inside to enjoy the tea while losing numbers. “Tea at home can taste as pleasant and aromatic as at a dhaba. I have no desire to catch pneumonia for having tea with friends. I can have tea while enjoying screen time at home,” said a friend who loved tea and paratha outings.
Still, for all those ditching dhaba tea, there was an equal number at the yakhni [broth] shop in Bolton Market. Plain chicken broth with a good squeeze of the lime at Rs120 a bowl and special broth at Rs300 a bowl with boiled egg and papri [cracker] never tasted better than having it on a chilly evening.
Similar sentiments were shared by others buying roasted peanuts, corn on the cob and crisp sweet jalebi at roadside stalls.
Eight-year-old Ayesha looked too well-clad in comparison to her father in just a cotton shalwar-kameez. “I’m wearing Abbu’s jacket,” the child gestured to her oversized black jacket that reached below her knees.
“It’s okay,” said the father. “I can take the cold. But my daughter may fall ill,” he said, adding that they misjudged the weather when leaving home during the afternoon.
Thick jackets and puffer jackets were selling aplenty at Lighthouse where concerned parents ended up looking for warm clothes for their children.
Meanwhile, Saeed Khan there was happy to have sold many of his second-hand coats and blazers which he carried in the market on his left shoulder.

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some sections collapsed. It has so far claimed 71 lives.
South DIG Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the FIR had been registered on behalf of the state, through a police official, under relevant laws.
According to the FIR, Nabi Bux police station SHO Inspector Nawaz Ali Zardari said the police received information about the fire in the plaza at around 10:30pm on January 17.
The FIR added that the fire was “rapidly spreading and engulfed the entire plaza” while firefighters and other rescue personnel were engaged in efforts to extinguish the blaze.
It further stated that the fire erupted in shop number 193, a flower and gift shop, located on the ground floor, and quickly spread in the shopping plaza.
“Rescue work is ongoing and there are apprehensions of more deaths,” said the FIR.
The police also blamed the lack of firefighting equipment and “no reasonable arrangements” in the case of an emergency for the tragedy.
The report added that there were “no emergency exits” and that electricity had been switched off, complicating the evacuation of those inside the shopping plaza.
“Due to these reasons, precious human lives were lost and substantive financial losses also occurred.”
The FIR has been registered under Sections 322, 337-H(i), 436, and 427 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). Police have not nominated anyone in the case; therefore, the FIR has been registered against unknown persons.
CM Murad announces major relief, accountability measures after Gul Plaza tragedy
On Friday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah briefed the provincial assembly on the incident, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab in attendance.
Recalling that Rs10 million had been announced for the family of each deceased individual, CM Murad said the required funds have been released and handed over to the Karachi commissioner for distribution.
About the committee formed to estimate the losses faced by the businesses at Gul Plaza, he said the Sindh Assembly would compensate the affected people.
The Sindh CM announced Rs500,000 in “immediate” financial assistance for the 1,102 shops approved by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) at Gul Plaza, and if any others had any proper documentation.
“This is for their sustenance so that they can stand back on their feet, as the rest of the programme can take two to three months,” he noted.
The chief minister further revealed that after some ministers’ efforts, 500 shops were made available in one building and 350 in another, whose owners have said they will not take any rent for one year.
“My effort is to make arrangements for them (shop occupants/renters) to get makeshift shops for two years,” Murad said.
He went on to announce that the Sindh government, through the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, would arrange the “security/collateral” for the affected people and pay the interest if someone wanted Rs10m in loans.
The Sindh CM said Gul Plaza would likely be demolished and then rebuilt, with each shop getting the same area size it previously had. He added that the Sindh government would aim to reconstruct them within two years.
The chief minister also stated that an audit will be conducted and non-compliant buildings would be given a “brief period” to comply, failing which they would be sealed.
He further said that he has directed the provincial law minister to draft legislation for making insurance mandatory.</p><small>2026-01-24 06:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646875-karachiites-quiver-as-temperature-drops-to-chilling-62c' target='_blank'><strong>Karachiites quiver as mercury drops to chilling 6.2°C — lowest this winter</strong></a><br><p>

The concern expressed by members across the political divide, if genuine, indicated that parliament may finally be turning its attention to substantive public interest issues. This approach should be broadened into a national conversation on the environmental degradation being witnessed in the ecological chain across the country.
Pakistan stands at the front lines of the global climate crisis. Glaciers are retreating, floods are becoming deadlier, water is growing scarcer, and weather patterns are losing their reliability for the Indus basin. Governments respond with reports, task forces and foreign-funded projects, yet disasters persist — with ever-increasing intensity. We ignore that the land that is now Pakistan once possessed a functioning climate civilisation of its own.
For instance, for over 2,000 years, societies in Gilgit-Baltistan, particularly Baltistan, Gilgit and Chilas, survived in one of the world’s harshest environments with remarkable stability. Long before the arrival of Buddhism and later Islam, the region was shaped by an indigenous belief system known as Bön. It was more than a religion; it was a comprehensive environmental philosophy. Nature was not treated as dead matter but as morally alive. Mountains, glaciers, rivers, forests and wildlife were all understood as participants in a shared living world that deserved to be treated with respect. Thus they were protected as a collective community responsibility.
This worldview created what modern policy now calls ‘environmental governance’. Upper watersheds were sacred and protected. Glacier zones were restricted. Forests were regulated. Grazing followed strict seasonal rules. Hunting was controlled. These standards were enforced collectively. Violating nature meant violating community norms.

The land that is now Pakistan once possessed a functioning climate civilisation of its own.

The heart of this system lay in seasonal festivals that structured life in the mountains. Even today, Baltistan celebrates May Fang on Dec 21, marking the winter peak and the return of light, and Nauroz, the spring festival of renewal. But these went beyond celebrations. They were regulatory events. May Fang reinforced survival discipline during the dangerous winter period. Nauroz reset agricultural schedules, irrigation systems, social contracts and land use. Other seasonal rituals controlled the opening of pastures, the protection of glaciers during peak melt, the storage of harvests and preparation for famine.
The cultural ethos was so strong that locals who migrated to other parts of the world have continued to celebrate these events. When I was a child, Nauroz was celebrated with special dishes and there were boiled, coloured eggs alongside greenery on a plate. We continue this ritual even today. In effect, society moved in rhythm with climate and ecology.
When Buddhism arrived and later Islam, this environmental civilisation was not destroyed. It was ethically transformed. Sacred mountains became signs of divine creation. Conservation became a moral duty. Festivals became moments of gratitude and prayer. Islam, in particular, reinforced environmental discipline with extraordinary clarity. The Quran warns humanity not to “transgress the balance” of nature and declares human beings as stewards of creation. The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) forbade waste of water even in the presence of a flowing river and declared that planting a tree was an act of charity. In the mountains, these principles merged naturally with existing ecological customs.
This fusion produced centuries of environmental stability in a region where survival itself is a constant struggle. Then, in the past 60 years, modern development dismantled this system. Roads, dams, concrete, mining and unregulated construction erased sacred geography. Seasonal rules collapsed under market pressures. Community authority weakened as centralised administration took over. Nature lost its moral meaning and became raw material. Towns are turning into sprawling katchi abadis spewing toxic gutter water that pollutes the clean sparkling streams.
The results are before us. Glaciers are melting faster. Floods are more violent. Springs are drying up. Food security is fragile. Conflicts over water and land are rising — not in this region alone; the entire country is suffering due to the criminal neglect of Pakistan’s mountainous north. The tragedy is that Pakistan is now searching for climate solutions in foreign policy templates while ignoring a climate model that already existed within its own borders.

 

GB offers more than cultural nostalgia. It offers a framework of governance that modern policy desperately needs. The first lesson is that climate resilience cannot survive on technical planning alone. It requires cultural obedience. People protect what they believe in. Environmental law becomes powerful only when it is anchored in social values and moral conviction enforced by the community — not by green civil servants from other parts of the region in unplanned new district administrative units who, blind to local conditions, have only added more confusion to the chaotic administrative nightmare of small wasteful new revenue districts.
Second, ecological management must be seasonal, not continuous. Ancient societies understood that nature functions in cycles. Modern policy treats resources as permanently available. That illusion is collapsing.
Third, community institutions are not obstacles to development; they are its foundation. No climate policy will succeed if it bypasses the cultural intelligence of the people who live with the land.
Pakistan’s future climate policy must, therefore, undergo a fundamental shift. Environmental governance should be localised, culturally grounded and ethically reinforced. Protected climate zones must replace unregulated construction in watersheds and glacier buffers. Valley-level councils should regulate grazing, forestry and water according to seasonal cycles. Indigenous festivals should be formally integrated into disaster planning, water management and food security strategies. Education must restore the moral relationship between society and nature.
The mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan are not backward remnants of a forgotten past. They are a library of climate knowledge written over centuries of living with glaciers, avalanches, droughts and floods. Pakistan can either continue importing climate policy from abroad or learn from its own civilisation. The current policies are a recipe for disaster and portend an alarming future for our rivers, our farms, cities and Pakistan itself.

ISLAMABAD: For every $1 the world invests in protecting nature, it spends $30 on destroying it. This stark imbalance is the central finding of a new report released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
The ‘State of Finance for Nature 2026’ report finds that total nature-negative finance flows stand at $7.3 trillion. Of this, $4.9tr comes from private sources, highly concentrated in a few sectors including utilities, industrials, energy, and basic materials. Public environmentally harmful subsidies — mainly for fossil fuels, agriculture, water, transport and construction — amounted to $2.4tr in 2023.
Released on Thursday, the rep­ort called for a major shift in global financing towards nature-based solutions (NbS) and the phasing out of harmful investments to deliver high returns, reduce risk exposure, and enhance resilience.
The report further finds that finance flows for NbS totalled $220 billion, with nearly 90 per cent coming from public sources, reflecting a steady rise in domestic and international support.
Globally, finance flows remain heavily skewed towards nature-negative activities, threatening ecosystems, economies and human well-being. Nearly half of the global economy significantly depends on nature, yet governments, businesses and financial institutions continue to erode the world’s collective natural capital.
In 2023, finance directly harmful to nature reached $7.3tr, while investments in NbS amounted to only $220bn. To meet global commitments under the Rio Conventions, NbS investment must increase by more than two and a half times to $571bn by 2030, while harmful finance flows must be phased out and repurposed, emphasised the report.
While finance for NbS has continued to grow, it remains far below the level required to meet global biodiversity, climate and land restoration goals.

ISLAMABAD: Young people are under-represented in positions of power and often excluded from policy decisions that disproportionately affect them, such as on public debt, climate change and, most directly, education, said a new Unesco report released on Friday on the eve of International Day of Education.
Unesco’s Global Education Monitoring Report 2026, titled “Lead with youth”, said that while young people and students are not well represented in formal politics, they remain politically active and frequently demand good governance and social justice.
“They want their voices to be heard and to be engaged meaningfully on issues that affect their present and future, notably on education,” it said.
It added that youth and students’ calls for meaningful engagement in education decision-making are part of a broader global movement for youth agency that has grown over the past three decades.
The report said stronger youth and student engagement requires formal mechanisms and a seat at decision-making tables, representative and inclusive participation, institutional support and resources, and the willingness of authorities to value and act on feedback.
According to the report, only one in three countries has formal bodies to engage youth or students in education discussions.
However, the report found that satisfaction with engagement is lowest among school student groups. Asked to assess the depth of their participation, ranging from exclusion to being treated as valued partners, only 20 per cent said they felt they were genuinely collaborating with government or that their contributions mattered. Satisfaction rises when students are given formal roles and responsibilities in policy reform, it added.
Meanwhile, in a message issued on the occasion, President Asif Ali Zardari said Pakistan’s future was closely linked to its youth.
“As a nation with a rich cultural heritage and a large young population, we must ensure that education nurtures curiosity, competence and character. It should enable young people to think critically, act ethically and contribute positively to their communities,” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the government was paying special attention to promoting higher education and skills through various programmes to strengthen the education system and empower youth.
In a message on International Day of Education, he said Pakistan joined the international community in recognising those associated with education and training, including students, teachers, parents, educators and researchers.
To mark the day, Unesco and the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training held an event at Islamabad Model College for Girls under the global theme, ‘The Power of Youth in Co-creating Education’, with organisers saying the forum aimed to bring students into education policy discussions.
Minister of State for Education and Professional Training Wajiha Qamar described education as a national priority, calling it “the most powerful investment a country can make”.
Unesco’s representative in Pakistan, Fuad Pashayev, said the education emergency could not be addressed through policy alone and stressed that young people were “not just the future” but also the present.
Separately, the World Bank said its group was the largest financier of education in the developing world, with a $26.4 billion portfolio across 81 countries, supporting 324 million students to date through education-related programmes.

Climate activist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr said people remained detached from environmental issues because these were never presented in their own context and diction.
“If you ask people in Lahore about the Ravi, they will take time to respond. The same is the case with Karachiites about the Indus,” he said.
However, he added, the announcement of the Cholistan Canal project last year triggered strong opposition in Sindh, with the issue even being raised in Friday sermons. “The realisation was there because they saw it in the context of decreasing water levels in the Indus each year,” he added.
He suggested communities should identify with natural landmarks, saying Lahorites should attach their identity to the Ravi, people in Multan to the Sutlej and Sindh to the Indus.

Speakers at Thinkfest warn weak budgets, poor water control undermining climate action

Interestingly, he also compared the announcements during air travel to different destinations in Pakistan. He regretted that unlike the Islamabad-Gilgit flight, during which announcements were made about the mountains along the route, no anno­uncements were made during Karachi-Lahore flights or to other destinations when the plane flies over the lakes of Sanghar, Kirthar Hills or other such beautiful places.
Alleging that each project of the incumbent and of the PTI government was for the elite capture, Zulfikar Jr said the Cholistan agricultural land development was for the wealthy, as no ordinary citizen could get a contract of thousands of acres of land in Cholistan. He called for environmental issues to be linked with the economy and development agenda to broaden public engagement.
‘West-driven agenda’
World Wild Fund-Pakistan Director-General Hammad Naqi also urged policymakers to frame climate change as an economic, social and development issue and to counter the impression that it was a Western-driven agenda.
Lamenting at the low priority the successive governments are attaching to climate change, he said this was evident from the poor budget allocated for the environment department, whereas either a newcomer or a close-to-retirement secretary is posted to the environment department.
He regretted the inconsistency in government policies, regretting that if one government emphasises on tree plantation, the other focuses on infrastructure projects that are visible to the public eye. Likewise, every new secretary calls as rubbish the steps introduced by his predecessor, meaning inconsistency in policies and incapacity of the officials.
The WWF-P director general was also unhappy to see the lethargic attitude of the policymakers towards water management. “Only two sitting of the Punjab Water Commissions have been held during the last five years,” he said.
He said agriculture policy was also lagging behind climate needs amid limited progress on drought-resilient seeds for different crops and the continued neglect of crop zoning. He added that water-guzzling crops such as sugarcane and rice were still being promoted despite severe water scarcity in the country.

Speaking at a session titled ‘The Gaza War and the Remaking of the Middle East’, moderated by journalist Najam Sethi, Mr Nasr implied that the situation has proven detrimental to the Palestinian cause.
He said Israel now believes it can pursue its objectives primarily through force. “With Arab states politically neutralised, Israeli leaders see little incentive to return to negotiations,” he added.
According to him, Israeli leadership now views political compromise with the Palestinians as a security liability rather than a pathway to stability, effectively abandoning the two-state framework.
Following the Gaza war, Israel moved against Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakening the group’s operational capacity. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 further altered the regional balance.

Scholar notes Pakistan currently enjoying ‘diplomatic honeymoon’ with Washington, which won’t last for long

Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, long aligned with Iran and regarded as part of the so-called “axis of resistance”, were effectively dismantled.
“With this strategic buffer around Israel gone, Israeli policymakers believed they could confront Iran more directly,” the political scientist said, referring to Israeli-US military strikes on Iran in October 2024.
He said Arab states have also seen their influence in regional affairs diminish, leaving them increasingly sidelined. Israel, Mr Nasr argued, has concluded that military strength is now its primary guarantee of security.
As Iran’s regional influence declined, Arab and Muslim countries reassessed Tehran’s strategic importance as a symbol, pillar, and financier of resistance. “Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey moved to restore and strengthen ties with Iran, recognising its symbolic and geopolitical counterweight to Israel,” he said.
Mr Nasr also said the events of Oct 7, 2023 marked a turning point that reshaped regional politics and power dynamics. “In many ways, everything in the Middle East changed on that day,” he said.
Until then, he explained, US strategy in the region centred on normalising Saudi-Israeli relations, expanding the Abraham Accords, building regional trade corridors, and linking Middle Eastern economies with Europe and India while bypassing China.
“The events of October 7 pushed the Palestinian issue, which the US and many regional allies had put on the back burner, back to the centre of global attention,” Mr Nasr said, adding that Israel’s security doctrine has since undergone a fundamental shift.
He also criticised the “Board of Peace” initiative announced by US President Donald Trump, calling it ineffective because it excludes Palestinians. According to Mr Nasr, several participating countries joined mainly to maintain favourable relations with Trump rather than to advance a genuine peace process.
Despite the shifting landscape, the political scientist said key questions remain unresolved.
“The future of Gaza is still unclear. There are also uncertainties surrounding the role of a potential Pakistan-Saudi defence partnership and how Iran and Turkey will manage their competing interests in Syria,” he said.
However, he concluded that the regional balance of power has already undergone a historic shift. “The Middle East has entered a new phase, and this transformation may well be permanent,” he said.
‘Diplomatic honeymoon’
In a separate discussion, titled ‘Pakistan: Between the USA and China’, Mr Nasr argued against the view that China’s rise is irreversible and America’s decline is inevitable, advising middle powers such as Pakistan to focus on strengthening their own technological and economic foundations.
Sharing the stage with former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and journalist Raza Rumi, Mr Nasr described Pakistan’s current relationship with Washington as a diplomatic “honeymoon”, which had so far helped shield Islamabad from difficult questions regarding its strategic ties with China and its defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia.
“This relationship has also helped Pakistan avoid scrutiny over its conflict with India, largely because it played its diplomatic cards well,” he said.
Noting that Pakistan had also benefited from the recent strain in US-India ties, Mr Nasr cautioned that this favourable phase may not last long.
“The United States effectively has two centres of power — one represented by the White House and the other by permanent institutions such as the State Department and the Pentagon,” he said.
“Pakistan is currently engaging mainly with the White House and benefiting from it, but the institutional system is likely to reassert itself and reopen uncomfortable discussions.”
Ms Khar largely agreed with Nasr’s assessment, and called for Pakistan to deepen its alignment with China — which she described as more predictable and consistent in its diplomacy — while maintaining constructive relations with the United States.
“The US remains a global superpower and Pakistan must remain on the right side of Washington,” she said, but warned policymakers not to assume that this situation would last.

Taliban authorities have told them that Pakistani diplomatic missions should officially approach them and verify the list with an official stamp. However, Pakistani officials are reluctant to do so, the affected students told Dawn from Kabul and Jalalabad.
The Taliban allowed the first group of 26 students to cross Torkham on Jan 12, and Pakistani authorities also opened the border specifically for them.
However, the students who arrived at Torkham on Jan 13 have not yet been allowed to cross, as Taliban authorities insist that the Pakistani embassy or the consulate in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province, should officially verify the list.
Dr Riazullah Wazir and Amanullah Wazir, representatives of the students in Kabul, said students had met the Nangarhar governor and officials at the Pakistani embassy and the Jalalabad consulate, but the issue remained unresolved.
Dr Noman Amir, the students’ representative in Jalalabad, said the current tensions had multiplied their problems, leaving them stuck in Afghanistan for months. He added that the students could not cross the border despite repeated requests to authorities on both sides.
“Visas of many students have expired, and they cannot travel to Islamabad due to the border closure. Dozens of students are also stuck in Pakistan and are facing difficulties attending exams and classes in Afghanistan,” Dr Amir, a final-year medical student in Jalalabad, told Dawn.
Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul remained in contact with the Pakistani community and assistance was extended to those who approached it.
“We will explore how these 200 students can be facilitated. It is currently winter holidays, and many students may be seeking to return during this time. We will review the situation accordingly after receiving updated information from our embassy,” Mr Andrabi said at his weekly briefing.
However, Dr Amir said that the parents of a couple of students had passed away in Pakistan, but the students were unable to attend their funerals.
“Our exams have ended and winter vacations have already started in Afghanistan, but students still cannot go to Pakistan,” he said. He added that students had contacted officials on both sides, but no one had taken “our problems seriously”.
He appealed to PM Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari to take notice of their situation and find a solution to their problem.
A Pakistani official, requesting not to be identified, told Dawn that the Torkham border was meant to remain open for two days, Jan 12 and 13. He said Pakistan had taken the decision after students stated in a video that the Afghan side had promised to allow them to cross the border.
“We held consultations in Islamabad and decided to open Torkham for our students. But now the Taliban have attached conditions for allowing them to cross,” he said, adding that Pakistan had also agreed to open the border for more students even after Jan 13.
The problem started when students arrived at Torkham on Jan 13 after the first group had already entered Pakistan.
“We spent two nights at Torkham and were hoping to cross the border, but it did not happen,” students said in a video posted online.
One student said the Afghan interior ministry told them to have the list verified with an official stamp from the Pakistani embassy. He claimed that neither the embassy nor the consulate agreed to the demand. However, a consulate official said the mission was in contact with the students as well as officials in Islamabad to resolve the issue.
An official in Islamabad said Pakistan would not make any official communication with the Taliban authorities.
“If they allow the students [to cross], we will open the border crossing,” the official told Dawn.

ABBOTTABAD: Rescue officials remove snow from their vehicle after heavy snowfall blanketed the Galiyat with a coat of white. According to the Met Office, more rain and snowfall is expected in various parts of the country from Sunday.—Dawn

• KKH, other major roads blocked• Murree sees 15 inches of snow• Quetta records coldest night at -13°C• More rain, snow expected from Sunday
CHITRAL/GILGIT/RAWALPINDI/QUETTA: At least nine members of a family were killed when a snow avalanche buried their house in Chitral on Friday, as heavy snowfall, avalanches and landslides brought life to a standstill across Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, blocking roads, stranding travellers and disrupting electricity and relief operations amid freezing temperatures.
The avalanche struck a house in Serigal village of the Damil area in the extreme south of the district on Friday afternoon. Lower Chitral Deputy Comm­issioner Hashim Azim said the bodies were recovered from the debris, while a nine-year-old boy survived and was rushed to hospital.
Officials said the avalanche was triggered after the area received over 20 inches of snowfall, with a huge mass of snow sliding down from a nearby pasture and hitting the isolated house in the sparsely populated mountainous village.
The deceased were identified as Bacha Khan, his wife, three sons, two daughters and two daughters-in-law. They were reportedly dining in the central room of the house when the avalanche struck.
Snowfall continued uninterrupted for more than 36 hours across the Chitral valley, from Arandu to Broghil, severely disrupting daily life. Vehicular traffic was suspended on several roads, including the approach road to the Lowari Tunnel, where thousands of passengers remained stranded for around 18 hours before traffic was restored on Friday evening after snow clearance.
Several roads in Upper and Lower Chitral remain closed due to heavy snowfall. Electricity supply was also disrupted after snowfall at Lowari Top severed the national transmission line connecting Chitral.
Large parts of KP received heavy rain and snowfall during the ongoing weather spell, resulting in road blockages, suspension of power supply and extreme cold. The mountains surrounding the Peshawar valley also received heavy snowfall, triggering a cold wave accompanied by chilly winds.
In Khyber district, a large number of displaced families returning from Tirah were stranded amid a snowstorm. Rescue 1122 said an operation was underway in Tirah Valley, Painda Cheena, Dawatoi and Bagh Maidan.
Gilgit-Baltistan
Meanwhile, fresh snowfall across GB on Friday further worsened conditions, triggering road blockages, power outages and extreme cold across the region.
In Chipurson valley of Gojal, upper Hunza, the situation of earthquake-affected families living in tents deteriorated as snowfall hampered relief activities.
Local residents said hundreds of families were facing severe shortages of food, medicine and heating facilities, with temperatures dropping to below minus 20 degrees Celsius.
Police said five to six inches of snow was recorded in upper areas of Skardu, Astore, Ghanche, Shigar, Ghizer, Kharmang, Diamer, Hunza and Nagar. Major roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Baltistan Highway and Ghizer-Shandur Road, were blocked at multiple locations due to heavy snowfall, avalanches and landslides.
As a result, hundreds of passengers, including women, children and elderly people, were stranded for hours in various areas, particularly in Kohistan, where vehicles were stuck in extreme cold with limited access to food and shelter.
Later, the Kohistan administration cleared parts of the KKH and arranged food and temporary accommodation for stranded passengers.
Authorities said heavy snowfall cut off several communities from road access, while prolonged power outages of over 20 hours were reported in upper areas, forcing residents to struggle for firewood and heating.
Murree records 15 inches of snowfall
Heavy rain accompanied by a hailstorm lashed the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad on Friday, while 15 inches of snowfall was recorded in Murree. Heavy snowfall in Murree intensified the cold, with the temperature dropping to four degrees Celsius. The Met Office said temperatures were likely to fall further in the coming days. Owing to the snowfall, the Murree Expressway was closed.
Around 15 inches of snowfall was recorded in Murree, prompting the district administration to stop the entry of vehicles into the hill station.
Balochistan
Biting cold continued to grip Quetta and several other districts of Balochistan, severely disrupting daily life. Residents of Quetta experienced the coldest night of the current winter season on Thursday as the mercury plunged to minus 13 degrees Celsius, while the absence of gas supply left households struggling to keep warm amid icy Siberian winds that blew throughout the night.
Temperatures dropped sharply, with Kalat recording minus 12 degrees Celsius and Ziarat minus 11 degrees, paralysing routine life in Quetta, Kalat, Ziarat and surrounding areas.
Normal life was severely affected, with people seen searching for gas cylinders to heat their homes as gas pressure remained extremely low.
Water supply through Wasa tube wells was suspended after pipelines burst due to sub-zero temperatures and power outages in various parts of the provincial capital and its surrounding areas.
Roads and streets in Quetta wore a deserted look as most shops in commercial areas remained closed. Traffic remained thin, with most vehicles off the roads.
Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority carried out a timely rescue operation near Muslim Bagh, safely evacuating 17 stranded people, including 14 women and children, who were trapped on a road due to severe weather conditions.
In the Zhob area, army troops assisted the local administration in rescuing people stranded on the N-50 after snow froze on the highway.
Forecast
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has predicted more rain and snowfall in various parts of the country from Sunday night to Tuesday, with daytime temperatures likely to drop during the period.
According to the Met Office, a westerly wave is likely to approach western parts of the country on Jan 25 (Sunday) and is expected to grip the upper parts on Jan 26.
Under the influence of this weather system, rain, wind and thunderstorms with snowfall are expected in most parts of Balochistan on Jan 25 (night) and Jan 26. Upper Sindh, including Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad and Dadu, is likely to receive rain on Jan 26.
Rain, wind and thunderstorms with snowfall, including heavy snowfall at a few places, are also expected in GB and Kashmir. The weather system is also expected to affect several parts of KP and Punjab.

International gold price further swelled by $91 per ounce to $4,923 per ounce, rates issued by All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA) based on interbank exchange rates, revealed.
Rising global rates are under pressure as investors pile into the yellow metal as a safe-haven amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and expectations of further US interest rate cuts.
A steep rise in domestic rates further fades the hopes of genuine gold jewellery buyers during the ongoing wedding season, as many families are unable to afford gold at Rs514,662 per tola. Jewellers complain about the thin presence of buyers in the markets while investors continue to hunt for the precious metal.
Investors must be upbeat as 10-gram and one-tola gold rates have surged by Rs206,671 and Rs241,062, respectively, if compared with the 10-gram and one-tola gold rates at Rs234,568 and Rs273,600 prevailing on Jan 1, 2025.
The world gold price was $2,624, up $2,299 per ounce from the above period.
Silver (24kt) rate had surged to Rs10,275 per tola, up by Rs372, while the 10-gram rate soared to Rs8,809, up by Rs319, owing to an increase in the world silver price to $98 per ounce, up by $3.72.

The agreement was reac­hed as Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met a high-level Somali delegation led by Somalia’s Interior Minister Ali Yusuf at the Ministry of Interior. 
During the meeting, Mr Naqvi announced visa facilitation for Somali citizens tra­velling to Pakistan for medical treatment and education. 
Mr Naqvi assured his cou­nterpart of Pakistan’s full su­­pport to Somalia in policing and counterterrorism. He said Pakistan would extend complete cooperation to So­­m­­alia across multiple sectors.
Mr Yusuf said his country was “facing a difficult situation and was actively fighting terrorists”. He expressed hope that the visit would expand bilateral relations between the two countries. 
Mr Yusuf expressed a str­ong desire to benefit from Pa­­kistan’s experience, noting that Naqvi’s initiatives for Islamabad’s infrastructure development were commendable. Both ministers stressed the need for impro­ved coordination to advance shared interests in various sectors. 
The Somali interior minister formally invited Mr Naqvi to visit Somalia and delivered a special message from the prime minister of Somalia for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

A three-judge SC bench comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Nae­em Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shake­­el Ahmed announced the verdict.  
District and Sessions Judge Aijaz Ali Khaskheli, who joined the Sindh judicial service in 1996, was removed from office in 2016 by then SHC chief justice Sajjad Ali Shah who was later elevated to the Supreme Court and retired upon reaching superannuation in 2022. 
The controversy stemmed from an appeal filed by the former SHC chief justice through the court registrar, seeking clarification on a point of law: whether a service tribunal could interfere with the lawful exercise of discretion by the competent authority, namely the chief justice of the high court, in awarding punishment. 
Mr Khaskheli, who was serving as a judge of the accountability court in Hyderabad at the time, is the respondent in the appeal. 

Three-judge bench sets aside former SHC chief justice’s petition

He was appointed as a civil judge in 1996 and promoted to the rank of district and sessions judge in 2014. In 2016, he was suspended and subsequently dismissed following disciplinary proceedings initiated by the then SHC chief justice on allegations of misconduct. 
The former judicial officer later approached the Sindh Subordinate Judicial Service Tribunal, which had on Sept 30, 2024, ruled in his favour. The tribunal held that the disciplinary proceedings were procedurally flawed and that the penalty of dismissal was disproportionate to the alleged misconduct.
The tribunal also noted that the then chief justice, who was the complainant in the case, had acted as both the initiating and punishing authority, in violation of the principle of nemo judex in causa sua — that no one should be a judge in their own cause. 
The dispute arose after the respondent judge issued what was termed an “unlawful notice” to the then Hyderabad commissioner, seeking his personal attendance. The notice alleged that funds for the construction of a compound wall of a bungalow occupied by the respondent judge had been withheld by the commissioner. 
The commissioner approached the office of the SHC registrar, who brought the matter to the attention of the then chief justice. The respondent judge was subsequently dismissed from service. 
After the service tribunal decided in favour of the respondent judge last year, the matter came before the Supreme Court. The SHC registrar argued that the tribunal’s decision should be overturned, contending that it had erred in applying the law and that the dismissal was justified. 
Conversely, the counsel for the respondent judge submitted that the disciplinary proceedings were fundamentally flawed as the SHC chief justice, who initiated the complaint, also acted as the punishing authority. This, he argued, violated the principles of natural justice. 
The respondent further contended that the disciplinary proceedings were initiated without first repatriating him to his parent department, as required under the Sindh Civil Servants (E&D) Rules, 1973. It was also argued that he was removed without a regular departmental inquiry, which was mandatory under the relevant rules.

According to Dera Ismail Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada, the explosion occurred during a wedding celebration at the residence of the peace committee chief, identified as Noor Alam Mehsud.
The participants were reportedly dancing to the beat of a drum when the attack was carried out. The blast caused the room’s roof to collapse, hampering rescue operations and making it difficult to reach those trapped under the debris.
“The explosion was a suicide blast,” the DPO told Dawn. He said that an emergency had been imposed at the District Headquarter Hospital.
In a statement, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said five bodies and 10 injured had been taken to the hospital.
He said that seven ambulances, a fire vehicle and a disaster vehicle reached the site of the incident soon after it was reported, adding that a rescue operation was under way.
Authorities cordoned off the area and launched an investigation into the incident. Initial reports said peace committee leader Waheedullah Mehsud alias Jigri Mehsud was among the dead.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi strongly condemned the blast and sought a report from the KP inspector general of police. According to a statement, he also directed law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident and identify those responsible.
He said the responsible parties would be brought to justice. “The provincial government shares the grief of the martyrs’ families. All possible assistance will be provided,” he said.
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report into the incident, according to a statement from his office.
“All possible medical assistance should be provided to the injured in the Dera blast,” he was quoted as saying, expressing grief over the incident.
Earlier this month, armed assailants had killed four members of a peace committee in KP’s Bannu district.
In November 2025, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked, also in KP’s Bannu district. Police officials told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Talib’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.

The statement came after the media reports emerged alleging that the YouTube channel had “disappeared”. The reports also said that NA proceedings, which are typically shown live, had not been broadcast on the official YouTube channel or on state television over the past few days.
The reports had emerged as a joint sitting of Parliament was held in Islamabad on Friday.
In the statement posted on X, the NA’s official account said, “It is hereby clarified that reports published and broadcast in newspapers and television channels regarding the shutdown of the NA YouTube channel are incorrect.
“Furthermore, the YouTube channel was not shut down at any point,” the statement said.







“Temporary technical issues occurred due to a social media server outage, which affected accessibility for a limited period have been resolved after Friday, following which the YouTube channel became fully operational again,” the statement said.
It added that the proceedings and the speeches of the joint session of Parliament held earlier in the day had been “duly uploaded” and were available on the YouTube channel.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was among the leaders and senior officials of 19 countries, including Pakistan, who gathered in Davos on Thursday and put their names to the founding charter of the Board of Peace — a move that has been denounced by the opposition.
Trump had originally proposed establishing the board when he announced his plan last September to end the onslaught in Gaza. It was originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year onslaught on the Palestinian enclave, but the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Thursday had defended the move in the National Assembly, saying the country joined the body meant to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding in the interest of the Palestinian people.
The matter was again debated in a joint session of Parliament on Friday, summoned by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier, and presided over by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
Arguing in defence of the government’s decision to join the board during the session, Iqbal said this “diplomatic win” should be celebrated.
He began his speech by recalling nuclear tests by Pakistan in 1998. “We set an example of Pakistan’s liberty and sovereignty when the then-US president called five times […] Pakistan was being pressurised from the world, but we took the decision [to conduct the tests] with courage,” he said.
Amid a noisy protest from the opposition benches, he asserted, “We don’t need to be taught about Pakistan’s defence and integrity. We are the defenders of Pakistan’s freedom and sovereignty.”
He went on to state that with the PML-N in power, “there can be no danger to Pakistan’s integrity and sovereignty.”
Iqbal said the government and armed forces had proved during a four-day conflict with India in May that anyone intending to harm the country would get a befitting reply. “So nobody can taunt that we are cowards and negligent.”
The minister said it was very easy to deliver speeches on Palestine in the House, adding that “our hearts have been wounded by the cruelty” that had been witnessed in the Palestinian enclave.
“But Muslim countries took a collective initiative to end that bloodshed,” he continued, further stating that the opposition was refusing to accept the “peace that the people of Palestine have celebrated”.
He went on to say that had the government decided not to join the Board of Peace, opposition members would have been decrying that Pakistan had been not been given any importance, that it had been isolated. They would have questioned why Pakistan was not a part of that big an initiavtive of peace, Iqbal said.
Listing other Muslim countries that joined the Board of Peace, Iqbal asked were they not Muslim countries and brother countries of Pakistan. “Have they joined [the Board of Peace] to contribute to the bloodshed of Muslims?”
The minister said prominent Muslim countries were given a chance through this initiative to play their role for the rights of the people of Palestine and for peace in Palestine.
He stressed that the government’s stance was the same as that of the people of Pakistan: “that Israel was an aggressor and a cruel country, which — Netanyahu has the blood of Muslims and Palestinians on his hands.”
“Our moral stance has not changed at all,” he said, adding that the government decided to join the board on the basis of this stance. “So that we can play our role along with our brother countries for peace in Palestine.”
He said that a major reason behind “the halt to bombardment” in Palestine was the role of eight Muslim countries that worked with the Trump administration on a ceasefire plan for Gaza.
“And the people [of Palestine] accepted that ceasefire, and they appreciated that the ensuing peace gave them an opportunity to begin their lives anew,” he maintained.
The minister added: “Our stance regarding Palestine is unchanged. We still believe that the state of Palestine is the right of the people of Palestine. Pakistan supported this in the past and, it supports it today as well.”
Speaking before Iqbal, Senate Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas took exception to the government’s decision to join the Board of Peace without taking Parliament into confidence.
“The board will further add to the miseries of the people of Palestine. What Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu could not do will begin in the name of Board of Peace,” he decried.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also voiced opposition to the decision, claiming it was taken because of the “fear of Trump”.
He accused the US president of strengthening Israel against Muslim countries such as Iran.
Earlier, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza submitted an adjournment motion in the Senate, seeking discussion on Pakistan joining US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking the parliament or cabinet into confidence.
In a post on X, the JUI-F Senator said, “An adjournment motion has been submitted in the Senate on behalf of JUI-F regarding Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace.”







“The House may adjourn its normal business in order to discuss an issue of public importance, whereby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. issued a statement, i.e. ‘Pakistan will join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace to help achieve lasting peace in Gaza’ without taking the Parliament into confidence or without placing the matter before the Cabinet,” the motion read.
It added that such an approach was “against the saying of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.”
Joint session passes 3 bills
The joint session also saw the passage of three bills — the Daanish Schools Authority Bill 2025, the Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025 — amid protest by the opposition.
During the session, opposition members, led by opposition leaders in the Senate and NA — Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — gathered near the speaker’s dias and protested against the bills.
President Zardari had returned these bills last month despite their passage by the Senate and the NA. With regards to the Daanish Schools Authority Bill, a statement by the Presidency had quoted Zardari as saying: “In the case of the establishment of Daanish schools in the provinces, prior consultation with the respective provincial governments is essential.”
A day earlier, according to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, the government had already taken other allied parties into confidence on the matter and assured them that all three bills would be passed in the joint sitting.
The PML-N leader said that he and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had met a PPP delegation, comprising Sherry Rehman, Naveed Qamar, and Farooq H. Naek, to assure the ruling partner that the proposed legislation would not impact the 18th Amendment, which had devolved education to provinces.
When the Daanish Schools Authority Bill was presented in the joint sitting, the JUI-F objected to it.
JUI-F Senator Murtaza contended that President Zardari had returned the bill unsigned and had termed it contrary to the Constitution.
The bill, however, was passed.
The Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025 was presented by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chaudhry while PPP MNA Shazia Marri also proposed an amendment in the legislation, both of which were approved.
The JUI-F also recommended some amendments to the bill, which were rejected.
PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui presented the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill, which was passed amid protest by opposition members.
JUI-F chief Rehman termed the legislation “unconstitutional and unlawful”, calling for it to be referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology. He said the bill was contrary to Islam.
In the legislation’s defence, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry contended that the bill would provide protection to not just women but men as well.
Gul Plaza inferno
In the joint sitting, members of both Houses of Parliament passed a resolution expressing solidarity with the victims of Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno, calling on the Sindh government to introduce “systemic reforms” ensuring that the tragedy is not repeated.
The fire that erupted at Gul Plaza last week has left at least 67 people dead in its wake. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
In the resolution passed today, the parliament expressed solidarity with the families of the victims and took note of the “reported shortcomings that turned an accident into a mass tragedy,” calling for systemic reforms.
“The Parliament offers its heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families of the deceased and prays for the swift recovery of the injured,” the resolution read.
It also paid tribute to firefighter Furqan Ali, who embraced martyrdom while battling the deadly fire.
In the joint resolution, the parliament urged the Sindh government to “ensure compensation to the families of victims and immediate recovery of the businesses affected.”
“Immediately undertake a city-wide emergency fire-risk audit of all commercial and residential buildings,” the resolution read, adding that the number of fire stations and firefighting equipment should be increased as well.
It also called upon the federal government to “facilitate and provide necessary support to the Provincial Government of Sindh in this crisis situation.”
The parliament vowed to “stand in unanimous solidarity with the people of Karachi and the victims’ families in this hour of immense grief”.
It further demanded that “lasting action” should be taken so that “lives lost in Gul Plaza will not go in vain.”
Senator Sherry Rehman calls on govt to play its part
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in her address to the joint session, expressed support for the resolution, calling on the federal government to play its part in supporting Karachi.
“Gul Plaza tragedy has been heartbreaking for all of us,” she said, adding that it was particularly difficult for “families who were awaiting the recovery of their loved ones’ bodies”.
During her address, the PPP leader underscored the need for readjusting resources as per population.
Taking note of MQM-P’s demand of handing over Karachi to the federal government, she said, “PPP has many, many contributions to Karachi, and while everyone has a right to criticise, do not add fuel to the fire”.
She urged MQM-P to “not engage in politics over dead bodies, rather help us in the recovery efforts”.
Achakzai condemns Imaan and Hadi’s arrest
Opposition leader in the NA Achakzai, while speaking in the National Assembly today, condemned the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, stating that “targeting political dissenters violated the Constitution”.
The couple was arrested earlier today in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts.
Achakzai stressed that the “freedom of expression and basic civil rights were being continuously curtailed in the country”.
“Using the law to protect the interests of a powerful class was unfortunate,” Acahkzai maintained, adding that such acts “severely undermined the public’s trust in state institutions”.
Achakzai demanded their release, calling for a “transparent and impartial” investigation into the arrest.</p><small>2026-01-23 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/23180124ac33f43.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968597/lawyers-imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chattha-sent-to-jail-on-judicial-remand-following-arrest-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chattha sent to jail on judicial remand following arrest in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Hours after the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha on Friday, the couple was sent to jail on judicial remand by an anti-terrorism court.
The development came in a case registered against the two for protesting outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and allegedly manhandling the IHC Bar Association (IHCBA) president.
Strict security was enforced during the proceedings and lawyers and media persons were not allowed to enter the courtroom.
The case was heard by ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Muhammad Zulqarnain.
It should be mentioned that prior to Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday morning, the two had spent three nights at the office of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani.
Their arrest subsequently prompted lawyers’ bodies to announce a complete strike, strongly condemning the action.
Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court on Friday in the controversial social media posts case, in which Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Afzal Majoka had cancelled their bail on January 15 and issued their arrest warrants on January 16.
According to IHCBA officials, Imaan and Hadi, along with the bar association’s president, had gone to surrender before IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar today.
However, they were informed by court staff that the chief justice was not present. They then returned to the bar association and later left for the district courts in an IHCBA vehicle, the officials said.
As the convoy left the IHC premises, police vehicles already deployed outside the building for the past three days began following them. Near the underpass located in front of Serena Hotel, police intercepted the vehicle, arrested the couple and shifted them to an undisclosed location.
Outside the Women Police Station, IHCBA President Gilani said that a new first information report (FIR) had been registered three days earlier against the two lawyers.

 

He said that while the IHC had granted relief in one case, other matters were pending before Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, where the accused were required to appear.
Meanwhile, IHCBA members alleged that despite assurances from the administration that the lawyers would not be arrested, police intercepted them and used force during the arrest.
They claimed that police personnel assaulted the lawyers, forcibly opened vehicle doors, and manhandled Imaan during her arrest. The IHCBA expressed concern for her safety and alleged misconduct by law enforcement officials.
IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said he was assured that the couple would not be arrested until they surrendered before the trial court. He resigned in protest over the arrest.
Talking to Dawn, Jajja said that he has submitted his resignation to the Islamabad Bar Council.
He said that the quarters concerned assured them of giving the couple a safe passage to face the trial. “Following the arrest, I have decided to quit from the office,” he said.
Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Majoka adjourned the hearing of the controversial social media posts case against the couple due to their absence.
The court observed that the right to cross-examination could be closed if the accused failed to appear. Prosecutor Rana Usman informed the court that the accused were deliberately avoiding proceedings.
Judge Majoka directed that cross-examination be completed by 3:30pm on Saturday, stating that sufficient time had already been granted.
On Tuesday, the IHC — which Imaan and Hadi had approached for their bail in the social media posts case — had declared Judge Majoka’s arrest order against the two null and void and directed that the accused be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses.
The court categorically clarified that Imaan and Hadi should not be arrested in the case. However, the court had also observed that if the accused failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted by the IHC would stand automatically terminated.
‘Fascism at its peak’
Earlier today, former minister and Imaan’s mother, Shireen Mazari, confirmed in a series of posts on X that her daughter had been arrested by police personnel, saying that she and her husband “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations.”
The former lawmaker claimed that no first information report (FIR) was shown by the police and the bar association, “sadly, could do nothing”.
“Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!” Mazari added in a post on X.







Mazari also shared videos showing police vehicles trailing the lawyers’ car, with officers stopping the vehicle and opening its doors.







In a separate post, Mazari claimed the police “used violence on the bar leaders, [including] breaking the windows of the car, etc”.
“All [because] the Twitter case had been exposed and more embarrassment would have followed in further [cross-examination] today,” the former minister said.
“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari alleged in another post.
In a post at around 4:15pm, Mazari shared today’s court order and said: “So Imaan and Hadi were covertly presented in ATC just now, but lawyers were not allowed in and no one has been allowed to see this FIR, although the judge has ordered it be given to their lawyers. But they are being denied. Also no idea to which jail they will be taken.”







In a subsequent post, she alleged: “Just learnt they were never even presented before the judge — kept in vehicle and taken away in the same vehicle so one could see what state they are in after violence was done on them during the arrest and maybe after arrest too. As good as a forced disappearance.”
At around 5:30pm, Mazari posted that she had no idea where “my daughter and her husband have been taken or what state they are in after the violence perpetrated on them during the arrest and possibly after arrest also”.
“Our lawyers had taken water and some dry fruits for them and medicine for Imaan but were denied access. Enforced Disappearance!” she claimed.







‘Illegal and unconstitutional move’
Earlier, Mazari also shared a video message of IHCBA President Gilani, who was with Imaan at the time of the arrest.







“We spoke to the authorities yesterday and other institutions, and they made a commitment that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha will not be arrested and will be given safe passage to go to the district court,” said the bar president in a video posted on X.
He said that, fearing arrest, the lawyers went to IHC Chief Justice Dogar and “informed him that there was a possibility we would be stopped; however, the chief justice did not hold court today.”
Gilani said Imaan and Hadi, along with their lawyers, were on their way to the sessions court when their vehicles came “under attack by police” as soon as they passed by Serena Chowk.
The IHCBA president claimed that the police subjected the lawyers to violence and broke the vehicles’ windows, forcing Imaan and Hadi out of the car.
He further said that male personnel grabbed Imaan and pushed her into the police vehicle.







Gilani also alleged that the police officials “pushed down [IHCBA] Secretary Jajja and beat him”.
He called on the lawyers of both the IHC and the sessions court to reach the Sitara Market Women’s Police Station — where he said Imaan was being held — and observe a strike.
“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani asserted.
Calling it a “very major incident for Islamabad”, Gilani emphasised that lawyers “guard the country’s integrity and law”.



The IHCBA, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrest of the lawyer couple.
The IHCBA and Islamabad Bar Association announced a strike for Friday, while the IBC called on lawyers to observe a strike on Saturday.
The IBA added that it held an emergency meeting in light of the “illegal and unconstitutional move” to arrest the duo. The body called on authorities to “immediately release” the arrested lawyers.
“The Islamabad Bar Association believes that every Pakistani has the right to defend themselves in the court,” the statement read, terming the arrest a “violation of fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and law”.



The IBC condemned the “highly reprehensible conduct, including misbehaviour, assault and torture, perpetrated by the police officials” against Gilani and Jajja during the incident.
It considered such actions “to be a blatant misuse of authority, aimed at harassing advocates and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion within the legal community”.
The IBC demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release, a transparent and independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved, and “strict disciplinary action against all those responsible for the misbehaviour, high-handedness and use of force”.
Separately, eight newly elected members of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) called on lawyers’ bodies, including the PBC and the Supreme Court Bar Association, to condemn the “malicious persecution” of Imaan and Hadi.
In a joint statement, Abid Shahid Zuberi, Shafqat Mehmood Chohan, Qazi Muhammad Arshad, Munir A Khan Kakar, Salman Akram Raja, Salahuddin Ahmad, Abdus Sattar Khan and Muhammad Maqsood Buttar urged lawyers’ bodies to protest the duo’s arrest and stand in solidarity with them at all forums.
“We call upon the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and all other lawyers’ bodies to perform their duty and unequivocally condemn this malicious persecution of human rights defenders and to vigorously protest and stand in solidarity with Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha before all forums,” said the single-page statement.
It added: “We are absolutely clear this brave couple is being punished solely for the sins of professionally representing victims of state oppression and speaking out against ongoing human rights abuses in Pakistan in order to set an example for others.”
Cases against the duo
Imaan and Hadi have recently mainly defended themselves in a case that pertains to controversial social media posts. The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad.
They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year.
ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances.
Subsequently, Imaan and Hadi challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.
The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

 

Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, relating to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case.
Separately, on Thursday, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025 — the same case in which they were arrested today.

Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed issued an updated list of 71 deceased. Of the 16 identified so far, nine were identified through DNA tests, which have been performed for 49 samples.
The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some sections collapsed.
As more bodies were recovered from different parts of the building, officials cautioned that the final toll can only be determined once the identification of the remains is completed.
Meanwhile, officials expressed the hope to complete their search efforts on Friday.
South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso told reporters that the search operation was in the “final stages”. “The search in the wreckage will be completed today,” he said.
Stating that a total of 77 missing persons had been reported, he said the recovery efforts were being made under the supervision of the Sindh Building and Control Authority’s (SBCA) team.

 

The director general (DG) of Sindh Rescue 1122, Brigadier (retd) Wajid Sibghatullah Mahar, said rescue personnel were to continue their recovery efforts in “10 to 15 per cent” of the building’s area that they had been unable to access before.
“There are some concerns that we have not been able to reach the ground floor, where the fire erupted. We hope to find bodies from there,” the Rescue 1122 DG told the media.
Defending Rescue 1122’s efforts, Mahar asserted that the teams had modern equipment, the inferno had turned into a third-degree fireby the time rescue personnel reached the site.
The official further said that 15 to 20 people were rescued and evacuated when the blaze erupted.
“Either the fire safety system was not present in the building, or it was not activated,” Mahar said. He revealed that the latest technology had been used over the past three days to aid the search process, in order to locate any individual who survived the blaze.
The Rescue 1122 DG added that based on the information so far, the fire erupted in a flower shop, from where it spread through the duct. However, he added, the police were still investigating why the fire spread quickly.
CM Murad announces major relief, accountability measures after Gul Plaza tragedy
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also briefed the provincial assembly on the incident on Friday, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab in attendance.
Recalling that Rs10 million had been announced for the family of each deceased individual, CM Murad said the required funds have been released and handed over to the Karachi commissioner for distribution.
About the committee formed to estimate the losses faced by the businesses at Gul Plaza, he said the Sindh Assembly would compensate the affected people.
The Sindh CM announced Rs500,000 in “immediate” financial assistance for the 1,102 shops approved by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) at Gul Plaza, and if any others had any proper documentation.
“This is for their sustenance so that they can stand back on their feet, as the rest of the programme can take two to three months,” he noted.



The chief minister further revealed that after some ministers’ efforts, 500 shops were made available in one building and 350 in another, whose owners have said they will not take any rent for one year.
“My effort is to make arrangements for them (shop occupants/renters) to get makeshift shops for two years,” Murad said.
He went on to announce that the Sindh government, through the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, would arrange the “security/collateral” for the affected people and pay the interest if someone wanted Rs10m in loans.
The Sindh CM said Gul Plaza would likely be demolished and then rebuilt, with each shop getting the same area size it previously had. He added that the Sindh government would aim to reconstruct them within two years.
The chief minister also stated that an audit will be conducted and non-compliant buildings would be given a “brief period” to comply, failing which they would be sealed.
He further said that he has directed the provincial law minister to draft legislation for making insurance mandatory.
‘FIR to be registered based on info so far’
CM Murad informed the Sindh Assembly that the fire erupted at a ground-floor shop at 10:14pm on January 17, with the first call received by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) from a shop owner’s son.

The first fire brigade was dispatched at 10:27pm from a fire station near the Civil Hospital Karachi, Murad said, adding that Rescue 1122 received the first call at 10:36pm. “We have also verified these records through CCTV.”
The Sindh CM said that he has issued directives to a minister to register a first information report (FIR) of the incident based on the information so far.
“Whoever is responsible for this will be punished,” he vowed, adding that he was withholding some details for now.
“Wherever government institutions have any negligence, they will get punishment accordingly […] including me, if I have been negligent.”
The chief minister also noted that people had gathered at the site in large numbers despite being told not to when the rescue operation began.
During his address, CM Murad also took a jibe at those “politicising” the incident and bringing up the topic of the 18th Amendment — an apparent reference to remarks made by leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P).

 

At this point, Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Muhammad Farooq interrupted the chief minister’s speech, at which Sindh Assembly Speaker Syed Awais Qadir Shah repeatedly asked the former to sit down or leave the hall.
Later during his speech, the chief minister asserted, “They do not understand the Constitution […] Where is it written that the Centre can control any part of a province? There is no such thing.”
The chief minister also went into the history of Gul Plaza, noting that the then-Karachi Municipal Committee had transferred the place in the name of the East India Company in 1884. In the 1980s, the building was sold with the then-Karachi Building Control Authority approving the plans for it.
Pointing out that the 99-year lease was not renewed as due in 1983, the Sindh CM said it was finally renewed in 1991 — “after the building had been constructed”.
“Who was the Karachi mayor on 28/9/1991 who approved the lease before the 18th Amendment?” Murad asked, adding that it was Farooq Sattar. He also noted that an ordinance was passed in 2001, followed by the regularisation of shops with the mayor’s approval in 2003.
Sindh governor to recommend martyred fireman for Sitara-i-Imtiaz
Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori visited the residence of firefighter Furqan Ali, who was also killed in the incident, to offer condolences to the bereaved family and expressed profound grief and sorrow. According to a press release, the governor prayed for the elevation of the martyr’s ranks and for patience and strength for the family.
Talking to the media, Tessori said that the nation would never forget Ali’s sacrifice.

 

“The governor announced that a formal recommendation will be sent to the president of Pakistan and the federal cabinet for awarding a civil award (Sitara-i-Imtiaz) to martyred firefighter Furqan Ali,” he said.
He further announced that the martyr’s widow would be provided a residential plot in a Smart City project, with construction to be completed by the builder.
Governor Sindh also announced that, in memory of Ali, the road in front of his residence would be named after him.
He also asserted that a transparent judicial inquiry into the incident was essential. He said that the victims’ families were still awaiting DNA reports, while thousands of families had been deprived of their livelihoods due to the tragedy.
He stressed that the blame game must stop and those responsible for negligence must be punished. He added that he is writing a letter to the Supreme Court, requesting a transparent judicial inquiry into the Gul Plaza tragedy, the handout said.</p><small>2026-01-23 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/23205949d051670.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968629/barbs-fly-in-senate-as-ptis-ali-zafar-demands-probe-into-institutional-overreach-election-fraud' target='_blank'><strong>Barbs fly in Senate as PTI’s Ali Zafar demands probe into ‘institutional overreach, election fraud’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Barbs flew in the Senate on Friday with the opposition taking the government to task over its policies and demanding a parliamentary probe into “institutional overreach” and “election fraud”.
In response, the government accused the opposition of committing “economic terrorism” while also chiding it for the Results Transmission System (RTS) fiasco in the 2018 general polls.
Speaking on a calling-attention notice, PTI’s Ali Zafar, the party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said Parliament had been made irrelevant and meaningless.
His speech was interrupted several times by the members of the treasury benches, who loudly objected to his remarks.
“Matters pertaining to the country’s economy, security and foreign policy are not brought before Parliament; [instead] decisions are taken in drawing rooms,” he said, regretting that even agreements linked to the country’s future were signed while keeping Parliament in the dark.
“This is a betrayal of the constitutional concept of civilian supremacy,” he asserted. Noting that all the lawmakers were under oath to protect the Constitution, he called for regaining lost civilian space.
“Will this Senate remain a rubber stamp or will it rise to face the storm? Let us ensure that the law is not merely the law of the powerful but the law of the land,” he remarked.
Zafar said that a full-blown constitutional crisis had occurred after the February 8, 2024 general election.
He said that despite the country’s people giving a clear decision on election day, an “attack” was carried out on democracy.
“The people’s mandate was not only ignored but was systematically destroyed through violence and manipulation,” he said, adding that this struck at the heart of democracy itself.
“This is against the very principle articulated by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah when he addressed the first Constituent Assembly on August 11, 1947 and said, ‘The authority of the government is conditional upon the will and consent of the people’,” he said.
“The same was also stated by our first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, who said, ‘The greatest pillar of democracy is the free will of the people. The will is the foundation of the Constitution’.”
Zafar went on to say that he was not raising the complaint as the representative of a particular political party. “This is the bell [signalling] national danger,” he said.
Zafar stressed that when the mandate of the people was crushed, the government that would be “installed” would lack both legal power and moral authority.
“Such a government cannot take hard decisions, cannot unite the nation, and can not lead the country through a crisis,” he remarked.
He termed the incumbent government a “house built on sand”, saying it was bound to collapse.
The PTI parliamentary leader also raised alarm over what he called the “economic slaughter” of the people of Pakistan.
“Inflation is not a mere statistic or economic indicator. It is a sword hanging over the head of every citizen,” he said. The PTI leader further said that public debt was not just increasing, it was also ensuring that future generations would wear the “shackles of slavery”.
“This government survives only on debt … they are not here to distribute progress, they are here to distribute misery,” he said, pointing out that public debt had risen to Rs80 trillion.
“What is their plan? Is the plan only to tax those who are already burdened with taxes? … What is the vision for increasing exports? What arrangements have been made to create jobs for our youth? Where is the strategy to harness our immense potential in information technology? Where is the support for small and medium enterprises, the backbone of our economy?” he asked.
“This government doesn’t have a policy or governance … only drift, confusion, and the dark clouds of an approaching storm,” he said.
Expressing concern over the ongoing brain drain, he said, the best minds in the country were leaving because they saw no hope, no justice, and no future. He also said industries were relocating, production was decreasing and investment was fleeing the country.
In his speech, Zafar also said that the country’s laws were being weaponised.
“Cases are not being filed, they are being manufactured. A court case has become a punishment itself. This is political victimisation which is destroying the last remnants of public trust in the state,” he asserted.
Zafar said the consequences of this were visible in the country’s foreign policy.
“We have abandoned our principled stance on Kashmir,” he said, pointing out that Pakistan did not have a clear position on Venezuela or Iran.
He said that a new world order was emerging and in the face of this new reality, every nation needed to defend its sovereignty and its “strategic autonomy”.
“Every step we take, we have to think it through. The government will be required Parliament’s guidance at every step; you cannot go forward without Parliament’s guidance,” he said.
However, at the same time, it was important for the government to have the public’s trust. “Without the public’s trust, you cannot take any step. And this you can only get when Imran Khan comes because the nation stands with him,” he said.
Zafar continued that the PTI was not just the opposition but rather an “alternative government”, and had the plans to steer the country out of the economic quagmire.
He demanded that a special parliamentary committee be constituted to investigate the serious allegations of election fraud and “institutional overreach”. He also said the House should pass a resolution rejecting the government’s policies that crush the country’s poor and deepen inequality.
In response to Zafar’s speech, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani sharply criticised the economic policies pursued by the PTI government between 2018 and 2022, saying repeated policy failures during that period pushed millions of Pakistanis below the poverty line and brought the country to the brink of default.
He said the past PTI-government changed four finance ministers, noting that while an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme was initially rejected, it was later accepted on weak terms and eventually sabotaged for political reasons.
Kayani alleged that when the PTI- led government realised it was losing power, it deliberately undermined the IMF agreement despite being aware that such actions could push the country towards default.
The minister said the present government, after assuming office, took difficult but necessary decisions to revive the IMF programme, rebuild trust with international partners and avert sovereign default.
Despite resistance and repeated attempts to derail the process, he said, the government succeeded in stabilising the economy.
He said former ministers belonging to the PTI resorted to “economic terrorism” by writing letters to the IMF to derail the programme.
The minister said that the government was committed to ensuring sustainable economic growth, expanding employment opportunities and putting Pakistan on a stable and resilient economic path.
Kayani claimed that the government had successfully steered the country away from default, restored economic stability and was now focused on achieving sustainable growth and creating jobs.
Kayani also said the PTI should apologise to the nation for their repeated attempts to push Pakistan towards default and trying to derail the IMF programme.</p><small>2026-01-23 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646821-heavy-snowfall-disrupts-pakistans-north-murree-tirah-chilas-quetta-affected' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy snowfall disrupts Pakistan's north; Murree, Tirah, Chilas, Quetta affected</strong></a><br><p>
