At least 198 people lost their lives and several remained missing as flash floods wreaked havoc across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
 






“The prime minister directed the NDMA to continue its cooperation with the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the PDMA, to provide them with all possible support in the rescue and relief operation and to utilise all resources for this,” a statement issued by Prime Minister’s Office read.
NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik briefed the prime minister on the damage caused by cloudbursts, flash floods in the upper parts of the country as well as the rescue and relief operation.
The prime minister directed the NDMA chairman to further coordinate with the KP provincial government for rescue and relief activities.
“Tents, medicines, food items and other relief materials should be delivered to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government immediately,” the prime minister directed the NDMA chairman.
The premier further ordered that relief materials should be sent through trucks on a priority basis immediately.
“People and tourists stranded in the flood-affected areas should be immediately taken to safe places.”
The prime minister was briefed on the progress of the rescue and relief operation, along with the assessment of the damage, during the meeting.
PM Shehbaz also had a telephone conversation with KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and expressed grief over the loss of precious lives due to the recent cloudburst and flash floods in KP.
He told Gandapur that the federal government will provide all possible assistance to the provincial government.
The prime minister also held a telephone conversation with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
“Our sympathies are with the victims in this hour of difficulty,” the prime minister said.
Since late June, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country — especially KP and northern regions — by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Yesterday, over a dozen people were killed as rains and flooding ripped through the country’s northern parts, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
In Muzaffarabad, a massive landslide in Sarli Sacha village hit a home, leaving six members of a family buried and feared dead. Torrential rains claimed the lives of two more women in AJK’s Bagh and Sudhnoti districts.
In GB, flash floods killed at least eight people, with two still missing in the Ghizer district, while also devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.
Similarly, a spell of heavy downpour lashed various parts of Abbottabad district yesterday, triggering flash floods that severely disrupted traffic flow and caused damage to infrastructure.
At least 325 people, including 142 children, had died and 743 others injured since June 26 in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan, according to daily data from the NDMA.</p><small>2025-08-15 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1518122121718aa.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931033/kp-devastated-by-flash-floods-as-198-lives-lost-5-killed-in-rescue-helicopter-crash' target='_blank'><strong>KP devastated by flash floods as 198 lives lost, 5 killed in rescue helicopter crash</strong></a><br><p>At least 198 people lost their lives and several remained missing as flash floods wreaked havoc across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Friday, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Since late June, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country — especially KP and northern regions — by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
The province-wide deaths included 172 men, 14 women and 12 children, with Buner witnessing the highest number of deaths, 91, according to the PDMA. The data added that 45 homes, three schools and eight other structures were destroyed amid the deluge, with 26 homes being destroyed in Swat alone.
According to the PDMA report, “37 houses were partially destroyed and seven were completely destroyed.”
The report added that heavy rain in the area is likely to continue intermittently until August 21.
“On the special instructions of the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, relief funds have been released for the districts affected by rains and flash floods,” the report read.
“A total of Rs500 million has been released for the districts most affected by floods,” it added, stating that Rs150m has been released for Buner district, Rs100m each for Bajaur, Battagram and Mansehra districts and Rs50m for Swat.
The PDMA added that it ordered the relevant institutions and bodies to intensify rescue efforts and dispatched letters to district administrations to take precautions ahead of the upcoming weather.
In the evening, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur issued a video statement where he said that all departments and institutions are engaged in rescue operations, which are being monitored from a control room set up at CM House in Peshawar.
“The province, especially in the Malakand and Hazara regions, has been hit by terrible floods due to cloudbursts and rain,” he said. “As a result, many lives have been lost due to various accidents.
“Two helicopters of the provincial government were working to rescue people, but one of these helicopters met with a tragic accident due to bad weather. Five crew members were martyred.”
The CM outlined that the district administrations and all provincial government departments are actively engaged and “ensuring all measures to protect the lives and property of the people”.
“The administration of the affected districts, as well as others, has also been put on high alert and safety measures are being taken,” he added. “Heavy machinery has been deployed in the affected areas for rescue operations and to clear blocked roads.”
The CM added that provincial lawmakers are in the affected areas and coordinating with local officials.
“In this hour of difficulty, the provincial government stands with its people,” Gandapur said. “The provincial government will fully repair the damage caused by these natural disasters and the public is urged to cooperate with the administration.”
Meanwhile, the KP Health Department issued a pair of notifications — available with Dawn.com — declaring a health emergency in the districts of Buner, Swat, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Bajaur and Mohmand and the establishment of flood control rooms and disease data-sharing centres in hospitals across KP.
The notification declaring a health emergency in all hospitals in the aforementioned districts stated that the step had been taken “to prevent [the] outbreak of communicable diseases and effectively monitor risks to the health of the affected population”.
It added that all healthcare staff were to be put on high alert and cancel their leaves to ensure adequate staffing for the provision of healthcare to victims.
The second notification, addressed to all hospitals in KP, ordered the establishment of flood control rooms in order to ensure the availability of medicines and the functioning of medical equipment.
“In light of the anticipated rise in fatalities and injuries, as well as the increasing cases of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, you are requested to nominate a focal person from your district who will be responsible for providing daily updates to the health directorate,” the notification read.
Earlier, the KP government dispatched a helicopter with supplies to Bajaur district, but said that it lost contact with the aircraft. It later confirmed in a statement that the helicopter had crashed and two pilots and three crew were killed.
 






“As a result of this tragic accident, five passengers, including two pilots, were martyred,” the statement read, quoting Gandapur.
“The provincial government has called for a day of mourning tomorrow and flags will be flown at half mast,” the statement added. “Rescue teams have been dispatched to the crash site and the martyrs will be buried with full honours.”
In an earlier statement, the CM was quoted as saying that contact with the helicopter had been lost due to “bad weather”.
 


Buner Deputy Commissioner Kashif Qayum Khan told Dawn.com that 78 people had lost their lives, while “several” were missing. A PDMA daily situation report seen by Dawn.com confirmed the casualties, with 75 men, two women and a child among the deceased.
He added that an emergency has been declared across the district as relief efforts continue in flood-affected areas.
“Helicopters are being used to carry out rescue operations in remote and inaccessible regions,” he said, adding that in Pir Baba Bazaar and the adjoining neighbourhood, floodwaters have completely submerged the area.
“A mosque in Gokand was destroyed and a large number of livestock perished,” he added. “Several roads remain blocked, and the exact number of missing persons has yet to be confirmed.”

Officials said the true figure would only be known once floodwaters receded.
Other most-impacted districts included Bajaur — located in the same Malakand Division as Buner — where eight children were among 21 killed and eight were injured due to flash floods, the PDMA report said.
Incidents related to lightning strikes took the lives of 15 men in Battagram, while 14 deaths and two injuries were reported in Mansehra due to floods.
In Swat, flash floods and thunder strikes claimed 11 lives, the PDMA report added. A roof collapse left five men dead and three wounded in Lower Dir, while two men were killed and as many were injured in a similar incident in Shangla.
The KP government said a provincial govt MI-17 rescue helicopter had reached Buner to evacuate people to safe areas.
 






Meanwhile, Muhammad Sohail, a media coordinator for Rescue 1122, told Dawn.com that more than 157 bodies have so far been recovered, while over 100 people, including women and children, have been rescued and moved to safe locations.
“The situation is at its worst and rescue operations are continuing in the affected areas, as authorities work to reach stranded residents and provide relief,” he said.
Speaking to Geo News, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi responded in the affirmative when asked whether an emergency should be declared. An official notification for that is yet to be issued.
PTI MNA Gohar Ali Khan, who is from Malakand Division’s Buner district, told Geo News: “We have sent rescue teams but reaching the points is also difficult.”
 






Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed condolences over the loss of life and the flooding, as well as the helicopter crash, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The Sindh CM spoke with Kundi and KP CM Gandapur, conveying the Sindh government’s solidarity and offering any assistance.
“Medical treatment facilities have been made available in Karachi for those injured in the floods, underscoring Sindh’s dedication to aiding affected communities,” he said.
Buner District Police Officer (DPO) also told Dawn.com in an earlier statement that 54 bodies were brought to a Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the relevant authorities to accelerate the rescue operation in Battagram district. In a statement, he expressed grief over the deaths and prayed for those who lost their lives in the flash flood.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur spoke to the Hazara commissioner and Battagram DC on the phone and directed that the district administration officials reach the site to supervise the rescue operations, his government said.
 






Floods wreak havoc in Bajaur, Battagram, Mansehra
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, Battagram Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Khan said the casualties occurred after five houses were destroyed last night due to a lightning strike in Neel Band village, which is located on the border of Battagram and Mansehra districts.
In Bajaur earlier today, there were “reports of several people injured in flash floods”, which were caused by a cloudburst (heavy rainfall) in Salarzai tehsil’s Jabrarai village“, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi told Dawn.com.
“Rescue 1122 personnel, with the cooperation of residents, have so far recovered 16 bodies and rescued three injured from the rubble and rainwater,” Faizi confirmed, stating an earlier toll.
A search and rescue operation was underway under the supervision of Bajaur District Emergency Officer Amjad Khan as seven people remained missing, Faizi said, citing locals. DEO Amjad Khan and the station house in-charge were personally supervising the operation, the Rescue 1122 official added.
 


The deluge in Battagram affected villages located on the border areas of Neel Band, Sarim and Malkal Gali, according to a statement issued by Battagram Rescue 1122 spokesperson Aziz Khan.
“The ongoing rescue efforts are facing challenges due to intermittent rain and a near-total loss of mobile network coverage, severely impacting communication,” the statement explained.
In Lower Dir, five people died and four were wounded when the roof of a house in the Maidan area’s Suri Pao village collapsed due to heavy rain, Faizi said.
Detailing the hurdles, the rescue official said: “The rescue team reached the scene after walking for three hours despite heavy rain, flooded rails, difficult and bad roads.”

Just imagine!! Last month, the university further promoted and confirmed a ‘lifelong’ research position. I will not tell what it is named.
The last time I flew in on our national airline trip, it was a disaster. Oh it was delayed several times with an unannounced departure. Not surprised. No wonder it was banned. The seats were reshuffled, disgraceful food quality, insipid tea (… most like cold tea, Sir!), the lights inside going crazy and snappy crew reassuring the aircraft will not crash. It was a delight to enter the dust-bowl skies of Lahore and the searing heat. For once, the Begum literally looked red.
Before leaving for Lahore I visited a sub-continental eatery in Cambridge called ‘Dishoom’, which started pre-Partition in Bombay (Mumbai), then opened a branch in Karachi and then moved to London and finally to Cambridge.
It is a Parsi-owned eatery and if you tell them that you are from Lahore, they get excited. The manager came and commented: “From Lahore I see. Then you understand food”. “What is your order?” he asked. “Maghaz and Mash Ki Daal’. He looked at the chef and said: “Exactly as I predicted”. I smiled and he smiled. “Slightly low on chillies and lots of ginger cuttings”. He commented: “Excellent”.
 
 

A few British students sitting next to us kept peeping at our order, wondering just what we had ordered. So we got going and let me tell you the food was amazing. The maghaz, as requested, was not cut into small pieces and the daal was dry and well-cooked. The naans were fine and suddenly I was propelled to Lahore.
Now back to my old method of marking a food experience. It seems ‘The Guardian’ of London loves my markings, what to speak of desi food choices. So here we go. The system operates on an average of any number of variables, depending on the nature of the outlet, with ‘One’ being ‘unacceptable’ and ‘Nine’ being excellent. The average of the combined score is the rating.
For ambience of the eatery it is 5, for cleanliness a clear 7, for service a very reasonable 7, for quality of the food a 7 is well-deserved, for quality of crockery and cutlery 7. We now progress to prices which get 5 (this is no cheap place), for car parking ease a 4 is reasonable for one has to park a long way away. For range of dishes to choose from it gets 7. Too large a spread reflects a dispersed effort throwing excellence out of the kitchen window.
So over eight variables, we get an average of 6.125, which is fine. Given the quality of the food it provides excellence. Highly recommended. But next week we will be visiting several eateries in Lahore, but my preference always is my old Bhati Gate days’ Ravian classmate Sheero whose mother makes the best Hareesa I know of. It is a rare event where we will meet Khalidi (the best tale reciter of Lahore’s ancient history).
Just to remind you that my wife’s old schoolteacher-friend Tahira has invited us (she actually orders us) to Maghaz and Maash Ki Daal. Also, we will be trying out Lahore Gymkhana’s ‘Club Sandwiches’. Few people realise that this sandwich was invented for the East India Company (EIC) soldiers camped in the Company Bagh, collecting for their march towards Delhi in 1857.
The EIC chefs then started working for the club, which was located in the old Company Bagh, then renamed Lawrence Gardens, and now called Jinnah Bagh. Old city folk still call it Company Bagh. On my last visit, the sandwiches were a wee bit soggy. Let’s see this time what we are served.

Founded in 1961 as the ADBP, it was renamed and incorporated as ZTBL in 2002 under the Companies Ord­inance 1984. The bank of­­fers agricultural credit and banking services to farmers nationwide and remains Pakistan’s largest public-sector agri lender.
Last month, the Board of the Privatisation Com­mission had approved the ap­­pointment of financial advisers for the divestme­nt of ZTBL, marking it as one of the government’s priority transactions in the current privatisation pipeline.
“The Privatisation Commission has signed a Financial Advisory Services Agreement (Fasa) with a consortium led by Next Capital Limited for the strategic privatisation of Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (ZTBL),” the statement said.
It added that the consortium also includes Ijaz Ahmed and Associates, Baker Tilly Mehmood Idrees Qamar, Executives Network International, Bridge Public Relations, Savills Pakistan Private Limited, and Prima Global Consulting Pvt Ltd.
“This initiative reflects the government’s unwavering commitment to inviting private sector investment, modernising banking operations, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of state-owned enterprises (SOEs),” the statement added.
According to the statement, post-privatisation, ZTBL, with its nationwide network of 501 branches, will be better positioned to deliver faster, more accessible credit to small farmers and rural communities.
It added that the bank will be able to “introduce modern banking technologies and digital solutions for agriculture financing as well as strengthen governance, transparency, and accountability, expand financial products tailored for emerging agribusiness opportunities and enhance customer service and on-ground responsiveness to meet farmers’ evolving needs”.
The privatisation of ZTBL is designed to catalyse investment in Pakistan’s agricultural future by combining private sector efficiency with ZTBL’s long-standing expertise in agricultural finance for fostering rural prosperity and ensuring farmers have timely access to essential financial resources.
Under the agreement, the financial advisers will conduct sell-side due diligence, carry out market sounding, engage with potential investors, structure the transaction, market it to investors, and assist the Privatisation Commission in a transparent bidding process, the ministry said.
The winning consortium had achieved the highest technical and financial score among six competing bidders, which incl­uded other leading groups headed by Arif Habib Ltd, AF Fergu­son, AKD Securities Ltd, Bri­­­­­dge Factor, and JS Bank.
The board also approved the formation of a nego­tiation committee to finalise the Fasa with the selected consortium.
Last month, the Senate Standing Committee on Privatisation had raised concerns over the government’s plans to privatise two state-owned entities — the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC) and ZTBL — and questioned the rationale behind their inclusion in the programme.</p><small>2025-08-15 15:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1516180794af731.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931059/facing-us-tariffs-indian-pm-modi-vows-self-reliance' target='_blank'><strong>Facing US tariffs, Indian PM Modi vows self-reliance</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that his country is seeking self-reliance in energy independence and the development of its own powerful defence systems, vowing to defend his country’s interests “like a wall”.
Modi delivered his annual Independence Day address from the ramparts of New Delhi’s Red Fort at a time when India faces intense pressure and threats of additional tariffs from the United States.
“Self-reliance is the foundation of developed India,” Modi said after a flypast of military helicopters scattered flower petals above an invited crowd of thousands. “Freedom becomes meaningless if someone becomes too dependent on others.”
Ties between New Delhi and Washington have been strained by Trump’s ultimatum that India end its purchases of Russian oil, a key source of revenue for Moscow as it wages its military offensive in Ukraine.
India has said it “stands ready” to support efforts to end the Ukraine war and endorses a summit to be held between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska later today.
However, the US has announced that it will double new import tariffs on India from 25 per cent to 50pc by August 27 if New Delhi does not switch its crude suppliers.
 
 

“We know that we remain dependent on many countries to meet our energy needs”, said Modi. “But to build a truly self-reliant India, we must achieve energy independence.”
Modi did not speak directly about Trump, but said he would “stand like a wall” against any policy that hurts the interests of farmers.
Agriculture employs vast numbers of people in India and has been a key sticking point in trade negotiations.
“When economic selfishness is rising day by day… we must not just sit and worry about the crisis but instead focus on our strengths,” Modi said.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a statement congratulating India’s Independence Day, said the relations between the two nations were “consequential and far-reaching”, and wanted to “ensure a brighter future for both”.
‘Blood and water’
Modi also urged scientists and engineers to focus on building key sectors and technologies, including fighter jet engines, semiconductor chips and military hardware systems.
“We will have India-made semiconductor chips in the market by the year’s end,” Modi said.
He added that the country was also working towards building a space station and would have a “defence shield” in the next decade, without giving further details.
 
 

Modi also honoured the Indian armed forces, which took part in a four-day conflict with arch-rival Pakistan that ended in a ceasefire on May 10.
“India will give a befitting reply to any other misadventure by the enemy,” he added, and referred to New Delhi’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
“India has decided that blood and water will not flow together”, he added.
The May conflict was sparked as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence — a claim strongly refuted by Pakistan.
In response to the attack, India held the IWT in abeyance, violating the agreement itself.
Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians. In retaliation, PAF downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.</p><small>2025-08-15 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1517394812c43bf.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931066/man-dies-fleeing-ice-raid-in-california' target='_blank'><strong>Man dies fleeing ICE raid in California</strong></a><br><p>A man who was believed to have been running from a raid by US immigration agents died on Thursday after being hit by a car on a freeway, police said.
City managers in Monrovia, near Los Angeles, said police had been called after there were reports of activity by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a Home Depot.
During the raid, one man ran from the parking lot of the hardware store — a place where day labourers commonly gather looking for casual work — and onto a busy freeway during rush hour, Monrovia City Manager Dylan Feik told media.
A spokesman for the California Highway Patrol (CHP) said the 40-year-old man was taken to a hospital, where he died from his injuries a few hours later.
Neither CHP nor the city were immediately able to provide any details on the man’s identity.
Feik said: “The city has not received any communication or information from ICE.” ICE did not immediately respond to an AFP request for information.
Masked and armed agents from ICE and US Border Patrol began carrying out raids in and around Los Angeles earlier this year, as President Donald Trump looked to fulfil his election promise to carry out the most deportations in US history.
 
 

The raids, which target hardware stores, carwashes and other businesses where undocumented people seek work, sparked fury in the multicultural city.
Protests in Los Angeles, some of which saw isloated instances of violence, were met with the mass deployment of soldiers by the federal government, even as local law enforcement said they could handle the unrest.
A federal court in July ordered a halt to ICE’s roving patrols in several California counties, after rights groups argued that the raids appeared to be arresting people largely based on their race, the language they were speaking or the place they had gathered.</p><small>2025-08-15 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618969-pm-shehbaz-performs-groundbreaking-of-china-backed-sez' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz performs groundbreaking of China-backed special economic zone</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has begun deporting documented Afghan refugees ahead of a September 1 deadline, a move the United Nations warns could force more than one million to leave.
The decision followed the interior ministry’s announcement on July 31 that PoR cardholders — the last category of Afghans legally residing in Pakistan without visas — became unlawful residents after their cards expired on June 30.
A letter from the interior ministry, dated August 4, was sent to the chief secretaries and police chiefs of the four provinces, as well as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, detailing the implementation of the ongoing Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
Among those at risk are more than 2,000 Afghans approved for relocation to Germany under programmes for people deemed vulnerable under Taliban rule in Afghanistan.
The relocations have been put on hold, pending a review by Germany’s new conservative-led government as it tries to deliver on its election promise to curb migration.
Refugee group PRO ASYL and the Patenschaftsnetzwerk Ortskraefte, a non-profit supporting former local staff who worked for Germany, filed a criminal complaint with Berlin prosecutors against Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt.
By allowing Pakistan to deport Afghans already accepted into German resettlement programmes, they said, the ministers had committed “abandonment” and “failure to render assistance” to people at risk under Section 221 of the Criminal Code.
They said more than 400 people approved for relocation to Germany had been arrested in Pakistan in recent weeks and 34 people had already been deported. Deportees face grave risks under Taliban rule, including imprisonment, mistreatment or execution, the groups said.
Victoria Lies, a lawyer who represents several of those affected, said some of her clients had been separated from their families, and in one case, a girl had been sent back to Afghanistan alone.
The foreign and interior ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.
However, Wadephul said on Friday his ministry was in “high-level contact with the Pakistani government to ensure the protection of these people and to provide rapid assistance to those who have been deported or arrested in recent days”.
The interior ministry has said it cannot provide a timeline to determine the future of the admission programme but expects decisions soon.
The two NGOs’ complaint builds on a July 8 legal opinion commissioned by them, which said German officials could be criminally liable if they fail to prevent the deportations.

“The counterterrorism dialogue will help in formulating a joint action plan,” the statement quoted Naqvi as saying during the meeting. The minister hoped for “positive results of Pak-US cooperation in eliminating terrorism”.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, Acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker and the federal interior secretary were also present on the occasion, it added.
“There has been an extraordinary improvement in Pak-US relations after the coming to power of President Donald Trump,” Naqvi said.
He praised US President Donald Trump’s efforts for world peace and stated, “The elements of transparency, mutual trust and cooperation are prominent in Pak-US relations.”
“This is a great opportunity to promote mutual relations in every field,” he added.
The interior minister also welcomed the recent US decision to designate the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army and the Majeed Brigade as global terrorist organisations, terming the development as a “good step”.
The statement said that LoGerfo expressed condolences over the loss of lives in terrorist attacks and quoted him as saying: “Pakistan is a very important country in geo-strategic terms.”
On Tuesday, the US said that it was committed to combat terrorism in all its forms with Pakistan, as UN Special Secretary Ambassador Nabeel Munir and LoGerfo co-chaired the US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue.¶
The last US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue was held in May 2024, where both countries reaffirmed the continuation of counterterrorism cooperation to advance regional and global security and stability.
Last week, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir completed a visit to the US, terming the trip — the second in just one-and-a-half months — a “new dimension” in ties between both nations. He also visited the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with US President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have an official face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
The two had discussed joint counterterrorism efforts and expanding bilateral trade during their “cordial” meeting in Washington. During the meeting, Trump had “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”.</p><small>2025-08-15 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618953-pakistans-nuclear-programme-meant-solely-for-defence-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's nuclear programme meant solely for defence: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China, which has supported it through many investments and development projects, such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which, currently in its second phase, has been termed a “lifeline” for the country’s economy. The phase II of the program is expected to focus on industrialisation, spe­c­ial economic zones, clean ene­rgy, agriculture and livelihood projects.
PM Shehbaz welcomed the establishment of an SEZ, saying that the “initiative would facilitate technology transfer, skill development, and sustainable industrial growth”.
The project will be set up by the Chinese textile group Challenge Fashion Private Limited, which is set to invest $100m over five years in the project.
PM Shehbaz met with the company’s delegation — led by its chairman Huwang Weiguo, expressing Pakistan’s willingness to “take bilateral ties to new heights”, APP quoted him as saying.
 






Federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Jam Kamal, Attaullah Tarar, Ali Pervez Malik, Sardar Awais Ahmad Leghari, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi were also present at the meeting.
The prime minister assured the delegation of his government’s complete facilitation for setting up the zone as part of the “industrial component of CPEC”, and thanked the delegation for having faith in the Pakistani market, APP reported.
PM Shehbaz expressed Pakistan’s desire to set up more such units across the country and hoped to benefit from China’s textile sector.
 






On that note, he shared that “a China-Pakistan Business-to-Business Conference would soon be held in China, providing an opportunity for collaboration between private businesses of both countries,” APP reported him as saying.
Chairman Huwang said he aims to establish a modern textile industry in Pakistan and thanked the PM for his support and hospitality.
In July, at a high-level meeting, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal assured a Chinese delegation that the establishment of SEZs remains the federal government’s top priority.
While earlier this year, the Sindh government signed an agreement with Chinese and local investors to establish the Dhabeji SEZ under CPEC Phase II.</p><small>2025-08-15 10:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618948-evacuation-ordered-in-more-bajaur-areas-ahead-of-anti-terror-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Evacuation ordered in more Bajaur areas ahead of anti-terror operation</strong></a><br><p>

According to police sources, the case was registered on the report of a constable, Muhammad Owais, who says the hakeem was running a clinic, where he installed secret cameras in the examination room.
He says the hakeem, in connivance with his two accomplices, sexually assaults the women patients visiting the clinic, on the pretext of examining them and records their videos.
The suspects would later extort money, jewellery and other valuables from these women by blackmailing them.
He said the suspects also uploaded obscene videos of some of the women patients on social media.
Acting on the complaint, Allappa police registered a case against the suspects who are yet to be arrested.
WOMAN TORTURED: A man, along with his brother, allegedly tortured his wife and forcibly cut her hair in Mailsi city on Thursday.
According to police, the suspect Usman had strained relations with his wife and he would subject her to torture.
On Thursday, the couple again quarrelled at their house, and Usman, with the help of his brother Kamran, overpowered his wife, subjected her to torture and cut her hair. Both suspects later fled.
Mailsi city police registered a case against the suspects, who have not been arrested so far.
MURDER CASE SOLVED: Mailsi police claimed to have solved a murder case in which the victim’s wife and her friend turned out to be his killers.
At a press conference, Mailsi DSP Saeed Ahmed Sial told the media that Asif, a labourer and a resident of 271/WB village married Sara a few years back.
He said that after her marriage, Sara contacted another man, Adnan Riaz, on social media and both became friends.
During their frequent contacts on social media, they decided to eliminate Asif and get married.
In July, Sara, with the help of Adnan, strangled Asif to death. Later, Sara claimed that Asif died of a heart attack.
The DSP said that the police developed suspicion and got conducted the postmortem examination of the victim, which revealed he was strangled.
He said that when Sara was interrogated, she confessed to her crime.
The DSP said that Mailsi Saddar police registered a murder case against Sara and Adnan and after locating them through geofencing, arrested both. He added that Sara was arrested from Lodhran and Adnan from Rawalpindi.

He chaired the meeting on the sidelines of the fifth session of the plastic pollution treaty negotiations taking place in Geneva. Billed as the most important environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord, the 10-day summit brought delegates from 185 countries to finalise a global treaty to control plastic pollution.
“Pakistan led a regional dialogue with Bangladesh, Egypt, Tajikistan, Malaysia, and Sudan for an interactive briefing,” according to a statement posted by Malik’s team on X.
“Minister Musadik called for a fair Global Plastics Treaty and equitable green financing, so support reaches nations most impacted by pollution and climate challenges,” the statement added.
 






At the meeting, the climate minister noted, “those responsible for the highest levels of plastic consumption are often the largest beneficiaries of green financing.” However, he added that the world’s poorest nations are often left to fend for themselves in the fight against climate change.
“Developing nations carry the heaviest burden of their environmental and socio-economic impacts,” APP quoted him as saying.
In a bid to rally the region towards fair and equitable green financing at the global plastics talks, the minister called for the treaty to take into consideration and prioritise “countries most affected by climate change and plastic pollution”.
Malik was of the opinion that “without fair access to resources and technology, developing nations cannot meet the environmental goals set by the global community”.
“By pushing for a united regional stance, Pakistan aims to strengthen the negotiating position of developing countries and ensure that the treaty addresses both environmental and economic fairness,” APP reported.
On Wednesday, Dr Musadik Malik had floated the idea of setting up a ‘global plastic fund’ for a marketplace to buy and sell plastic credits, receiving quite a few nods and thumbs up from delegates at the talks.
“Once we have enough countries agreeing to this, the [UN Environment Programme] secretariat will be forced to put it on the agenda,” said the climate minister.
World plastic pollution treaty talks collapse with no deal
Talks aimed at striking a landmark global treaty on plastic pollution fell apart on Friday without agreement, as countries failed to find consensus on how the world should tackle the ever-growing scourge, AFP reported.
Negotiators from 185 nations worked beyond Thursday’s deadline and through the night in an ultimately futile search for common ground between nations wanting bold action, such as curbing plastic production, and oil-producing states preferring to focus more narrowly on waste management.
The talks in Geneva — called after the collapse of the fifth and supposedly final round of talks in South Korea late last year — opened on August 5.
Several countries voiced bitter disappointment as the talks unravelled, but said they were prepared for future negotiations — despite six rounds of talks over three years now having failed to find agreement.
“We have missed a historic opportunity, but we have to keep going and act urgently. The planet and present and future generations need this treaty,” said Cuba.
A cluster of mostly oil-producing states calling themselves the Like-Minded Group — including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia, Iran, and Malaysia — want the treaty to have a much narrower remit.
“Our views were not reflected… without an agreed scope, this process cannot remain on the right track and risks sliding down a slippery slope,” said Kuwait.
Bahrain said it wanted a treaty that “does not penalise developing countries for exploiting their own resources”.</p><small>2025-08-15 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13170342dae783b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929543/the-story-of-a-sunni-pilgrim-at-arbaeen' target='_blank'><strong>The story of a Sunni pilgrim at Arbaeen</strong></a><br><p>“You’re so lucky to be here, Bilal. You can’t just come here like that … it’s an invitation. You’re handpicked.”
Arbaeen marks the 40th day after Ashura — the day Imam Hussain embraced martyrdom. Every year, over 20 million people make their way to Karbala at this time, making the journey one of the largest, if not the largest, pilgrimages in the world.
My journey to Iraq wasn’t exactly planned. I’ve been to over 43 countries around the globe, but Arbaeen, specifically, was purely based on luck — the opening of a random Instagram DM.
 

A mural in Baghdad featuring the message ‘have a blessed ziarat’.

One fine day, I received a message from a kind follower who insisted that I should make the journey to Iraq. We exchanged numbers, got talking, and one thing led to another; by then, I had given him my passport details.
He disappeared for weeks, only to return with a confirmation receipt. As it turned out, he had paid for my entire pilgrimage.
“I don’t understand. This is a lot. I don’t even know you. Why?” I asked him. “Because I think you should go. May God be with you. Allah Hafiz. Have a great journey.
“The tour leader will get in touch with you soon,” he replied.
And that’s literally how it happened. The next thing I knew, I was on a flight to Baghdad. Throughout the flight, pilgrims would sporadically break into hymns and chants, culminating in the final euphoric “Nara e Haidari; Ya Ali”. This was one of the biggest sojourns of their lives.
Being Imam Hussain’s guest
The Baghdad airport welcomed me with chaos, packed to the brim. You can’t blame it, though — after all, it is the gateway to one of the largest pilgrimages in the world. This realisation, and the patience that came with it, was not mine alone but was also shared by fellow pilgrims, none of whom lost their cool despite the mayhem. All of us waited for nearly eight hours until our caravan was finally stamped out.
The first pit stop of the pilgrimage was at Kadhmiya, aka Kazmain. It’s home to the shrines of the 7th and 9th Shia Imams, Musa Kadhim and Muhammad Al Jawad, respectively. It was at this point that the gravity of the pilgrimage finally dawned upon me.
 

The shrines at Kazmain.

After the long flight and subsequent chaotic immigration, emotions were running high, and so the first glimpse of the shrines — a short walk away from our guesthouse — brought tears to everyone’s eyes.
I didn’t exactly feel the same way, though. For perspective, I was raised in a Sunni Muslim household, and so I couldn’t exactly comprehend the scale and magnitude of the occasion or the place until I got there. This was, after all, a predominantly Shia pilgrimage.
Naturally, I was unfamiliar with the significance of this stage of the pilgrimage, and also overwhelmed. Seeing the very visible confusion on my face, one of my roommates asked: “Are you feeling okay, my friend? You seem a bit lost.”
 

Pilgrims pay respect at the shrines in Kazmain.

I didn’t know how to respond. Do I just tell him up front that I am not Shia? How do I say it? How will he respond? What is the right way to do it? There was a barrage of thoughts in my mind. And so I just blurted it all out.
To my surprise, he didn’t flinch one bit. In fact, very quickly, the news spread amongst the caravan that I am not Shia. But did that mean people from other faiths or sects were not welcome here? By the end of the journey, I had my answer: No, not at all.
In fact, I was welcomed with open arms by everyone in my caravan. Oftentimes, I even felt that they treated me better than other Shia pilgrims. “You’re Imam Hussain’s guest; that means you’re our guest,” they would say.
 

Making friends with pilgrims along the journey to Karbala.

This warmth was not just restricted to the people in my caravan — in Iraq, kindness and hospitality know no bounds. Everyone I met extended the same generosity. One of them was a friend in Najaf, whom I had been trying to connect with for years.
When I finally met him, he was adamant that I go back with something special. “You can’t leave Najaf without getting a Dur-e-Najaf ring. Please take this as a gift from me for being here,” he insisted.
Dur-e-Najaf, also known as Durr al-Najaf, is a highly prized gemstone, specifically a type of clear quartz, found exclusively in Najaf, as the name suggests. It is believed that the stone has blessings from God and is used for prayers, healing and spiritual strength.
The 1,452-poles-long walk
Najaf is the next pitstop after Kadhmiya, and is home to the shrine of Imam Ali (AS) — a sprawling complex crowned with an iconic golden dome. This is also where the walk to Karbala commences, from Imam Ali’s Shrine to Imam Hussain’s, from father to son. Both of their fates were written in tragedy.
In total, the journey is about 80km long. Along the route are a series of poles, each numbered to help you pace yourself and keep track of the long walk comprising 1,452 poles.
 

First glimpse of the tomb of Imam Ali.

The biggest shocker for me here, though, was how you don’t have to worry about food, water or accommodation throughout the journey. Everything is free.
Humanitarians from across the globe congregate here to set up their Moakibs — rest shops. They are all laid out along the route from Najaf to Karbala, ranging from sober establishments to full-fledged multi-storey air-conditioned complexes, serving as resting stops for pilgrims.
 

Food provided to pilgrims, who carry the flags of their country.

Since it was the middle of summer, I would begin walking after sunset, when the temperature outside cooled, and continue until sunrise. On the walk, I met all kinds of people — rich, poor, young and old; the newly born; the politically and religiously charged; the apolitical and irreligious looking to find God.
There’s a firm belief amongst the pilgrims that if you’re a guest of Hussain, nothing will happen to you. If you’re lost, you’ll be found; if you’re sick, you’ll be tended to; if you’re thirsty, you’ll be quenched.
 

Walking along the highway to Karbala.

This is the land of the Tigris and Euphrates, two blessed and heavily contested rivers, both of which have been mentioned in the Bible and the Quran. Prophets have passed through this land, and many people have laid down their lives on these very routes.
They say that angels, martyrs and djinns are walking with you along the way, guiding you to your final destination. So even if you’re a sceptic like me, somewhere along the way, you start to feel the power of this place, its significance, its magnanimity, and its pain.
A divine invitation
On my last day of walking, I was very close to giving up. It was past midnight, and I had stopped to sit down for some time, when an old man took a seat beside me. We got talking and soon he was passing a series of dad jokes.
I don’t recall how long we sat there, but what I do clearly remember is that by the end of our conversation, I felt much better and was back on my feet to continue the journey.
 

Meeting pilgrims from across the world in Karbala.

“I hope you see the world, Bilal. Good luck with your journey. Try your best to finish it,” the man bid me farewell. I didn’t pay much attention to his words at that moment, but a few metres later, it suddenly hit me. I never mentioned my name to him, nor did I tell him I loved to travel.
I was at a loss for words. What had happened? Where did he come from? Why was he there at the very moment I was going to give up? Serendipity? Chance? Fate?
I always consider myself to be a relatively fit person, but as I kept moving forward, one step after the other, none of that truly mattered. After all, this journey was an invitation from the skies and what exists beyond that.
 

An aerial view of the shrines of Imam Hussain and Imam Abbas.

Throughout the journey, I kept thinking: What did I do to deserve to be here? Before coming to Iraq, I didn’t know much about the gravity of our shared Islamic history, but walking all alone in the thick of the night brought a lot of time for quiet contemplation.
What was it like for Bibi Zainab to walk back to Karbala, broken, to mourn her family? She was Imam Hussain’s sister after all, and a living witness to the entire tragedy. If she could do it 1,300 years back without all the luxuries that we have now, I surely can too.
The blisters on my feet, the back pain, the sunburn, the sweat that congealed on my t-shirt into salt; none of it seemed to matter because somewhere along the way, I realised that I was doing this out of sheer love for one man: Imam Hussain.
 

Finally, reaching Karbala.

It is love at the end of the day that gets you to the end. There is no other plausible explanation.
I made it to the Shrine complex just as dawn was about to break; the golden dome of Imam Hussain’s shrine was gleaming as the first rays of daylight caressed it. In that moment, the words I had heard the most in all these days rang through my ears, accompanied by a quiet realisation — I really was handpicked for this journey.

The Federated States of Micronesia are an island nation located in the western Pacific Ocean that joined the United Nations in 1991, according to the UN’s website.
Both countries’ permanent representatives to the UN signed an agreement at a ceremony in New York, the Pakistan Mission to the UN said in a press release on Thursday.
“Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, and Federated States of Micronesia’s counterpart, Ambassador Jeem S. Lippwe, signed a joint communiqué to formalise the relationship between the two countries,” the Pakistan Mission said.
 






Addressing the ceremony, Ambassador Ahmad noted: “The relations would open up avenues for cooperation in the field of human resource management, capacity building and climate change.”
Both Missions would “work closely on key matters, especially promotion of international peace and security” at the UN, the envoy highlighted.
He praised that the development came on Pakistan’s Independence Day anniversary and that it was the 100th country to forge ties with Micronesia.
Ambassador Lippwe “expressed his happiness on the start of a new chapter in bilateral relations”, according to the Pakistan Mission statement.
While thanking Pakistan for extending support to his country, the ambassador said he “looked forward to working closely with his Pakistani counterpart to strengthen [the] bond of friendship”.
The Mission statement noted that Ambassadors Ahmad and Lippwe held a brief meeting before the ceremony, where they discussed “matters of mutual interest, including possible areas of cooperation both bilaterally as well as at the UN”.
The signing ceremony was attended by the two countries’ diplomats, including  Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon.
 






In Dec 2024, Pakistan joined a coalition spearheaded by small island Pacific states to push for a new treaty focused on managing an equitable phase-out of fossil fuels and financing a global just transition away from the threat of coal, oil and gas production.
Pakistan was the first South Asian state to engage with this group to “understand the contours of the proposal for a Fossil Fuel Treaty, aimed at fairly winding down fossil fuel production”.
The 16-strong group has members across four continents, including Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Tonga, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Niue, Antigua and Barbuda, Timor-Leste, Palau, Colombia, Samoa, Nauru, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Pakistan, and the Bahamas.</p><small>2025-08-15 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1512501908577cd.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931047/afghan-taliban-mark-4th-year-in-power-buoyed-by-official-recognition-from-russia' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Taliban mark 4th year in power, buoyed by official recognition from Russia</strong></a><br><p>Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities marked the fourth anniversary of their takeover on Friday, buoyed by Russia’s first official recognition of their government, a step they hope other countries will follow.
Parades were planned in several cities, including in central Kabul, where helicopters were set to drop flowers and the white-and-black flags of the Taliban’s “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” fluttered across the city to mark their capture of the capital on August 15, 2021.
Taliban members gathered on Thursday night at a square near the shuttered US embassy — seat of their enemy during their 20-year insurgency — waving flags and setting off fireworks, an AFP journalist said.
The military parade held last year with much fanfare at the Bagram airbase, once the linchpin for US-led operations, was cancelled this year, without public explanation.
The Taliban government remains largely isolated on the global stage over restrictions imposed under their interpretation of Islamic law, targeting women in particular.

The International Criminal Court issued in July arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders, accusing them of crimes against humanity over the persecution of women and girls, who are banned from most education and work, as well as parks, gyms and travelling without a male guardian.
But the authorities scored a victory in early July when Russia became the first country to officially recognise their administration.
Kabul also enjoys close ties, despite lacking official recognition, with countries including Central Asian states, China and the United Arab Emirates.
On the Western front, the Taliban government reported talks in Kabul with officials from Norway, Britain and the United States, among others.
 
 

The authorities face almost no internal opposition, though steep challenges stem from economic fragility, international aid cuts and the influx of four million Afghans expelled from neighbouring countries.
Independent experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday called on the international community not to normalise relations with the Taliban authorities and to reject their “violent and authoritarian rule”.
“Operating without legitimacy, the Taliban enforces an institutionalised system of gender oppression, crushes dissent, exacts reprisals, and muzzles independent media while showing outright contempt for human rights, equality and non-discrimination,” the experts said in a statement.</p><small>2025-08-15 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/15115042a381421.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931040/rescuers-scour-debris-as-toll-from-occupied-kashmir-flood-rises-to-60' target='_blank'><strong>Rescuers scour debris as toll from occupied Kashmir flood rises to 60</strong></a><br><p>Rescue teams on Friday dug through mud searching for victims, a day after the latest deadly flood to crash through a village in India-occupied Kashmir’s Kishtwar district killed at least 60 people.
Dozens more are missing, including Hindu pilgrims who were visiting a shrine, after torrents of water and mud driven by intense rain tore through the village in the Himalayan region.
Officials said a large makeshift kitchen in Chisoti village, where more than 100 pilgrims were completely washed away by what Chief Minister Omar Abdullah reported was a sudden “cloudburst” rain storm.
Heavy earthmovers were brought to the disaster area overnight to dig through deep mud, huge boulders and rubble that the flood brought down the mountainside.
The army’s White Knight Corps said its troops, “braving the harsh weather and rugged terrain, are engaged in evacuation of injured”.
Emergency kit, including ropes and digging tools, were being brought to the disaster site, with the army supporting other rescue teams.
One survivor told the Press Trust of India news agency that he had heard a “big blast” when the wall of water hit the settlement. “We thought it was an earthquake”, the shocked eyewitness said, who did not give his name.
Mohammad Irshad, a top disaster management official, told AFP today that “60 people are recorded dead”, with 80 people unaccounted for. “The search for the missing has intensified,” Irshad told AFP.
Around 50 severely injured people have been taken to hospitals.
Floods and landslides are common during the June-September monsoon season, but experts say climate change, coupled with poorly planned development, is increasing their frequency, severity and impact.
Floods on August 5 overwhelmed the Himalayan town of Dharali in India’s Uttarakhand state and buried it in mud. The likely death toll from that disaster is more than 70 but has yet to be confirmed.
 
 

The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said last year that increasingly intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” of what is to come as climate change makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.
Roads had already been damaged by days of heavy storms. The area lies more than 200 kilometres by road from the region’s main city Srinagar.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the spate of disasters in his Independence Day speech in New Delhi today.

The tourist influx continued on Thursday.
A spokesman for the traffic police said that more than 53,000 tourist vehicles had entered Murree so far, compared to its capacity for only 5,000 vehicles.
The city traffic police have been taking all possible measures to facilitate tourists.

More than 200 traffic police personnel perform duty on Independence Day

He said that more than 200 traffic police personnel were on duty on Independence Day to assist visitors. Although 53,000 vehicles have entered Murree so far, many of them have left at the same time.
Therefore, between 6,000 and 9,000 vehicles were present in Murree at a given time, the traffic police spokesman told Dawn.
Driving licences are being checked at entry points and checkpoints to ensure tourist safety, while motorcyclists without helmets are not being allowed to enter Murree.
Entry to Mall Road without family is banned on Independence Day, the traffic police spokesman said.
CTO Waseem Akhtar and Traffic Officer Murree Sohail Shahzad have been personally supervising traffic arrangements in Murree, the spokesman added.
All roads in Murree are open for traffic, and movement is smooth. Awareness pamphlets are also being distributed among tourists for safe travel, the spokesman said.
However, there was unusual traffic pressure due to the rush of pedestrians at GPO Chowk, he said, adding that tourists should follow traffic rules to make their journey safe and enjoyable.
He advised tourists to park only in designated areas provided by the traffic police.
He urged tourists to avoid creating double lanes and to refrain from illegal parking, as officers are continuously patrolling to prevent violations and ensure smooth traffic flow.
Meanwhile, in view of the monsoon rains, the City Traffic Police Murree has issued a special traffic advisory for visitors.
Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Waseem Akhtar directed the traffic police that, since Murree is a mountainous area, they should check the driving licences and fitness certificates of public service vehicles entering the town, in accordance with the SOP.
He further advised tourists to choose suitable vehicles for travelling to Murree, keep wipers and lights in perfect working condition, avoid speeding on slippery roads and dangerous turns, and refrain from violating one-way traffic rules or overtaking wrongly.
All roads in Murree are two-way, so double lines should be avoided.
The CTO said vehicles should not be parked on the road to take pictures, as this affects the flow of traffic.
Tourists should follow the instructions of traffic wardens, who play an important role in ensuring safety and making journeys easier.

In videos that went viral on social media, Mr Tessori was heard as telling a big crowd that recently gathered at the Governor House to attend an Independence Day concert that “Mein bar bar keh raha hoon, tumharay bhai wapas aa rahay hain… tumharay bhai, Karachi ko theek karnay,” [I am repeatedly saying that Bhai is making a comeback, your Bhai, to get Karachi fixed]. And the crowd roared in the affirmative when he asked whether they wanted “old MQM”.
 
 

Earlier, Mr Tessori had talked about the “return of old MQM to revive past glory” during a media interaction after his visit to Bhit Shah. When asked what he was alluding to, he said he would not reveal everything, but hastened to add: “Apkay hosh urr jaey gey jo honay ja raha hay” [You would be shocked to see what is going to unfold].
The governor’s back-to-back statements not only came as a surprise to senior MQM-Pakistan leadership, which parted ways with Mr Hussain following his August 22, 2016 incendiary speech, but also to the powerful circles behind an undeclared ban on the MQM-London.
An MQM-P source told Dawn that some elements within the party conveyed their concerns to certain quarters about the “wrong message the governor’s remarks were sending across the party and the masses”.
As a result, in yet another media interaction, the governor clarified his remarks and said that he was bound to follow the policy of the MQM-P, which had openly dissociated itself from Mr Hussain.
“Altaf Hussain sahab has nothing to do with the politics of MQM Pakistan [and] its leadership is not going to accept him [in their fold] as they openly parted ways with him,” he said, adding that he could not understand why such an impression his remarks were creating.
“There is no policy [regarding Mr Hussain’s comeback] and I cannot talk against the policy of the MQM-P,” he said.

The defendants are accused of forcing both children and adults into grueling labour under threat and coercion, highlighting vulnerabilities in low-wage service industries across the United States.
“This case is about a family business built on human exploitation,” said US Attorney Susan Lehr for the District of Nebraska. “The defendants allegedly profited by compelling vulnerable victims, including children, to work for little or no pay under threat and coercion.”
The five accused — Kentakumar Chaudhari, Rashmi Ajit Samani, Amit Prahladbhai Chaudhari, Amit Babubhai Chaudhari, and Maheshkumar Chaudhari — allegedly ran hotels where undocumented individuals were forced to work in “unclean, unsafe conditions, sometimes in the very hotels where they were forced to work,” according to the DOJ.

27 victims, including 10 children, made to work long hours in unsafe, unclean hotels for little or no pay

Victims were reportedly required to work “long hours, seven days a week, in exchange for little or no pay” and were “threatened with arrest, deportation, and harm to their families if they refused to work.”
Federal raids
On Aug 12, federal, state, and local officers executed search warrants at the Nebraska hotels, including AmericInn, Omaha, The Inn (formerly Super 8), Omaha, The New Victorian Inn and Omaha, Roadway Inn, Bellevue.
 
 

The DOJ said these properties were “used as part of a conspiracy to commit forced labour” and that the defendants “conspired to harbor undocumented non-citizens for the purposes of commercial advantage and private financial gain.”
A total of 27 victims were rescued: “Ten minor children under the age of 12 from the forced labour scheme, and 17 adult victims from the same criminal conspiracy.”
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division emphasised: “No child should ever be forced into labour. We will use every tool available to bring to justice those who exploit the most vulnerable members of our society.”
The Nebraska arrests come amid a wider push by US authorities to dismantle trafficking networks.
India on Tier 2
The US 2024 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report placed India on Tier 2, noting that the government “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking” but is “making significant efforts to do so.” The report highlighted persistent concerns about “forced labour, sex trafficking in religious and tourist destinations, and the exploitation of children, including in the context of child sex tourism.”
Experts in Washington stress that the Nebraska case underscores the global nature of trafficking. Indian authorities have increasingly coordinated with US counterparts to investigate potential exploitation networks affecting Indian nationals abroad, especially in low-wage labour sectors.
The five Nebraska defendants now face federal charges that could carry decades in prison if convicted, and the investigation remains ongoing.

He said the decision would depend on the outcome of President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.
“We’ve put secondary tariffs on Indians for buying Russian oil. And I could see, If things don’t go well, then sanctions or secondary tariffs could go up,” Bessent said in an interview to Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.
 
 

Earlier this month, Trump imposed a 25 per cent penalty on India in addition to 25pc tariffs for buying oil and weapons from Russia. The US has been trying to mediate a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, and on Wednesday, Trump warned of “severe consequences” if Moscow did not agree to a peace deal.

Russian oil made up 35-40pc of India’s oil imports in 2024, up from 3pc in 2021

Trump and Putin are set to meet in Anchorage on Friday to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine.
“President Trump is meeting with President Putin, and the Europeans are in the wings carping about how he should do it, what he should do. The Europeans need to join us in these sanctions. The Europeans need to be willing to put on these secondary sanctions,” Bessent said.
Delhi’s increased imports of cheap Russian crude since the Ukraine war have strained India-US relations and disrupted ongoing trade talks with Washington. Russian oil made up 35pc to 40pc of India’s oil imports in 2024 — up from 3pc in 2021.
Delhi has defended its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that as a major energy importer, it must buy the cheapest available crude to protect millions of poor Indians from rising costs.
Bessent’s comments come after he called India a “bit recalcitrant” on trade negotiations in an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday. Trump says his tariffs are part of his administration’s plan to boost the US’ economy and make global trade fairer.
He has repeatedly called India a tariff abuser and is keen to trim a $45bn (£33bn) trade deficit with Asia’s third largest economy. Trade negotiations between Delhi and Washington have been under way for several months, and are set to renew with US negotiators expected to arrive in India on August 25.
 
 

But experts say India’s refusal to reduce duties on agriculture and dairy products has been a major thorn in the negotiations.
Trump’s new 50pc tariff rate on India is set to come into effect on August 27, which some experts have said is akin to an embargo on trade between the two countries. It makes India the most heavily taxed US trading partner in Asia and is expected to severely hamper its exports focused industries like textiles and jewellery, and could drag India’s growth down by as much as half a percent.

A senior government official told Dawn that the National Assembly passed the Petroleum (Amendment) Act 2025 on Wednesday, empowering authorities to deploy information technology-based systems for continuous monitoring of petroleum products. The law aims to coordinate the efforts of various enforcement agencies to regulate storage, transportation, and sale, both jointly and independently.
 
 

The new legislation amends the nearly century-old Petroleum Act 1934, introducing provisions for digital tracking and granting enforcement powers to deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and designated officers under the Customs Act 1969, allowing them to seize smuggled or illegally stored fuel and related infrastructure before and after conviction.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), along with market stakeholders, has been working for months on the technical side of the rollout to ensure smooth implementation. The system will cover monitoring at petrol stations, en route transportation, and designated storage facilities.

New law introduces real-time tracking of petroleum products from import to retail, aims to curb Rs300-500bn in annual losses

Local refineries and oil marketing companies have long pushed for stricter controls on smuggling — particularly at borders and key domestic points — citing severe damage to their businesses and the resultant loss of government revenue. The illicit trade of petroleum products, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), remains a persistent issue.
 
 

A 2020 inquiry, commissioned by then-Prime Minister Imran Khan, revealed oil smuggling worth over Rs250bn annually from Iran and exposed the absence of oversight in the sector. A more comprehensive intelligence report submitted in April 2024 noted that around 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were being smuggled into Pakistan daily, resulting in a revenue loss of over Rs227bn.
The report also identified the involvement of 533 illegal petrol stations, 105 known oil smugglers, and complicit personnel in more than a dozen law enforcement agencies. It detailed informal border crossings and established smuggling routes across the country.
The amended law introduces severe penalties for violators. Individuals involved in the illegal import, transport, storage, sale, refining, or blending of petroleum products will face fines of Rs1m, with repeat offenders subject to Rs5m penalties. Facilities operating without valid licences will face closure and the confiscation of all machinery, storage tanks, and petroleum products. Owners of such facilities will be fined Rs10m.
For facilities with expired or cancelled storage licences (issued under Form K by the Department of Explosives), a six-month grace period has been granted for renewal or restoration. Failure to comply will result in the sealing of the facility, confiscation of assets, and a fine of Rs1m. The Department of Explosives is required to renew licences within 30 days of receiving complete documentation and payment.
In cases where premises are found storing or selling smuggled fuel, the law mandates immediate closure, confiscation of assets, and a fine of Rs100m. Furthermore, the Depart­ment of Explosives must cancel the operating licence of such a facility.
Vehicles involved in smuggling activities will also be confiscated under the provisions of the Customs Act 1969. Any seized goods will be handed over to customs officers for further action under applicable laws. Importantly, confiscation proceedings can begin before any conviction.
Additionally, the law vests the trial of accused individuals with the Sessions Court, while administrative powers will be exercised by deputy or assistant commissioners. Aggrieved parties will retain the right to appeal to the High Court within 30 days of receiving a decision.
The reform is seen as a long-overdue step to bring order to Pakistan’s petroleum supply chain, reduce environmental and engine damage from adulterated fuel, and plug significant leakages in public revenue.

• Registration begins for displaced families; each household offered Rs75,000
BAJAUR: As security forces claimed to have eliminated nine terrorists in an ongoing ‘targeted operation’, the district administration on Thursday ordered residents of 26 areas in the restive Lowi and War Mamund tehsils to evacuate their homes by Aug 16 for the ‘planned targeted operation’ against militants in Bajaur.
Sources claimed nine militants had been killed during the ongoing operation in Bajaur’s mountainous areas. They claimed that the operation, based on credible intelligence, involves both ground and aerial assets to neutralise the terrorist presence and was conducted in the Damadola area.
Official sources said militants tried to hide bodies in caves and hideouts, but security forces have systematically cleared these areas. However, the military’s media wing, ISPR, has not issued any statement in this regard so far.
 
 

Residents of 26 areas in both Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils, including Malangi, Sapary, Dawowgi, Mena Sulman Khail Khoorchai, Zagai, Gat, Agra, Gondai, Zari, Nakhtat, Mula Kalley, Bakaroo, Gohati, Chimialoo, Lar Kalan, Bar Kalan, Choohtra, Damadola, Inam Khoro Chinagi and Agra, have been told to evacuate their homes by 10am on Aug 16 for a short period to ensure their safety during the targeted operation against terrorists, according to a notification posted on the deputy commissioner Bajaur’s official Facebook page.
The notification, seen by Dawn, asked the residents of the specified areas to move to several relief camps in Khar using official transport arranged by the district administration. The notification added that the decision was intended to clear their areas of militants permanently.
Protest
Meanwhile, scores of people attended a demonstration on Thursday, calling for the protection of civilians in the ongoing operation in Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils here.
People from all walks of life, including political and social activists, participated in the gathering held at Umary Chowk on the Inayat Kallay-Laghari road.
A number of senior political figures and members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga also took part in the demonstration, held two days after the death of a woman and her two children following a mortar shell allegedly hitting the house of a resident in the Erab area of Lowi Mamund tehsil on Tuesday. The attack also wounded two children from the affected family.
The participants, some of whom were carrying black flags, also chanted slogans for peace and against the offensive. Bajaur Aman Jirga chief Sahib Zada Haroon Rashid, PTI local MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, ANP district president Gul Afzal Khan, PTI senior activist Najibullah Khan Mamund, Malik Khalid Khan and Irfan Janbaz addressed the gathering.
They expressed their deep anger over Tuesday’s incident in the Erab area of Lowi Mamund, which left a woman and her two children dead and wounded two children.
They called on the authorities to investigate the incident and to take special care of the civilian population during the offensive to prevent such incidents in future.
The gathering, which continued for a couple of hours, ended after Dr Hamidur Rehaman informed the participants that the authorities had assured them of investigating the Tuesday incident.
He claimed that the authorities had also agreed with them to ask the residents to evacuate their homes days before the operation. In addition, he mentioned that the authorities also agreed to provide compensation for property damage to residents during the operation.
Registration to begin today
Authorities are set to initiate a registration process for displaced persons affected by the ongoing operation in Bajaur district, starting today (Friday), to provide them with financial support.
Talking to the media on Thursday, Additional Deputy Commissioner (Planning and Finance) Saeedullah Jan said all arrangements had been finalised to start the process from Friday.
 
 

He mentioned that a registration centre has been established at the Utman Khail complex in Qazafi, equipped with 10 counters and five mobile verification units. He said it is a joint initiative of Nadra and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to offer a financial package of Rs75,000 to each displaced family from the provincial government.
Mr Jan said that under the package, each family would receive Rs50,000 for their arrival and Rs25,000 for transportation to facilitate their return. He said that displaced people from about 27 areas of Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils would be paid digitally, regardless of whether they were staying in relief camps or with relatives.
According to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, the provincial cabinet had approved Rs5 billion in relief funds for people displaced by the military operation in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils.
Also on Thursday, the district administration provided non-food items to displaced people staying at relief camps in Bajaur, including the Bajaur Sports Complex in Khar.

Addressing a public meeting at Paharpur Sports Stadium after leading a large rally from Al-Amin House, CM Gandapur said the Constitution and law gave them the right to reclaim their mandate and that they were ready to “take bullets on the chest” in their struggle.
The rally, organised as part of PTI’s protest movement on August 14, consisted of hundreds of vehicles and was welcomed at various points  along the route to Paharpur.
In his fiery speech, the chief minister accused the state of  “oppression” since May 9, 2023, adding that PTI supporters had endured arrests and violence but kept the party’s flag flying. “We will not commit suicide, we will fight. Those who shoot at us will face the same,” he  declared.
 






He criticised the state for waging “war against its own people” and said that peace was essential for development. “If people have taken up arms, the state also bears responsibility,” he said, adding that while terrorism must end, the government should not oppress its citizens.
Highlighting cultural ties with Afghanistan, he called for better bilateral relations. He also announced that Paharpur would be granted district status.

•  Flea markets have become vital for low-income groups as new branded goods become unaffordable
KARACHI: Pakistan’s imports of second-hand clothing have surged to an all-time high of 1.137 million tonnes worth $511 million in the previous fiscal year, surpassing the previous record of 990,266 tonnes ($434 million) in FY24.
This sharp rise reflects both the growing demand for affordable clothing and the country’s deepening poverty crisis.
A significant number of people, unable to afford locally made branded goods, have turned to second-hand clothing markets known as landa bazaars or flea markets.
These markets, such as those in Shershah and Banaras, have become a lifeline for lower-income groups, where used clothing, shoes, and other items are sold at a fraction of the price of new, branded goods.
According to the World Bank’s latest report, nearly 45 per cent of Pakistan’s population now lives below the poverty line, with the new threshold set at $4.20 per person per day, up from $3.65.
This increase has pushed the poverty ratio for lower-middle-income groups to 44.7pc, up from 39.8pc under the previous threshold.
Muhammad Usman Farooqui, General Secretary of the Pakistan Second Hand Clothing Merchants Associa­tion (PSHCMA), attributed the rise in second-hand clothing imports to escalating poverty.
Mr Farooqui noted that many families, especially from lower and middle-income brackets, are increasingly dependent on affordable used goods.
Farooqui has called on the government to reduce various taxes and duties on these imports.
These include a 10pc regulatory duty, 5pc customs duty, 6pc advance income tax, and approximately 5pc sales tax, which, he said, make second-hand clothing unaffordable for those who need it most.
Traders involved in the purchase and sale of used clothing also face additional taxes, including a 5pc sales tax on the difference between their sale and purchase prices. Domestic traders are also liable to pay income tax if their annual income from the business exceeds Rs 600,000.
In the Finance Bill 2024, second-hand clothing importers were designated withholding agents, requiring them to collect advance tax at 0.1pc from distributors, dealers, and wholesalers.
However, if the parties involved are not registered with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the withholding tax increases to 2pc or even 2.5pc for non-compliant retailers.
According to Farooqui, many individuals working in the used clothing trade are not registered with the FBR, and often do not have fixed business locations or proper records, making it difficult for them to comply with these tax regulations.
Despite the government’s efforts to stabilise the economy, Farooqui argued that the benefits of this recovery must be transferred to the masses.
He called for the removal of the regulatory duty and tax exemptions for used clothing imports to ease the financial burden on people with low incomes.
Used clothing is primarily imported from European countries, the USA, Japan, Korea, China, and Canada. Within Pakistan, exporters in special zones hold a dominant share of 60-70pc of the imports. These units sort through unsorted clothing to extract higher-quality items, which are then re-exported, with only 10-20pc sold locally.
Import duties on used clothing stand at Rs 36 per kg, while shoes are taxed at Rs 66 per kg at the import stage. Farooqui stressed that reducing these taxes could provide much-needed relief for Pakistan’s disadvantaged segments.
Market surveys reveal the high prices of second-hand clothing.
Imported used jeans cost between Rs300-400, while a second-hand shirt is priced around Rs250-300. In contrast, new sports shoes made in Lahore are priced between Rs2,500-3,500, while branded shoes made in Vietnam or China can go for Rs4,000-5,500. However, used sports shoes are available for Rs600-800, making them more accessible for many consumers.
With the rising demand for affordable second-hand goods, landa bazaars have become essential in offering an alternative to increasingly unaffordable new items. While Pakistan’s economy continues to struggle, these flea markets are proving to be crucial for the lower-income population, struggling to make ends meet amidst a growing poverty crisis.

• Top judge says move might affect unity among judges, expose court to public comment
• Insists Article 184 petitions must go to Constitutional Bench, not full court
• SC Rules 2025 published, aim to modernise court procedures
ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi ignored a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment of the Constitution before the full Supreme Court, according to minutes of the communication exchange between CJP and two senior judges of the apex court.
CJP argued that such a move would dampen the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges, besides exposing the court to public comment, as in the recent past.
The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024, under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing. He also mentioned receiving the letters from the two senior judges late in the afternoon.
 
 

CJP explained that he had been compelled to send the committee’s decision and his response in sealed envelopes to the secretary of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) for safekeeping until the JCP meeting, which was convened on Nov 5, 2024.
In his reply, the CJP expressed his intention to request the JCP to nominate additional judges to join him on the Constitutional Bench. This would enable the committee, as envisaged under Article 191A (3a) of the Constitution, to bring the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment before the full court.
He observed that convening the committee to form benches under PPA or constituting the full court would violate the Constitution’s provisions.
He also asked the JCP Secretary to present his response, along with the letters from the two judges, for due consideration at the upcoming JCP meeting.
CJP Afridi asserted that the constitutional mandate regarding the jurisdiction of any bench to hear petitions under Article 184 of the Constitution was clear. Under Article 191A, petitions filed under Article 184 must be placed before the Constitutional Bench. He further noted that the constitution of benches to hear such petitions is solely within the purview of a three-judge committee of the Constitutional Bench, not the PPA committee.
He recalled how he consulted all 13 judges of the Supreme Court. Nine of them agreed that petitions challenging the 26th Amendment should be placed before the Constitutional Bench, not the full court.
In separate minutes dated May 20, 2025, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah stressed the need for meaningful consultation, which he stated was the core purpose of the PPA. Justice Shah noted that delegating powers to the Supreme Court’s registrar was not covered by the act.
He suggested finding a permanent solution for urgent matters and proposed that the next senior judge should attend committee meetings in the absence of a member, but only if the CJP was unavailable.
The committee discussed Justice Shah’s proposals and agreed with his view on non-delegation of committee powers but differed with the rest of his assertions. The committee directed the registrar to revise the draft and resubmit it.
SC Rules 2025
Meanwhile, the apex court on Thursday formally published the Supreme Court Rules 2025, replacing the Supreme Court Rules 1980.
Framed under Article 191 of the Constitution, the new rules replace outdated provisions and bring court procedures in line with contemporary legal, constitutional and technological developments that have emerged immediately.
To carry out this revision, CJP had formed a committee comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi. The committee engaged with judges, the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and other bar associations. The final draft was placed before the full court and approved after detailed deliberation.
The Supreme Court Rules 2025 consist of seven parts, 38 orders and six schedules, with around 280 provisions amended (including 160 from the schedules), 60 new provisions added, and five outdated provisions deleted.
Key highlights of the new rules include that all petitions and paper books must be filed electronically, and notices, orders and certified copies will be issued digitally. Pleadings, hearings and affidavits may be conducted via video link, and judicial documents sent by post will no longer be entertained.
The rules update court fees for the first time in decades, with special provisions for criminal petitions, fees for petitions submitted from jail and fee exemptions for habeas corpus and Article 184(3) petitions. Counsel fees have also been increased, and the registrar may appoint advocates at state expense in death penalty cases.
Intra-Court Appeals have been introduced for orders under Article 184(3) and contempt proceedings, with one review petition allowed per judgement. Frivolous reviews will incur penalties, and the security deposit has been increased.
Appeals from interlocutory orders must be heard by a bench of at least two judges. The registrar is empowered to recall ex parte orders and enforce compliance with procedural formats.
The registrar is granted authority to oversee staff and exercise procedural powers, and procedural failures will not invalidate proceedings.
