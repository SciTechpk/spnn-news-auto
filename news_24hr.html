Tucked away in the remote valleys close to the Turkish border, Ghorjomi — and the surrounding region of Upper Adjara — are a rare outpost of Islam in one of the world’s most devoutly Christian countries.
“We live in Georgia, a multiconfessional country,” he told Reuters in June, after prayers for Eidul Azha.
Georgia was the second country in the world to adopt Christianity as its state religion around the year 319, behind only neighbouring Armenia.
It remains devoutly Christian, and its national identity is closely linked to centuries of struggle against Muslim Persian and Turkic invaders.
Still today, Adjara’s Muslim Georgians are derisively dubbed “Tatars” by some, referring to a Muslim ethnic group in Russia.
According to census data, around 10 per cent of Georgia’s 3.6 million people are Muslims. The bulk of them belong to the mostly Shia Azerbaijani minority.
But ethnically Georgian Muslims, unique to Adjara, are rarer and more controversial in a country whose national flag consists of five Christian crosses.

The country’s powerful Orthodox Church is seen as a custodian of Georgian identity, and for many, membership of the church is a prerequisite for being truly Georgian.
However, for the Georgians of Upper Adjara, who were converted to Islam during centuries spent as part of the Ottoman Empire, there is nothing contradictory in being both a practising Muslim and a patriotic Georgian.
“We are proud that we are Georgians. We have a shared past,” said Tariel Nakaidze, a Ghorjomi native and head of the Georgian Muslims Union.
Nevertheless, said Nakaidze, Georgian Muslims experience social pressures he likened to anti-religious campaigns under the Soviet Union.
He said: “During the Soviet Union in Georgia, both Christians and Muslims had to live a double life. On the outside, you were an atheist. But at home, you were a believer.”
“Unfortunately, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, that problem was replaced by the Orthodox Christian religion.”
Adjaran Islam comes with a distinctly Georgian flavour, though few locals indulge in the dry wines and pork kebabs favoured by their Christian cousins.

Central to local Muslim life are Adjara’s distinctive wooden mosques.
Their outsides sheathed in corrugated iron to protect from mountain winters, on the inside, Adjaran mosques feature intricate wooden carvings, vividly painted in a medley of traditional Ottoman and Georgian designs.

Down on the Black Sea coast, 100km (62 miles) from Ghorjomi, sits Batumi, Adjara’s capital and Georgia’s second city.
A raucous seaside resort town with casinos and nightclubs catering mostly to tourists from the former Soviet Union, Batumi’s mosque congregations are swollen by visitors from across the Turkish border, 20km (12 miles) away, as well as by Middle Eastern tourists.
Space is so limited that worshippers are often forced to pray on the street outside.
Batumi imam Tamaz Geladze has been trying to expand his rudimentary, lean-to mosque for years. Though permission has been granted by the authorities, the project remains tied up in bureaucracy.
Even so, Geladze said he valued Georgia’s history of tolerance towards religious minorities.
“We have coexisted for centuries here, in friendship and in dialogue.”
“Georgia’s diversity is a treasure,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-11 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613510-military-to-military-ceasefire-holding-but-indian-leadership-not-coming-to-terms-with-defeat-says-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-India military truce holding but Delhi not coming to terms with defeat: Dar</strong></a><br><p>

On Thursday night, at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts, Assistant Comm­issioner Naveed Alam said a day ago.
Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind also confirmed the incident and said that Fitna-al-Hindu­stan  — a term the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung, and Sur-Dakai.
The Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.
Alam told Dawn.com on Friday that the bodies of all nine passengers were handed over to a political agent in the Sakhi Sarwar district of Dera Ghazi Khan to be handed over to their families.
He said that seven of the passengers had been identified but two could not be identified due to a lack of documents.
“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam said.
Of the seven passengers identified, two were residents of Lodhran, while one passenger each were residents of Dera Ghazi Khan, Gujrat, Attock, Khanewal and Gujranwala.
Condemnations pour in
The country’s top leaders strongly condemned the incident and vowed action against the perpetrators “at all costs”.
In a statement today, President Asif Ali Zardari said: “This barbarity is part of Fitna-al-Hindustan’s evil conspiracy to spill blood in Pakistan,” state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
He reaffirmed commitment to “clear the land of Fitna-al-Hindustan and its facilitators at all costs”.
Similarly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement issued by his office: “We will deal with terrorists with full force. The blood of innocent people will be avenged.”
The premier added that the killing of unarmed civilians was a blatant act of terrorism by Fitna-al-Hindustan.
“With resolve, unity, and strength, we will confront the scourge of terrorism and uproot it completely,” the prime minister said.
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also strongly condemned the incident, calling it “blatant terrorism”.
“The killing of innocent civilians based on Pakistani identity is an unforgivable crime,” Bugti said, vowing that the response would be “severe”.
“The terrorists have proven that they are not human beings, but cowardly beasts,” he said, adding that the state “would not even let these murderers hide underground.”
The chief minister added: “All networks of terrorists who are the sponsors of Fitna-al-Hindustan will be destroyed.”
Noting that this was a “state war”, he vowed decisive action.
CM Bugti further vowed to crush “every plan of terrorism” with strength, determination and unity. “Balochistan will become a graveyard for enemies.”
In a statement on X late last night, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident, saying: “We will chase and eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists who target innocent passengers.”
“The conspiracies of Indian-sponsored terrorists and their accomplices must be foiled with the support of the nation.”
 






According to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.
The armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.
“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”
After abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.
Security forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.
According to sources, the attackers checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.
‘Get rid of miscreants’, brother of slain passengers demands
One of the surviving passengers, Sabir Toor, told Geo News that he and 10 members of his family were on their way to Lodhran from Quetta for their father’s funeral when the attack occurred.
The gunmen offloaded his two brothers, Usman and Jabir, from the bus in front of women and children of the family and killed them. “I cannot describe this hour of grief — we have three funerals in the family now.”
“I urge security forces to get rid of these miscreants,” he said, adding that he and his brothers had been working in Quetta for the past 30 years and had no relations to any political party.
‘Violence against common citizens deplorable’: HRCP
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed deep grievance over the incident, urging the state to seek a “political solution” to long-standing issues in Balochistan.
In a statement posted on X, the HRCP said, “This wanton violence against labourers and common citizens is deplorable and must cease immediately.”
 






In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-al-Hindu­stan.
Balochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, nine people were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while two labourers from Punjab were shot in Kech.
In February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.
In May last year, seven barbers from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw 23 travellers offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.</p><small>2025-07-11 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1114401115f9133.jpg?r=144100' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923487/brother-of-actor-humaira-asghar-denies-media-reports-on-family-refusing-to-claim-body' target='_blank'><strong>Brother of actor Humaira Asghar denies media reports on family refusing to claim body</strong></a><br><p>The brother of the deceased model and actor Humaira Asghar Ali has criticised the media for reporting that the family refused to claim her body.
Earlier this week, Humaira’s partially decomposed body was found in her rented apartment in Karachi’s upscale Defence Housing Authority (DHA) when the police entered to enforce a court-ordered eviction.
Police on Wednesday said that she might have died around six months ago, citing the expiry date of food kept in the refrigerator and her phone records, which were both from  September 2024.
They also said that when approached, her family in Lahore — particularly her father — refused to take the body for burial, triggering shock across the entertainment industry. A day earlier, the brother Naveed Asghar arrived in Karachi to take the body to Lahore for burial. Police had stated that the actor’s body would be handed over to her brother after DNA matching.
An autopsy report by police surgeon Summaiya Syed today, seen by Dawn.com, confirmed that the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition” and at least eight months old.
Speaking to journalists last night, Naveed said, “The body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it.”
He said that for the last three days, the family was in contact with Chhipa and the police, including Station House Officer Farooq Ahmed Sanjrani of the Gizri Police.
“According to the guidelines, we were [eventually] going to receive the body and perform the rites,” he said.
 


Naveed criticised the media for reporting that the family had refused to accept Humaira’s body, revealing that his parents were “distressed” due to the recent death of another close relative.
“Due to the condition of the body, we could not carry it at that moment,” he said, adding that the police were carrying out legal procedures before the handover.
“The media’s focus was entirely on our family. It never highlighted other possible causes of death,” he said.
Naveed acknowledged that his sister’s body was several months old, urging that the media should urge authorities to manage the installation of CCTV cameras in every house with a tenant.
 
 

Naveed also said that Humaira was an “independent person” who wouldn’t visit the family for extended periods.
“She moved to Karachi and had been living here for the last seven years … she would visit home after several months or even a year at times,” he said. “She didn’t contact us for a year, although our mother had reached out to her asking about her whereabouts.”
He continued: “Her mobile phone had been switched off for the last six months, so our mother could not contact Humaira. We could not trace her number either.”
Authorities, celebrities step in for late actor’s burial
The reports suggesting Humaira’s family had refused to claim her body prompted the authorities and celebrities to come forward and take responsibility for her burial.
The Sindh culture department offered to take care of Humaira’s burial and funeral if no relatives were willing to do so.
In a notification issued by the Sindh culture department on Thursday, Culture Minister Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah took notice of her death. He was “very much aggrieved for non-cooperation from her legal heirs to take over custody of the body for burial.”
“In light of this situation and considering her contributions to the arts and culture of the country, the culture department is willing to take responsibility for her burial arrangements with respect and in a dignified manner,” read the notice.
Meanwhile, several members of the entertainment fraternity also approached the police, expressing their willingness to perform the last rites and arrange the burial. Actors Yashma Gill and Sonya Hussayn were among many who volunteered to take responsibility for arranging the burial.
The Actors Collective of Pakistan — a trade body representing actors in the country — had also announced that it will ensure she is “laid to rest with the dignity and respect every human being deserves”.
“In our family, no one is forgotten. No member is left behind. We stand together — in life, in loss, and in remembrance,” the organisation wrote in a statement on Wednesday.</p><small>2025-07-11 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1113140501c465c.jpg?r=131459' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923491/pakistan-russia-sign-agreement-to-revive-pakistan-steel-mills-reaffirm-long-standing-industrial-partnership' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Russia sign agreement to revive Pakistan Steel Mills, reaffirm ‘long-standing industrial partnership’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Russia signed an agreement on Friday to revive and expand the Pakistan Steel Mills project in Karachi — originally built in 1973 with soviet assistance — signalling both countries’ commitment to their “long-standing” industrial partnership.
In May, Pakistan and Russia had agreed to revive PSM, which ceased its operations in 2015, according to a press release by the Press Information Department (PID). In 2024, following the official closure of the mill, Sindh sought Russia’s assistance in restoring the ageing infrastructure, which had been incurring losses for decades.
The agreement to revive the defunct entity was signed at the Pakistan Embassy in Moscow by Secretary Industries and Production, Saif Anjum and General Director of Industries Engineering LLC of Russia, Vadim Velichko, according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Industries and Production.
“Reviving PSM with Russia’s support reflects our shared history and commitment to a stronger industrial future,” said Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Haroon Akhtar Khan, who was also present at the occasion along with Pakistan’s Ambassador to the Russian Federation Muhammad Khalid Jamali.
The project aims to restart and expand steel production, marking a new chapter in bilateral cooperation, as per the press release.
A day ago, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk said Pakistan and Russia were “natural allies” and that Moscow viewed Islamabad as an important strategic partner in the areas of economy and energy.
The two countries have remained actively engaged on diplomatic fronts recently.
On June 3, Russian Foreign Min­ister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Syed Tariq Fatemi, reaffirmed Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan.
The countries are also engaged in multiple rail connectivity projects.</p><small>2025-07-11 08:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613491-more-monsoon-rains-to-begin-across-pakistan-from-today-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>More monsoon rains to begin across Pakistan from today: PMD</strong></a><br><p>

Rescue 1122, Charsadda’s District Emergency Officer Jawad Ali told Dawn.com that the incident occurred in the Omarzai area, where the roof of a house collapsed, adding that his team responded promptly and recovered the injured from the debris.
“The injured were transported to the district headquarters hospital in Charsadda for medical assistance,” he said. “The Rescue 1122 team had also provided first aid to the injured on the spot and in the ambulances; they seemed out of danger.”
According to the DEO Ali, four of the injured were guests from Karachi. Of the four children, aged five to nine, three suffered multiple injuries, while the fourth suffered a forehead wound.
The DEO appealed to the public to take precautionary measures during the monsoon season.
Meanwhile, Ali and Charsadda Deputy Commissioner Azmat Wazir both said in statements that the water level in the Pali Dam surged due to heavy rains on the night of July 10 and 11, causing a flooding situation in the Jundi River.
They added that Rescue 1122, civil defence, revenue and administration teams had been alerted and were in the field to monitor the situation.
 
 

“Rescue 1122 Charsadda took timely action on the flood situation in the Jundi river,” the DEO said, adding that he personally supervised the operations.
He said six ambulances, a disaster vehicle, a water rescue vehicle, and a total of 90 rescue personnel participated in the operations.
“A total of 105 people were rescued and taken to safe places in the affected areas”, Ali said, adding that four people were rescued from Sherpao Kanyur and 10 people were taken to a safe place from Omarzai. Similarly, 76 people were taken to shelter homes from Gedar Kaly.
The deputy commissioner urged the public to avoid visiting the riverside this season, as has already been banned, to avoid any mishap.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore, the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
On Thursday, the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) alerted the district administrations across the province to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17.
On Sunday, six people lost their lives while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the PDMAs of both provinces. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.
Meanwhile, due to a significant rise in temperature, accelerating snow and glacier melt have triggered flash floods and landslides in various areas of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan. Two boys drowned in the Indus River in the Torghar district and Jabba nullah of KP’s Mansehra on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-07-11 07:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1111514298f3f65.png?r=115303' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923483/musks-tesla-marks-formal-india-entry-with-mumbai-launch-event' target='_blank'><strong>Musk’s Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event</strong></a><br><p>Tesla will open its first India showroom in Mumbai next week, having imported $1 million worth of cars and merchandise, marking its entry into the world’s third-largest car market despite CEO Elon Musk’s complaints about high import tariffs.
In an invitation to the media on Thursday, the carmaker said the July 15 event was the “launch of Tesla in India through the opening of the Tesla experience centre at Bandra Kurla Complex,” located in the city’s leading commercial business district.
Grappling with excess manufacturing capacity at its other factories and falling sales, Tesla has pivoted to selling imported cars in India, on which it will need to pay about 70 per cent import duty and other levies.
Commercially available custom records from January to June showed Tesla imported vehicles, chargers and accessories into India worth close to $1m, mainly from China and the United States.
The vehicles included six of Tesla’s best-selling Model Y at a shipment value of $32,500 each for five cars, and $46,000 for the long-range version, as well as several Superchargers.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has for years wooed Tesla, including forming a new policy to attract the carmaker to build its EVs locally.
Last year, Musk had planned to visit India, where he was expected to announce an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, including in local EV manufacturing. But he cancelled the trip at the last moment. Tesla has conveyed that it is not interested in manufacturing in India at the moment.
US President Donald Trump has said that if Tesla were to build a factory in India to circumvent that country’s tariffs, it would be “unfair” to the US. Tesla has hired for several of the three dozen positions it advertised in India earlier this year, bringing on board store managers, sales and service executives. It is looking for supply chain engineers and vehicle operators for its autopilot ambitions.</p><small>2025-07-11 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/11114746ebc9879.png?r=115556' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915399/from-colonialism-to-ai-how-the-global-south-became-the-worlds-inequality-hotspot' target='_blank'><strong>From colonialism to AI: How the Global South became the world’s inequality hotspot</strong></a><br><p>In 1906, Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto made a striking observation: 80 per cent of Italy’s wealth was owned by just 20pc of its population. Startled by this imbalance, he formulated what would later become known as the Pareto Principle — or the 80/20 rule — suggesting that a small percentage of causes are responsible for a large part of the results. Though it began as an anecdotal insight, the principle eventually found its way into boardrooms, business schools, and self-help manuals.
More than a century later, the Global South stands as living proof that Pareto wasn’t far off. If economic inequality had a modern poster child, this part of the world would be it.
Once a loosely defined term for ‘Third World’ countries, the ‘Global South’ has evolved in recent years into a more meaningful label. Policymakers, academics, and journalists now use it to describe nations — many of them former colonies — that are part of the Non-Aligned Movement, a bloc of roughly 120 countries committed to principles such as sovereignty, anti-imperialism, and self-determination.
But such ideals don’t always pay the bills. The Global South is home to 85pc of the world’s population, yet it generates only 39pc of global GDP. This is the textbook definition of economic imbalance. And the future doesn’t look too bright either. According to the World Bank’s 2024 annual report, over the next decade, 1.2 billion young people in the region will step into working age. Yet the job market is expected to create just 424 million new positions. That’s not a gap — it’s a gaping chasm.
While one half of the world is busy riding the wave of the AI revolution — racing to patent algorithms, train billion-dollar generative models, and automate the future — the other half is still waiting for something as basic as electricity. Nearly 600 million people in Africa remain without reliable access to power — that’s almost half the continent’s population, and more than 80pc of the global electricity access gap. It’s a sobering contrast. One side teaches machines to outthink humans; the other side lights candles to chase away the dark. In an era of satellites, AI, and trillion-dollar tech empires, this scale of inequality is dangerous.
The numbers say it all
When it comes to measuring income inequality, few tools are as widely recognised as the Gini Index. The scale runs from 0 to 1, or 0pc to 100pc, where 0pc means perfect equality and 100pc means total inequality (all wealth concentrated in a single pair of hands). According to World Bank data  drawn from recent years, South Africa tops the list with a staggering Gini Coefficient of 63pc, while Slovakia sits at the other end with just 24.1pc. For comparison, the United States clocks in at 41.3pc and China at 36.7pc. In South Asia, Pakistan stands at 29.6pc, India at 32.8pc, and Bangladesh at 33.4pc.
 


But here’s the catch: the Gini Index tells us how income is distributed, not how much wealth there is to go around in the first place. A country could have near-perfect distribution but still be grappling with widespread poverty.
Still, when mapped globally, the Gini Coefficient reveals a clear pattern: countries in the Global South consistently show higher inequality, exposing the structural gaps that income or wealth distribution alone can’t fully explain.
Another way to grasp the depth of income inequality is by looking at who holds what share of a country’s income — the bottom 50pc, the top 10pc, and the top 1pc. National income, after all, is simply the total of what a country’s residents earn in a year, but how it’s divided tells a much bigger story.
According to the World Inequality Database 2024, which tracks income data from 216 countries over two centuries, the picture is incredibly lopsided. The top 10pc of earners control more than half of global income, while the bottom 50pc barely scrape together 10pc. Zoom in by region, and the divide becomes even sharper. Europe stands out as the least unequal, while Latin America, Middle East, and North Africa show the most extreme concentration of wealth in the hands of the top 10pc. In other words, geography still shapes destiny, and in much of the Global South, the odds remain stacked in favour of the few.
 


The global map of inequality tells a familiar tale — the top 10pc hold a disproportionate share of income, and this imbalance is most stark in the Global South.
A world of haves and have-nots
In Asia, a study focused on India reveals something striking. The ‘Billionaire Raj’ is now more unequal than the colonial British Raj ever was. Since the early 2000s, inequality has soared. The top 10pc in India saw their income share jump from 40pc in 2000 to 58pc in 2023.
The real drivers? The top 1pc, whose slice grew from 15pc to 23pc, while the middle 40pc lost ground, shrinking from 39pc to 27pc. The United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Multidimensional Poverty Index 2024 adds another layer. Out of 112 countries surveyed, 1.1 billion people out of 6.3 billion are living in poverty. India alone accounts for 234 million people living in poverty — more than the total populations of at least 29 smaller Asian nations combined.
In Indonesia and Pakistan, the top 10pc claim 46pc and 42pc of national income, respectively — a quiet confirmation that this is no regional fluke, but a structural feature of inequality across the South.
Latin America remains the world’s most unequal region. Here, the richest 10pc earn 12 times more than the poorest 10pc. In countries like Colombia, Chile, and Uruguay, just 1pc of the population controls between 37pc and 40pc of total wealth. The bottom half? They’re left with barely 10pc.
In Africa, the story grows more complex. While economic growth is occurring, it remains unevenly distributed. A joint report by the Agence Française de Développement (AFD) and the World Bank reveals that between 1980 and 2016, the richest 1pc of Africans captured 27pc of total income growth. In 2024, Sub-Saharan Africa — home to just 16pc of the world’s population — carries 67pc of the world’s extremely poor.
The takeaway is clear — economic growth may lift national economies, but it does not guarantee equitable outcomes.
This stark disparity across the Global South can largely be traced back to colonial legacies. Under colonial rule, land and resources were concentrated in the hands of a privileged few, entrenching class divisions that continue to shape social and economic realities today. Even after independence, low social investment, unequal access to education, weak tax systems, and the enduring influence of powerful elites in policymaking have all worked to reinforce these imbalances. And so today, we have a system that not only tolerates but sustains inequality — not just in Latin America, but throughout the Global South.
Even advanced economies like the United States aren’t immune to the rising tide of inequality. A recent survey found that, after immigration, income inequality ranked as the second most pressing concern for Americans, with many hoping Trump would address it within his first 100 days in office. It’s not hard to see why.
Consider this: the collective net worth of America’s top 12 billionaires now exceeds $2 trillion. Between March 18, 2020, and December 3, 2024, their combined wealth soared by $1.3 trillion — a 193pc increase. If evidence of deepening inequality is needed, the pandemic offers it in plain sight. Covid-19 did a lot more than disrupt lives; it supercharged billionaire fortunes, widening an already vast wealth divide.
A 2022 study co-authored by Nobel Laureate Daron Acemoglu highlights another powerful driver of inequality: automation. By replacing human labour in industries like retail, manufacturing, and customer service, automation alone accounted for 50–70pc of the growing income gap between more-educated and less-educated workers from 1980 to 2016 — a sobering reminder that technology, without the right policies in place, can entrench inequality rather than alleviate it.
Now, what about the future? In 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) sounded the alarm, expressing “profound concerns” over labour disruptions and rising inequality as economies begin to adopt generative AI at scale. The Fund warned that generative AI could amplify the market power of already-dominant firms, accelerating the shift toward winner-takes-all dynamics and further concentrating capital in the hands of a few.
 


Here’s what Pakistan needs to do
For countries in the Global South like Pakistan, the moment has arrived for a fundamental shift in development strategy. The obsession with short-term growth at the expense of inclusive development has only deepened systemic imbalances. Yet Pakistan holds immense potential to chart a different course by leveraging its vast natural wealth, including minerals, coal, crude oil and natural gas.
Geological surveys estimate the value of the country’s untapped mineral reserves at over $6 trillion. However, true progress cannot be measured by extraction alone. It will be defined by how equitably the resulting wealth is distributed and how effectively it contributes to uplifting the lives of ordinary citizens.
To address the persistent disparities in economic opportunity, Pakistan must begin to reorient its policy framework toward broader public welfare and inclusive governance. This requires building a culture rooted in meritocracy, holding institutions accountable, eliminating inefficiencies, and dismantling the bureaucratic red tape that stifles innovation. Only then can economic growth translate into meaningful, shared prosperity.
A progressive tax system, in its true spirit, is essential — one that fairly distributes the fiscal burden across all segments of society, rather than disproportionately weighing on salaried workers. Revenue, once mobilised, should be invested where it counts most: education, health and social protection. With nearly 64pc of Pakistan’s population under the age of 30, targeted spending on education is no longer optional, it’s imperative. This demographic presents a unique opportunity; only an educated, skilled, and empowered youth can steer the country toward inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
Equally important is the expansion and depoliticisation of social safety nets. Conditional cash transfer programmes, especially those tied to education and nutrition, can lift millions out of poverty if implemented with transparency and fairness. Targeted subsidies that empower small entrepreneurs and marginalised communities, rather than inflating the profits of the elites, can unleash Pakistan’s true economic potential and drive grassroots development.
These are not just prescriptions for Pakistan, they are imperatives for any country in the Global South wrestling with the scourge of entrenched inequality. Real development is not measured by growth alone, but by the inclusivity of that growth. Until economies are restructured to empower the many rather than enrich the few, progress will remain superficial. The numbers may impress on paper, but the lived reality for millions will continue to tell a far bleaker story.
The future demands inclusive progress
While rising economic inequality is a global crisis, its effects are felt far more acutely in the Global South. Here, the absence of robust social safety nets and underfunded welfare programmes amplifies the disparities, standing in stark contrast to the well-funded and designed welfare systems of the West, supported by effective tax policies and the capacity to absorb national debt.
Meanwhile, as billions are funnelled into military spending and the technological arms race — ranging from Artificial Intelligence to quantum computing and supercomputers — the chasm between North and South threatens to grow even wider. Unless global leaders confront this economic divide with urgency and vision, the Pareto Principle will ring truer than ever, with a small elite controlling an ever-larger share of the world’s wealth and opportunity.

It was the latest of more than 20 such letters issued by Trump since Monday, as he continues to pursue his trade war threats against dozens of economies.
Canada and the US have been locked in trade negotiations in hopes of reaching a deal by July 21, but the latest threat appeared to have shifted that deadline.
Both Canada and Mexico are trying to find ways to satisfy Trump so that the free trade deal uniting the three countries — known as the USMCA — can be put back on track.
“Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses.
We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1,“ Carney posted on the social media platform X Thursday night.
 






The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement replaced the previous NAFTA accord in July 2020, after Trump successfully pushed for a renegotiation during his first term in office.
It was due to be reviewed by July next year, but Trump has thrown the process into disarray by launching his trade wars after he took office in January.
Canadian and Mexican products were initially hard hit by 25pc US tariffs, with a lower rate for Canadian energy.
Trump targeted both neighbours, saying they did not do enough on illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs across borders.
But he eventually announced exemptions for goods entering his country under the USMCA, covering large swaths of products.
The letter on Thursday came despite what had been warming relations between Trump and Carney, who has been faced with his counterpart’s regular musings that Canada should become the 51st US state.
Reciprocity
The Canadian leader came to the White House on May 6 and had a cordial meeting with Trump in the Oval Office.
They met again at the G7 summit last month in Canada, where leaders pushed Trump to back away from his punishing trade war.
Canada also agreed to rescind taxes impacting US tech firms that had prompted Trump to retaliate by calling off trade talks.
Separately, Trump announced in an interview with NBC that he was also thinking of slapping blanket tariffs of between 15pc and 20pc on August 1 on countries that had not yet received one of his letters.
The letters announce tariff rates of as much as 50pc in the case of Brazil to kick in on August 1 unless better terms can be found before then.
Trump told NBC that the letter to the 27-country European Union, the US’s biggest trading partner, would be sent “today or tomorrow (Friday).”
Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva said on Thursday that he is willing to negotiate with the United States after Trump said he would hit the country with his tough tariff.
He, however, reiterated that the Brazilian government is evaluating reciprocity measures. In his letter addressed to Lula, Trump criticised the treatment of his right-wing ally Jair Bolsonaro.</p><small>2025-07-11 06:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613483-cm-vows-to-crush-terrorism-with-full-force-after-bus-passengers-slaughtered-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>CM vows crushing response as nine bus passengers slaughtered in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

In a rare display of unity and resolve, Mehsuds of Upper South Waziristan convened a jirga in Makin tehsil to discuss deteriorating law and order and seek their constitutional rights.
The jirga drew thousands of participants not only from Upper South Waziristan but also from North Waziristan and Lower South Waziristan including tribal elders, political workers, lawyers, journalists and students.
MPAs Asif Khan Mehsud and Ajab Gul Wazir, MNA Zubair Khan Wazir, former MNA Maulana Jamaluddin, former senator Saleh Shah and mayor Shah Faisal Ghazi also attended the jirga. Leaders of major political parties including Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Pakistan Peoples Party, Jamaat-i-Islami, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and Pashtun Tahafuz Movement were also among the participants of the jirga.

Mehsud jirga calls for halt to military operations; demands crackdown on criminals

The participants of the jirga expressed grave concerns over deteriorating security conditions in merged districts, particularly in three districts of Waziristan. They said that increasing incidents of targeted killings, kidnapping for ransom, bomb blasts and other acts of violence left civilians vulnerable.
They said that clashes between security forces and militants often resulted in civilian casualties and widespread displacement. They termed indiscriminate mortar shelling, forced evacuations and collateral damage to civilians as gross violation of human rights and deviation from state’s constitutional responsibilities.
Through a unanimous resolution, the jirga demanded immediate and effective action by state institutions including federal and provincial governments and security forces to normalise situation. The resolution called for a halt to military operations and shelling on civilian areas. It demanded crackdown on criminal elements, respectful engagement with tribal communities and launch of sustainable development initiatives in the area.
Speakers said that tribal people had always been patriotic citizens of Pakistan. Casting suspicion on their intentions or subjecting them to perpetual scrutiny under the pretext of security concerns was unjust and discriminatory, they added.
The jirga urged the state to integrate tribal people with dignity into national mainstream and ensure their inclusion in decision-making process to promote long-term peace and national cohesion.
The jirga was convened to discuss the worsening security situation in Upper and Lower South Waziristan as well as North Waziristan during the last one year. The residents of the region say that they face severe threats to life and livelihood, with markets deserted, schools closed and economic activities paralysed. They say that thousands of families live under constant psychological and financial stress.
The participant of the jirga said that they would no longer remain silent if their legitimate demands were ignored. They said that they would peacefully raise their voice at all available democratic and constitutional platforms.

Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek will also play in her first Wimbledon final as she crushed former Olympic champion Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 in the other last-four clash.
Anisimova’s victory extended her win-loss record over her equally  big-hitting rival to 6-3 and kept alive American hopes of a third  women’s Grand Slam champion this year after Madison Keys won the  Australian Open and Coco Gauff the French Open.
“This doesn’t feel real right now, honestly,” a beaming Anisimova said in her on-court interview. “Aryna is such a tough competitor and I was absolutely dying out  there. Yeah, I don’t know how I pulled it off. She’s an inspiration to me and I’m sure so  many other people.
“We’ve had so many tough battles. To come out on top today and be  in the final of Wimbledon is so incredibly special.”

semi-final against Iga Swiatek of Poland on Thursday.—Reuters

At an oven-like Centre Court  where the temperature climbed to 30 degrees Celsius, Sabalenka  twice rushed to the aid of ill fans by supplying bottles of cold water  and an ice pack, before she cracked under pressure from her opponent in  the 10th game.
The 23-year-old Anisimova, playing in her first major semi-final  since her 2019 French Open run as a gifted teenager, made her opponent  sweat for every point and wrapped up the opening set when Sabalenka produced a double fault.
With her back against the wall, Sabalenka  roared back like a tiger, the animal that has become her totem, and  broke for a 4-3 lead en route to levelling up the match at one set  apiece after some sloppy errors from 13th seed Anisimova’s racket.
Having matched each other’s decibel levels in a cacophony of  grunting, the duo swapped breaks at the start of the decider but  Anisimova pounced again when Sabalenka sent a shot long and went on to book a final.
In the Thursday’s later match, Swiatek, seeded eighth at the All England Club, dominated her Swiss opponent from the start, wrapping up victory in 71 minutes on Centre Court.
“Honestly, I never even dreamed that it’s going to be possible for me to play in the final. So I’m just super-excited and proud of myself and I don’t know, tennis keeps surprising me,” said Swiatek.
“I thought I had lived through everything, even though I’m young, I thought I experienced everything on the court but I didn’t experience playing well on grass, so that’s the first time and I’m super, super excited and just enjoying it.”
On a baking Centre Court, the 24-year-old caught Bencic cold, racing into a 3-0 lead.
Bencic, ranked 35th in the world, found her footing, holding serve twice but Polish star Swiatek broke to love in the eighth game to take the match by the scruff of the neck.
Bencic was immediately under pressure in the second set as Swiatek broke for a 2-0 lead.
The rampant Swiatek did not allow Bencic a single game in a remarkably one-sided second set.
Despite her impressive form, Swiatek has largely gone under the radar at this year’s Wimbledon, dropping just one set so far while the top seven women’s seeds were all eliminated.
DJOKOVIC REACHES 14TH WIMBLEDON SEMI-FINAL
In Wednesday’s late  match, Novak Djokovic was given an early scare but continued his bid for  a record-equalling eighth Wimbledon trophy and standalone 25th Grand  Slam title by beating Italian Flavio Cobolli 6-7(6/8), 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 to  reach the semi-finals.
The 38-year-old’s fightback helped him  reach a record 14th singles semi-final at the All England Club, where he  will face top seed Jannik Sinner, with defending champion Carlos  Alcaraz or Taylor Fritz awaiting in the title clash.
“A lot of numbers, a lot of numbers in the head,” Serbian Djokovic said.
“Wimbledon  was, is, and always will be the most special tournament that we have in  our sport, at least in my opinion and I think in many players’ opinion.  It means the world to me that I’m still able at 38 to play in the final  stages of Wimbledon.
“Another thing that makes me feel very young  is competing with youngsters, Cobolli today … I enjoy sliding and  running around the court with him and all the other guys.
“I’m going to have Sinner next so I look forward to that. It’s going to be a great match.”
Cobolli,  the 22nd seed, showed tremendous mental fortitude to recover a break  after going 3-5 down in the first set, which he edged in a tiebreak by  letting rip blistering winners from his orange-framed racket to draw  loud cheers on Centre Court.Former  Roma youth soccer player Cobolli, who switched to tennis after watching  Djok­ovic, was given a masterclass in the next set, however, and his  idol broke for a 6-5 lead thanks to a slew of errors before tightening  his grip on the contest.
With his thinking cap on in fading  sunlight, Djokovic earned break points early in the fourth set with  vintage tennis but was hitting his shoe with his racket after wasting  them, before he fell to the ground with the finish line in sight.
Djokovic  dusted himself off and served out the victory to go past Roger  Federer’s semi-finals record at the All England Club and reach a  record-extending 52nd Grand Slam semi-final.

Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur formally inaugurated the initiative during an event at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat here, according to an official statement.
The event was also attended by adviser to the CM on finance Muzammil Aslam, adviser to the CM on health Ihtisham Ali, additional chief secretary (P&D) Ikramullah Khan, additional chief secretary (home) Abid Majeed, health secretary Shahidullah Khan, senior officials from the health department and representatives of international partner organisations.
The chief minister said that the provincial government was working with renewed commitment to eradicate poliovirus from the province.

CM says achieving targets challenging, not impossible

“Alongside polio eradication efforts, special attention is also being given to protecting children from other diseases. For this purpose, an action plan has been developed to strengthen the immunisation programme,” he said.
The chief minister said it was not just an action plan, but a clear reflection of the provincial government’s commitment to eliminating polio.
He said that the real task was on-ground implementation of the action plan, so all relevant departments, institutions and district administrations should ensure its full and effective execution.
Mr Gandapur said that although achieving the targets of the action plan was challenging, it was not impossible.
He said with better teamwork, determination and hard work, those targets could be accomplished.
The chief minister said Rs8 billion was allocated in the current fiscal year’s budget for the immunisation programme.
“We are also deeply grateful to our development partners for their generous support and continued collaboration in this shared mission to safeguard the wellbeing of our children,” he said, pledging the elimination of polio and deadly diseases from the province.
On the rationale behind the IAP, chief secretary Shahab Ali Shah said that the province had the lowest immunisation coverage in the country, with the southern districts posing challenges to vaccination efforts.
He described the target as ambitious yet attainable in light of the enhanced institutional capacity and resources.
The chief secretary emphasised a focused and coordinated approach to ensure that every child whether living in urban areas or remote rural communities was reached through the plan.
During a detailed presentation at the event, officials said currently, 55 per cent of children in the province were fully immunised, leaving a large number at risk, while the new IAP sought to close that gap by vaccinating approximately 1.42 million children under the age of two every year.
The list of diseases on target included diphtheria, tetanus, mumps, hepatitis B, pertussis, rotavirus, rubella, polio, meningitis, pneumonia, typhoid and measles.
The IAP outlined an eight-point strategy to ensure no child is left behind, with special focus on underserved and hard-to-reach areas. A central element of the strategy involves comprehensive outreach to all mapped communities, including those in security, compromised or geographically remote locations.
Officials said operational capacity had been enhanced through a significant increase in dedicated transportation budgets expanding from Rs80 million to Rs448 million over three years, enabling field teams to reach distant and rural communities with consistency.
They said the plan focused on upgrading over 1,800 fixed immunisation sites across the province, including basic health units, rural health centres and hospitals.
The officials said those facilities were being equipped with trained staff, complete stocks of essential vaccines, working cold chain equipment and a 15-day buffer supply of syringes to prevent disruption in service delivery.
They said in urban and semi-urban districts that showed low coverage rates, targeted immunisation drives would be launched.
The first such campaign is scheduled to begin in Peshawar, with an aim to identify, digitise and vaccinate every missed child in the area.
In order to ensure results and accountability, the action plan incorporates strong governance mechanisms. Monthly and quarterly performance monitoring will be based on reliable data indicators, such as vaccinator performance, geographic outreach, and site functionality.
Also, third-party coverage assessments will be conducted every six months to validate government data and identify underserved populations, according to IAP.
It added that in parallel, a survey across the province was being carried out to understand behavioral barriers that prevent families from seeking immunisation services.
The plan said the findings would inform future communication strategies tailored to address disparities across gender, geography and socioeconomic status.
According to it, this comprehensive approach, driven by digital data, community engagement and field-level monitoring, represents a turning point in the province’s public health efforts.
“With political commitment at the top and mechanisms in place for delivery at the grassroots, the government is now focused on translating its promises into measurable impact,” said the IAP.

Reports said Noureen Akhter, 45, was brought to Dr Safia’s private hospital (Al-Shifa) in the Canal Colony, complaining of pain in her uterus. The doctor performed a three-hour uterus removal operation on July 8.
However, Noureen’s condition remained unstable despite the procedure.
Noureen was admitted to a private room of the hospital.
The family says they repeatedly informed the doctor about the patient’s condition, who then performed a second surgery, just 17 hours after the first one.
The family claims that the seven-hour-long second operation was performed on July 9, during which the patient was transfused nine blood bags after her white blood cells count dropped significantly.
The patient’s family and relatives alleged that Noureen was forcefully discharged by the hospital management and later died at the Sahiwal Teaching Hospital.
They alleged she died due to the negligence of Dr Safia and her paramedical staff.
They staged a protest demonstration against the doctor, blocking a major city road for about three hours. The demonstrators finally ended the protest after police and the district administration assured them that justice would be done. The body was later handed over to police for completion of the legal procedure and the postmortem examination.
Police later registered a case against Dr Safia Izhar and seven of her paramedical staff under sections 322, 148, and 149 of the PPC on the complaint of Noureen’s husband, Imran Ashraf, a resident of Ferozepur Road, Lahore.
According to the First Information Report (FIR), the family alleges they were “forcefully discharged” from the private clinic on the evening of July 9 at 6pm, despite Noureen’s serious condition. They claim that the hospital staff told them the patient’s “inner organs got damaged during the first surgery.”
With no other choice, the family immediately took Noureen to Sahiwal Teaching Hospital, where she passed away within two hours of her admission.
Civil Lines police say that after the postmortem at the DHQ Hospital, samples of the body have been sent for forensic analysis and the body was handed over to the bereaved family for burial.
Complainant Imran Ashraf told Dawn that they want the Punjab Health Commission to intervene and provide them justice.
KIDNAPPED: Ghalla Mandi police booked a man and his seven unknown accomplicesfor allegedly kidnapping a commission agent, keeping him in illegal confinement for five days, besides sexually assaulting and torturing him.
Amir Hussain, a resident of village 133/9-L, said in his complaint to police that he was kidnapped from Fatoh Moor on July 1 by Asif and his seven accomplices and taken to an unknown location in a pick-up van.
He said Asif and his accomplices allegedly tortured and sexually assaulted him for five days, after administering some tranquilising syrup.
The suspects also recorded a video of the episode, threatening him to upload it on social media.
The complainant also alleged that he was deprived of Rs0.94 million by the suspects, who later threw him at a desolate place.
The victim was shifted to Sahiwal Teaching Hospital by a Rescue 1122 team called by a passerby on July 5, where he received treatment for five days.

The only exception was the tractor segment, which recorded a sharp 36.4pc decline due to continued stress in the agricultural economy.
According to data released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association, car sales rose by 38pc to 112,203 units in FY25 from 81,579 units a year earlier.
Light commercial vehicles, pickups, vans, and sport utility vehicles recorded a 61pc increase, with total sales rising to 35,820 units from 22,250.
Truck sales more than doubled, jumping 103pc to 4,444 units compared to 2,187 in FY24, while bus sales grew 74pc to 788 units from 454. The two- and three-wheeler segments also showed improvement, with sales climbing 32pc to 1.518 million units from 1.150m units.
However, tractor sales plunged to 29,192 units in FY25 from 45,911 units in FY24, reflecting subdued farm income and weak rural demand.
Myesha Sohail of Topline Securities said car, LCV, jeep, and pickup sales in June 2025 alone reached 21,773 units — a 64pc year-on-year and 47pc month-on-month increase.
The sharp MoM rise was driven primarily by pre-buying ahead of the July 1 hike in general sales tax (GST) from 12.5pc to 18pc, with Suzuki Alto sales reaching a 39-month high.
She added that the YoY growth was supported by a stable macroeconomic environment, lower interest rates, easing inflation, a stronger rupee, and improving consumer confidence. The availability of new car variants also contributed to the rising trend.
Among manufacturers, Pak Suzuki Motor Company led the market with sales of 72,685 units in FY25, up 34pc. Indus Motor Company followed with a 61pc increase, selling 33,393 units. Honda Atlas Cars Limited sold 18,296 units, marking a 38pc rise, while Hyundai Nishat’s sales grew 20pc to 10,954 units.
Sazgar Engineering posted one of the most impressive growth rates, with sales doubling to 10,844 units in FY25 — up 102pc from the previous year — boosted by strong demand for its newly facelifted Haval model.
Looking ahead, Sohail expects the positive momentum in the auto sector to continue into FY26, driven by lower borrowing costs and upcoming launches across various fuel technologies, including hybrid and plug-in hybrid models.

According to SBP data released on Thursday, the central bank’s reserves rose primarily on the back of official inflows, though no specific breakdown was provided.
Bankers said the SBP purchased over $8bn from the interbank market during FY25, supported by record-high remittances of $38.3bn.
These inflows were primarily driven by incentives offered to banks on transactions from overseas Pakistanis. However, the government is now considering scrapping these incentives, though no final decision has been made.
The central bank also maintained a tight grip on dollar outflows throughout the year, particularly during the final quarter, frustrating importers who struggled to secure foreign exchange. This control on imports, combined with heavy dollar buying, led to a shortage that gradually pushed the exchange rate upward.
Some bankers noted that to attract more remittances, banks were offering higher rates to overseas senders — exceeding official dollar quotes — to capitalise on per-transaction incentives.
The dollar’s appreciation in the local market continued on Thursday. The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reported the interbank rate at Rs284.76, up 10 paise from the previous day, while the open market rate rose 50 paise to Rs287.50.
This rise came despite the US dollar weakening globally against major currencies, with the greenback slipping further from a two-week high on Thursday.
Currency analysts believe the SBP’s reserve build-up could continue in FY26, potentially reaching $20bn. However, this would depend on sustained remittance inflows, rollover of a significant portion of external debt, and smooth relations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Pakistan faced little difficulty in securing commercial loans during FY25, largely due to its continued participation in the IMF programme — a factor expected to sustain investor confidence and ease access to external financing.
As of July 4, the country’s total foreign exchange reserves stood at $20.028bn, including $5.526bn held by commercial banks, according to SBP data.

They added that Areeba, 16, died from torture in the D-1 area near Madina Masjid.
Khokhrapar SHO Allah Bachayo told Dawn that her body was found dumped in a street within the congested and impoverished neighbourhood.
He said the teenage girl had prepared lunch for her father at home of her uncle. She was reportedly taking the meal to him when she was kidnapped and killed in the same neighbourhood.
The officer said there were three or four houses in the street, with one under construction.
The police searched the under-construction building and found one of her slippers. Her father recognised it to be his daughter’s footwear.
During a further search, the meal (porridge) she had prepared was also found discarded at the scene.
Three suspects had been detained for interrogation, the officer said. He added that there were torture marks on her body.
The girl had been strangled with a scarf, which was found wrapped around her neck, he added.
He said the body was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.
The officer said her parents had separated around some six years ago.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that a post-mortem examination report was awaited.

A man was allegedly killed by his brother in Patel Para on Thursday evening, police said. They added that Dilawar, 40, was stabbed to death by his brother Jehangir inside a house.
Jamshed Quarters SHO Anser Ahmed Butt told Dawn that the deceased was preparing tea in the kitchen when his brother attacked him with a knife. The suspect, along with the knife, managed to escape from the scene.

The team arrived on July 8 for a th­­­ree-day aviation security inspection.
Accompanied by a representative of the British High Commission, the UK team began its assessment with an inaugural meeting attended by the Chief Security Officer and all relevant airport stakeholders.
“All aviation security stakeholders including PAA officials, ASF personnel, and representatives from PIA, British Airways, Air Blue, Kitchen Cuisine, Ras Menzies and others attended the initial briefing,” the PCAA said.

Saudi auditors to assess seven major airports next month

The inspection focused on security deployment, internal controls, scre­ening procedures, issuance of passes, vehicle and staff checks, CCTV operations, perimeter security, deployment of quick response forces, drone arrangements, and the ASF’s emergency response capabilities.
The team also reviewed catering and flight operations.
At the conclusion of the visit, the UK inspectors commended the efforts of the Airports Security Force to ensure safe air travel.
Saudi visit soon
Meanwhile, a Saudi aviation security team is scheduled to conduct a security audit of seven major Pakistani airports—including Isla­mabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Faisalabad, Sialkot, and Multan—starting in August, according to PCAA spokesperson Shahid Qadir.
“Director General of Saudi Ara­bia’s General Authority of Civil Av­­iation (GACA) has approached Pa­­kistan’s DG PCAA, Nadir Shafi Dar, to conduct an aviation security au­­dit of seven Pakistani airports,” PCAA spokesperson Shahid Qadir said. “A Saudi aviation security team will visit Pakistan in August and October to conduct the audit,” he added.
The Saudi team will coordinate closely with the Directorate of Aviation Security (AvSec) of the PCAA, which will host the visiting delegation.  The audits come as Pakistan’s civil aviation sector shows marked improvement in international benchmarks.
Pakistan achieved a score of 86.73 per cent in the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s Uni­versal Security Audit Programme (USAP), significantly higher than the global average of 71pc and India’s 73pc, according to the CAA.
Direct US flights
PCAA Director General Nadir Shafi Dar, a veteran aviation specialist, has also initiated engagement with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in pursuit of direct flight operations to the United States.
The move follows the recent restoration of flights to the European Union and progress toward re-entry into the United Kingdom’s aviation network.

• Govt accused of overlooking more than 2,000 crimes committed against religious minorities
DHAKA: Bangladesh’s former police chief pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity committed during a crackdown on protests last year, while ex-prime minister Sheikh Hasina was formally indicted, prosecutors said after the trial resumed Thursday.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024, according to the United Nations, when Hasina’s government attem­pted to crush a student-led uprising.
Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures connected to Ha­­sina’s ousted government and her now-banned party, the Awami League.
Former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Mamun “pleaded guilty to crimes against humanity”, Muhammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor at the ICT, told reporters.
Islam said Mamun has agreed to assist the court by acting as a witness, giving “all the knowledge he has regarding the crimes committed during the July-August uprising”.
The court has approved separate accommodation to ensure Mamun’s safety. The tribunal on Thursday also rejected defence lawyers’ requ­est to have the charges against Hasi­­na and her interior minister Asaduz­zaman Khan Kamal dismissed.
Both Hasina and Kamal were formally indicted in the same case.
Amir Hossain, the state-appointed counsel for Hasina and Kamal, however, remained hopeful.
“The trial is at an initial stage, and there are several other phases,” he said.
Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to India as the protests ended her 15-year rule. She has defied an ext­radition order to return to Dhaka, where her trial in absentia opened on June 1. Hasina faces at least five charges at the ICT, including “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising”.
Prosecutors say that Hasina held overall command responsibility for the violence.
She was already convicted of contempt of court in a separate case on July 2, receiving a six-month sentence. Fugitive former minister Kamal is also believed to be in India.
Attacks on religious minorities
A rights group in Bangladesh accused the government on Thursday of overlooking more than 2,000 crimes committed against religious minorities in the country and excluding them from reforms.
The Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Unity Council has been voicing concern over targeted attacks on religious minorities since the fall of ousted former premier Sheikh Hasina last year.
“We have recorded 2,442 incid­ents from August 4 last year to June 30 this year, involving murders, rapes and gang rapes, vandalism of temples, homes, and businesses,” Monindra Kumar Nath, general secretary of the council, told a news conference.
The council alleged such attacks have continued even after the int­e­rim government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus took charge of the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people.
His administration has often dismissed the accusations, saying the crimes against minorities are politically motivated, the victims believed to have supported Hasina’s Awami League party in the past.
“Instead of giving due attention to our concerns, the government chose to label them as false, fabricated, and exaggerated,” Nath said, alleging the accused were “enjoying impunity”.
The unity council criticised the government for excluding religious minorities from any of the reform commissions tasked with proposing measures to end all forms of discrimination in the society.

• Rubio voices optimism over potential ceasefire
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency on Thursday said at least 52 people, including eight children, were killed by Israeli forces in the Palestinian territory battered by more than 21 months of war.
The latest deadly strikes and gunfire came just hours after Hamas, which runs Gaza, announced it was willing to release 10 prisoners as part of indirect ceasefire talks with Israel.
Civil defence official Mohammad al-Mughair told AFP that 17 people were killed in a strike in front of a medical point in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza.
 
 

Mughair said eight children and two women were killed in the strike.
Yousef Al-Aydi, 30, said he was among dozens of people, mostly women and children, waiting for nutritional supplements in front of the medical point.
“Suddenly, we heard the sound of a drone approaching, and then the explosion happened,” he told AFP by phone.
“The ground shook beneath our feet, and everything around us tur­ned into blood and deafening screams.”
“What was our fault? What was the fault of the children?” asked Mohammed Abu Ouda, 35, who had also been waiting for supplies.
“I saw a mother hugging her child on the ground, both motionless — they were killed instantly.”
Four people were killed and several injured in a pre-dawn air strike on a family home in Al-Bureij camp in central Gaza, Mughair added.
AFP footage from Al-Bureij showed a family including three young children sitting among rubble outside their tattered tent after an air strike hit a house next door.
Mughair reported 27 more people killed in bombardments across the territory, including 15 people in five separate strikes in the area of Gaza City.
One person was killed southwest of the southern city of Khan Yunis by “Israeli military fire”, Mughair said.
Three more, including a woman, were killed by Israeli gunfire on civilians near an aid centre in the northwest of nearby Rafah, he added.
More than 600 people have been killed around aid distributions and convoys in Gaza since late May, when Israel began allowing in a trickle of supplies, the United Nations said in early July.
Sticking point
Hamas on Thursday said it opposes any ceasefire deal that includes a large Israeli military presence in Gaza, after offering to release some prisoners.
Indirect negotiations aimed at securing a truce in Gaza between Hamas and Israel entered their fifth day in Qatar on Thursday, an official with knowledge of the talks told AFP.
The current negotiations — taking place after 21 months of fighting and multiple previous rounds of talks that failed to yield a breakthrough — began in the capital Doha on Sunday in hopes of clinching a deal based on a US-backed framework that envisages an initial 60-day truce.
“Hamas and Israel remain in Qatar,” the official said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of talks.
Hamas said disagreements over the free flow of aid into Gaza and Israel’s military withdrawal were sticking points, as were its demands for “real guarantees” for a lasting peace.
Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim told AFP on Thursday: “We cannot accept the perpetuation of the occupation of our land and the surrender of our people to isolated enclaves under the control of the occupation army (Israel).
“This is what the negotiating delegation is presenting to the occupation so far in the current round of negotiations in Doha.”
Hamas was particularly opposed to Israeli control over Rafah, on the border with Egypt, and the so-called Morag Corridor between the southern city and Khan Yunis, he added.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he was “hopeful” about the prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza, telling reporters on Thursday that negotiations were “closer” than they had been in some time.
“We’re hopeful… It appears that generally the terms have been agreed to, but obviously now you need to have talks about how you implement those terms,” Rubio said on the sidelines of a meeting of Southeast Asian countries in Malaysia.
“I think perhaps we’re closer than we’ve been in quite a while, and we’re hopeful, but we also recognise there are still some challenges in the way.”
He acknowledged that previous rounds of talks had fallen apart at similar stages. “One of the fundamental challenges is Hamas’ unwillingness to disarm, which would end this conflict immediately,” Rubio said.
The top US diplomat added that “the Israelis have shown some flexibility”.

• Claims Rs191bn saved in FY25 as power losses dip due to governance reforms
• Govt eyes 6,000MW surplus supply for crypto, data centres
ISLAMABAD: The Power Division is making another attempt to convince the federal cabinet to curtail returns on solar net metering and remove electricity duty on consumer bills being resisted by the provinces.
Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Power Minister Awais Leghari said he would be presenting a revised plan to the federal cabinet in a week or two based on consultations with some stakeholders to stagger the recovery of investment on net metering to two to three years from the current one and a half years.
Mr Leghari also announced that the Power Division on Thursday moved a summary for cabinet approval to finalise rules for wheeling charges, a key step towards operationalising the competitive electricity trading market.
He added that the government was exploring plans to offer 5,000-6,000MW of surplus electricity at marginal costs to industries such as data centres and crypto mining, and discussions were underway with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The minister said that a change in the net metering arrangement would not reduce the electricity tariff, but there would be no further increase in rates. Unless measures are introduced, the expansion of solar systems could add to the surplus on the grid. The combination of the sale of surplus power and the containment of solar expansion would help grid stability, he said.
Mr Leghari said the consumers had adopted solar net metering under a government policy and would not be penalised, but its return had become unjustified. If not corrected, even the net metering consumers would be bearing billions of rupees worth of electricity bills in future.
He said the government had saved over Rs3 trillion from negotiations with the independent power producers, cancelled over 10,000MW of new power plants out of 17,000MW committed capacity and saved over Rs4tr in future payments, whereas correction of net metering was also on the agenda.
Mr Leghari said he had written letters to the chief ministers to convey that power distribution companies (Discos) would no longer act as collection agents of electricity duty for provinces.
He said that only one chief minister had so far responded, and once the remaining three give their feedback, a case would be presented before the federal cabinet for a final decision.
Mr Leghari said the Power Division had been able to reduce recovery, transmission and distribution losses through good governance.
He said the government suffered a Rs591 billion loss in fiscal year 2024 due to less billing and higher technical losses of Discos.
This money could have utilised in the development or any other meaningful sector, he added.
The minister said in fiscal 2025, this loss was brought by Rs191bn to Rs399bn through good governance.
 






The government has appointed board of directors to Discos “on merit and without any political consideration”.
He said Discos had been given the target of Rs100bn annual reduction over the next five years, but their losses had been cut by Rs191bn even before the start of that five-year period.
This was achieved through improvement in recoveries, he said, explaining that the Discos had suffered Rs315bn loss in FY24 when recovery against billing stood at 92.4 per cent.
The bill recovery was improved to 96.6pc in FY25, bringing down these losses to just Rs132bn, as the recovery rate of five Punjab and Islamabad companies was beyond 101pc.
Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses, mostly attributed to electricity theft, fell slightly from Rs276bn in FY24 to Rs266bn in FY25, with losses decreasing from 18.3pc to 17.6pc.
The minister added that savings could have been higher — around Rs225 billion — had the government been able to appoint new boards for Hyderabad and Sukkur Electric, which remain delayed due to litigation.
He revealed the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) had uncovered massive electricity theft at four steel and furnace factories using tampered meters.
He claimed the factory owners wielded significant influence and attempted to remove security officials and Disco staff involved in the investigation. However, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and government institutions backed the anti-theft campaign.
The minister said the Power Division and Discos would focus on recoveries, dismantle networks of theft and improve governance and overall efficiencies.
Responding to a question, Mr Leghari said the Power Division believed that since K-Electric’s overwhelming reliance would now be on the national grid, the uniformity of tariff should extend to fuel costs as well as quarterly adjustments.
He said K-Electric’s import from the grid had increased to 1,600MW from 1,000MW, which would further go up by another 400MW with additional interconnection within a month.
He said the Power Division would engage with the power regulator and present a detailed point of view before the federal cabinet for an amicable and sustainable solution.
The power minister conceded that LNG import contracts were made almost a decade ago on the assumption that LNG-based power plants would operate on LNG and consume 100pc of imports.
However, he stressed that no power plant should be operated without a fuel-based merit order. Therefore, the previous assumptions did not materialise.
“We believe that violation of economic merit order is a mortal sin,” he said, adding that the only solution was to review LNG contracts as had been done in the case of independent power producers.

The CJP made these remarks in a meeting with the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) chairman, Rabiya Javeri Agha, on Thursday.
The meeting discussed initiatives for the protection and promotion of human rights, according to an official statement.
CJP Afridi appreciated the NCHR for its efforts to address rights-based challenges.

IFJ asks apex court to review Peca, directs govt to amend it

Ms Agha briefed the CJP on NCHR’s ongoing initiatives, policy interventions and monitoring mec­hanisms related to the implementation of constitutional and legal safeguards for fundamental rights.
 
 

They reaffirmed the need for co­ordination among state institutions to address systemic gaps in the human rights protection framework.
The CJP emphasised the judiciary’s commitment to upholding constitutional values, due process, and the protection of citizens’ fundamental freedoms.
The meeting ended with a “shared resolve to work collectively for a more just, inclusive and rights-respecting society,” the official statement added.
Peca review
The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) secretary general, Anthony Bellanger, has requested the Supreme Court to review the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) as a matter of priority and provide necessary directions to the government to amend the law.
In his letter addressing the CJP, Mr Bellanger said “swift action” was needed to “address this critical situation for Pakistan’s media and pro-tect press freedom as guaranteed in Article 19 of Pakistan’s constitution”.
 
 

The letter was delivered to the apex court on Thursday by Shakeel Ahmad, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) secretary general.
The letter stated the increased political polarisation, widespread protests and social disruption meant media professionals across Pakistan were “facing increased challenges while performing their duties”.
They are also facing a “heightened level of legal persecution including litigation, intimidation and cases filed under Peca”.
“We understand that Pakistan is a signatory of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and United Nations Conventions that confer freedom of speech and expression and key democratic rights, but the curtailing of these fundamental rights under Peca is of great concern for the IFJ and international journalist community,” the letter explained.

LAHORE / RAWALPINDI: Five people lost their lives and at least 40 were injured in Lahore on Thursday as torrential monsoon rains lashed the city, submerging roads and low-lying areas.
The deadly downpour came as a fresh spell of heavy rainfall is forecast to hit several parts of the country from July 13 to 17, with authorities warning of urban flooding, landslides and rising river levels.
The National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) warned of potential flooding in rivers due to a sharp rise in temperatures in northern regions, particularly Gilgit-Baltistan and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The warming trend is accelerating glacial and snowmelt, increasing river flows.
 
 

According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), moist currents are currently entering the country and are likely to intensify from July 13. A new westerly wave is also expected to approach the country on the evening of July 13.
Under the prevailing weather conditions, rain-wind/thundershowers accompanied by scattered heavy to very heavy falls are expected in several parts of the country.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur, the rainfall is forecast from July 11 to 17.
Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit and others) is likely to receive showers on the night of July 11 and again from July 13 to 16 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakht­u­nkhwa, rain, windstorm and thundershower with scattered heavy falls (at times very heavy) is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Shangla, Battagram, Buner, Kohat, Karak, Bannu, Tank, Lakki Marwat, Dera Ismail Khan, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Waziristan, Orakzai, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Hangu and Kurram from July 11 to July 17 with occasional gaps.
In Punjab and Islamabad, heavy to very heavy rainfall is predicted in major cities including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sargodha and Sahiwal from July 11 to 17.
Southern Punjab districts such as Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur may witness rain on July 11 and again from July 13 to 17.
In Balochistan, areas including Quetta, Zhob, Lasbela and Khuzdar are forecast to receive rain on July 11 and between July 13 and 16.

It advised the residents near rivers and streams to stay vigilant, especially during nighttime and heavy rainfall.
Lahore faces urban flooding
Lahore witnessed an unprecedented monsoon fury on Thursday, recording 182mm of rainfall in just a few hours, which submerged several major roads and low-lying areas.
According to Rescue officials, five people died and 40 were injured in rain-related incidents across Punjab in the last 24 hours.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported rainfall in Lahore for over seven hours. Rainfall recorded in other areas included Sialkot (77mm), Gujranwala (67mm), Chakwal (65mm), Jhelum (64mm), Hafizabad (60mm), Gujarat (52mm), Mandi Bahauddin (47mm), Attock (45mm), Faisalabad (51mm), Narowal (44mm), Okara (33mm), Toba Tek Singh and Sheikhupura (25mm), Rawalpindi and Kasur (23mm), Mangla (19mm), Sargodha (18mm), D.G. Khan (16mm), Jhang (11mm), Mianwali (10mm) and Sahiwal (8mm).
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said drainage was ensured “in the shortest possible time” in Lahore despite the heavy rainfall.
He said the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) and district administrations remained on the ground to manage water removal from highways, underpasses and other vulnerable places.
He noted that this second monsoon spell will continue until July 13 and more rains are expected in divisions including Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur.
Mr Kathia said 36 people have lost their lives and 96 sustained injuries in rain-related incidents this season. A total of 42 houses were damaged and four livestock lost.
Most deaths were caused by roof collapses in dilapidated buildings. He urged citizens to avoid unsafe structures, live electric wires and flood-prone areas.

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Yahya Afridi took up Mr Chaudhry’s plea on Thursday.
The former PTI leader had filed an appeal against the LHC’s order issued on May 20, which rejected the plea.
Advocate Faisal Farid Chaudhry, who represented Mr Chaudhry, argued the high court dismissed the plea without perusing the case record and relying upon facts “sourced through AI and social media platforms”.
The petition had also questioned whether multiple FIRs over a single offence violated fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and whether a single trial should be conducted under the doctrine of similarity to ensure fairness and justice.
During the hearing, CJP Afridi observed the court will dictate the order in the presence of both parties to protect their rights.
He then called Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi and Mr Chaudhry to his chambers.
Earlier on April 8, the apex court had ordered the Anti Terrorism Courts (ATCs) to conclude within four months the trials of suspects allegedly involved in violence on May 9.
It also directed the ATCs to submit progress reports on trials to relevant high courts every two weeks.
On Thursday, CJP appreciated that the trial courts were working and the litigants were exempt from attendance in different districts. The CJP reminded Mr Chaudhry he also got an exemption from personal attendance from the LHC.
During the hearing, Mr Naqvi raised objections to the plea, stating the case at the high court was never heard on merits.
The LHC had ruled on the petition’s admissibility.
The Supreme Court also rejected a plea to halt cases relating to May 9 violence until the present case was decided.
The CJP stated the high court will consider and decide whether to stay the proceedings at the trial court or not.
In case the Supreme Court issues any decision, the case of the parties at the trial court may be affected, observed CJP.
The petitioner highlighted that he was primarily alleged to have committed abetment in connection with the events of May 9 and following his arrest, the authorities engaged in a systematic pattern of malafide conduct to substantiate base-less allegations.
The petitioner remained in police custody for nearly six months, during which no meaningful investigation was conducted, nor was his statement recorded as mandated by law, the petition alleged, adding he was booked in 11 “false, frivolous and politically motivated” cases in Lahore.
The petition stated the malafide intent became apparent when all FIRs implicating the petitioner were initiated through complaints lodged exclusively by police officers.
These complaints were registered on identical dates, with the reported times conspicuously overlapping.
The petitioner was not originally nominated in all FIRs. Instead, his alleged involvement was contrived through supplementary statements recorded at later dates, a practice evidently employed to manufacture charges retroactively.
The fragmented and duplicative proceedings across multiple FIRs violated the principles of justice but also subjected the petitioner to undue harassment and prejudice, the petition alleged, adding the failure to consolidate the cases under one trial has compelled the petitioner to approach the Supreme Court.
The fragmentation of cases across multiple stations not only created unnecessary procedural complexities but also subjected the petitioner to “undue harassment and prejudice”.
“Such an approach undermines the principles of fair trial and judicial economy, which demand that justice be administered efficiently and without duplication.”

• Azma says Imran’s sons will not be allowed to create unrest
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: In the lead-up to the ‘Free Imran Khan Movement’ expected to be launched on Aug 5, the PTI in the northern Punjab region has decided to rely on its grassroots workers to galvanise its support – a move which contrasts with its earlier practice of depending on heavyweights to drum up support for its protests.
Since the incarceration of the party founder in 2023, the embattled political party has failed to mobilise workers, particularly in Punjab, due to a crackdown on its top- and middle-tier leadership by the provincial government as well as a disconnect between the party leaders and the cadre.
Seemingly, in order to bridge this gap, the North Punjab chapter of the party has established committees at the district and tehsil levels to run awareness campaigns for the release of Mr Khan.
A meeting chaired by chapter’s president Malik Taimoor Masood decided that the movement would be officially launched on August 5. It was further decided that Malik Yasir Patwali, Fayaz Tabassum and Yasir Jamal will lead the awareness campaign in Attock. In Rawalpindi Metropolitan, the task has been assigned to Malik Azeem, Tayyaba Raja and Muslim Shehzad. In Rawalpindi City, Zubair Khan, Wajahat Qayyum Abbasi, Parveen Rehmani and Hafiz Zahid will lead the campaign and Sardar Mansoor and Hasnain Sunbal will mobilise workers in Murree.
Similarly, three PTI workers, Farrukh Mehmood Sial, Rizwan Dani and Muhammad Afzal, have been nominated from Jhelum, while Aftab Ahmad Sahi, Malik Hammad and Ehtisham Kiani have been assigned duties in Chakwal. Ghulam Dastagir and Sajida Begum will work in Mianwali and Arslan Manch and Zohaib Umar will rally workers in Khushab. The party workers have been charged with mobilisation duties in Sargodha and Bhakkar as well.
The campaign will start at the district and tehsil levels, featuring corner meetings, door-to-door canvassing, and public engagement under the leadership of local MNAs, MPAs, ticket-holders, and organisational office-bearers. It was also decided that each district and tehsil would regularly submit performance reports to the designated representatives of the North Punjab chapter. These activities will be monitored and reports will be forwarded by the PTI North Punjab president to the senior leadership.
Speaking to Dawn, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said the party aimed to gain momentum ahead of the Aug 5 anniversary of Imran Khan’s imprisonment and workers were being mobilised in this regard.
He said at present, they had not decided to take the protest to Islamabad, and for now it would be public meetings and rallies in respective cities and provinces. He said all the district committees would report to PTI Punjab President Aliya Hamza, who would then inform the central leadership about the progress on mobilisation.
‘Unrest in Pakistan’
Meanwhile, the Punjab government’s information minister, Azma Bukhari, said Imran’s son — Kasim and Suleman — would not be allowed to create unrest in Pakistan. Earlier this week, Aleema Khan had said that the ex-PM’s son would be visiting Pakistan to join the campaign for the release of their father. She, however, did not share a timeline in this regard.
In a presser in Lahore, Ms Bukhari said that Imran Khan’s sons would not be allowed to create unrest in the country. “Why did Khan’s sons not visit Pakistan when he was injured. Now suddenly, they are missing Pakistan,” she questioned. The minister said Mr Khan’s sons would not be allowed to create unrest in Pakistan. “Jemima has reportedly barred her sons from visiting Pakistan… The instigators will not be allowed to use children to spread unrest,” she warned.
On the other hand, Imran’s ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith accused the government of preventing her children from speaking to their father and threatening to arrest them if they came to Pakistan. “My children are not allowed to speak on the phone to their father Imran Khan. He has been in solitary confinement in prison for nearly 2 years,” Ms Goldsmith said in a post on X on Thursday.
She said, “Pakistan’s government has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars. This doesn’t happen in a democracy or a functioning state. This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.” Her statement came after a warning from PM’s adviser Rana Sanaullah that Imran Khan’s sons would be arrested if they joined any violent PTI protest in Pakistan.
 






On the other hand, PML-N’s Senator Irfan Siddiqui hinted that the government might not arrest them on arrival, but the law would take its course if they joined the protest movement of the PTI.
“In my personal opinion as the government has so far not taken any official stance, Suleman and Kasim should be allowed to come. They should come and carry out their activities.”
