Aamir Khan, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, told Dawn.com that the children found the mortar shell in the field and took it to their village, Sorband, thinking it was a toy.
“The shell exploded, resulting in the deaths of five children and leaving 12 others critically injured,” he said. “The deceased and injured children have been transported to Khalifa Gul Nawaz hospital,” the spokesperson said, adding that the injured children were being provided medical treatment in the emergency ward.
A statement issued by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan said he visited the hospital to enquire about the condition of the injured.
“He checked on their condition, encouraged them and met with hospital administration to review the provision of treatment, availability of medicines, and other medical facilities in detail.”
It added that the Bomb Disposal Squad arrived at the scene, collected evidence and initiated an investigation.
According to the statement, the RPO vowed that all possible assistance would be provided to the affected families and those responsible would soon be brought to justice. RPO Khan also met with the relatives of the injured and assured them of full support.
Children playing with explosives, thinking they are toys, is not a new phenomenon.
In October 2023, a child lost his life while eight others were injured when a hand grenade exploded in the Zarchain area of Balochistan’s Wadh city.
The month before, nine people, including four children, lost their lives while a woman was injured when a “rocket launcher’s” ordnance exploded in a house in Sindh’s Kashmore district.</p><small>2025-08-02 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616982-how-pakistan-shot-down-indias-cutting-edge-fighter-jet-using-chinese-gear' target='_blank'><strong>How Pakistan shot down India's cutting-edge fighter jet using Chinese gear</strong></a><br><p>

The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since a student-led revolt ousted then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina on August 5, 2024, ending her 15-year rule.
Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections are held, has said he inherited a “completely broken down” system of public administration.
Yunus previously pledged to unveil a “big package” to overhaul democratic institutions.
But efforts to reach agreements have made slow progress as political parties jostle for power ahead of elections, slated for early 2026.
Yunus’s government has warned that political power struggles risk jeopardising the gains that have been made.
On July 29, Yunus said he was working to “build a broad national consensus around a renewed political system — one that delivers inclusive, participatory, and credible elections”.
Yunus’s office said on Saturday that the “July Proclamation” would be “presented to the nation … in the presence of all political parties involved in the mass uprising”.
Hasina’s rule saw widespread human rights abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killings of her political opponents.
Her government was also accused of politicising courts and the civil service, staging lopsided elections and dismantling democratic checks on its power.
Hasina, 77, fled to India, where she has defied court orders to attend her ongoing trial on charges amounting to crimes against humanity.
Protests began on July 1, 2024, with university students calling for reforms to a quota system for public sector jobs.
They culminated on August 5, 2024, when thousands of protesters stormed Hasina’s palace as she escaped by helicopter.</p><small>2025-08-02 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0215484549efbc8.jpg?r=161158' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928258/viral-video-of-passenger-slapping-muslim-man-on-indian-flight-sparks-social-media-outrage' target='_blank'><strong>Viral video of passenger slapping Muslim man on Indian flight sparks social media outrage</strong></a><br><p>A passenger slapping a Muslim fellow traveller on an Indian flight sparked outrage on social media when a video of the incident went viral, Indian news outlet Hindustan Times reported on Friday.
Discrimination against Muslims in India has spiked in recent months, amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s allegations levelled without evidence against Islamabad over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
According to the Hindustan Times, the passengers were on board IndiGo flight 6E138 from Mumbai to Kolkata.
“The victim appeared to be unwell and was receiving assistance from the cabin crew when another passenger suddenly slapped him without any provocation,” it reported.
The Times of India said that the victim, a Muslim man, had a panic attack, “began sobbing and walking the aisle requesting to de-board as the aircraft taxied, when another flyer struck him”.
A video clip circulating online showed the victim in visible distress after being hit. Another passenger could be heard asking, “Why did you slap him? You don’t have the right to hit anybody, do you understand?”
A crew member was also heard telling the accused, “Don’t do that.”
 






The reason behind the assault remains unknown for now, and investigations are ongoing. However, the video sparked outrage across social media, with many calling for strict action against the attacker.
The consensus across social media was that the victim had been hit because he was a “visible Muslim”, causing the conversation to turn to slamming “hate politics” and religious divides.
According to the Hindustan Times, one user on X wrote, “This isn’t society collapsing, it’s decades of hate politics finally reaching cruising altitude.”
Another commented, “What level of harassment and abuse is this? Just slapping a guy because he was a visible Muslim? What action have you taken against him? He should be behind bars and banned from travelling.”
Another comment said, “What right does that person have to hit anyone? Pathetic!”
Attacker handed over to authorities
Upon landing in Kolkata, the attacker was handed over to security personnel at the airport. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) took the individual into custody for further investigation.
IndiGo condemned the incident and confirmed that it would initiate action under unruly flyer rules, which may include a temporary no-fly ban. The airline emphasised its commitment to passenger safety and respectful conduct on all flights.
The airline declared the individual as “unruly” and stated that relevant aviation security agencies had been informed in line with protocol.
IndiGo said in a post on X, “Such unruly behaviour is completely unacceptable, and we strongly condemn any actions that compromise the safety and dignity of our passengers and crew.”
The airline added, “We remain committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment on all our flights.”
 






In May, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), which is based in New Delhi, reported 184 hate crimes targeted at Muslims all over India between April 27 and May 8 in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report.
The White House, India’s Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India starting August 1 along with additional penalties, potentially straining relations with the world’s most populous democracy.
Trump indicated in a Truth Social post that India would face additional penalties for the purchase of Russian arms and oil. However, he later said that he did not care what India does with Russia.
 


On Friday, Trump told reporters that he had heard that India would no longer be buying oil from Russia.
 
 

Two senior Indian officials said there had been no change in policy, according to the NYT report, which added that one official said the government had “not given any direction to oil companies” to cut back imports from Russia.
Reuters had earlier reported that Indian state refiners stopped buying Russian oil in the past week as discounts narrowed in July.
On July 14, Trump threatened 100pc tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine. Russia is the top supplier to India, responsible for about 35pc of India’s overall supplies.
On Monday, Trump said most partners that do not negotiate separate trade deals would soon face tariffs of 15-20pc on their exports to the US, well above the broad 10pc tariff he imposed in April. His administration will notify some 200 countries soon of their new “world tariff” rate.</p><small>2025-08-02 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02153703c3b57ea.png?r=153718' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928257/iran-president-lands-in-lahore-eyeing-to-boost-trade-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Iran president lands in Lahore, eyeing to boost trade ties</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian landed in Lahore on Saturday, eyeing to reaffirm his commitment to elevate the annual bilateral trade with Pakistan.
Pakistan has recently expressed solidarity and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which experts say is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.
Pezeshkian is paying a two-day official visit to Pakistan over the weekend, making it his first trip to Islamabad in his current role, the Foreign Office said. Ahead of his trip, Pakistan yesterday pledged to help defuse tensions between Iran and the United States.
Ex-premier and MNA Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, received the distinguished guest upon his arrival in Lahore.
 


According to PTV News, the Iranian president will pay a visit to Mazar-i-Iqbal and then head to Islamabad, where he will meet with President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
PM Shehbaz had met with Pezeshkian during his visit to Iran in late May, which was part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the conflict with India.
Pezeshkian is the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. Late Ebrahim Raisi had visited the country in April last year, just a month before he died in a helicopter crash.
According to Iran’s state media IRNA, before departing for Pakistan, Pezeshkian emphasised the plan to elevate their annual trade exchanges to $10 billion. The two countries had agreed in April last year to boost trade over the next five years.
The president termed the trade relations between Tehran and Islamabad as “good” and identified boosting trade with Pakistan via land, air and sea as priorities for this trip, the report added.
“Through Pakistan, Iran can connect to the Silk Road linking China and Pakistan, and the route can then extend through Iran to Europe,” he said.
Emphasising that security and border issues were of great importance to both Iran and Pakistan, he stressed that regional security must be achieved through cooperation, according to IRNA.
 
 

Pezeshkian noted that the two neighbours have “enjoyed good, friendly, and deep-rooted relations” since Pakistan’s independence. “The two countries cooperate in economic, scientific, cultural, and border areas, and a deep bond exists between the people of both sides,” he was quoted as saying.
Pezeshkian highlighted that during the recent Israel-Iran war and the United States’ strikes against its nuclear facilities, “Pakistan was among the countries that strongly condemned this aggression and declared its readiness to provide any necessary support for Iran’s territorial integrity, as well as for the government and people of Iran”.
According to IRNA, the president also noted that “the enemy plans to create division among Muslims, but Iran will thwart the enemies’ plots”, adding that Tehran aims to maintain unity and solidarity between Iran and Pakistan.
Pezeshkian had left for Pakistan earlier today. He is accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, senior ministers and other high-ranking officials.

The Pakistani government has lately seemed willing to fast-track the adoption of crypto currencies for banks, foreign exchange comp­anies and gold trading. In March, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched, which was a government-backed initiative to regulate, foster, and integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency innovations into the country’s financial and economic framework.
“A high-level video conference was held between Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal bin Saqib and Director of the National Investment Agency of Kyrgyzstan Farukht Aminov,” acccording to PTV.
“Both sides emphasised the development of virtual assets, technology exchange, and cooperation in regulatory frameworks,” it added.
The Kyrgyz director highlighted the importance of exchanging information, experiences and best global practices.
Bilal bin Saqib said Kyrgyzstan can become a key partner in innovation and regulation in digital assets. He described Pak-Kyrgyz relations as a strong foundation in the digital economy of the future.
The two countries also discussed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for formal cooperation in the crypto sector. The participants expressed their commitment to continue bilateral cooperation for the establishment of a secure, transparent and modern digital economy.
The participants of the video conference also agreed that there is a need for regional partnerships to promote blockchain and digital finance in Central and South Asia.
In July, President  Asif Ali Zardari had approved the “Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025” to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin pioneer Michael Saylor has also previously lauded Pakistan’s efforts to move towards cryptocurrency and digital assets.</p><small>2025-08-02 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0214003519122ed.png?r=140429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928116/over-20-brands-of-drinking-water-unsafe-for-human-consumption' target='_blank'><strong>Over 20 brands of drinking water unsafe for human consumption</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Council for Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) on Friday declared 23 brands unsafe for human consumption due to microbiological or chemical contamination.
The government of Pakistan had tasked PCRWR with monitoring bottled/mineral water brands on quarterly basis and publicize the results for awareness of public health.
For the second quarter of year 2025 from April to June, 203 samples of mineral/bottled water brands were collected from 21 major cities. Comparison of test results with the bottled water quality standards of Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) had revealed that 23 brands were unsafe for human consumption due to microbiological or chemical contamination.
Eleven brands such as New Mehran, Aqua 111, Nice Pure Max, Pure Drinking Water, Logic, Himalya Cool, Natural Pure Life, Natural, Forever Bottled Drinking Water, Drinkly Pure Drinking Water, Qudrat Water were found to be unsafe due to the presence of higher levels of sodium.
Four brands — Atco Drinking Water, Aqua nest, Pani, New Mountain — were found to be unsafe due to the presence of higher levels of arsenic.
 
 

One brand labelled Vey Forever was found unsafe due to the presence of a high level of potassium than the permissible limit.
Nine other brands, such as Noble Pure Drinking Water, Aqua 111, Clear, Wah Water, Nice Pure Max, Aqua King bottled water, Maa jee, Freshin drinking water and Iceland, were found contaminated with bacteria and thus were unsafe for drinking purposes.
PCRWR said that the general public was encouraged to look at the detailed report to know about the status of water quality of bottled water brands they consume.

Floods swept across GB last week, causing landslides, leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said today that a search operation on Babusar Highway is under way during which many vehicles that were swept away by the floods have been recovered.
“The vehicles were found but we found no clue as to the missing persons,” he said in a statement.
Faraq continued that rehabilitation work has been accelerated in the flood-affected areas.
He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would be visiting GB in two or three days. “Hopefully, the prime minister’s visit will provide relief to the injured victims.”
PM Shehbaz yesterday expressed his aim to visit GB in solidarity with the affected people. He reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in the flood-hit areas in a high-level meeting that focused on immediate relief efforts, future disaster preparedness and federal assistance to the affected regions.
 






“Water and electricity have been restored in many areas of the region,” the spokesperson said, adding that communication systems on Babusar Highway and other places have also been restored.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Yesterday, a glacier burst in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person when a father and son fell into a ravine and were buried under the debris of the glacier.
More cloudburst-induced floods hit the Ghizer and Hunza districts on Thursday.
Last week, at least four tourists were killed, two others injured and 15 went missing after floods triggered by heavy rain swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02131046d5c0f03.png?r=132544' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928249/spacex-crew-dragon-docks-with-international-space-station' target='_blank'><strong>SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with International Space Station</strong></a><br><p>An international team of four astronauts aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule docked on Saturday with the orbiting International Space Station (ISS).
“Docking confirmed!”, SpaceX posted on social media, along with a video showing the spacecraft making contact with the ISS at 2:27am Eastern Time (11:27am PKT), far above the southeast Pacific Ocean.
American astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan’s Kimiya Yui, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Platonov are joining the ISS on a six-month mission.
They lifted off on Friday morning from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, their capsule mounted on a Falcon 9 rocket.
It is the 11th crew rotation mission to the ISS under Nasa’s Commercial Crew Programme, created to succeed the Space Shuttle era by partnering with private industry.
 






 






“We have cold drinks, hot food, and us waiting — see you soon,” the ISS crew told the new arrivals shortly after contact, according to the posted video.
“Hello Space Station — Crew 11 is here and we are super excited to join,” Fincke replied.
As part of their stay, the Crew-11 astronauts will simulate moon landing scenarios that could be encountered near the lunar South Pole under the US-led Artemis programme.
Using handheld controllers and multiple display screens, they will test how shifts in gravity affect astronauts’ ability to pilot spacecraft, including future lunar landers.
 
 

Continuously inhabited since 2000, the ISS functions as a testbed for research that supports deeper space exploration — including eventual missions to Mars.
Among Crew-11’s more colourful cargo items are Armenian pomegranate seeds, which will be compared to a control batch kept on Earth to study how microgravity influences crop growth.
The ISS is set to be decommissioned after 2030, with its orbit gradually lowered until it breaks up in the atmosphere over a remote part of the Pacific Ocean called Point Nemo, a spacecraft graveyard.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616953-allegations-of-military-control-over-kp-minerals-baseless' target='_blank'><strong>Allegations of military control over KP minerals baseless</strong></a><br><p>

The Aviation Industry Corporation of China had displayed its Z-10 attack helicopter for the first time outside its home country at the Singapore Airshow in February 2024, according to Reuters. It also noted that as of then, the model had Pakistan as the only known export customer, but no sales had been announced at the air show.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir presided over the induction ceremony and later witnessed a firepower demonstration by the “newly inducted Z-10ME helicopters” at the Muzaffargarh Field Firing Ranges, the ISPR said in a press release, without specifying the number of the craft acquired.
“The induction of this potent system marks a major leap in the modernisation of Army Aviation, reinforcing its integrated battlefield response and capacity to deliver decisive effects against potential adversaries,” the military’s media affairs wing noted.
 


In 2021, Defense News reported that China sent three of its Z-10 helicopter gunships for trials in Pakistan, but they failed to sufficiently impress officials and were returned.
However, former Australian defence attaché to Islamabad, Brian Cloughley, had said it was “likely that the Pakistan Army will evaluate the Chinese Z-10ME attack helicopter”.
The ISPR highlighted: “This state-of-the-art, all-weather platform is capable of precision strike operations day and night.
“Equipped with advanced radar systems and cutting-edge electronic warfare suites, the Z-10ME significantly enhances the army’s capability to engage diverse aerial and ground threats.”
Interacting with troops at the Muzaffargarh firing ranges, COAS Munir lauded their exceptional morale, professionalism, and combat proficiency.
He appreciated the “successful demonstration of combined arms tactics, reflecting the army’s firm resolve to maintain a decisive edge in the evolving character of warfare”.
Separately, Field Marshal Munir stressed the importance of national unity and civil-military synergy in countering “hybrid threats”.
 
 

He made the remarks as he engaged with members of academia and civil society during an interactive session, following his visit to Multan Garrison.
“He underscored the significance of national unity, civil-military synergy and a whole-of-nation approach in countering hybrid threats and fostering societal cohesion,” the ISPR statement read.
At the garrison, COAS Munir was briefed on the formation’s operational preparedness and ongoing training activities, the report added. He reaffirmed the army’s “unwavering commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
The army chief expressed satisfaction over the high standards of readiness.</p><small>2025-08-02 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/02124840d5d865c.png?r=124939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928166/transport-dept-is-not-responsible-for-red-line-delays-sindh-assembly-told' target='_blank'><strong>Transport dept is not responsible for Red Line delays, Sindh Assembly told</strong></a><br><p>• Sharjeel terms relocating utility connections a major challenge in construction
• Says govt aims to digitise entire transport department by 2026
KARACHI: Replying to lawmakers’ written and verbal queries during the Question Hour in the Sindh Assembly, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon informed the house on Friday that the provincial transport department was not responsible for delays in completion of the much-awaited Red Line-Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
Mr Memon, who also holds the portfolios of transport and information department, said every aspect of the Red Line project was being monitored by local experts and international consultants.
He said that work was underway on major development schemes in the city, and progress was being made rapidly on two sections of the Yellow Line BRT with a bridge expected to be completed by August.
In reply to a verbal question raised by Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan Dr Fouzia Hameed, the minister acknowledged that occasional delays might occur due to technical or administrative issues, but overall, the work was progressing smoothly. He stated that relocating utility connections was always a major challenge.
 
 

“Several stages had to be completed to remove the gas line from the Yellow Line BRT route, and at times, unexpected issues also arise,” he added.
Highlighting the provincial government’s efforts to provide top-notch travel facilities to the people of the provincial, the senior minister said that the Peoples Bus Service, which currently transported 110,000 passengers daily, was a testament to this commitment.
“The government plans to introduce more buses to tackle the long-standing transportation issue in the province, including Karachi,” he added.
He said that Pakistan’s first EV-buses had been introduced by the Sindh government and added that EV-scooters would be provided to women free of cost by the end of August.
Responding to another question, he said that the provincial government aimed to digitise the entire transport department by 2026.
“Route permits have already been digitised, ensuring a more efficient and transparent system,” he added.
Replying to a call attention notice by Dr Fouzia Hameed on illegal constructions in the city, Qasim Siraj Soomro said that action had been taken against those involved and the government was working to curb illegal constructions.
Call for separate educational board for Christians
In his call attention notice, minority member Mahesh Kumar said that the subject of ethics had been given to minority children in the textbooks.
“The subject of ethics should be for everyone,” he said and asked the provincial government to replace the subject of ethics with religious studies in the educational institutions.
He also demanded the creation of a separate educational board for the Christian community.
Education Minister Sardar Shah, while responding to the notice, said that a single curriculum was brought during the PTI era, which the Sindh government had opposed.
 
 

He said that at that time Muslim children were being taught Islamiat and non-Muslims were taught ethics. “We reviewed the curriculum in 2022 and work was in progress for replacing the subject of ethics with religious studies.”
In response to a notice from MQM-P’s Najam Mirza regarding admissions of children through the Centralised Admission Policy (CAP), the education minister said that the CAP had been extended to the entire province and admissions were automatically done by computer without any human intervention.
He said that preference was given to A1 grade and A grade in admissions.

Former chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM), Aamir Allawala, raised concerns during a media briefing at various vending units, stating that used vehicles already account for 25pc of the market — over 40,000 units annually. In contrast, used car market share stands at zero in India, 0.3pc in Vietnam, and 1.2pc in Thailand, he noted.
Allawala said import duties on completely built-up (CBU) units in Pakistan range from 50–100pc, compared to 125pc in India, 52pc in Vietnam, and 80pc in Thailand. The negligible used car imports in these countries are the result of both tariff and administrative measures, he added.
He asserted that used vehicles, as a category, now form the second-largest segment of Pakistan’s car market, trailing only Suzuki, and have overtaken the collective sales of Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Haval, MG, and Changan.
 
 

Highlighting a lack of transparency, Allawala said that imports and sales of used vehicles remain undocumented. “Remittances for imports are routed via hawala, while local sales are largely cash-based, bypassing formal channels,” he said. This informal trade, he warned, severely undermines local assemblers and vendors who rely on documented transactions and taxation compliance.
Based on an average value of Rs4 million per unit, the influx of used cars represents an annual volume of Rs160bn, he said. He estimated that this diverts about Rs60bn in potential revenue away from local auto parts manufacturers — given an average of Rs1.5 million in locally made parts per new vehicle — and could result in the loss of around 40,000 jobs in assembly and vending units.
“If imports are liberalised, global automakers operating in Pakistan may shift to importing completely built units, both new and used, while local parts vendors will be left without a market and forced to shut down,” he warned.
Referring to the Auto Policy 2016–21, he said 10 new entrants joined the market under favourable incentives, including a 50pc duty concession on already localised parts. This brought the total number of assemblers to 13.
However, vendors have suffered as these entrants have achieved minimal localisation. “One such assembler earned Rs36bn profit in FY25 without any localisation,” he claimed, adding that the assembler’s output surpasses that of the established players.
PAAPAM’s Senior Vice Chairman, Shehryar Qadir, urged the government to adopt models followed by Thailand and Vietnam to develop the vendor base and maximise export potential.
Senate panel backs auto sector
Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Industries and Production, Senator Aon Abbas, reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening domestic manufacturing and promoting high-value investment in the auto sector.
During a visit to Indus Motor Company (IMC) on Friday, accompanied by other committee members, Senator Abbas underscored the critical role of the local automotive industry in driving industrial growth and generating employment.
CEO of IMC, Ali Asghar Jamali, expressed concern over the underutilisation of the industry’s production capacity, noting that more than 64pc remains idle despite substantial investments by leading global automotive brands.

“The US Consulate General Karachi received a report of a threat directed at high-end hotels in Karachi,” the department said in a security alert.
“The US Consulate General in Karachi has temporarily limited visits by official US government personnel to these hotels.”
The State Department said it sometimes declares areas in foreign countries, such as tourist attractions, hotels, markets, shopping malls and restaurants, off-limits to official US government personnel in response to such threats.
The security alert urges people to avoid the areas and crowds, keep a low profile and to stay alert in places frequented by tourists and citizens of Western countries.
The State Department currently has a travel advisory in place for Pakistan that advises US citizens to reconsider travelling there due to the risk of terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.
Britain’s foreign ministry on Friday also advised against all but essential travel to parts of Pakistan.

The protest on the Karakoram Highway has halted all Pakistan-China trade and travel through the border crossing, leaving thousands of people, including Chinese nationals and foreign tourists, stranded in the area.
Protesters, who have gained the support of local political, youth and religious parties, argue that the region’s disputed constitutional status exempts it from federal taxation.
“The federal government is reluctant to solve the genuine demands of local people,” said Mohammad Ishaq, one of the protest organisers.

Protesters argue that federal taxes are illegal due to region’s disputed status

“They are just demanding how federal taxes can be collected from the people who are not constitutional citizens of Pakistan and the region is a disputed status area.”
 
 

He added that protesting traders would not back down from their “principle stance of “No taxation without representation”.
The tax dispute has paralysed the local economy for the last eight months, rendering thousands jobless, including transporters, hotel owners, shopkeepers and customs agents.
Ayub Waziri, a member of the GB Assembly, said the issue extends beyond the trading community.
“This is an issue of the GB people,” Waziri said, explaining that because the region is not constitutionally part of Pakistan, all federal taxes imposed there are illegal.
Mr Waziri said that during the last year negotiations, officials from the Federal Board of Revenue had admitted that GB falls in a “non-tariff zone”.
He said the federal government has since formed a committee to resolve the issue and that the GB government is acting as a mediator.
The protest movement intensified on Friday as hundreds of people in rallies from multiple areas joined the blockade to show solidarity.
“The protest movement has awakened GB people for their rights,” said Moulana Sharfuddin, a leader of Tanzeem Ahl-i-Sunnat wal Jamat, GB, expressing his support.
Protesters claim the standoff has left them victims of federal policies.
 
 

Ahmed Nabi, a protester, told Dawn that billions of rupees worth of items imported through the Sost Dry Port have been held up for the last month.
He said many items have expired, while others stored in the open have been damaged by rain because Pakistan Customs officials are not clearing local consignments.
Javed Hussain, another organiser, alleged that speedy clearance of goods is “allowed to only a handful of people”.
“The economic exploitation of local people will never be accepted,” he said.

This was the second such honour killing incident in the Tangir district within a week
According to FIR registered with Jaglot Police Station, Javed Iqbal, his wife and children were washing clothes on a river near their home when two men, Afsar Khan and Dar Khan, reached there and allegedly shot Javed Iqbal dead.
The two accused, after killing Javed Iqbal, also killed a married woman in the name of honour.

HRCP denounces second such incident in Tangir area within a week

In the same area on July 21, a man Bareem from Frori village, allegedly shot dead his wife, the mother of four children, and another man in the name of honour.
 
 

The incident sparked protest over social media by rights and civil society activists.
Local community leaders and activists of political parties also condemned these killings and called for immediate, transparent investigation into these incidents. They also demanded effective measures to prevent further honour-related killing in GB.
In a statement issued here, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the brutal ‘honour’ killing of Awami Action Committee vice chairman Javed Iqbal and a married woman in the area.
 






The HRCP said that Javed Iqbal was murdered in the presence of his mother and wife which also shows the barbarity of the act.
“This marks the second such incident in Tangir within a week in which two women and two men were killed in the name of honour.
“We demand an immediate and transparent investigation, swift prosecution of the perpetrators and urgent action to dismantle the culture of impunity surrounding honour-based violence in Gilgit-Baltistan,” the HRCP said.

Judge Muhammad Naeem Sheikh dir­ected the Mianwali police chief to ensure the arrest all 51 fugitives of law within a month and produce them in the court.
The ATC in Sargodha handed down a rigorous life sentence to Mr Ismail for his role in the May 9, 2023 riots, which saw attacks on a judicial complex and other government installations in Mianwali.
The verdict, delivered by Judge Muhammad Naeem Sheikh, also declared 50 other PTI leaders and workers as proclaimed offenders.

Warrants out for arrest of 18 party leaders in Nov 26 protests case

Among those named as fugitives are prominent figures such as former Punjab opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar and sitting MNAs Ahmad Chatha and Bilal Ijaz.
Omar Ayub, the opposition leader in the National Assembly, had previously been declared a fugitive by the court.
Three cases were registered at City Police Station Mianwali against hundreds of PTI leaders and workers for rioting, attacking a Pakistan Air Force base, and damaging public property, including setting fire to court records.
Most parliamentarians and workers were nominated in the FIRs months after the incidents.
Malik Shafqat Abbas Awan, a PTI MNA and counsel for one of the accused, condemned the judgment, calling it “a black spot on the face of the judiciary.”
He noted that Ismail and others had previously been acquitted in two related cases, and accused the court of relying on evidence that had already been rejected.
According to the court’s order, Ismail was convicted under multiple sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, receiving three life terms, a collective 15 years of rigorous imprisonment, and fines totaling over Rs3.5 million. The court also ordered the forfeiture of his property.
Warrants out for 18 PTI leaders
Separately, an ATC in Rawalpindi issued arrest warrants for 18 senior PTI leaders in a case linked to the Wah Cantt protest on Nov 26, 2024.
Those named include Khyber Pakh­tu­nkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Ganda­pur; Aleema Khan, the sister of jailed ex-premier Imran Khan; former provincial minister Ijaz Khan Jazi; former federal minister Sheikh Waqas Akram; and former MNA Kanwal Shozab.
The court ordered police to apprehend the accused and present them on Aug 8, also summoning the investigating officer with the complete case record.
 
 

Prosecutors told the court that the accused were “deliberately evading arrest and ignoring repeated court summons, thereby obstructing the
legal proceedings.”
Prosecutor Zaheer Abbas argued that the accused’s continued absence was “affecting the judicial process and undermining the rule of law.”
The court also took up an application seeking cancellation of bail for 68 accused in a related case, issuing notices to their sureties and adjourning proceedings until August 5.
The ATC warned that legal action would be taken not only against absconding individuals but also against those who provided bail sureties if the accused fail to appear.

“We have received directives from the home department to launch a fresh drive to repatriate all Afghans… in a respectful and orderly manner,” Meharullah, a senior government official in Quetta, the capital of Balo­chistan province, told AFP.
On Friday, there were “around 4,000 to 5,000 people at the Chaman border” waiting to return, said Habib Bingalzai, a senior government official in Chaman.
Abdul Latif Hakimi, the head of Refugee Registration in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province across the border, said they were aware of an increase in returning Afghans on Friday.
 
 

Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Tali­ban government in 2021.
A deportation drive first launched in 2023 was renewed in April when the government rescinded hun­dreds of thousands of residence permits for Afghans, warning them of arrests if they did not leave.
Analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to control militancy in the border regions.
In total, more than a million Afghans have left Paki­stan since 2023, incl­uding more than 200,000 since April this year.
The campaign targeted the more than 800,000 Afghans with temporary residence permits, some of whom were born in Pakistan or have lived here for decades.
However, many Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, with the result that the deportation drive has widespread support.
Pakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afgh­anistan, battling a growing insurgency in parts of Khy­ber Pakh­tunkhwa and Balochistan.
Last year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade and the government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks.
Iran has launched a similar large-scale deportation campaign of Afghans, which has seen more than 1.5 million sent back across the border.

Both Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz have been camping in Murree for the last several days to discuss “important legislation”.
 






They discussed with Am­­bassador Al-Zaabi on how to expand bilateral co­­op­e­ration in fraternal relatio­­ns, economic partnership, education, science and sustainable development.

In this regard, he also stressed the need for streamlining government support to bar associations for maximum impact and cost-efficiency.
The CJP, while presiding over a meeting in Peshawar, reviewed institutional linkages between bar associations and the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) and shared insights from recent visits to remote districts across the country, where he assessed judicial infrastructure and identified implementation gaps caused by poor coordination.
 
 

CJP Afridi also highlighted the need to include bar associations in judicial development efforts, especially regarding judicial complexes.
The meeting was attended by senior judicial and government officials, including Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Tahir Warraich, KP Bar Council Vice Chairman Ahmed Farooq Khattak, and representatives from the Supreme Court, high courts, law and justice commission, the provincial government, and the Ministry of Law and Justice.

Meets PHC chief justice, KP lawyers

To bridge coordination gaps, the LJCP will post senior representatives in each province, based at high courts, to serve as liaisons with district bars. Their responsibilities would include raising awareness about justice sector initiatives, identifying local priorities, and overseeing grassroots reforms. Bar associations will be invited to submit development proposals to district development committees (headed by district and sessions judges), ensuring federal and provincial departments participate in planning and avoid resource duplication.
 
 

The CJP urged provincial departments to remain engaged with designated officers for timely execution of justice-related projects. Highlighting persistent issues such as poor infrastructure, unreliable power, and limited digital access in remote districts, he called for targeted interventions.
Provincial governments were instructed to integrate these initiatives into their annual planning and prioritise gender-sensitive facilities such as shelters for female litigants.
He also encouraged bar associations to take full advantage of Continuing Legal Education (CLE) programmes offered by the judicial academy. He called for wider dissemination of the training calendar and appointment of focal persons within bars to coordinate participation.
Bar representatives appreciated the inclusive approach and thanked the CJP for acknowledging the difficulties faced by both litigants and lawyers. Federal and provincial stakeholders pledged full support in realising the goal of accessible, efficient, and citizen-centric justice delivery.
Separately, CJP Afridi and the PHC chief justice met a delegation of lawyers from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the Supreme Court registry in Peshawar.
The delegation included representatives from the KP Bar Council, High Court Bar Association, and 35 district bar associations.
The CJP briefed them on ongoing justice reforms under LJCP, noting that, for the first time, Bar representatives have been included as members of the Commission to foster participatory decision-making in legal policy.
He also shared key outcomes from the recent meeting of the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC), including addressing enforced disappearances through a dedicated response committee; directives to high courts to protect judicial officers from external interference; establishment of commercial litigation corridors and model criminal trial courts and time-bound adjudication in 13 case categories; piloting of a double-docket court regime; introduction of court-annexed mediation and a professional excellence index; standardisation of district judiciary appointments and training; biometric case verification and video link attendance for under-trial prisoners and witnesses; ethical guidelines for AI use in judicial settings; and improved welfare measures for judicial officers.
Expressing concern over inadequate infrastructure in underdeveloped regions — particularly the lack of solar power and digital connectivity — the CJP reiterated the need for targeted reforms to bridge regional disparities.
In a major move towards inclusive justice, he announced a new legal aid initiative to ensure no litigant is left unrepresented. Under this initiative, financially distressed litigants will be entitled to state-funded legal representation from magistrate courts to the Supreme Court, while bar associations will be allowed to nominate competent lawyers for this purpose.
Reiterating the importance of CLE programmes, the CJP urged lawyers to make full use of training opportunities at the Federal Judicial Academy. He listened attentively to the delegation’s concerns and assured them of his commitment to addressing these issues in coordination with relevant institutions. He reaffirmed the judiciary’s resolve to promote transparency, access to justice, and collaborative reform.

• Elders assure army, FC of full support for anti-militancy efforts
BAJAUR / NORTH WAZIRISTAN: A complete curfew was imposed across North Waziristan in view of the security situation, while a peace jirga tried to prevail upon local militant leaders to leave Bajaur.
The moves were part of efforts to restore peace to these merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which have witnessed a spike in militant activity of late, especially along the border with Afghanistan.
On Friday, a peace march was held in the Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district against the deteriorating law and order situation in the area.
Tribal elders, representatives of all political parties, the Utmanzai Jirga, Youth of Kabul Khel, and activists of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) attended the gathering.
Addressing the participants, Utmanzai jirga spok­esman Mufti Baitullah and other speakers expressed concern over rising lawlessness across the district.
 
 

The speakers emphasised that people were living in constant fear, primarily due to the re-emergence of militant elements and poor government strategies, and called upon state institutions to ensure immediate and sustainable peace in the region.
Following the imposition of curfew in the area, the district administration has advised people to stay indoors and avoid travelling on roads.
Jirga efforts
In Bajaur, where ‘Opera­tion Sarbakaf’ was laun­c­hed earlier this week to clear the area of militants, a peace Jirga met local militant leaders to convince them to return to Afghanistan.
But sources said that the local leadership of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have sought another day’s time to consult with their leaders in Afghanistan.
 
 

The meeting, held at a mosque in the Lar Kalan area of Lowi Mamund teh­sil, was attended by a 50-member delegation of the Bajaur Peace Commi­ttee and a group of TTP leaders.
Sources said that Jirga members, led by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and consisting of local PTI MPAs Dr. Hamidur Rehman, Anwar Zeb Khan, and former PTI MNA Gul Zafar Khan — among others — presented a two-point agenda to the TTP leaders.
The delegation asked the militants to either return to Afghanistan, or go into the mountains rather than staying among the local population, as their presence posed a serious threat to locals, Dr Khailur Rehman, a PTI senior leader who was also a part of the delegation, told Dawn.
He said that the TTP leaders had sought time until noon on Saturday to respond to the Jirga’s demands.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid also confirmed this, telling reporters after the meeting that the next round of talks would be held today (Saturday).
The meeting with militant leaders followed a similar engagement in Khyber’s Tirah valley, where a Jirga from the Bar Qambarkhel tribe had called upon TTP commanders to quit the area.
That meeting had also had a similar outcome — with the militants seeking time to consult their leadership in Afghanistan.
Bajaur scouts
A separate Jirga held at the Bajaur Scouts headquarters in Khar, said the peace-loving people of Bajaur stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistan Army and Frontier Corps to restore peace in the region.
According to the statement issued by the Bajaur Scouts, local lawmakers and senior officials of the security forces, district administration, and police were also in attendance in the jirga, which aimed to finalise a result-oriented strategy to establish durable peace and stability in the district.
Addressing the participants, Frontier Corps (North) Inspector General Major General Rao Imran Sirtaj said that anti-terrorism operations are aimed at establishing long-lasting peace and normalcy in the district, with the goal of enabling the people of the region to live in a peaceful environment conducive to progress and prosperity.

In a detailed report released by the Senate Secretariat, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs “uncovered significant concerns” regarding NXCC’s (one of the contractors) prior disqualification, arbitration conflicts, payment discrepancies, document manipulation, and collusive bidding practices.
The meeting presided over by Senator Saifullah Abro discussed serious allegations of irregularities, collusive practices, and potential corruption in the awarding of contracts for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Tranche-III corridor project by the NHA.
 






The panel chief said contracts were initially awarded based on auditor sheets without verifying the credentials of M/s Dynamic Constructors, M/s Rustam Associates, and M/s Ningxia Commun-ications Construction Co., Ltd (NXCC).

Senate panel finds ‘collusive bidding, conflicts of interest, manipulation of documents’ in road projects

“The committee maintained that M/s NXCC is a non-performing firm and is currently involved in litigation related to the Multan-Lodhran project”, the report said. “Surprisingly, NHA proposed Mr. Zafar Hussain Siddiqui as an arbitrator, despite his past association with the first lowest bidders M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates construction companies”, it added.
Mr Abro presented a money trail with bank statement that “clearly indicated Zafar Hussain Siddiqui’s prior affiliation with the JV partners of M/s NXCC”. However, NHA officials said that it had no prior knowledge of the arbitrator’s connection with either party.
 
 

After thorough discussion, the chairman of the committee recommended that NHA file a petition in the Supreme Court against the award, as the circumstances strongly suggest official malafide intent to clear M/s NXCC from litigation and non-performance issues, ultimately facilitating the award of the ADB CAREC Tranche-III (Rajanpur-D.G. Khan-D.I. Khan) Project.
“The secretary of Ministry of Communications also questioned the concerned NHA officials on how such a situation was allowed to develop,” the report said.
Mr Abro told the committee NHA had submitted incomplete papers. They submitted only the auditor reports of M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates, he siad. He alleged the auditor reports prepared by A.B.M & Co. reflected irregularities and signs of collusive practices in ADB CAREC Tranche-III project.
The panel also held a detailed discussion on the Gilgit- Shandur Joint Venture Motorway Project. It noted, according to the auditor’s statement, there were several irregularities and signs of collusive practices in the project. In the Gilgit-Shandur project, M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates are partnered in JV with M/s NXCC and NLC serving as the lead partner.
“Surprisingly, the record showed that contractors received payments exceeding their quoted share which was evident from the payment details.” The committee also noted clear signs of document manipulation.
In several cases, the recorded payments were higher than the amounts mentioned in the corresponding work orders“, said the report, adding the panel expressed serious concern over the lack of verification within the NHA, especially for such a large-scale project.
The committee was shocked to learn that contractors had claimed experience and submitted payment documents for work done with FWO, HSSR, and various building and real estate companies.
Referring to the “Hanzol Hydropower Project,” he revealed that the work order was issued on May 7, 2024, and the work completed on May 7, 2025. However, the bid documents for the project were submitted in September 2024 and the same project was included in the audit reports for the financial year 2023–24.

• HRW says Israel using starvation as a weapon of war
• Author David Grossman calls Israel’s Gaza campaign ‘genocide’
GAZA CITY: President Donald Trump’s special envoy inspected a US-backed food distribution centre in war-torn Gaza on Friday, as the UN rights office reported that Israeli forces had killed hundreds of hungry Palestinians waiting for aid.
Meanwhile, award-winning Israeli author David Grossman called his country’s campaign in Gaza “genocide” and said he was using the term with a “broken heart”.
The visit by Steve Witkoff came as a report from global advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) also accused Israeli forces of presiding over “regular bloodbaths” close to the US-backed aid points.
 


The UN’s rights office in the Palestinian territories said at least 1,373 people had been killed seeking aid in Gaza since May 27 — 105 of them in the last two days of July.
“Most of these killings were committed by the Israeli military,” the UN office said, breaking down the death toll into 859 killed near the US-backed food sites and 514 along routes used by UN and aid agency convoys.
The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, posted on X that he and Witkoff had visited Gaza “to learn the truth” about the private aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is supported by the United States.
“We received briefings from IDF (the Israeli military) and spoke to folks on the ground. GHF delivers more than one million meals a day, an incredible feat!” Huckabee said.
 






The foundation, on its own X account, posted that it had been a “privilege and honor” to host Witkoff and Huckabee as the group delivered its 100-millionth meal in Gaza, fulfilling Trump’s “call to lead with strength, compassion and action”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said 11 people were killed by Israeli fire and air strikes on Friday, including two who were waiting near an aid distribution site run by GHF.
‘Beyond imagination’
In its report on the GHF centres on Friday, Human Rights Watch accused the Israeli military of illegally using starvation as a weapon of war.
“Israeli forces are not only deliberately starving Palestinian civilians, but they are now gunning them down almost every day as they desperately seek food for their families,” said Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch.
 






Witkoff meets Netanyahu
After arriving in Israel, Witkoff held talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over how to resolve the ongoing war, feed desperate civilians and free the remaining Israeli prisoners.
In a recent video, German-Israeli prisoner Rom Braslavski, 21, while watching recent news footage of the crisis in Gaza pleaded with the Israeli authorities to secure his release.
‘Genocide’
In the meantime, award-winning Israeli author David Grossman called his country’s campaign in Gaza “genocide” and said he was using the term with a “broken heart”.
 
 

“For many years, I refused to use that term: ‘genocide’,” the prominent writer and peace activist told Italian daily La Repubblica in an interview published on Friday.
“But now, after the images I have seen and after talking to people who were there, I can’t help using it.” Grossman told the paper he was using the word “with immense pain and with a broken heart.”
He also won Israel’s top literary prize in 2018, the Israel Prize for Literature, for his work spanning more than three decades.

Addressing Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) delegates from across the country, gathered here for the three-day platinum jubilee celebrations, the PPP chairman acknowledged the persistent challenges facing Balochistan “are often not fully understood at the federal level”, stressing that resolving them required consistent hard work, meaningful engagement and sustained investment.
“While there may be a need for kinetic action in certain situations, such measures alone cannot resolve Balochistan’s problems,” he said.
“The provincial government is striving to introduce initiatives that go beyond that. We are bringing projects aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the people of Balochistan. That’s the real battle we are trying to fight and win in Balochistan.”
Earlier, he recalled how the Pakistani Air Force defeated Indian aggression, while Pakistani journalism countered Indian media’s disinformation campaigns. “Our journalists prioritised credibility, truth, and verified news over sensationalism. This commitment is commendable,” he said.

PPP chief praises role of media during recent escalation with India

“The recent conflict made it clear how essential digital platforms are as national assets,” he said.
“Digital media played a critical role, and its freedom proved beneficial. We must now safeguard and empower it. I am grateful that the government lifted the ban on digital media during the war — and that it has not been reinstated since. I sincerely hope it remains that way.”
 
 

Addressing the spread of disinformation by hostile elements, including India, the PPP chairman stressed that misinformation targeting regions like Balochistan, Sindh, and Kashmir was part of a larger campaign.
He vowed to collaborate with PFUJ to introduce legislation to combat disinformation and protect journalism. He expressed hope that the federal government would reconsider some policies towards the media.
“We will do everything we can to implement laws designed to protect journalists. We also ask journalists to work with us in this effort,” he said.

ISLAMABAD / GILGIT: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in flood-hit Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Chairing a high-level meeting to review the monsoon damage, the prime minister ordered an urgent overhaul of the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s early warning infrastructure to make it more proactive and effective.
He also directed authorities to restore and repair road and communication networks on an emergency basis to ensure timely aid delivery and mobility in affected areas.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the meeting focused on immediate relief efforts, future disaster preparedness and federal assistance to the affected regions.
 






Expressing sorrow over the loss of lives and widespread destruction caused by torrential rains, PM Shehbaz reiterated his government’s solidarity with the people of GB and AJK.
“The federal government stands shoulder to shoulder with the administrations and citizens of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir in this hour of grief,” he said. “I will soon visit Gilgit-Baltistan to express solidarity with the victims and a comprehensive federal relief package will be announced to support recovery and rehabilitation efforts.”
The prime minister directed all federal departments to coordinate with regional authorities to conduct swift damage assessments and prioritise life-saving interventions. He stressed the need for a coordinated and rapid response to minimise further losses and ensure timely assistance to those affected.
During the briefing, National Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik informed the premier that monsoon-related disasters had caused 295 deaths and over 700 injuries nationwide. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed and 376 livestock lost.
He also warned of continued flood threats in rivers and streams, noting potential minor flooding at Tarbela, Chashma, Taunsa and Kalabagh, and moderate flood levels at Head Marala and Guddu on the Chenab River. He cautioned that monsoon activity is expected to intensify towards the end of August.
The meeting was attended by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister for Climate Change Dr Musadik Malik and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, among others.
Separately, Minister for National Health Services Syed Mustafa Kamal called on PM Shehbaz on Friday to brief him on ongoing projects and reform efforts in the health sector. The meeting also covered other matters related to the Ministry of Health, according to a statement from the PM’s Office.
 






Tragedies mount in GB
In Gilgit-Baltistan’s Haron area, four members of a family drowned in the Ghizer River while trying to rescue a man reported to be mentally unwell, who had jumped into the water. Rescue 1122 officials said that one family member was rescued, while two women and a man remain missing.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered all available resources to be deployed in the search and rescue operation.
 
 

In a separate incident, a glacier burst in Bagrot Valley on Friday led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The pair had been crossing the glacier in Barchi village on foot when it collapsed.
The GB spokesperson confirmed they fell into a ravine and were buried under debris. The father was rescued after several hours by locals and Rescue 1122.
While a billion-rupee early warning system had been installed in the area under the UNDP-funded Glof-II Project, it failed to function during the incident.
Opposition leader from the constituency, Syed Sohail Abbas Shah, alle­ged large-scale corruption in the implementation of early warning and protection projects, accusing both the government and international organisations.
Emergency declared
Spokesperson Fai­zullah Faraq announced that an eme­rgency has been imp­osed across GB. He urged the federal government to step in and assist with flood relief and the rehabilitation of affected people.
Fresh flash floods have struck the Khanbari area of Diamer district, dest­roying standing crops, farmland and irrigation infrastructure. The search continues for the 11th day for missing tourists along the Babusar Highway.
PM Shehbaz is expected to visit GB soon.

“The decisions by France, the United Kingdom and Canada reinforce the trend towards recognising Palestine as part of efforts to breathe new life into the peace process,” Stubb said in a post to X.
“If I receive a proposal to recognise the Palestinian state, I am prepared to approve it,” Stubb said, deploring an “inhumane” situation in Gaza.
Finland’s Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Friday reiterated Helsinki’s support for a two-state solution, without specifying whether the government was ready to recognise a Palestinian state.

However, the detailed road map for the service is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.
On Friday, Minister for Mari­time Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry called for the swift launch of Pakistan’s first ferry service, stressing the need for immediate reforms to licensing procedures and financial facilitation for operators.
 
 

These reforms aim to ensure affordable sea travel, support pilgrims and boost maritime connectivity.
In a meeting with Shipping and Ports Director General Alia Shahid, the minister highlighted the benefits of sea travel, pointing out that ferry services could offer a reliable and cost-efficient travel option for Zaireen heading to Iran and Iraq.
“Beyond tourism and business, this service can greatly facilitate religious travel. We can offer pilgrims a secure, affordable and efficient option for their journeys,” said Mr Chaudhry.
He also emphasised the potential economic benefits of the service, noting that every year, between 700,000 and one million Pakistani Zaireen travel to Iran and Iraq. If 20 per cent of these pilgrims opt for ferry services in the first three years, it could result in 140,000 to 200,000 passengers annually, representing significant economic potential.
The meeting also revealed that stakeholder consultations, including with private operators and regional maritime authorities, are underway. Feasibility studies and regulatory frameworks are being finalised, with a pilot lau­nch expected in the coming weeks.
“If implemented effectively, this service could become a vital new transport link across the region,” the minister said.
To streamline the process, the minister instructed that the ferry licensing process be fully digitalised and integrated into the Pakistan Single Window platform, similar to the existing ship registration process. He specifically ordered that the current six-month licensing period be reduced to just one month.
“There’s no justification for a half-year delay,” he said. “We must eliminate red tape and act decisively.”
In an effort to attract private sector participation, the minister also called for exploring flexible financial models for ferry operators.
“Our aim is to support, not hinder, entrepreneurs who wish to invest in this sector,” he added.
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs has proposed a hybrid financial model, where the country’s financial management system relies on bank and insurance guarantees to support the venture.
Deadlock over land travel ban
Meanwhile, the deadlock continues between the federal government and political groups representing the Shia community over the ban on land travel for pilgrims.
The negotiation team, which included Nasir Shirazi, Allama Ahmed Iqbal Rizvi and Asad Naqvi from Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), and Allama Shabbir Meesami, Allama Arif Wahidi and Zahid Akhunzada from the Shia Ulema Council (SUC), submitted a written proposal to the Ministry of Interior on Thursday.
 
 

The proposal called for the immediate reversal of the government’s decision to ban land travel to Iran for the pilgrims.
The government has been urged to facilitate the movement of around 80 buses stranded in Quetta to reach the Gabd-Rimdan border crossing. However, the government’s response was delayed, as key officials were occupied with security meetings ahead of the Iranian president’s arrival on Saturday (today).
As a result, neither the Minister of State for Interior nor any senior official from the Ministry of Interior could meet with the joint delegation from MWM and SUC.
One member of the negotiating team said they were awaiting the government’s response and would announce their future strategy after the government’s decision.
“The government must take this matter seriously. We want the issue to be resolved through dialogue, so that the pilgrims may travel to Karbala,” said Nasir Shirazi, secretary general of MWM.
“But it seems the authorities are not understanding the pressure we are under, with many pilgrims also belonging to the Ahle Sunnah school of thought.”
