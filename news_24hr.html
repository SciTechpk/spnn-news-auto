“Pakistan did not ask anyone to arrange talks with India. Pakistan is ready for comprehensive talks with India, including on the Kashmir issue,” he told journalists at Parliament House.
Talking about the May conflict between the two countries and the subsequent ceasefire, he said the latter was still underway.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
Talking about the halt in hostilities, Dar said: “India had requested the US for a ceasefire. I received a call from the US for a ceasefire. I had made it clear that Pakistan did not want war.”
The foreign minister said that Pakistan had been suggested to sit down at a neutral venue for talks, to which he had expressed his willingness to do so.
“I had made it clear that there will be no discussion on any single-point agenda with India. We will discuss all outstanding issues, including the Kashmir issue with India,” he said, adding that “unnecessary rhetoric” continued flowing from India meanwhile.
He also said a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Pakistan was not yet scheduled.
Pakistan ready for dialogue with India: FO spokesperson
Foreign Office spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan noted that Pakistan is ready for composite dialogue with India, reiterating remarks made earlier by FM Dar.
Fielding questions from reporters during a weekly press briefing, the spokesperson said Pakistan is ready for “composite dialogue” with India on all matters, not just the issue of terrorism.
“India says that they would talk on terrorism only; however, we want to talk on all matters, including terrorism,” Khan said. “We have complete and detailed evidence about India’s acts of terrorism against Pakistan, but this would just be one item during the composite dialogue.”
 


Khan added that Islamabad would welcome attempts by other countries, including the United States, to bring Pakistan and India to the table for talks. However, responding to a question, he said there is no meeting in the works between the prime ministers of both countries.
Responding to another question about Indian military buildup, Khan called it an “alarming trend” and a threat to regional stability.
“It becomes more sinister when you look at their declaratory policy, and the domestic developments in India, which are so hostile towards Pakistan, and increasingly Islamophobic,” the spokesperson outlined.
“We have been raising this issue with our partners. The international community turning a blind eye to India’s mad rush to develop their military capabilities is a very dangerous trend.”
However, he assured that Pakistan remains ready and has the capability to respond to any threat or action by India.
Tarar lauds media’s role during conflict with India
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar lauded the media for its role in countering Indian narratives during the military confrontation and praised it for delivering the country’s message to the world in the face of a much larger media apparatus in India.
Addressing a meeting of the Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE) in Islamabad, Tarar labelled that period as “extraordinary circumstances”.
“Right from the beginning, it was a war of narratives,” he highlighted. “The enemy had greater resources, international interest, lobbying and PR firms. International media outlets had employees of Indian origin because of their greater population.”
The minister stated that Pakistan’s strength was not in numbers or resources, but in “having the truth”.
“The truth cannot hide or be countered,” Tarar stated. “While the prime minister asked for an inquiry into the Pahalgam attack at Kakul, India was levelling allegations without evidence.”
Tarar then described a “synergy” between the armed forces and the information ministry during wartime, noting that the ministry’s “state-of-the-art data centre was maybe made for this purpose so that we could fight a war of narratives”.
He thanked the director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations “for this synergy”.
“This war was fought by everyone together, with your help and your content. The way things were written and disseminated was a team effort,” he stated.
 


Tarar said that due to the media’s coverage during the fighting, Pakistan experienced a resurgence on the international stage.
“Across the world, people have greater respect for Pakistan and take us seriously,” he said.
“There was this false glorification of ‘rising India’, how it was this big economy and rising power in South Asia. That same Modi has to give fake medals in countries whose names we have never heard of.
“However much factual information we were spreading, they (India) were spreading as many lies,” he added.
“Their media has been terribly exposed, while our media became part of our diplomatic effort and spokespersons for our foreign policy. They took every step for our defence.”
Stating that the Pakistan Navy was ready for any Indian engagement, the minister quipped that “when the enemy found they could not destroy Karachi port, they destroyed ports in Multan and Lahore instead”.
“An Indian channel said that Indian media is a spokesperson for foreign policy and Pakistani media is adrift. I’d like to say to that person that they should be ashamed of the lies and propaganda and how they are being mocked globally,” Tarar stated.
“The whole country played a role in this effort, as did the CPNE, which will be remembered fondly for its role as a wartime body,” he said, stressing the need to acknowledge the CPNE’s “wartime cabinet” and how the council “played a role in narrative building and defeating the enemy during this war”.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22213846300a1b4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934392/pakistan-fisherfolk-forums-fatima-majeed-appointed-head-of-sindh-fisheries-department' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum’s Fatima Majeed appointed head of Sindh Fisheries Department</strong></a><br><p>Climate activist Fatima Majeed has been appointed as the chairperson of the Sindh Fisheries Department, becoming the first woman from the fishing community to become so, it emerged on Friday.
Majeed is an activist, social worker and senior vice-chairperson of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF).
The PFF, a democratic organisation with over 100,000 memberships across the country, having a minimum 35 per cent women ratio, today is one of the strongest social movements in Pakistan.
It has, over the years, proven itself as a nursery for producing leaders in the fishing and peasant communities of Pakistan.
 
 

Its struggle targets policy issues related to fishing rights, fish marketing and fish conservation, rehabilitation of the Indus Delta, sustainable fisheries policy, abolition of the contract system over inland waters, historical fishing rights on entire water bodies for indigenous fisherfolk, discouraging industrial fishing by deep sea trawlers and marine pollution, and detention of fishermen.
In a post on X today, the Sindh Information Department announced that Majeed was appointed to the role “in line with the inclusive vision of [PPP] Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and the Sindh government’s commitment to women empowerment”.
It added that she was the first woman from a fishing community to lead the vital sector.
“This milestone reflects a strong commitment to community empowerment, inclusive representation, and merit-based leadership within public institutions,” it said.
 






Majeed has participated in protests every year for the past three years against climate change and demanding climate justice.
The World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in March that Pakistan had formally accepted the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.
WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala had said Pakistan’s formal acceptance of the agreement marked a vital step toward ensuring the long-term sustainability of global marine resources, while safeguarding the livelihoods and food security of the millions of people, who depend on healthy fisheries.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2220061990c817e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934294/president-zardari-constitutes-11th-national-finance-commission-to-divvy-up-revenue' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari constitutes 11th National Finance Commission to divvy up revenue</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday constituted the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) to announce a new award for the sharing of federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces.
According to a notification from the Finance Division, the president constituted the commission with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as the chairman and the four provincial finance ministers as its members.
The commission also includes former bureaucrat Nasir Mahmood Khosa as a member representing the Punjab government, economist and researcher Asad Sayeed as a member representing the Sindh government, former bureaucrat Dr Musharraf Rasool Cyan as a member representing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and Farmanullah as a member representing the Balochistan government.
The commission will make recommendations to the president on the distribution between the federation and the provinces of the ““net proceeds of the taxes mentioned in clause (3) of Article 160 of the Constitution”, it read.
The taxes are taxes on income, including corporation tax, but not including taxes on income consisting of remuneration paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund; taxes on the sales and purchases of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured or consumed; export duties on cotton, and such other export duties as may be specified by the president; duties of excise as may be specified by the president and other taxes as may be specified by the president.
The body will also recommend the president regarding the grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provincial governments and the exercise, by the federal government and the provincial governments, of the borrowing powers conferred by the Constitution.
The commission will further make recommendations to the president on issues relating to the sharing of financial expense incurred or to be incurred by the federation in respect of subjects and matters falling within the domain of the provinces; issues relating to the sharing of financial expense incurred or to be incurred by the federation or the provinces or both in respect of trans-provincial matters; issues relating to financial expense for national projects to be shared by the federation and the provinces; and any other matter relating to finance referred to the commission by the president.
For several years, policymakers associated with the finance ministry, as well as political actors across different parties at the centre, have spoken about revising revenue transfers to the provinces to improve the federal government’s financial position.
The 10th NFC expired on July 21. The 7th NFC Award has now been in effect for nearly 15 years — far beyond its five-year tenure. The president has extended the award every year due to a disagreement between the provinces and the Centre over the new formula.
The 18th Amendment provided constitutional protection to the share of the federating units, stipulating that a sub-federation’s share in any future award must not be less than its share in the previous award.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619966-pakistan-ready-for-comprehensive-talks-with-india-says-ishaq-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ready for comprehensive talks with India: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

A glacial burst, or glacial lake outburst flood (Glof), refers to an outburst of water from a glacial lake which could lead to severe flooding downstream, effectively blocking or overwhelming rivers in its path. Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.
A statement from Rescue 1122 said, “200 people have been rescued from flood-affected areas and have been shifted to Ghizer’s Yangal and Samal areas.”
“Several people have been traumatised after [their] houses were destroyed. Medical assistance is being provided to the affected people,” it added.
In another statement issued earlier today, Rescue 1122 said, “A terrible incident of glacier outburst has taken place at Tildas and Rawshan villages in Gupis valley late at night, causing widespread destruction in the downstream.”
“The Ghizer River has been completely blocked for several hours, which has increased the risks for downstream areas with a possibility of high-level flooding in the river,” it added.
The statement said that the rescue personnel had been kept on alert on the orders of the Rescue 1122 director general and the Rescue 1122 District Emergency Officer Engineer Tahir Shah. Rescue 1122 also urged people living near the river to take timely precautionary measures and move to safe places.
GB Secretary Fida Hussain said that no casualties were reported and all the affected people were safe.
“The flood swept away everything in the downstream areas in Talidas and Rawshan villages,” he said, adding that 40 people, who were stranded, had been rescued.
He added that local volunteers were the first to rescue people from the floodwaters, after which Pakistan Army helicopters joined the operation.
“The high temperature caused a burst of the lake, and ultimately high flooding occurred in the Sado nullah on Wednesday night.
“Some shepherds informed the local community about the flood. People in dangerous areas were immediately shifted to other areas,” he said.
According to the locals, 80 per cent of the village has been washed away. A local named Abdul Wahid said, “Some shepherds, who were living near the glacier, had informed people living in the downstream areas through mobile communication about the flood and urged them to evacuate.”
The local administration said that the Ghizer River, after remaining blocked for eight hours, started spilling over the flood debris.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that a rescue operation was initiated to evacuate the stranded people in the areas. He said, “The flow of the Ghizer River has remained blocked for many hours, but it poses a threat to low-lying areas if it bursts.”
Ghulam Muhammad, GB Minister for Law, Parliamentary Affairs and Tourism, said, “The flood, which occurred due to the bursting of the lake, completely destroyed 70 houses, while the river water is standing due to the flood debris, but the level is rising.”
He said that if the flow of the river water is not restored, hundreds of large houses will be submerged in the water. “The process of flooding in the drain due to the bursting of the lake has been ongoing since 10pm.”
Muhammad further said that the river spread three to four kilometres in length due to the standing water.
“Some people are still trapped, for whom an army helicopter has been sent to rescue them. Hopefully, the trapped people will also be rescued,” he added.

GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan issued orders to the GB home secretary and GB Disa­ster Manage­ment Aut­h­ority director general to immediately rescue the people trapped in the flood.
The CM said, “All available resources will be utilised to rescue the precious human lives and help will be sought from the Pakistan Army.”
He also directed the Gilgit and Ghizer police officials and the concerned departments to ensure safety measures in the settlements adjacent to the river.
Meanwhile, Senator Sherry Rehman highlighted that not a single life was lost during the glacial outburst due to the functional early warning system.
“This is living proof of why Pakistan must urgently scale alert systems, local response teams and community training nationwide,” she wrote in a post on X.
 






Special Assistant to CM on Information Eman Shah said that authorities have started initial relief and rescue activities. “Steps are being taken to shift people from Ghizer River downstream areas to safer places in fear of the temporary lake formed in Ghizer bursting,” he said.
Earlier this month, a Glof from the Shishper Glacier tore through Hassanabad Nullah, swee­ping away part of the Karakoram Highway and destroying public and private properties.
A glacier burst in Bagrot Valley caused the death of one person on Aug 1, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619967-president-notifies-formation-of-11th-national-finance-commission-with-nine-members' target='_blank'><strong>President notifies formation of 11th National Finance Commission with nine members</strong></a><br><p>

A massive explosion took place inside a warehouse in a densely populated area near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex on MA Jinnah Road yesterday afternoon, in which 33 people were injured and two were confirmed to have lost their lives.
Rescue 1122 said today that the number of deaths from the incident had risen to six after a fourth body was retrieved. South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG)  Syed Asad Raza said earlier today that two people had died during treatment, while three bodies were recovered from the site.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the deaths occurred because of “multiple crush injuries and suffocation”. She said one died owing to suffocation, and two other deaths occurred from multiple crush injuries, while the autopsy of two other bodies could not be conducted.
Meanwhile, Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the fire was extinguished on Thursday around 5pm, but cooling operations were still underway today. He said the Bomb Disposal Squad has examined the warehouse where fireworks were stored.

DIG Raza said Preedy Police registered a case against the two brothers who owned the facility — one of whom was injured — under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 286 (negligent conduct with respect to explosive substance), 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery), 322 (punishment for manslaughter), 324 (attempted murder), 427 (mischief causing damage) and 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
As per the first information report, the suspects had stored fireworks in “excessive” quantities in a haphazard manner without any precautionary measures, and their negligence and carelessness caused loss of precious human lives and injuries and substantive damages to property.
It added that one suspect was injured in the incident, while another was present during the time of the blast and had managed to escape from the spot in his car.
Sharing findings of experts, Raza said during inspection of the warehouse, nearly 300 cartons weighing 500 kilogrammes of fireworks material were burnt due to some “mishandling”. The building was “badly” damaged, while the blast also caused serious effects spread over 180 metres in the surrounding area.
The DIG said about 5,000kg of fireworks material was still lying in the building’s three godowns in two containers, while other material was also lying outside the building in an open place in “dangerous condition” which required urgent demolition or disposal, as per findings of the BDS team.
“We are removing and disposing of the rest of the explosives with the help of concerned agencies,” he said.

Haseeb had told Dawn.com that the facility was situated in the basement of a three-storey commercial and residential building in Saddar.
“Raw material used for the preparation of firecrackers was stored [in this facility],” Khan said. “During the initial probe, it was suspected that a short circuit triggered a fire in the store, and a huge explosion took place because of the presence of highly inflammable material.”
However, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) senior official Raja Umer Khattab had told reporters that the facility contained explosive material, not raw material for fireworks.
“CTD had seized two tons of explosive material in this area in the recent past,” he said, noting that the raw material in fireworks could also be used in bombs.
The rescue spokesperson added that the building’s pillars and walls were damaged, while thick concrete blocks had fallen on parked vehicles nearby. Windows in nearby buildings were also smashed.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
Earlier this month, a massive blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi that injured eight people and damaged at least three other factories was brought under control after hours of efforts.</p><small>2025-08-22 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619957-top-court-acquits-former-ptb-official-in-nab-case-after-sentence-served' target='_blank'><strong>Top court acquits former PTB official in NAB case after sentence served</strong></a><br><p>

The tournament is designed to showcase talent from regions where ice hockey is a growing sport and “break barriers and unite non-traditional hockey markets in a thrilling display of skill, passion, and camaraderie”, according to the organisers’ website.
A press release from the National Hockey League (NHL), stated that this year’s Latam Cup features 62 women’s, men’s and youth teams and over 1,450 players representing 17 countries and territories. The tournament started on Sunday and will continue through August 24.
The NHL stated that Pakistan’s men’s team went undefeated throughout the tournament and playoffs, defeating Peru 6-1 to win the championship for the first time.
 






The Pakistani Ice Hockey Team wrote in an Instagram post: “Pakistan men’s Division III champions! Undefeated run capped off with gold. What a tournament!”
In their first outing in the Latam Cup last year, Pakistan only won one game.
“I thought we’d be winning several years from now,” said Donny Khan, the NHL’s senior director of hockey development and strategic collaboration. “I didn’t think we’d be doing this in year two.”
The NHL stated that Khan helped form the Pakistani teams that competed.
 






Kameron Sabir, an Edmonton physician who coached the men’s team, was quoted as saying, “You can’t do better than this first gold … first cup.
“It’s just an amazing day for the country and ice hockey. The women did such an amazing job too. Tremendous [performance] for their first tournament. They had only 10-12 players, so hats off to them.”
Mariya Rauf, who coached the women’s team, clutched a cricket bat given to her by her players and smiled while watching the men celebrate their victory against Peru, the NHL said.
“Cricket is our national sport, but I think after this, it just shows [ice] hockey’s growing very single day,” she was quoted as saying. “This shows that there’s talent and that we’re just going to keep getting better.”
Rauf is also a junior forward on Yale University’s National Collegiate Athletics Association Division I women’s ice hockey team.
The NHL noted that most of the countries and territories competing in the tournament aspire to play ice hockey on the world stage, but don’t have skating rinks or suitable ice facilities that meet International Ice Hockey Federation regulations, enabling them to compete in events like the Olympics.
“The hope is that exposure from winning or competing in the tournament will persuade sports federations, Olympic committees or private investors in those countries and territories to support ice hockey, mainly by building rinks,” the NHL stated.</p><small>2025-08-22 14:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2218555908784ad.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934208/how-floods-in-pakistan-turned-wedding-celebrations-into-24-funerals' target='_blank'><strong>How floods in Pakistan turned wedding celebrations into 24 funerals</strong></a><br><p>Two days before his wedding, Noor Muhammad had a long phone call with his mother, just hours before devastating floods in Pakistan killed her along with 23 family members and relatives.
“I cannot explain how happy she was,” he said standing by the rubble of his family’s large 36-room house, perched on the bank of a floodwater channel in Qadir Nagar village.
The village in mountainous Buner district has been the worst hit by recent massive rain in the country, accounting for over 200 deaths out of nearly 400 in floods in the northern areas since August 15.
Buner is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Islamabad.
“Everything was finished,” sobbed Muhammad, 25, as mourners sat at his damaged house to offer condolences, saying there was nothing left when he got home except for rubble and heavy rocks, which swept down from the mountains along with mud and raging flood waters, smashing into houses, markets and buildings.
“The flood came, a huge flood came, it swept away everything, home, mother, sister, brother, my uncle, my grandfather and children.”

Muhammad works as a labourer in Malaysia. He arrived at the Islamabad airport on August 15 to drive home where his wedding preparations were in full swing for two days later. Instead, he attended 24 funerals.
They included his mother, a brother and a sister, he said, adding that his father and another brother survived because they had gone to pick him up at the airport.
The rest of the fatalities were among his uncles’ families who shared the house built by his grandfather, and relatives who are attending his marriage.
His fiance survived. Her home was away from the worst of the damage.
Devastating flash floods
The flash floods triggered by the worst of this year’s monsoon and cloudbursts, which started in the mountainous northern areas have spread to other parts of the country of 240 million, bringing death and destruction at a large scale.
Authorities have said the longer spell of heavy rain and rare cloudbursts were rooted in climate change due to global warming, fearing the intensity will increase in the coming years.
“We and our elders have never seen a storm like this in our lives,” said Muhammad Zeb, 28, a resident in Buner. It was a complete chaos, and massive disaster, he added.
“You can see for yourself, this was a beautiful place with homes. But now, as you can see, the flood and storm have swept everything away.”

An unknown number of people remain missing, with dead bodies still being recovered, officials said.
The overall death toll across the country in the monsoon rains which began in late June stood at 776, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, which said more than 25,000 people had been rescued in the northern areas.
 
 

The army and air force have joined the rescue and relief efforts.
Officials have warned of more storms ahead with another two spells of monsoon rain expected until September 10.
Buner received more than 150 mm (5.91 inches)of rain within an hour triggered by a cloudburst in the single most destructive event in this monsoon season. A cloudburst is a rare phenomenon where more than 100mm (3.9 inches) of rainfall within an hour in a small area.
Only four people of the 28 in his house survived, Muhammad said. “What else can we say? It’s God’s will,” he said.

The PTI, in a post on X, called the incident an “abduction” and lamented that “the rule of law has been replaced with the law of the jungle”.
The move comes a day after PTI announced that men in plainclothes had “abducted” Aleema’s son from her residence. Lahore police later announced that Shahrez had been arrested in connection with a May 9 case.
Aleema addressed the arrest on social media this morning, saying, “(The policemen) brutally assaulted our staff, harassed my daughter-in-law, and forcibly took away my son, Shahrez Khan, in front of his two young daughters.”
She added, “For over three years, this fascist regime in Pakistan has unleashed a reign of terror, raiding thousands of homes, abducting and harassing countless innocent civilians.”
However, she said that it had not broken Imran and that he had set a “remarkable standard of resilience against tyranny”.
 






Speaking on the incident today, Aleema addressed the notion that the move was an attempt to scare the PTI.
“Do we look like we will be scared of such things?” she said.
She added, “In every FIR (first information report), it is written: ‘Aleema Khan comes bringing Imran Khan’s message’. So if we have to bring Imran Khan’s message in every FIR, we will absolutely do that. We will absolutely be his voice and give his complete message.”
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Lahore ATC judge sends Shahrez on 8-day physical remand
Meanwhile, a Lahore anti-terrorism court (ATC) sent Shahrez on an eight-day physical remand. The suspect was presented in the Lahore ATC today before Judge Manzar Ali Gul.
The investigating officer told the judge that Shahrez was arrested in relation to the Jinnah House attack on May 9. He added that the suspect was first named in the case on September 23, 2023, in supplementary statements.
To this, Shahrez’s counsel, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alleged that his client had never been named in the case, branding the arrest an act of “harassment”.
He questioned why he had never been arrested before, despite being in the country for 27 months. The legal counsel called the move a “reaction to the approval of Imran’s bail pleas”.
On Wednesday,  the Supreme Court accepted Imran’s bail petitions in eight cases related to the May 9 riots. The PTI founder has been imprisoned at the Adiala Jail since August 2023 in cases related to the selling of state gifts and a £190 million graft case, while he faces pending trials related to the May 9 riots.
The investigation officer filed an application in the court for a 30-day physical remand for police investigation; however, the court approved only eight days and directed the police to present Shahrez at the next hearing.
Raja, speaking to the media outside the court, said Shahrez was “falsely implicated”. He vowed to fight against the case, saying, “We will go to every court.”
“This is a message to the nation that there is no law in this country,” he said, adding that “cases are being fabricated”.
Questioning the validity of the case, Raja alleged that during the events of May 9, Shahrez was in Chitral.
“This is madness and a well-thought-out conspiracy,” he added. “We have to stand with the founder of PTI and his family.”</p><small>2025-08-22 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/221529326a34e4e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934001/pm-shehbaz-to-call-meeting-on-illegal-constructions-on-rivers-soon' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to call meeting on illegal constructions on rivers soon</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that he will convene a meeting over the illegal constructions on rivers soon, as monsoon rains caused catastrophic floods in northern parts of the country.
Record rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc on different parts of the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond with the death toll at 393.
Speaking during a federal cabinet meeting today, PM Shehbaz said, “I will call a meeting over the illegal constructions on rivers, such as hotels, restaurants and houses.”
 






He highlighted the concerns over such structures, which reflected “catastrophic beauty”, and over the cutting of trees in Galiyat, where plazas and houses have been constructed.
“There is no room for man-made disasters,” he said, adding that the meeting will be called on an all-Pakistan basis to discuss these issues.
The premier discussed the relief and rehabilitation work in the flood-affected areas during the meeting, saying that the federal government has extended “full cooperation” to the provincial governments, Radio Pakistan reported.
PM Shehbaz also commended the efforts of the armed forces in rescue and relief operations. “Pakistan Army reached the distant and difficult areas to rescue the people. For this purpose, helicopters were also used,” he said.
He mentioned his visit to flood-affected areas in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, highlighting the efforts of ministers and secretaries. He said, “This is a collective responsibility.”
“For how long will the provincial and federal governments keep giving compensation for illegal structures?” he questioned.
 
 

The prime minister also condoled the casualties, stating, “over 700 people, including over 400 in KP lost their lives in the recent rains and flash floods,” according to Radio Pakistan.
“He emphasised that the responsibility of climate change ministry has increased to deal with the issue of climate change. He said other relevant departments will also have to play their part in it,” the report added.
The premier mentioned the recent “destructive rains” in Karachi from earlier this week. “I talked to the Sindh chief minister and (PPP Chairman) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to express my sympathies,” he said.
PM Shehbaz on Wednesday visited the flood-affected districts of Swat, Buner and Shangla in KP, as 14 more bodies were recovered from debris in Swabi’s Dalori.
While interacting with flood victims, he assured them of the government and the army’s unwavering commitment to extending maximum support to them “in this critical hour”.
On Monday, the KP government released Rs800 million in relief funds for all affected districts, with an additional Rs500m specifically for worst-hit Buner.
UK govt announces humanitarian aid for monsoon-affected regions
Separately, the United Kingdom announced £1.33 million in humanitarian aid to support Pakistan’s response to the devastating impact of monsoon rains, according to a press release.
“This funding will help more than 223,000 people across seven flood-affected districts in Punjab, GB, and KP,” the press release said.
 






It added that the support would enable “a wide range of emergency and early recovery efforts”, which include “the provision of dry food rations, search and rescue operations, mobile medical camps, rehabilitation of drinking water systems, restoration of irrigation channels, and support for livelihoods and agriculture”.
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott was quoted as saying, “Through UK-funded programmes, vital assistance is reaching communities affected by flooding and landslides.
“Working closely with national and provincial authorities and partners, the UK remains committed to strengthening Pakistan’s disaster response and resilience.”
She said that the UK trained 2.400 community volunteers for search and rescue operations across vulnerable districts, adding that “25 volunteers from Charsadda have joined Rescue 1122’s efforts in Buner, providing crucial help at a time when many people remain missing or trapped under debris”.
Mobile medical camps were being set up in areas where health clinics were damaged, ensuring continued access to essential healthcare, she said.
She was further quoted as saying, “Non-food items, food rations, shelter materials, and dignity kits for women, are being distributed to displaced families.
“Meanwhile, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs district coordinators in Swat and Buner are helping to coordinate the work of humanitarian organisations on the ground, ensuring aid is delivered effectively and efficiently.”

The senior journalist was found dead in his car last week, parked on Hyderabad Road in Sanghar under what police termed “mysterious circumstances”. The body was found in the driving seat, with a gunshot wound to the head.
The day after the incident, police said that they were probing the incident “from all possible angles” and a fact-finding committee had been formed to probe Hussain’s death. This committee, led by Sindh Additional Inspector General of Police (IGP) (Counter-Terrorism Department) Azad Khan, comprised Karachi West Zone Deputy IGP Irfan Baloch and Sanghar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abid Baloch.
The committee reached its conclusion based on a detailed examination of the crime scene, interviews of witnesses, examination of postmortem and forensic reports and analysis of CCTV footage, concluding that the cause of death was suicide.
“It is clear from the firearm forensic report that the lone bullet that caused [the] death of the deceased was fired from his 9mm licensed pistol, recovered from his right hand,” the report read.
The report noted that Hussain’s vehicle was parked outside a restaurant in Sanghar for two hours, according to an “exhaustive” analysis of CCTV footage from the scene. It stated that there was no evidence that he met anyone, nor did anyone approach the vehicle.
“The blackening (soot deposition) around the entry wound mentioned in the first postmortem report of Civil Hospital Sanghar suggests a close-range shot. The re-postmortem carried out at LUH (Liaquat University Hospital), Hyderabad, mentions blackening, charring (burn around wound margin) and muzzle mark (abrasion/imprint of muzzle of weapon on skin) at entry wound.”
The report stated that muzzle marks are produced when the muzzle of a firearm is pressed firmly against the skin at the time of firing.
“The findings exclude homicide or accidental fire as a cause of death,” the report stated. “The committee finds suicide as the only probable cause of death.”
The committee was also of the opinion that Hussain died sometime between 9:58pm and 10:35pm. It also noted that its findings are unlikely to change, despite reports pending from laboratory and gunshot residue tests.
“A number of journalists and acquaintances confided, off the record, about some friendships of the deceased, that were [the] cause of severe rift between him and his spouse,” the report stated, mentioning that the motive behind the incident needed further investigation.
“However, this aspect was not touched upon for the time being, as this would require interviewing and questioning his friends, colleagues and family members, at this time of grief.”
A request was submitted to the Sindh Home Department for the constitution of a medical board comprising senior doctors and forensic experts to perform a “fair, transparent, and impartial postmortem examination”.
Sanghar SSP Baloch said that Hussain’s brother-in-law told police that he did not inform them about his Saturday arrival, although he asked them to hold an annual religious ritual as per the family’s tradition. Hussain had neither told friends in Sanghar about his visit nor did he attend the ritual.
“His sister confirmed that he had celebrated Eidul Azha with her on her insistence, after their parents shifted to the US this May,” he said.</p><small>2025-08-22 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619938-journalist-khawar-hussains-death-declared-suicide-as-investigation-concludes' target='_blank'><strong>Journalist Khawar Hussain's death declared 'suicide' as investigation concludes</strong></a><br><p>

The unidentified assailants struck two units on patrol near the town of Iranshahr, the Fars news agency said, citing local police.
“In this terrorist act, five servants of security and peace were martyred,” it quoted police as saying.
Sistan-Baluchestan, which borders Pakistan and Afghanistan, has long been a flashpoint for clashes between security forces and armed groups, including drug traffickers and separatists.
The province, which is home to a large Sunni Muslim Baloch minority, is one of the poorest regions of the Shia-majority country.
Police said the officers had been on routine patrol when they came under fire. Iranian media published an image of a bullet-riddled police pickup with bodies lying on the ground nearby.
An operation was underway to “track down and identify” the assailants, Fars said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility.
Iran regularly reports deadly ambushes in the province targeting police or Revolutionary Guards.
Authorities blame militant groups, including Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice).
The latest attack comes after authorities said the security forces had killed seven members of another armed group, Ansar al-Furqan, last week as they foiled an attempted attack.
A day earlier, a police officer was killed in an attack later claimed by Jaish al-Adl.</p><small>2025-08-22 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/221423362cbdf58.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933933/commerce-minister-meets-bangladesh-govt-adviser-to-discuss-bilateral-trade-enhancement' target='_blank'><strong>Commerce minister meets Bangladesh govt adviser to discuss bilateral trade enhancement</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s commerce minister and a Bangladeshi government adviser met in Dhaka on Friday to discuss the enhancement of bilateral trade and the strengthening of economic ties between the two countries.
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier fleeing to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
A press release by the Ministry of Commerce said that Pakistan’s Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, who reached Dhaka on August 21 for an official visit, met with Bangladesh’s Adviser for Commerce Sheikh Bashir Uddin.  During the interaction, both sides “held in-depth discussions in Dhaka today to advance economic cooperation, mutual investments and strengthen bilateral trade ties”.
It added that Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Imran Haider, was also present during the meeting.
“The two countries are in the process of establishing a Joint working group on trade to enhance the economic ties and foster greater cooperation in trade,” the statement said.
According to the ministry, both sides agreed to re-activate the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) forum to work out a comprehensive strategy for the promotion of trade, investment and economic collaborations.
The statement pointed out that the last meeting of the JEC was held in 2005.
The two sides also agreed to form a joint trade commission, which would present a roadmap for building on the existing bilateral trade relations, set goals for future commercial ties and define steps to achieve those targets.
“The minister and adviser discussed sectors including agricultural modernisation, renewable energy, steel industry, green ship breaking, ship building, dates, minerals, construction aggregates, halal trade, sugar, leather, rice, dehydrated fruits and agro-processing,” the ministry said.
The two noted the need to improve and economise connectivity and logistics for trade to cut costs. They also discussed the reduction of tariffs and duties and preferential access to certain Bangladeshi products in the Pakistani market.
Both sides underscored that there was a vast untapped potential of bilateral trade and that both countries were “all set to benefit” from such opportunities.
 
 

“The two governments should build on the existing momentum and swiftly move to create a more conducive environment,” the ministry statement concluded.
The commerce minister is currently on a visit to Bangladesh. He was received by Bashir Uddin upon his arrival in Dhaka yesterday.
“Looking forward to engagements with officials and business leaders,” he said on social media.
 






Yesterday, he held discussions with Bangladesh’s Adviser for Industries Adilur Rahman Khan to explore avenues for industrial cooperation between the two countries. He emphasised Pakistan’s interest in being a part of Bangladesh’s evolving industrial landscape through collaboration, joint ventures and mutual investment.
Separately, Bangladesh Army Quarter Master General Lieutenant General Faizur Rahman called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters in Rawalpindi, according to the military’s media wing.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed the prevailing security environment in the region and laid emphasis on shared resolve for enhancing existing cooperation in defence and security domain,” the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a statement.
 






“The Chairman JCSC highlighted the rising trajectory of bilateral relations between both the countries and identified new avenues of defence cooperation,” it added.
It concluded that the visiting dignitary “lauded the professionalism of Pakistan Armed Forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in fight against terrorism”.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) confirmed that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will pay an official visit to Dhaka over the weekend on Bangladesh’s invitation.
The FO said he will hold important meetings with various Bangladeshi leaders, including Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus and Adviser for Foreign Affairs Touhid Hossain.
“The whole range of bilateral relations and a number of regional and international issues will be discussed during these meetings.”

Wickremesinghe, 76, who lost power in a 2024 election, had been investigated over a visit he made to London to attend his wife’s graduation ceremony, local media reported.
Police confirmed his arrest for alleged misuse of public funds.
“Former president Ranil Wickremesinghe has been arrested and produced in court. We are awaiting the court directive to decide what further steps need to be taken,” a police spokesperson said.
Wickremesinghe’s office did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
An ally from his United National Party (UNP) proclaimed his innocence and suggested the case was politically motivated.
“Ranil Wickremesinghe has never misused public funds or state funds,” UNP member Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe told reporters gathered outside the court complex where the former president appeared in Colombo.
“He was the person who stepped up and accepted the challenge to save this country when the economy collapsed,” Warnasinghe said. “That is the person who is being treated like this today by this government.”
Sri Lanka’s cabinet spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Political Family
Wickremesinghe, a lawyer who also served as Sri Lanka’s prime minister a record six times, became president in 2022 at the height of the Indian Ocean island nation’s debilitating financial crisis.
Wickremesinghe, who leads the UNP, took over after widespread protests caused by an economic meltdown forced his predecessor, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, to flee the country and later resign.
He finished third in last year’s presidential election — the first since the economic crisis — behind Marxist-leaning Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who won the vote, and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa.
The election was largely seen as a referendum on Wickremesinghe, who led a successful but fragile economic recovery that included painful austerity measures.
Born into a prominent family of politicians and businessmen with significant media interests, Wickremesinghe was, at 29, appointed the country’s youngest cabinet minister by his uncle, then-President Junius Jayewardene in 1978.
In 1994, following the assassinations of several of his senior colleagues, Wickremesinghe became leader of the UNP.</p><small>2025-08-22 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22172816d2feab0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934115/saleema-imtiaz-set-for-odi-debut-in-pakistan-south-africa-womens-series' target='_blank'><strong>Saleema Imtiaz set for ODI debut in Pakistan-South Africa women’s series</strong></a><br><p>Saleema Imtiaz is set for her umpiring debut in the upcoming women’s ODI series between Pakistan and South Africa in Lahore, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Friday, alongside confirming other match officials for the series.
Last year, Saleema became the first Pakistani female official to join ICC’s International Panel of Development Umpires, enabling her to officiate women’s bilateral international matches and ICC women’s events.
The three-match One-Day International series will be staged at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium from September 16-22.
Saleema, who is part of the ICC International Panel of Umpires will be joined by Australia’s Claire Polosak, who returns to Pakistan after officiating in the Pakistan v West Indies women’s series last year in Karachi, PCB said.
Polosak, also a member of the ICC International Panel of Umpires, will stand in all three ODIs as an on-field umpire.
 






Humairah Farah has been named as the reserve umpire for the series, while Tariq Rasheed from the PCB Elite Panel of Umpires will also perform duty of an on-field umpire during the series.
Former Test cricketer Ali Naqvi, a member of the PCB and ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees, will lead the playing control team, PCB said.

The Chinese foreign minister arrived in Pakistan late Wednesday night to attend the sixth Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue on Thursday morning. He also met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, reaffirming China’s commitment to working with Pakistan to promote regional peace, development, and stability.
Wang said that China was prepared to support its neighbours on issues concerning their core interests and to firmly oppose external interference in the region, per a Chinese foreign ministry handout. He stressed the need to improve the security dialogue mechanism, deepen law enforcement and security cooperation, strengthen the fight against transnational terrorism, and eliminate conditions that promote extremism.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today, Wang and COAS Munir held discussions focused on regional security, counter-terrorism and matters of mutual interest.
“Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen the strategic partnership and enhance coordination at regional and international forums.”
Wang reiterated China’s steadfast support for Pakistan’s sovereignty and development, the statement said, adding that COAS Munir expressed gratitude for China’s consistent support for Pakistan.
The meeting concluded with a shared commitment to advance peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, it said.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership that covers trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. Their militaries have built deep mutual trust and cooperation, and both sides agreed to sustain high-level visits while enhancing collaboration in joint training, exercises and military technology.
On August 1, COAS Munir, while speaking at an event marking the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army of China, stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Islamabad and Beijing will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.
Last month, during COAS Munir’s visit to Beijing, the Chinese leadership had lauded the role of the Pakistan Army and hailed it as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.

The 27-year-old threw a massive 77.43m on his sixth and final attempt to snag a podium finish and smash his previous season’s best of 76.07m set at the Asian Athletics Championships in May.
Sri Lanka’s Pathirage Rumesh Tharanga won gold with an 82.05m throw and became the only athlete to cross the 80m barrier this morning. Behind him was Japan’s Gen Naganuma with 78.60m.
 


Yasir opened his campaign with a no-throw, followed by a solid 75.79m. He the then threw two successive throws in the 72m range before anther no-throw on his fifth attempt.
It was on his final attempt that he struck his medal-winning 77.43m throw.
Yasir said in a social media post that he was “happy for a podium finish” and season’s best throw despite “tough conditions”.
He thanked his supporters and hoped for more medals in the future.

Yasir clinched a silver at last year’s championships with a 78.10m throw, and a bronze in 2023 with a 79.93m throw, which still stands as his personal best.
The javelin ace has yet to shatter the 80m barrier.

Many animal lovers took to the streets to protest against the order. Animal rights activists signed online petitions asking the court to revoke its decision.
The court ruling also drew criticism from politicians and celebrities.
India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi called it a “step back from decades of humane, science-backed policy”.
 






On Friday, the court said that dogs picked up in the past few weeks in Delhi and its suburbs would be released after sterilisation and immunisation, barring those showing aggressive behaviour or signs of rabies infection.
Former federal minister and animal rights activist Maneka Gandhi told ANI news agency that she was happy with the “scientific decision” of relocating dogs back to their area. The court has not clarified what “an aggressive dog” is and this remains a grey area, she added.
In April, the government said nearly 430,000 cases of dog bites were reported nationwide in January, against 3.7 million cases in all of 2024.
India has 52.5m stray dogs, a survey of homeless pets by Mars Petcare has shown, with 8m canines in shelters. Media reports suggest Delhi alone has 1m stray dogs. Reuters could not independently verify the figure.
To curb public feeding of stray dogs, the court also directed the setting-up of designated zones.
A three-judge panel of the court said the scope of the case would be expanded across India and the court would formulate a uniform policy for all stray dogs soon.
“On behalf of the community dogs we serve, we thank the three-judge bench for its decision,” animal rights group PETA India said on Friday, urging people to adopt dogs and support sterilisation efforts.

A senior officer of investigation police said Shahrez Khan, son of Aleema Khan, was wanted in the 2023 violence which erupted following the arrest of Imran Khan.
Rejecting police claim, PTI Secretary-General Salman Akram Raja said Shahrez had nothing to do with politics.
Shahrez’ father Suhail Khan said his son was doing business and now he was preparing to go abroad to participate in a world triathlon championship. Earlier, Salman Raja said plainclothes men attacked the residence of Aleema Khan and abducted her son Shahrez.
“Aleema Bibi’s home in Lahore has been attacked by men in plainclothes and her son Shahrez abducted,” tweeted Mr Raja.
 






He also alleged that the intruders harassed Aleema Khan’s family members and even thrashed staff.
PTI lawyer Rana Mudassar told Dawn.com that Shahrez was “kidnapped” from his home in Lahore.
“People dressed in plainclothes entered the house and took Aleema Khan’s son with them,” he claimed. “No case has been registered against Shahrez, nor is he related to politics.”
Mudassar said no information had been given about Shahrez’s whereabouts and that he would approach the Lahore High Court for his recovery.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram wrote on X: “During an attack, people dressed in plainclothes abducted the son of Aleema Khan from her home.
 






“We strongly condemn this thuggery and oppression. We demand from the current government and the Chief Justice that her son be immediately recovered and safely returned to her,” he added.
At night, Salman Raja reached the residence of Aleema Khan and told media the men in civvies came in tinted glass vehicles and drove away Shahrez Khan without presenting any warrant. Raja said the “powers that be” were busy in victimising Imran Khan and added Shahrez Khan had nothing to do with politics.
Advocate Hassan Niazi, another nephew of Imran Khan, was convicted in a May 9 case in December last.

The limit — which will be recommended for all residents in central Japan’s Toyoake City — will not be binding and there will be no penalties incurred for higher usage, according to the draft ordinance.
The proposal aims “to prevent excessive use of devices causing physical and mental health issues… including sleep problems”, mayor Masafumi Koki said in a statement on Friday.
The draft urges elementary school students to avoid smartphones after 9:00pm, and junior high students and older are advised not to use them after 10:00pm.
The move prompted an online backlash, with many calling the plan unrealistic.
“I understand their intention, but the two-hour limit is impossible,” one user wrote on social media platform X.
“In two hours, I cannot even read a book or watch a movie (on my smartphone),” wrote another.
Others said smartphone use should be a decision for families to make themselves.
The angry response prompted the mayor to clarify that the two-hour limit was not mandatory, emphasising that the guidelines “acknowledge smartphones are useful and indipensable in daily life”.
 
 

The ordinance will be considered next week, and if passed, it will come into effect in October.
In 2020, the western Kagawa region issued a first-of-its kind ordinance calling for children to be limited to an hour a day of gaming during the week, and 90 minutes during school holidays.
It also suggested children aged 12 to 15 should not be allowed to use smartphones later than 9:00pm, with the limit rising to 10:00pm for children between 15 and 18.
Japanese youth spend slightly over five hours on average a day online on weekdays, according to a survey published in March by the Children and Families Agency.</p><small>2025-08-22 06:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a7a7a8dbad3.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933222/adb-to-give-410m-for-barrick-run-reko-diq' target='_blank'><strong>ADB to give $410m for Barrick-run Reko Diq</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank will provide a $410 million financing package to help develop Pakistan’s Reko Diq copper mine, one of the world’s largest untapped deposits, which will be operated by Barrick Gold , two sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Islamabad hopes the project will serve as a springboard to draw more foreign interest to its mineral sector, particularly to exploit rare earth deposits. Pakistan has already attracted interest from the Trump administration and offered future concessions to US companies.
The loans and a financing guarantee will support development of Reko Diq, which is expected to produce copper and gold from 2028 and generate about $70 billion in free cash flow over its lifespan.
The financing is composed of two loans totalling $300m to Barrick and a $110m financing guarantee for the Government of Pakistan, both sources said ahead of the official announcement.
The $6.6bn project in Balochistan is 50pc owned by Barrick with the other half held by the federal and provincial governments.
ADB, the petroleum ministry and Barrick did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The project aims to raise upwards of $2bn and has a previous agreement for $700m in financing from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s private investment arm.
The project’s developers are in talks with other prospective financiers, including the US Export-Import Bank, Export Development Canada and Japans JBIC and expect to sign term sheets this quarter, project director Tim Cribb told Reuters in April.

A PDMA report issued here said that the tally of deaths from last Friday’s catastrophic rains and flash floods had gone up to 393, with Buner, the most affected district, reporting 234 fatalities as well as injury to 128 people.
Also, 42 people were killed and 20 injured in Swabi district, while Shangla district has recorded 36 deaths, Mansehra 25, Bajaur 22 and Swat 20.
 
 

The PDMA report said that the Pakistan Meteorological Department had forecast the start of widespread rains in the province’s central and upper parts from August 22.

Most 234 fatalities reported in Buner district

It said that widespread downpour, along with wind and thunderstorms, were very likely in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Malakand, Buner, Mansehra, Battagram, Torghar, Abbottabad, Haripur, Swabi, Mardan, Nowshera, Charsadda, Peshawar, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, Tank and Dera Ismail Khan from August 22 to 26.
The PDMA warned that heavy to very heavy rainfall could generate flash floods in nullah and streams of Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Abbottabad, Buner, Bajaur, Battagram, Buner, Hangu, Torghar, Haripur, Karak, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Khyber, Kohat, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Peshawar, Shangla, Kurram, Lakki Marwat, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Waziristan and Tank district during the period.
It also issued a warning about flooding in low-lying urban areas of Peshawar, Nowshera, Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts and said that landslides could cause road closures in the vulnerable hilly areas of Abbottabad, Battagram, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Khyber, Kohistan, Kolai-Palas, Kohistan, Kurram, Malakand, Mansehra, Mohmand, Orakzai, Shangla, Swat, Torghar and North Waziristan districts.
In addition, heavy rainfall along with windstorms and lightning could damage weak structures like the roofs and walls of mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
The PDMA asked authorities to take all precautionary measures to avoid or minimise damage to public life and property, cattle and infrastructure.
It urged local administrations to plan provision of additional resources and exercise control over traffic leading to and in vicinity of vulnerable choke points and tourist places and keep people away from structures under construction, advertisement hoardings, electric poles and solar panels.
The PDMA also called for the removal of debris and obstacles from drainage systems to ensure efficient flow of water and minimise the risk of urban flooding, and coordinate with the relevant municipal administrations to ensure mitigation and preparedness measures for landslides and urban flooding.
It also emphasised the removal of billboards and hoardings to prevent damage to public life and property due to wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms.
It asked people to seek shelter in sturdy buildings or underground structures to prevent damage from wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms, or lightning.

• Exposes recurring systemic issues in federal govt finances
• Massive supplementary grants allocated without parliamentary approval
• 87pc of expenditure in FY24 on debt, interest payments
ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has identified a record over Rs375 trillion worth of irregularities, financial mismanagement and loss of public money in the affairs of the federal government and departments and entities working under its control.
The AGP expressed grave concern that only 13 per cent of public funds were directed towards the public good, raising significant questions about the country’s financial affairs.
In its report for the audit year 2024-25, the AGP examined the accounts of the federal government, including ministries, divisions and other government bodies, for FY24. The report said that the “recurrence of these irregularities indicates that systemic issues were cropping up either due to inadequate oversight mechanisms or inappropriate design of internal controls”.
It pointed out unnecessary allocation of supplementary grants leading to blocking of public funds, massive supplementary grants without approval of the parliament, demand for budget without need assessment leading to surrender of budget, lapse of funds due to non-surrendering of funds in time and non-recording of commitments leading to poor budget management.
It said that “a high percentage of expenditure, i.e. 96.26pc, was expended on General Public Service, which includes 86.69pc on repayment of debt and interest payments during 2023-24, which was 91.42pc during 2022-23”.
Therefore, the federal government was left with a meagre 13.31pc of total expenditure for socio-economic functions (other than debt), which is slightly higher than the last year‘s percentage of 8.58pc.
Some of the key audit findings included a massive Rs284.17tr procurement-related issues, Rs85.6tr worth of defective, unexecuted and delayed civil work and Rs2.5tr worth of receivables and recovery-related issues.
There were Rs1.228tr worth of non-settlement of circular debt issues, Rs958bn worth of violation of law and regulations, Rs677.5bn of weak internal control, Rs628bn of poor asset management and Rs281bn worth of poor contract management.
There were Rs165bn worth of audit findings relating to miscellaneous financial issues, Rs73bn worth of value for money and service delivery issues and Rs92bn worth of loss to the state due to non-recovery of government shares and encroachment on public land.
 
 

The report noted that although many government entities had internal audit setups, the financial irregularities observed during the current audit reflect that this function failed to deliver effectively. “The efficient functioning of internal audit would have helped the management in effective implementation of internal controls and strengthening the internal control environment in audited entities,” it observed.
The audit analysis revealed certain deficiencies and shortcomings that were shared with the management and all the stakeholders, which include the Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue (AGPR), Cont­roller General of Accounts (CGA), Ministry of Finance and all principal accounting officers of the relevant ministries and divisions and other entities for corrective measures.
The report revealed that 29pc (Rs513.87bn) of supplementary grants for FY24 had been issued without parliamentary approval, an unauthorised action. Non-surrender of savings under 12 grants led to a lapse of Rs212.08bn, and Rs12.6bn worth of expenditure exceeded the approved grants.
It said that as per the appropriation accounts for the financial year 2023-24, there was a total provision of Rs46.57tr. However, after surrender and supplementary grants, the final allocation was Rs 40.315tr. The actual expenditure was Rs39.945tr, with Rs369.97bn (0.92pc) savings, which was lower than the final allocation.
Overall appropriation figures revealed that the federal government approved supplementary grants of Rs1.765tr, of which Rs513.87bn was not approved by parliament. It said the Ministry of Finance claimed that supplementary grants not approved by parliament during the year would be presented for regularisation at the time of the next budget.
The AGP is required under Articles 169 and 170 of the Constitution to conduct an audit of the accounts of federal and provincial governments and the accounts of any authority or body established by these governments.
The consolidated audit report of the federal government is based on audits of the accounts of 7,879 formations working under entities of the federal government for the financial year 2023-24, and also contains some audit observations for the previous years.
The audit was conducted during 2024-25 on a test check basis to report significant audit findings to the stakeholders. The report includes only the systemic issues and audit findings carrying high monetary value.
Relatively less significant issues shall be pursued with the respective principal accounting officers (PAO) and, if unresolved, have to be brought to the notice of the Public Accounts Committee in the next year‘s audit report.
The AGP claimed that its audit activities had contributed towards adding value to the control mechanism of organisations, which complied with audit recommendations. As a result of the audit, management‘s awareness about internal controls and overall financial discipline has improved compliance with rules and regulations.

KOT ADDU: Villagers carrying their children on their shoulders wade through floodwaters in Ehsan Pur village.—AFP

• Fresh spell of torrential rains forecast across the country
• PDMA issues high-alert warning for Punjab
• Tarbela Dam is at maximum capacity; Mangla Dam is 74pc full
LAHORE / RAWALPINDI: Thousands of families in south Punjab have been displaced as floods caused by overflowing Indus and Chenab rivers have destroyed homes, crops and farmland.
Districts including Layyah, Taunsa Sharif, Kot Addu, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur and Multan are among the worst affected.
In Multan, floodwaters entered several villages, destroying crops and mango orchards. In Kot Adu, residents of Ehsanpur and Hinjrai union councils were forced to evac­uate along with their livestock.
“Houses are surrounded by water, crops have vanished and land is eroding,” a rescue official told Dawn on condition of anonymity, adding that his team had evacuated over 150 people and their cattle by boat.
In Layyah, floodwaters washed away roads connected to the Layyah-Taunsa bridge, breaching the protective bunds. Residents of multiple union councils in Layyah and Taunsa have fled their homes, many now living under the open sky. At Head Taunsa, water flows have reached 500,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs), threatening downstream areas of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur.
 
 

Jampur tehsil has also been devastated, with villages such as Shero Jadu, Jakhar Imam Shah, Lundi Pitafi and Qabool Chowk submerged. Residents said they lost homes and crops without receiving any government assistance. “We have to leave on our own with our cattle,” said Khalil Malik, a resident of Jampur.
In Muzaffargarh, floodwaters breached locally built bunds in Jatoi and Alipur tehsils, forcing residents to evacuate. Entire villages near Khairpur, Basti Laskani and Kehal have been abandoned.
Fresh spell of rains
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast another spell of heavy monsoon rains from Aug 23, warning of torrential downpours, wind and thunderstorms in the upper and central parts of the country until Aug 27, followed by heavy rains in Sindh and eastern and southern Balochistan from Aug 27 to 29.
According to the Met Office, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are expected to penetrate the country’s upper regions from Aug 22, with a westerly wave likely to approach the same night.
Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread rain, wind and thundershower (with scattered heavy falls) are expected in Azad Kashmir (Neelum valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur) and rain, wind and thundershowers (with isolated heavy falls) in Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, Shigar) from Aug 23 to Aug 27 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, widespread rain, wind and thundershower (with scattered heavy falls) are expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank and Dera Ismail Khan from Aug 23 to 26.
Similar weather is expected in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad and Sahiwal from Aug 23 to 27 with occasional gaps.
 
 

Scattered rain, wind and thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) are also likely in D.G. Khan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rajanpur and Rahimyar Khan from Aug 24 to Aug 27.
In Sindh, rain, wind and thundershowers are expected in Mithi, Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpurkhas from the evening or night of Aug 23 to Aug 26 with occasional gaps.
In Balochistan, similar weather is expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibbi, Zhob, Kalat and Khuzdar from Aug 23 (evening or night) to Aug 26.
The PMD has warned of flash floods in streams and nullahs of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northern Punjab, Islamabad, Murree, Galliyat and Kashmir between Aug 23 and 26. Urban flooding is likely in low-lying areas of Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Peshawar, Nowshera and Mardan. Landslides and mudslides are also feared in hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Murree and Kashmir.
The Met Office has urged authorities to remain on high alert and advised citizens, tourists and travellers to avoid unnecessary exposure in vulnerable areas. It warned that strong winds, heavy falls and lightning may damage weak structures, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
PDMA issues high alert
Separately, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a high-alert warning across the province as increased water flows, fuelled by glacial melt and ongoing rains, threaten several districts.
According to the PDMA, medium-level flooding is reported at Taunsa Barrage on the Indus, while Chashma and Kalabagh are experiencing low-level flooding. On the Sutlej River, Ganda Singh Wala and Bed Sulemanki are under low-level flood stage, with the Pulkhu and Basantar streams also affected.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Tarbela Dam has reached 100 per cent capacity and Mangla Dam is 74pc full, raising concerns of further water releases into already swollen rivers.
“Citizens living in riverbeds should immediately relocate to safe areas,” DG Kathia warned, urging people to comply with evacuation orders and avoid recreational activities near rivers. He stressed that bathing in rivers, canals and ponds is strictly prohibited and parents must not allow children near water bodies.
While water flows in the Jhelum, Chenab and Ravi rivers remain normal, the PDMA cautioned that the situation could worsen rapidly. “Protecting lives and property is our paramount responsibility,” DG Kathia said, calling for vigilance and immediate action from communities in at-risk areas.

The exchange of fire took place near Karmazi Stop, as troops were carrying out an operation to take control of a key militant stronghold. Sources said security forces managed to establish two new posts in the area.
Officials said that several militants initially managed to take refuge inside a nearby structure, but later fled during the clearance operation.
The crossfire left 11 residents injured, who were provided first aid before being shifted to the District Headq­uarters Hospital in Wana.
 
 

Witnesses said intermittent firing continued throughout the day, and residents said the area remained tense throughout the operation, with families confined to their homes for several hours. The Wana-Azam Warsak Road remained closed until around 1pm, disrupting routine life and leaving thousands unable to reach Wana Rustam bazaar.

Several militants believed to be among those killed in Bajaur explosion

Security officials confirmed that the road was later cleared.
Separately, several people were killed an explosion in the remote Charmang region of Bajaur’s Nawagai tehsil.
Although the exact cause of the incident is yet to be established, some sources claimed that a number of militants were among those killed. By some accounts, over two dozen individuals were killed in the explosion, which occurred in a mosque located in a hilly area. The remoteness of the region made it difficult to obtain independent confirmation of the incident.
It may be recalled that Operation Sarbakaf is currently underway in Bajaur, and residents have been evacuated from parts of the district as security forces work to root out a militant presence in the area.
There was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations, the military’s media wing, on either incident, until going to press.
