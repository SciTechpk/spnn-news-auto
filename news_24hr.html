It is mysterious, magnificent, mighty, and draws in earthlings who have long dreamed of exploring other worlds. In recent years, these dreams have crossed over from the realm of ambition to the reality of necessity. As billion-dollar companies and superpowers race toward the stars, a Pakistani engineer has crossed the Kármán line with nothing more than a handful of wheat seeds and a vision.
“As we speak, Pakistan-origin wheat seeds are on their way to space,” Mahhad Nayyar told Dawn.com. He and his colleague, Muhammad Haroon, successfully sent the first Pakistani payload to the International Space Station through the Kármán-Jaguar Earth Seeds for Space partnership.
The initiative brought together researchers and space leaders from four countries to explore how native crops respond to microgravity. Pakistan’s contribution, wheat seeds, was spearheaded by Mahhad.
 

Mahhad Nayyar works on the payload at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre before the launch.

The seeds took up one-quarter of the space in the test tube, equal to the Nigerian melon seeds, Armenian pomegranate seeds, and Egyptian cotton seeds. The test tube was aboard the SpaceX Dragon Capsule — mounted on a Falcon 9 rocket — which launched from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida, on August 1.
“I was quite literally living a dream,” Mahhad gleamed. “Watching the rocket fire up and blaze into the sky, leaving behind a trail of smoke … all of it happened just within a few minutes. For me, though, it was the experience of a lifetime.”
But the flight from land to space, one that the 34-year-old had dreamt of for years, was long and riddled with challenges.
How it started
As a young boy, Mahhad was obsessed with the boundless horizon above him. At the time, the only way he knew to explore the skies was through flying, and, in what he describes as “quintessential fashion”, the engineer joined PAF College Sargodha, where he underwent five years of training and subsequently joined the Pakistan Air Force.
“My aim was to become a fighter pilot, but I fell short due to my short-sightedness and was hence sent towards engineering by the PAF,” he recalled to Dawn.com. In 2009, Mahhad enrolled in the aeronautical engineering programme at the PAF College, Risalpur, during which he secured a scholarship at the US Air Force Academy.
This is where his life took a turn. Mahhad went to the States with the intention of studying aeronautical engineering, but came back as an astronautical engineer. “It was here that I found my love for space; when I controlled, monitored and designed satellites.” But he couldn’t explain it to the people around him when he came back home, who thought it was a subject far-fetched, one that “didn’t even have an office here”.
For the next few years, he served as a flight engineer for search and rescue helicopters during the day and volunteered for astronomical societies in the evenings. Meanwhile, Mahhad immersed himself in the world of astrodynamics — his nights were occupied by documentaries such as ‘Cosmos: A Personal Voyage’ and ‘Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey’.
“I fell in love with how vast the space is. I could see all the possibilities of what could be done there,” he reminisced. As years passed by, however, he couldn’t help but wonder how Pakistan was losing out on the vast potential of the cosmos.
His disappointment further grew when, in 2020, Mahhad came across a research paper featuring a world map of countries that had participated in initiatives with the ISS. One conspicuous gap was hard to ignore: Pakistan was the only one of the world’s 10 most populous countries to not have taken part.
 


The image stayed with him, almost as if it were imprinted in his mind. “I realised that in two and a half decades, we were unable to send an experiment into space, let alone an astronaut. This was a matter of shame to me.” He resolved to change this and bring to life the idea that space should be accessible and meaningful for everyone, not just a select few nations or industries.
So when in 2024 he came across the Kármán Project, he knew exactly what he needed to do.
A journey into space
Mahhad applied to become a pioneer for the project, named after the line 100km above the ground from where space begins. By this time, he had retired from the PAF and was pursuing a PhD from Purdue University in the US.
“I got an email from the Kármán Project one day, wherein they were seeking proposals for sending a free-of-cost experiment to space, so I drafted a proposal with the help of my colleague Haroon, who is currently studying botany at the same varsity as mine,” he said.
Their proposal, for sending wheat seeds to space, was among the four that were accepted from across the world. These seeds, once back on Earth, will be examined at length to see the changes they underwent while in space.
 

Mahhad Nayyar poses with colleagues at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre.

“For me, just the fact that a Pakistani experiment is going to space matters the most, and the fact that we are finally on the ISS map,” Mahhad remarked. For him, it is a matter of national pride and a call to future Pakistani scientists, astronauts and aerospace engineers that nothing is beyond their reach, not even space.
The pride Mahhad talks about, he felt it the most when he visited the Kennedy Space Centre last week for the launch, making sure to keep a neatly folded Pakistani flag with him.

But Mahhad kept his excitement at bay because he knew entering the centre could be a lengthy process. It involved a lot of paperwork, and more so in his case, because Pakistan fell under the strictest criteria. A Nasa escort accompanied him throughout the visit. “Once inside, I worked with my Armenian, Nigerian and Egyptian colleagues on the final work required for the payload,” he recalled.
After a day’s delay that triggered Mahhad’s anxiety, the SpaceX Dragon Capsule finally took off from the Kennedy Space Centre’s Space Systems Processing Facility at 11:43am Eastern Time (around 8:43pm in Pakistan) on Friday and docked at the International Space Station just 15 hours after the launch.
There were many thoughts racing in his mind at the time, those of childlike wonder and pure fascination. “A rocket is essentially a controlled explosion and to put human beings on top of that and launch them to another realm of existence is not only thrilling but also leaves you in awe of how far science and technology has come for the betterment of humans.”
The science
As grand and groundbreaking as the project was, at first glance, it may seem too simple. Why wheat seeds? Isn’t that too ordinary for a space mission?
“For us, wheat seeds were a strong candidate because they’re a staple food in Pakistan and other countries,” said Haroon, the collaborator on the payload. Elaborating on the same, Mahhad told Dawn.com that the cultural and dietary significance of wheat made it a powerful symbol of sustenance, resilience and everyday life.
“Scientifically, wheat is also a strong candidate for space agriculture due to its relatively short growth cycle, high nutritional value, and adaptability to controlled environments. As space agencies explore long-duration missions and potential off-world settlements, crops like wheat will be essential to support human life sustainably,” he explained.

But most importantly, the crop serves as a bridge between nations, and while it has been studied in space before, this experiment focuses on a variety native to South Asia, cultivated in different climatic and soil conditions. Hence, both Mahhad and Haroon agreed that this could open the door to valuable comparative insights into genetic resilience and environmental adaptation under extreme conditions.
The scientific objective of the payload is to observe the effects of microgravity on the seeds. “One key focus will be on studying stomatal traits — the microscopic pores on the surface of leaves that regulate gas exchange and water loss. Stomata play a vital role in photosynthesis, respiration, and overall plant-water relations.
“By observing how these traits develop in a microgravity environment, we can better understand how space conditions may affect plant physiology at a structural and functional level. This could reveal critical insights into drought tolerance, water use efficiency, and stress adaptation,” Mahhad said.
Once the seeds come back to Earth, which is expected by the end of the month, they will be germinated under controlled conditions, and their physiological and anatomical traits will be studied.

“We will identify beneficial traits related to drought tolerance concerning stomata so these seeds won’t require extra water and will be good for both space and land. For sure they will have effect from space which will help us understand how this physiology is different from when they were sent to space,” Haroon added.
Moreover, if these traits prove to be beneficial, they could inform future breeding programmes to develop cultivars that require less water and are ideal for regions like Pakistan that are facing water scarcity or extreme climate stress. “The insights from this space-based study may help design crops that are not space-resilient but also more sustainable for vulnerable ecosystems on Earth.”
Beyond the science
But for Mahhad, the true impact of the payload goes far beyond the science behind it. Working with wheat — a staple food for millions across the globe — creates an opportunity for Pakistan and gives it a chance to connect space exploration with daily life in a way that feels intimate and real.
“It will open doors for young Pakistanis to understand, discover and fall in love with space,” he said, expressing the hope that the mission is remembered as a gentle but lasting turning point — a moment when space became a little more accessible, a little more culturally grounded, and a lot more inclusive. This also comes at a time when Pakistan, in collaboration with China, plans to send its first manned space mission to the latter’s space station
Personally, though, for Mahhad, this is just the beginning for him. A PhD student at Purdue University, Mahhad’s research revolves around space situational awareness, and his study has brought him face to face with some hard realisations.
“Emerging space economies such as Pakistan have a maximum of five objects in space; we have been unable to use the space medium adequately. Now this is not just a question of scientific exploration but also that of fundamental human equity. With developed countries now exponentially populating space with their objects, the space for countries like ours is shrinking every day.”
Mahhad wants to change this, for which Pakistan’s strategic geographical location is his biggest asset. “It is one of the best sites for looking into space traffic, and this data can be sold globally,” he said.
The benefits are not just monetary. A person going about their usual day may not even realise but space plays a huge part in their lives — from enabling smooth communication to navigating through traffic (basically Google Maps) and monitoring the climate. The benefits are endless.
“But all of this can only come through with situational awareness of the space environment,” the engineer stressed. He believes that this can only happen when Pakistan starts investing in a space programme, where students in universities, schools and colleges are encouraged to develop, launch and monitor satellites.
And to play his part, the 34-year-old plans to build a virtual mentorship lab to turn his story into a conversation starter, ultimately encouraging more experiments from Pakistan in space.
To prove his point, the engineer quotes his favourite astrophysicist and writer, Neil deGrasse Tyson: “Recognise that the very molecules that make up your body, the atoms that construct the molecules, are traceable to the crucibles that were once the centres of high mass stars that exploded their chemically rich guts into the galaxy, enriching pristine gas clouds with the chemistry of life.
“So that we are all connected to each other biologically, to the earth chemically and to the rest of the universe atomically. That’s kinda cool! That makes me smile and I actually feel quite large at the end of that. It’s not that we are better than the universe, we are part of the universe. We are in the universe and the universe is in us.”

Six other suspects, including a surgeon, managed to escape during a pre-dawn raid, according to the police.
Earlier this month, Airport police had also unearthed a similar illegal operation in which a man was found undergoing a kidney removal procedure.
Police said on Thursday that Sub-Inspector Wasim Sarwar registered an FIR with the Rawat police, stating he and his subordinates heard screaming of an individual from inside a house during an anti-crime patrol at 12 o’clock midnight in Rafi Block, Phase VIII of Bahria Town.
He said an ambulance and other suspicious vehicles were also seen moving outside the house. “When the police reached the house located on the main road at 12:10am, they heard screams from inside,” the SI said.
He stated in the FIR that the police knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, but no one responded from inside. Considering human lives were at stake, they entered the house along with a lady constable and heard noises coming from one of the rooms.
 
 

As the police entered the room, they found a man fastened to a stretcher with pieces of rope. He was on a drip and shouting loudly: “Save me, save me.” Another person standing guard in the room attempted to escape.
The SI added that the police apprehended the man, who after interrogation revealed his name as Zafarullah Khan Cheema, a resident of district Hafizabad. Upon seeing the police, six individuals inside the house jumped over the walls and escaped.
According to the arrested suspect, the names of those who escaped were Imran, resident of Dhamial, Rawalpindi; Dr Manzoor (surgeon), resident of Hazro, Attock; Dr Aamir, of Mansehra; Gul Nawaz (assistant), Attock; Zeb (assistant), Attock, and Rafiq alias Fika.
It transpired later that the person on the stretcher was Hanan Zaid, resident of Sector I, Phase VIII, Bahria Town.
He informed the police that the suspects had called him for a job at the house. When he arrived, they gave him a glass of juice. After drinking the juice, he began feeling unwell and became semi-conscious. He said the suspects then took him to a hospital in the PWD area and conducted medical tests on him before he lost consciousness.
When he regained consciousness, he found himself tied to a stretcher in the same house, and said he was experiencing seizures.
When he asked why he had been tied up, they told him, “You’ve your medical done, and you have a damaged kidney that needs an operation. After that, you will get a job.”
He added that the suspects had forcibly kidnapped and detained him and intended to remove his kidney to sell it.
Zafarullah Cheema, now in police custody, told investigators that various people had been brought to the house, where their kidneys were removed and sold for transplants to both domestic and foreign clients.
Upon searching the rooms inside the house, police seized medical equipment and medicines used in the operation theatre. A case has been registered under relevant sections of the law, and an investigation is underway.

The decision, announced through an official notification by the School Education Department on Wednesday, supersedes the previous directive to resume classes on Aug 14.
According to the notification, all district education authorities (DEAs) have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with the revised schedule. The extension comes amid ongoing extreme weather conditions in the province, though the notification did not explicitly cite a reason for the decision.
This marks the second adjustment to the academic calendar this summer. Parents and students are advised to note the revised date, while school administrations are expected to adjust their academic plans accordingly.
The Punjab government has not yet indicated whether the extended break will affect the overall academic year schedule or examinations.
Punjab School Education minister Rana Sikandar Hayat also tweeted about extension of summer vacations.
“Schools in Punjab will be opened from Sept 1,” he tweeted.

Speaking at a press conference along with Health Department Secretary Mujeeb-ur-Rehman Panizai and spokesman for the Balochistan government Shahid Rind, Mr Kakar affirmed that now the health department will not succumb to blackmail or pressure in the process of implementing structural reforms.
“With the adoption of mid- to long-term reforms and the integration of technology, we can resolve nearly half of our health sector problems,” Mr Kakar said, adding that administrative, financial and recruitment powers are being devolved to district levels, supported by the formation of divisional level committees.
The minister said that five new health-related laws have been passed to support reforms’ implementation and monthly performance review meetings have been initiated, focusing on underperforming districts.
“A centralised command and control centre has been established to directly monitor healthcare facilities in the province,” the health minister said, adding that for years, hospitals across the province have grappled with erratic medicine supplies and uneven deployment of healthcare professionals.
He said that promotions within the health department had been stalled since 2012 largely due to internal resistance, particularly from doctors who were unwilling to serve outside Quetta and this reluctance of doctors had left people living in rural areas critically underserved.
To address this major problem, the minister said, doctors admitted to medical colleges from various districts will now be sent to their home regions to serve the masses there. The government is now also constructing residential quarters and flats in remote areas of the province to improve living conditions and encourage doctors and other medical staff’s stay at their places of postings.

Committee Chairman Senator Syed Masroor Ahsan expressed strong displeasure over the absence of officials from the ministry and the law division concerned, except for the secretary of National Food Security and Research.
The committee observed that ‘such non-professional attitude’ of the ministry on its own legislative business raises severe questions on the ability of the ministry to address problems affecting the people on issues of food security’ especially in the wake of the sugar crisis.
The committee had a two-item agenda for discussion on an ordinance, National Agri-Trade and Food Safety Authority Ordinance, 2025.
The panel had invited the secretary of national food security for a briefing on the countries supporting Pakistan in the field of food, agriculture and research, with complete details including names of countries and international non-governmental organisations.

Pakistan Railways authorities confirmed the explosion, which occurred near the outer signal of the track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country.
“The explosive device was planted near the outer railway signal and detonated shortly after the train passed, causing significant damage to the track but leaving the train unharmed,” a senior official told Dawn.
However, the railway track was badly damaged in the blast.
“A portion of the railway track was blown up in the blast,” railway police officials said, adding that train service has been suspended after the explosion and Quetta-bound trains stopped at Jacobabad station. The repair of the damaged railway line has started.
Following the explosion, security forces rushed to the scene to investigate. Preliminary findings revealed that the explosive device had been remotely detonated.

Through its systematic tracking, Fafen has identified 374 election petitions — 124 challenging the electoral outcomes in the National Assembly (NA) constituencies and 250 in the provincial assemblies’ (PA) constituencies.
So far, approximately two-thirds (62 per cent) of the petitions related to NA constituencies, and half (50 per cent) of those pertaining to PA constituencies, remain undecided.
According to Fafen update, between April 21 and July 31, 2025, election tribunals decided 35 election petitions related to the General Elections 2024 (GE-2024). With these decisions, the total number of resolved petitions reached 171, accounting for 46pc of the overall caseload pending before 23 tribunals across the four provinces.

Election tribunals only decided 35 petitions between April and July, report says

During the reporting period, 28 of the 35 decided petitions were from Punjab, three each from Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and one from Balochistan. In Punjab, the four Lahore-based tribunals decided 15 petitions, the Bahawalpur tribunal decided nine, while the Rawalpindi and Multan tribunals decided two cases each.
In Sindh, the two Karachi tribunals decided three petitions. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Bannu tribunal decided three cases. In Balochistan, a Quetta tribunal decided one petition.
While Punjab tribunals have gained pace in deciding peitions, adjudication process in the remaining three provinces has slowed noticeably since April this year. As many as 12 out of the 23 election tribunals have not decided any petition since April 21, 2025.
Overall, Balochistan’s three tribunals collectively decided 44 out of 52 petitions (85pc) filed for NA and PA constituencies. Punjab’s eight tribunals resolved 94 out of 192 petitions (49pc). Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s six tribunals decided 12 out of 43 petitions (28pc), while Sindh’s five tribunals disposed of 21 of 84 petitions (25pc).
Out of 124 petitions challenging NA constituency results, 47 (38pc) were decided so far. These include 30 from Punjab, nine from Balochistan, five from Sindh, and three from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Regarding PA constituencies, 124 out of 250 petitions (50pc) were decided, including 64 from Punjab, 35 from Balochistan, 16 from Sindh, and nine from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Out of the 171 petitions decided so far, 168 were dismissed, while only three were accepted. Among the 168 dismissals, 81 petitions (48pc) — including 24 related to NA constituencies and 57 to PA constituencies — were dismissed on grounds of non-maintainability. Another 22 petitions (13pc) — three from NA and 19 from PA constituencies — were dismissed after petitioners failed to prove their case during trial proceedings.
Independent candidates, supported by PTI, make the largest group of petitioners with 55pc of the total petitions filed by them, followed by PML-N candidates (13pc), PPPP candidates (8pc), unaffiliated independent candidates (7pc) and JUI-F candidates (7pc). As many as 16 other parties’ candidates cumulatively account for the remaining 12pc of the total petitions.
Around 65pc petitions of independent candidates, 54pc of PPPP, 54pc of PML-N, 40pc of JUI-F, and 38pc of PTI-backed independent candidates were disposed of till date.
The returned candidates belonging to PML-N make the largest group of defendants with 39pc of the petitions challenging their victory, followed by PTI-backed candidates (16pc), MQM-P candidates and PPPP candidates (13pc each), unaffiliated independents (6pc) and JUI-P (5pc). As many as 11 other defendant parties’ candidates cumulatively account for the remaining 8pc petitions.
So far, 84 verdicts of election tribunals have been challenged before the Supreme Court. Among these, three appeals were initiated by returned candidates against whom election petitions have been accepted.

This figure is more than double the 301,000 bales reported by the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA).
Citing data from its Crop Reporting Service (CRS), a spokesperson for the department clarified on Thursday that the 609,000 bales of seed cotton were recorded up to July 31. In contrast, the PCGA’s estimate reflects only the cotton arriving at operational ginning factories in Punjab, irrespective of its origin.
The spokesperson emphasised that the CRS figures are based on internationally recognised, scientifically proven methods. These include randomised sampling, ground truthing techniques, and GPS-enabled tools, all of which are in line with FAO-endorsed methodologies. The CRS also utilises a real-time digital dashboard that ensures transparency and supports evidence-based policy decisions.
 
 

The department further argued that the PCGA figures fail to account for cotton held at the farm level, transferred to other provinces, or stored by stockists. “Persistent under-invoicing in recent years has distorted the accuracy of cotton reporting at ginning factories,” the spokesperson added.

Agriculture Department claims record yield, discrepancies with PCGA data

To clarify the situation, the department reiterated that the official record of national cotton production is based on estimates compiled by all provinces. As such, it suggested that comparisons with the fortnightly data on cotton arriving at ginning factories were not justified.
The department has also requested the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to implement a robust mechanism at all operational ginning factories to ensure real-time, accurate reporting of cotton received and processed.
“This step is essential for enhancing transparency, strengthening data integrity, and supporting coordinated efforts across institutions involved in cotton monitoring and policy formulation,” the spokesperson said.
This year, Punjab has seen significant success in cotton cultivation, with early planting carried out on 781,000 acres, contributing to a total sown area of 3.16 million acres.
Extensive support for the crop has included enhanced field services, active participation from universities, agricultural interns, and the private sector through the cotton campaign.

“We urge the authorities to respect the constitutional protections for freedom of expression and ensure that journalists are not targeted for their work, the notice issued to Akbar Notezai must be withdrawn immediately, and we demand that the FIA refrain from using cybercrime laws to silence journalists,” the PFUJ leaders said.
Karachi Press Club President Fazil Jamili also opposed the move, saying that “this action contributes to a climate of fear and is a misuse of cybercrime laws to silence the press”. He called on the authorities to withdraw the notice immediately.
Earlier, the Balochistan Union of Journalists and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan also decried the move. BUJ President Khalil Ahmed and General Secretary Abdul Ghani Kakar expressed concern that the government, despite all claims, was still using vile tactics to prevent them from performing their professional duties.
The HRCP noted that “such actions contribute to a climate of fear and intimidation for journalists and raise serious concerns about the misuse of cybercrime laws to curb press freedom” and called for the notice to be withdrawn.

WHILE heavy rains in July triggered catastrophic floods in South Asia, the upcoming week is expected to bring more heatwaves.—Reuters/file

• Beijing-based forecaster says high temperatures to persist in Pakistan, many other countries over next week
• Although this July wasn’t as record-breaking as previous ‘hottest’ months; experts say the reprieve is temporary
ISLAMABAD: The World Meteorological Centre (WMC) in Beijing has warned of impending heatwaves expected to sweep across various parts of the world, including Pakistan, from next week.
The warning comes as European forecasters revealed that this past July was the third-hottest on record — breaking a months-long record setting heat streak.
“Two years after the hottest July on record, the recent streak of global temperature records is over,” Carlo Buontempo, director of the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service, said in a statement.
“But that does not mean climate change has stopped,” he said, adding: “We continue to witness the effects of a warming world”.
“We continued to witness the effect of a warming world in events such as extreme heatwaves and catastrophic floods in July,” Buontempo said.
In July, heavy rains flooded Pakistan, India and China; Canada, Scotland and Greece struggled to tame wildfires intensified by persistent drought; and many nations in Asia and Scandinavia recorded new average highs for the month.
Heatwaves to persist
In its forecast, the WMC said that persistent high temperatures exceeding 38°C have been observed over the past week in West Asia, southern Central Asia, western South Europe, North Africa, Pakistan, southeastern India, central and southern Japan, southwestern United States, and northern Mexico.
“Notably, maximum temperatures exceeded 42°C in parts of West Asia, southern Central Asia, most of North Africa, southern Pakistan, and the southwestern United States, with localized areas surpassing 45°C. Maximum temperatures in southwestern Iran and eastern Iraq locally exceeded 50°C,” it said.
The forecast said that persistent influence from a subtropical high will maintain the heatwaves across most of these areas.
“Maximum temperatures in most of these regions will range between 38 and 40°C, with some areas exceeding 42°C. Specifically, localised temperatures could reach above 45°C in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, western and southern Iran, the southwestern United States, western Algeria, and northern Mauritania,” it said.
 
 

Global average temperatures are calculated using billions of satellite and weather readings, both on land and at sea, and the data used by Copernicus extends back to 1940.
Even if July was milder in some places than in previous years, 11 countries experienced their hottest July in at least a half-century, including China, Japan, North Korea, Tajikistan, Bhutan, Brunei and Malaysia,.
Seas overheating
Last month was also the third-hottest July on record for sea surface temperatures.
Locally, however, several ocean records for July were broken: in the Norwegian Sea, in parts of the North Sea, in the North Atlantic west of France and Britain.
The extent of Arctic sea ice was 10 per cent below average, the second lowest for a July in 47 years of satellite observations, virtually tied with the readings of 2012 and 2021.
Diminishing sea ice is a concern not because it adds to sea levels, but because it replaces the snow and ice that reflect almost all the Sun’s energy back into space with deep blue ocean, which absorbs it.
Ninety per cent of the excess heat generated by global warming is absorbed by the oceans.
In Antarctica, sea ice extent is the third lowest on record for this month.

The lander’s ascent and descent systems underwent comprehensive verification at a site in Hebei province that was designed to simulate the moon’s surface. The test surface had special coating to mimic lunar soil reflectivity, as well as being covered with rocks and craters.
“The test involved multiple operational conditions, a lengthy testing period, and high technical complexity, making it a critical milestone in the development of China’s manned lunar exploration program,” China Manned Space (CMS) said in a statement posted on its website on Thursday.
The lunar lander, known as Lanyue, which means “embrace the moon” in Mandarin, will be used to transport astronauts between the lunar orbit and the moon’s surface, as well as serving as a living space, power source, and data center after they land on the moon, CMS added.
China has kept details closely guarded about its programme to achieve a manned landing on the moon, but the disclosure about the test comes at a time when the United States is looking to stave off the rapid advances of China’s space programme.
Nasa plans for its Artemis programme to send astronauts around the moon and back in April 2026, with a subsequent moon landing mission a year later.
 
 

China’s uncrewed missions to the moon in the past five years have allowed the country to become the only nation to retrieve lunar samples from both the near and far side of the moon.
Those missions have drawn interest from the European Space Agency, Nasa-funded universities, and national space agencies from Pakistan to Thailand.
A successful manned landing before 2030 would boost China’s plans to build a “basic model” of the International Lunar Research Station by 2035.
This manned base, led by China and Russia, would include a nuclear reactor on the moon’s surface as a power source.

The attack was triggered by the situation the people of Gaza have faced since the blockade of 2007. Despite their desperation, Israel resorted to a predictably massive and disproportionate response, leading to destruction and misery in Gaza at a scale not witnessed before.
Over 70 per cent of Gaza’s built structures lie flattened by incessant bombardment and ground assaults. Most of the energy, water and sewerage infrastructure has been destroyed. Conservative estimates suggest that over 60,000 individuals have been killed so far, with one of the highest proportions of child deaths — an estimated 17,000 — recorded in any modern urban siege or conflict.
The indiscriminate use of force by the Israel Defence Forces and a complete blockade of humanitarian aid has been abetted, if not encouraged, by the Western powers. Protests by neighbouring Muslim countries have been muted and uncoordinated. President Donald Trump’s high-profile visit to the Middle East in May this year has yielded no solution or ceasefire in any negotiation or communiqué. It has been a glaring omission and missed opportunity, with major ramifications.
When negotiations collapsed in March this year, Israel completely blocked the entry of humanitarian assistance, food, medicine and water to Gaza, leading to one of the worst man-made humanitarian disasters in recent memory. All but one hospital has been destroyed and over 765,000 people displaced since Israel ended the ceasefire on March 18, 2025.
Most of Gaza’s population now lives in abysmal circumstances — in ruined homes and temporary shelters, squeezed within less than 12pc of the Strip’s total area, with major curbs on their movement. Disruptions in basic services, safe water and access to medications have played havoc with lives. The so-called Gaza Humanitarian Fund, set up by Israel and the US to provide assistance, is not only grossly inadequate but also a death trap for desperate people seeking food. Children have paid a disproportionate price over the last 21 months, given their vulnerability and limited resilience.

Gaza has seen the highest proportion of child deaths and injuries in any modern urban conflict.

Although the full picture of the health and nutrition consequences of the Gaza siege and bombardment will emerge only when the rubble is cleared, conservative estimates show that the death count may be significantly higher than reported. The longer-term effects on survivors will be much greater in terms of injuries, suffering and mental health as they will be on health and development outcomes, especially for children. The deliberate targeting and destruction of Gaza’s health services and facilities has also impacted newborn and child survival and led to an exponential increase in childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea, dysentery and acute respiratory infections. However, some of the most damaging and enduring consequences stem from prolonged undernutrition and starvation, through a despicable policy of food blockade, which is akin to genocide.
The crisis has reached an extreme stage. According to the most recent figures from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report (July 29), the situation in Gaza fulfils two of the three requirements for a famine declaration — namely that at least one in three children is acutely malnourished; one in five people suffers from extreme food shortage; and two of every 10,000 people die from starvation or malnutrition and disease, although this level of reporting is impossible in conflict settings without surveys. In Gaza, some 39pc of the population reports not having eaten for days and rates of severe acute malnutrition have quadrupled over the last two months and exceed 15pc in most areas.
The long-term consequences of such mass starvation on vulnerable women and children are massive and well-documented in the literature. The blockade of food to Holland’s population in the winter of 1944-45, at the tail end of World War II, was also known as the ‘Dutch Hunger Winter’. Its consequences continue to be tracked. Babies born to malnourished mothers in that period have been shown to bear scars of a higher burden of illnesses and mental health issues. Indeed, they are at a far higher risk of non-communicable diseases for the rest of their lives. All of these consequences in the Gaza conflict will need long-term follow-up.
As members of the Standing Together for Nutrition Consortium, nutrition scientists across the globe published a comment in The Lancet last month, demanding action for stopping the use of mass starvation as a weapon of war. They have rightly pointed out that undernutrition is not only a consequence of war, it is also the seed for future conflicts. If an entire generation is allowed to grow up hungry, traumatised and without hope, we all are complicit in setting the stage for further suffering.
History will judge the global community harshly for failing Gaza and its people, and permitting this mass violation of humanitarian principles. The use of mass starvation of besieged populations, especially women and children, as a weapon of war is strictly prohibited under international law. But Gaza is not the only recent example where this has happened. We witnessed similar atrocities in the Syrian conflict, and millions of women and children in Sudan today face comparable brutality, in this instance at the hands of fellow Muslims.
We call upon all leaders of the OIC representing 48 Muslim-majority countries to further press for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and hold a specific emergency session. Apart from calls for an independent Palestinian state, discussions should focus on measures to completely ban the use of food blockades and mass starvation as weapons of war, collective enforcement measures in case of non-compliance, and allocation of appropriate resources for the desperate people of Gaza once the conflict is over. Many eyes are now focused on the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York this September. If a call is given for an immediate ceasefire and comprehensive humanitarian action in Gaza, it could become a turning point.

“Now that the nuclear arsenal being ‘created’ by Iran has been totally OBLITERATED, it is very important to me that all Middle Eastern Countries join the Abraham Accords,” Trump wrote in a social media post.
As part of the Abraham Accords, signed during Trump’s first term in office, four Muslim-majority countries agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel after US mediation. Efforts to expand the accords have been complicated by a soaring death toll and starvation in Gaza.
 
 

The war in Gaza, where local authorities say more than 60,000 people have died, has provoked global anger. Canada, France and the United Kingdom have announced plans in recent days to recognise an independent Palestinian state.
Trump’s administration is actively discussing with Azerbaijan the possibility of bringing that nation and some Central Asian allies into the Abraham Accords, hoping to deepen their existing ties with Israel, according to five sources with knowledge of the matter.
During his first term in 2020, Trump secured a series of deals, known as the Abraham Accords, to establish official diplomatic ties between Israel and several Arab states, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco.

The auction of three remaining properties, owned by controversial real estate tycoon Malik Riaz, was shelved due to a “lack of qualifying bids”.
Although mediapersons were invited to cover the auction, they were not allowed to witness proceedings, which were held behind closed doors at NAB’s regional headquarters for Rawalpindi/Islamabad.
Following the auction, journalists seated in a separate committee room were handed a paper carrying brief details of its outcome.
Dozens of private vehicles were seen parked outside the NAB headquarters, ostensibly belonging to the bidders.
According to NAB’s advertisement, six properties were scheduled to be auctioned. However, only three were sold: Rubaish Marquee fetched Rs508 million, while the bureau received conditional offers of Rs876m and Rs881.5m for two of the property developer’s corporate offices.
NAB claimed that Rubaish Marquee was auctioned at Rs20m above its reserved price of Rs488m, while the other two properties were sold at the reserved prices set by the bureau.
 
 

A source in NAB told Dawn that the conditional offers for the two corporate offices were submitted as the bidders wanted to change the purpose of these premises in order to carry out other businesses at these venues.
The remaining three properties — Arena Cinema (reserve price Rs1.1bn), Bahria Town International Academy (Rs1.07bn), and Safari Club (Rs1.2bn), all located in Bahria Town, Rawalpindi — will be auctioned later.
No date has been announced yet for the next auction.
NAB documents stated that the properties were auctioned due to a default of a plea bargain amount in a reference filed against Zain Malik, Malik Riaz’s son-in-law and one of the owners of Bahria Town housing schemes.
Malik Riaz is currently abroad and is reportedly avoiding arrest in other references filed against him, including the high-profile £190m Al-Qadir Trust case and the Bahria Town Karachi case.
The auction followed the Islamabad High Court’s dismissal on Tuesday of petitions filed against the sale of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad, thus allowing NAB to proceed with the auction scheduled for August 7.
Following the IHC go-ahead, Bahria Town approached the Supreme Court in a bid to restrain NAB from holding the auction.

The development came after a high-level meeting in Karachi where Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and MWM leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri addressed the media, confirming a seven-point agree­­ment.
The minister confirmed that the government would facilitate the extension of pilgrims’ visas for up to 60 days in coordination with the Iraqi government. He also assured the pilgrims that special discounted flights would be arranged for them.
 
 

The government will also ensure the refund of payments made to buses, transport companies and tour operators for land travel. Mr Chaudhry also emphasised that the Taftan-Rimdan border, a crucial route for pilgrims, would remain open, although the government has advised against land travel this year.
Allama Nasir pointed out that the travel restrictions caused immense difficulties for pilgrims. “But today, after successful talks and assurances from the government, we are end­ing our march,” he added.

• Met Office warns of more heavy rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir
GILGIT: A glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) from Shisper Glacier swelled the Hassanabad Nullah in Hunza, damaging infrastructure, and putting dozens of mountainside homes at risk in the mountainous region of Gilgit-Baltistan.
Officials said the heavy flood eroded the protective walls of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) and damaged farmland. Due to land erosion caused by the nullah, dozens of houses are at risk in case of such events in the future.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Manage­ment Authority (GBDMA), the flood damaged the newly constructed retaining wall and a portion of the Kara­koram Highway. Though the highway is open to all types of traffic, the damaged section has been sealed off for safety measures.
 
 

The authority said a significant area of cultivable land, along with standing crops and trees, had been wiped out in the flood, while the electricity supply to Hassanabad was also disrupted. Similarly, a property owned by the Forest Dep­artment had suffered damage while a portion of Frontier Works Orga­ni­sa­tion’s land adjacent to a bri­dge also sustained damage.
Locals said that four houses downstream were dismantled in time to save them from the flood. Last month, a similar Glof event damaged four houses, agricultural land, trees, and public and private properties.
The authority requested the National Highway Authority (NHA) to urgently visit the site to assess the damaged section and inspect other vulnerable parts of the road. Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committee members, GBDMA staff, and other volunteers were actively monitoring the situation on the site and supporting community preparedness and response efforts.
On the other hand, the Gilgit-Shandur Road remained closed off for the seventh day in Khotom village of the Phander valley, stranding thousands of people in the area.
Met Office alert
On the other hand, the Pakistan Meteorological Department on Thursday afternoon issued a warning for heavy rain across Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and advised citizens to stay alert, Dawn.com reported.

• Asad Qaiser demands transparent trial of Imran; Marwat seeks inquiry into ‘attack on parliament’
• Commerce ministry says $1 billion saved after US tariff reduced from 29 to 19pc
ISLAMABAD: As the PTI vigorously opposed any potential military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa following a spike in terror incidents, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Thursday said action against militants under the National Action Plan would continue, despite their objections.
The minister was responding to PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser in the lower house of parliament as the latter vowed to oppose any offensive in the PTI-ruled province to eradicate militancy.
Mr Qaiser warned against such attempts, saying they would put up resistance against such plans. His statement is consistent with PTI founder Imran Khan’s stance, who had asked the KP government to oppose such measures, as well as that of the tribal people who have expressed apprehensions against new military offensives.
In response, the minister ruled out a new operation but said measures under NAP would continue, adding that nobody can stop such measures.
Mr Chaudhry also urged the provincial authorities to fulfil their responsibilities to tackle the menace, saying Khyber Pakhtunkhwa received Rs700 billion under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award for counter-terrorism measures.
He, however, rued that the province had done nothing to improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies.
“I know why you are disturbed,” he said while addressing Mr Qaiser. Chiding the PTI leadership for alleged resettlement of the TTP terrorists in Pakistan, he asked if they were with the militants or the state.
It may be noted that after initial action, a potential military operation had been postponed in Bajaur following successful talks between the Bajaur Aman Jirga and the banned TTP.
 
 

About the claims of Imran Khan being the most popular leader, he said popularity did not prove innocence, adding that monuments honouring martyrs had been desecrated during the May 9 violence in 2023.
Crackdown on PTI
Earlier, PTI leader Asad Qaiser also demanded a transparent and independent trial of Imran Khan. “We are referring to an ‘independent trial’ of cases against Imran Khan when we talk about his release”, he clarified.
He said that the PTI leadership had been struggling for the country’s sovereignty and fighting for the supremacy of the Constitution and law. He recalled that the PTI parliamentarians were whisked away from the Parliament House by unidentified men and now they were being disqualified on the pretext of the May 9 violence.
 






The opposition leader said the National Assembly had been turned into a rubber stamp, adding that he would ask his party members to boycott the proceedings of the house for being “unlawful”. He regretted that the gates of the house were closed for the PTI parliamentarians and a BPS-18 or BPS-19 officer humiliated them.
Disgruntled PTI member Sher Afzal Marwat questioned whether the PML-N and the PPP had signed the Charter of Democracy to misbehave with the leaders and parliamentarians of other political parties.
 






“Such an attitude is creating hatred in the political culture,” he said, adding that he would always remember the personnel of agencies and police standing outside the assembly. “I shall never tolerate these people outside the Assembly if I am given the authority of the speaker even for a day,” he remarked.
He demanded the constitution of a committee of the house for an inquiry into what he termed an “attack on Parliament House”. Mr Marwat was among several PTI lawmakers who had been picked up from the premises of parliament in a late-night raid in September last year.
US tariff
Earlier, during Question Hour, the house was told that the recent trade deal signed with the United States would boost Pakistan’s exports and positively impact the economy.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the 19pc tariff rate offered to Pakistan was the lowest in the South Asian region.
Separately, the commerce ministry, in a written response, informed the house that the change in the US tariff from 29pc to 19pc saved Pakistan at least $1 billion.
“…instead of one billion dollars loss, Pakistan’s exports have the potential to increase share in the US market especially in textiles. The new tariff rates on Pakistan and other comparative economies will be instrumental in enhancing Pakistani goods penetration in the highly competitive US market,” the response attributed to Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan said.
 






Lifesaving drugs
Responding to a calling attention notice, Parliamentary Secretary for National Health Services Nelson Azeem said that there was no shortage of lifesaving medicines, including insulin and cancer drugs. He admitted there was a shortage in May during tensions with India.
PPP’s Sharmila Farooqui, who raised the matter, however, noted that the parliamentary secretary was unaware of ground realities and insisted that there was an intermittent shortage in both urban and rural areas.
 






She regretted that about 100 key positions in the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan were vacant, affecting the performance of the authority responsible for controlling the prices and ensuring the availability of drugs.
She said, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the prices of these lifesaving drugs had been increasing by 17.5 per cent every year. According to the June price index, the prices went up by 13 and 15 per cent in urban and rural areas, respectively, she added.

Mardan police spokesperson Muhammad Faheem Khan said the force had taken prompt action and launched a search operation to arrest the suspects.
“The suspects stripped the boy, beat him with sticks, and filmed the assault before making the video go viral on social media,” Faheem said.
Quoting District Police Officer Zahoor Babar Afridi, the spokesperson said he reacted strongly to the incident and said that “no powerful person can target the weak or poor class, the law is equal for everyone.”
He said the district police took immediate notice of the incident and directed the Hoti police to take strict action against the culprits.
According to Faheem, Hoti police Station House Officer Riaz Khan ordered immediate action and registered a case against two residents of Gali Bagh, Misri Abad Road.
A first information report (FIR) was registered at Hoti Police Station on Wednesday at the complaint of the victim under Sections 292 (sale, etc of obscene books, etc), 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person, otherwise than on grave provocation), 376 (rape) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation; if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as Sections 37 (punishment for violence) and 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act, 2010.
According to the complainant, the video was recorded one year ago.
Police added that special teams have been formed to arrest the suspects.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objectives of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” said Sahil.
Earlier this week, police in Mardan arrested four individuals in a case involving a viral video wherein the suspects were involved in the harassment of a teenage girl.

Since taking office for his second term, Trump’s administration has attempted to dismantle affirmative action policies at universities, launching dozens of investigations and threatening to cut off funding to schools that promote diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
Trump has particularly taken aim at Harvard University since he took office, calling the institution a “joke” that teaches “hate and stupidity” and going as far as to freeze their government funding.
In May, Trump’s administration revoked Harvard’s right to enrol foreign students — more than a quarter of its annual enrollment.
Though the move was blocked by a judge, the US president stood by his decision.
“Why isn’t Harvard saying that almost 31 [per cent] of their students are from foreign lands, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay nothing toward their student’s education, nor do they ever intend to,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
“We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming.”</p><small>2025-08-07 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07215759abca975.jpg?r=220658' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929346/cricketer-haider-ali-suspended-by-pcb-amid-uk-police-investigation' target='_blank'><strong>Cricketer Haider Ali suspended by PCB amid UK police investigation</strong></a><br><p>Cricketer Haider Ali was provisionally suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday due to his involvement in an investigation being carried out by police in the UK, according to a statement.
The PCB announced last month that Saud Shakeel would lead an 18-member Pakistan Shaheens squad to tour England from July 17 to August 6 for two three-day and three 50-over matches. Ali was a part of the squad.
According to the statement, the PCB was informed about the investigation by the Greater Manchester Police regarding an incident that reportedly took place during the tour.
The nature of the incident was not immediately clear, nor were any details provided in the statement itself.
“In line with its duty of care and responsibility to ensure the welfare and legal rights of all its players, the PCB has ensured that Haider Ali has received appropriate legal support to protect his rights throughout this process,” the PCB stated.
The statement added that the cricket board acknowledged British legal processes and the importance of allowing an investigation to run its course.
“Accordingly, the PCB has decided to place Haider Ali under provisional suspension, effective immediately, pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation,” the statement read.
“Once the legal proceedings are concluded and all facts have been duly established, the PCB reserves the right to take appropriate action under its Code of Conduct, if necessary.”
The statement added that the PCB would not issue any further comment on the matter until it reaches its “legal conclusion”.

The nuclear-armed rivals exchanged artillery, drone and air strikes in May, after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for a deadly attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. The four-day confrontation came to an end when US President Donald Trump announced a surprise ceasefire.
In a post on X, Netanyahu announced that he met the Indian ambassador to Israel, JP Singh, in Jerusalem today, where the pair “discussed strengthening and expanding cooperation between Israel and India, particularly in the fields of security and economics”.
“Afterward, I held a meeting with a group of senior journalists from India and answered their questions,” the Israeli leader wrote.
 






According to Indian television channel NDTV, Netanyahu confirmed the use of Israeli weapons during India’s military operations in May, including the deployment of HARPY drones and the Barak-8 missile, which is jointly developed with India.
“The things we provided before worked very well on the field… we develop our weapons in the field and they are battle-tested,” the Israeli PM was quoted as saying by NDTV. “They worked fine and we have a pretty solid foundation.”
The channel added that Israel was one of several countries that supported Operation Sindoor. Kobbi Shoshani, the Consul General in Mumbai, said it was “essential” to send a strong message to the terrorists.
“That (Operation Sindoor) was an action of self-defence, and I’m very proud of this operation,” Shoshani was quoted as saying.
According to Indian channel News18, New Delhi deployed the HARPY and SkyStriker loitering munitions “to great effect” during Operation Sindoor, reportedly targeting Pakistani air defence and surveillance systems.
 
 

Over the last decade, India has imported military hardware worth $2.9 billion from Israel, including radars, surveillance and combat drones, and missiles.
In 2019, India struck what it claimed was a “terrorist training camp” in Balakot with Israeli-made Rafael SPICE “smart bombs”, though local residents in the area claimed nobody had been injured or killed.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/07193001f551411.jpg?r=193018' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929339/pm-shehbaz-calls-for-national-policy-to-address-rapid-population-growth' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz calls for national policy to address rapid population growth</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for an immediate national policy to address Pakistan’s rapid population growth rate on Thursday.
Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to World Bank figures. In 2023, the population growth rate was reported to have reached around 2.55 per cent. However, almost forty-five per cent of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line, according to a World Bank report.
The prime minister termed the high population growth rate an “alarming trend” and said that immediate and coordinated policy action was required at a national level to address the issue. The World Bank reported Pakistan’s annual growth rate for 2024 as 1.5pc.
The statement came during a high-level meeting chaired by the premier at his office to review the challenges posed by Pakistan’s rising population and deliberate on effective strategies to manage it, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.
The meeting was also attended by Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Federal Minister for Education Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf and Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar, along with senior officials from institutions.
“We need comprehensive planning to ensure our growing population, especially the youth, becomes a productive part of the economy,” PM Shehbaz stressed.
 






“A large segment of our population comprises young people, who are the most valuable asset for our country.”
He emphasised that the government was taking several initiatives to empower the youth and integrate them into the country’s economic mainstream.
“Opportunities are being created to enable our youth to play a central role in national development,” he added.
 
 

Speaking on gender inclusion, Shehbaz underlined the critical importance of women’s participation in the workforce.
“Women constitute a significant portion of our human capital. We must ensure greater employment opportunities for them,” he said.
The premier instructed the formation of a committee to develop a comprehensive and effective national policy, in close collaboration with provincial governments.
“A unified and strategic response is the need of the hour,” he said, calling for a coordinated federal-provincial framework to tackle population-related issues.
He also stressed the importance of launching a nationwide awareness campaign to educate citizens about the implications of unchecked population growth, especially in the context of sustainable economic development.
During the meeting, the premier was briefed on various proposals and recommendations to manage population growth. Officials stressed that any long-term solution would require active provincial collaboration and public engagement at the grassroots level.
Last month, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal said that population growth in Pakistan has reached an alarming level. He highlighted the wide-ranging consequences of the demographic challenge, including over 25m children currently being out of school and overcrowding at government hospitals.
In June, parliamentarians unanimously approved a resolution on population stabilisation and vowed to table it in the National Assembly.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071858447c0fea5.jpg?r=190211' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929293/indias-modi-unwilling-to-compromise-on-agriculture-as-us-tariff-war-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Modi unwilling to compromise on agriculture as US tariff war escalates</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Thursday he would not compromise on the agriculture sector, a day after United States President Donald Trump announced 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods.
Washington announced the hike in levies on Wednesday, citing New Delhi’s purchasing of Russian oil, a key revenue source for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
For New Delhi, one of the main sticking points in trade negotiations has been Washington’s demand to access India’s vast agricultural and dairy market.
India has remained steadfast about its labour-intensive agricultural sector, unwilling to risk angering farmers, a powerful voting bloc.
“We will not compromise with the interests of our farmers, our dairy sector, our fishermen,” Modi said during a speech at a conference in New Delhi, his remarks widely seen as his first public response to the tariffs.
“I know I will have to pay a personal price for this, but I am ready for it,” he added, without giving further details.
India has also refused to allow the import of genetically modified products.
 


Additionally, New Delhi fears that allowing the import of dairy products may upset the cultural and religious sensitivities of India’s majority Hindus, who revere cows as sacred.
It seems a far cry from India’s early hopes for special tariff treatment.
In February, Trump said that he found a “special bond” with Modi when he visited Washington — complimenting Modi as being a “much tougher negotiator” than he was.
Successive US administrations have seen India — the world’s most populous nation and fifth-largest economy — as a key partner, with like-minded interests in the face of powerful China.
India and neighbouring China have long been intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia.
Modi, meanwhile, according to Indian media but not confirmed by officials, may visit China in late August, which would be his first visit since 2018.
Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping last met in Russia in October 2024.
Indian exporters warned that additional US tariffs risked making businesses “not viable”.
Stocks opened marginally lower on Thursday, with the benchmark Nifty index down 0.31 per cent after an initial 25pc US tariff came into effect.
India is the second-largest buyer of Russian oil, saving itself billions of dollars on discounted crude.
India’s foreign ministry condemned Trump’s announcement of further tariffs, calling the move “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
 






S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO), said he feared a troubling impact.
“This move is a severe setback for Indian exports, with nearly 55pc of our shipments to the US market directly affected,” he said in a statement.
“The 50pc reciprocal tariff effectively imposes a cost burden, placing our exporters at a 30–35pc competitive disadvantage compared to peers from countries with lesser reciprocal tariff.”
Ralhan said “many export orders have already been put on hold” as buyers reassess sourcing decisions.
For “a large number” of small to medium-sized enterprises, profit “margins are already thin”, he said.
“Absorbing this sudden cost escalation is simply not viable,” he added.
India is bracing for a bumpy ride, as the US is its largest trading partner, with New Delhi shipping goods worth $87.4 billion in 2024.
 
 

“If the extra 25pc tariff that President Trump has announced on imports from India remains in place, India’s attractiveness as an emerging manufacturing hub will be hugely undermined,” Shilan Shah of Capital Economics said in a note.
US spending drives around 2.5pc of India’s GDP, Shah said.
But a 50pc tariff is “large enough to have a material impact”, he added, with the resulting drop in exports meaning the economy would grow by closer to 6pc this year and next, down from the 7pc they currently forecast.</p><small>2025-08-07 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/071732092cce89d.png?r=180339' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929333/nepra-slashes-uniform-tariff-by-rs189-for-aug-oct' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra slashes uniform tariff by Rs1.89 for Aug-Oct</strong></a><br><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a decrease of Rs1.89 in the uniform tariff for the next three months.
A notification dated August 7 and available with Dawn.com said that the authority “decided to allow the application of instant quarterly adjustments on the consumers of K-Electric as well, with the same applicability period.
“Accordingly, the instant quarterly adjustment of negative Rs1.8881/kWh (per kilowatt hour) shall also be charged from the consumers of K-Electric except life line and prepaid consumers, to be recovered in a period of three months [from] August 2025 to October 2025.”
Nepra stated that this discount will be applied to bills for the applicable period issued before the notification, adding that distribution companies (Discos) will comply with court orders.
Meanwhile, Nepra also notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs0.78 per unit for consumers of all ex-Wapda distribution companies (XWDiscos) except for K-Electric (KE) in their bills for August.
According to a separate Nepra notification — also dated August 7 and available with Dawn.com — the authority decided on an FCA of Rs0.78 for the month of June 2025 based on variations in fuel charges in the approved tariffs of XWDiscos.
Nepra decided that the FCA “shall be applicable to all consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”, the notification read.
The notification stated that XWDiscos would reflect the June FCA in the billing month of August 2025, which would be shown separately on consumers’ bills based on the units billed to them in June.
“In case any bills of August 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in [the] subsequent month,” Nepra added.
“While effecting the Fuel Charges Adjustment, the concerned XWDiscos shall keep in view and strictly comply with the orders of the courts, notwithstanding this order.”
In another notification from today, Nepra replied to a request from the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) seeking a monthly FCA for June, finding that based on the information provided, the actual pool fuel cost was Rs.7.68 per kilowatt hour (kWh) against the reference fuel cost component of Rs.8.3341 per kWh
“The actual fuel charges, as claimed by CPРА, for the June 2025 decreased by Rs.0.65 per kWh as compared to the reference fuel charges,” the notification read.
Today’s notifications come in the wake of a Nepra hearing discussing complaints of overbilling and requests for a negative FCA.
The regulator had called the public hearing on the request of XWDiscos seeking a negative quarterly adjustment of Rs1.80 per unit to refund about Rs53.4 billion to consumers from August to October. The refund stems from savings in capacity payments during the fourth quarter (April-June) of FY2025.</p><small>2025-08-07 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617761-pm-seeks-national-policy-to-address-challenges-posed-by-rising-population' target='_blank'><strong>PM seeks national policy to address challenges posed by rising population</strong></a><br><p>

With the bill’s approval, Pakistan would become the third South Asian country, after Bangladesh and India, to have a land port authority. The Bangladesh Land Port Authority was created in 2002, while India did so in March 2012.
“The House discussed and passed the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill, 2025,” the NA’s official X account said. The bill was moved by Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on behalf of Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.
Once approved by the Senate and signed by President Asif Ali Zardari, the bill will establish the Pakistan Land Port Authority, which would function as a statutory body responsible for inter-agency coordination to facilitate the movement of goods and people across border crossing points.
As MNA Ali Zahid, who was chairing the session, ordered the clause-by-clause reading of the bill, PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar noted that his party had reservations on some clauses.
 






“The legislative committee of the party went through the bill and suggested a whole number of amendments in the bill to make it a better authority,” Qamar, chairman of the NA’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, said.
“[…] We have accepted the bill after going through a lot of deliberations and negotiations with the committee,” Qamar noted.
On the invitation of Zahid, Qamar read out amendments to at least 12 clauses of the legislation, each of which Chaudhry said he had no objection to. They were individually moved before the House and voted in favour of, and subsequently, the bill was passed as well.
The Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill
The PPP government made the first attempt to establish a land port authority in 2012 under the ambit of the commerce ministry, while the PTI government made the second attempt in 2021.
The PML-N government had also discussed the matter during its previous tenure in 2016, with various models of upgraded border posts for covered cargo at Jamrud, Taftan and Sost mulled.
In December 2024, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the bill on behalf of Naqvi, but at the time, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah had not referred it to the relevant committee.
 
 

The proposed legislation will provide a framework for the declaration, regulation, security and oversight of all land ports for promoting trade, fostering free competition, implementing border control and protecting the country’s strategic interests.
The port authority will establish a robust mechanism to carry out effective coordination with border agencies for trade facilitation in pursuance of commitments under international agreements and conventions for improved land port efficiency and regional port competitiveness.
The bill also proposes the establishment of a 16-member governing council for supervising the authority.
Currently, there is no single agency for the coordinated functioning of various government authorities and service providers at international border points. This lack of coordination sometimes causes a delay in the flow of goods and passengers.
High-tech equipment is also needed to be installed at land ports to check illegal immigration and smuggling of goods.</p><small>2025-08-07 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617757-jirga-head-confesses-to-killing-woman-himself-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Jirga head confesses to killing woman himself in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>
