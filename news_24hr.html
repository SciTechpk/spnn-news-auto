Late on Wednesday night, a Pakistani delegation led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in Washington, DC, finalised a trade agreement with the US, expected to lower tariffs, although no figure was announced. Trump also said Washington would help Islamabad develop “massive oil deposits”.
According to an executive order detailing the tariffs, it was announced that Pakistan is set to face a 19pc tariff rate as Trump’s tariff deadline comes to an end on August 1 (today).
Trump set rates including a 35pc duty on many goods from Canada, 50pc for Brazil, 25pc for India, 20pc for Taiwan and 39pc for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order.
The order listed higher import duty rates of 10 to 41pc starting in seven days for 69 trading partners as the 12:01am EDT (9:01am PKT) deadline approached.
Some of them had reached tariff-reducing deals; others had no opportunity to negotiate with his administration. Trump included an exception for some goods shipped within the coming week.
Goods from all other countries not listed would be subject to a 10pc US import tax. Trump had previously said that the rate might be higher.
The administration also teased that more trade deals were in the pipeline as it seeks to close trade deficits and boost domestic factories.
Facing a Friday deadline of his making, the Republican president has tapped emergency powers, pressured foreign leaders, and pressed ahead with trade policies that sparked a market sell-off when they were first announced in April.
 
 

This time, markets had a more muted reaction. Stocks and equity futures fell modestly in Friday morning trading in Asia.
Trump’s order said that some trading partners, “despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters”.
Other details are still to come, including on the “rules of origin” that will determine what products might face even higher tariffs.
Trump also said “we have made a few deals today that are excellent deals for the country”, and a US official later told reporters that they were still to be announced.
Canada, Mexico
Trump issued a separate order for Canada that raises the rate on Canadian goods subject to fentanyl-related tariffs to 35pc, from 25pc previously, saying Canada had “failed to cooperate” in curbing illicit narcotics flows into the US.
The higher tariffs on Canadian goods contrasted sharply with Trump’s decision to grant Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs of 30pc on many goods to provide more time to negotiate a broader trade pact.
Trump complained to reporters earlier that Canada had “been very poorly led”.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was disappointed by Trump’s decision.
“While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong,” Carney said in a post on X.
 






US duties and tariffs will heavily affect lumber, steel, aluminium, and automobiles, he added, vowing action to protect Canadian jobs, buy Canadian goods, invest in industrial competitiveness and diversify export markets.
The extension for Mexico avoids a 30pc tariff on most Mexican non-automotive and non-metal goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade and came after a Thursday morning call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.
“We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow,” Sheinbaum wrote on X, adding that the Trump call was “very good”.
About 85pc of US imports from Mexico comply with the rules of origin outlined in the USMCA, shielding them from 25pc tariffs related to fentanyl, according to Mexico’s economy ministry.
 






Trump said the US would continue to levy a 50pc tariff on Mexican steel, aluminum and copper and a 25pc tariff on Mexican autos and on non-USMCA-compliant goods subject to tariffs related to the US fentanyl crisis.
“Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non-Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, without providing details.
India discord
Goods from India appeared to be headed for a 25pc tariff after talks bogged down over access to India’s agriculture sector, drawing a higher-rate threat from Trump that also included an unspecified penalty for India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Although negotiations with India were continuing, New Delhi vowed to protect the country’s labour-intensive farm sector, and the threat of higher rates from Trump triggered outrage from the opposition party and a slump in the rupee.

Trump’s rollout of higher import taxes on Friday comes amid more evidence they have begun driving up consumer goods prices.
Commerce Department data released Thursday showed prices for home furnishings and durable household equipment jumped 1.3pc in June, the biggest gain since March 2022. Recreational goods and vehicles prices shot up 0.9pc, the most since February 2024. Prices for clothing and footwear rose 0.4pc.
Tough questions from judges
Trump hit Brazil’s exports on Wednesday with a steep 50pc tariff as he escalated his fight with Latin America’s largest economy over its prosecution of his friend and former president Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from heavier levies.
 
 

The run-up to Trump’s tariff deadline was unfolding as federal appeals court judges sharply questioned Trump’s use of a sweeping emergency powers law to justify his sweeping tariffs of up to 50pc on nearly all trading partners.
Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare an emergency over the growing US trade deficit and impose his “reciprocal” tariffs and a separate fentanyl emergency.
The Court of International Trade ruled in May that the actions exceeded his executive authority, and questions from judges during oral arguments before the US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit in Washington indicated further scepticism.
Meanwhile, China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with Trump’s administration, after Beijing and Washington reached preliminary deals in May and June to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and a cut-off of rare earth minerals.

The West Texas Intermediate light crude cargo will be loaded from Houston this month and is expected to arrive in Karachi in the second half of October, Qureshi said.
“This is a test spot cargo under our umbrella term agreement with Vitol. If it is commercially viable and available, we could import at least one cargo per month,” he said, adding that the shipment was not meant for resale.
The deal follows months of multiple negotiations, which first began in April, he said, after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 29pc tariffs on imports from Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistan hailed a trade deal struck with the US, its top export market, and said the agreement would increase investments. The White House said on Thursday the US will charge a 19pc tariff on imports from Pakistan.
Qureshi said Pakistan’s finance and petroleum ministries encouraged local refineries to explore US crude imports after the April tariff announcement.
Vitol did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of office hours.
A key China ally, Pakistan has been warming up to Trump after he threatened tariffs. It has credited US diplomatic intervention for ending recent hostilities with neighbouring India and nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Oil is Pakistan’s biggest import item, and its shipments were valued at $11.3 billion in the year ended June 30, 2025, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country’s total import bill.
The import deal will help Pakistan diversify its crude sourcing and reduce reliance on Middle Eastern suppliers, who account for nearly all of its oil imports.
“Gross refining margin is on par with Gulf grades, and no blending or refinery tweaks are required,” Qureshi said.
Cnergyico can process 156,000 barrels of crude per day and operates the country’s only single-point mooring terminal near Karachi, enabling it to handle large tankers, unlike other refiners in Pakistan.
The company plans to install a second offshore terminal to allow larger or more frequent shipments, and to upgrade its refinery over the next five to six years, Qureshi said.
The refiner, which has been operating at an average refinery run rate of 30 to 35pc due to tepid local demand, is betting on growth in demand for oil products.
“We expect run rates to rise as domestic demand strengthens and local production is prioritised over imported fuels,” Qureshi said.
Trump said on Wednesday the US would also cooperate with Pakistan to develop the South Asian country’s “massive oil reserves”, without providing further details.</p><small>2025-08-01 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/688bf021c7acd.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927866/opposition-alliance-holds-mpc-in-islamabad-despite-venue-hurdles' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance holds MPC in Islamabad despite venue hurdles</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) held its multi-party conference on Thursday, appealing for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy, claiming that government officials had blocked access to the original venue, forcing them to relocate.
The alliance was forced to move its conference to a private farmhouse after authorities placed barriers at its intended venue, Tulip Banquet Hall, organisers said
TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that when he and other leaders, including Mehmood Khan Achakzai, arrived at the Tulip Banquet Hall, the venue management was absent.
“Barriers were placed there and it was made impossible to go there,” Mr Khokhar said. “We held a press conference there and then we decided to move the venue to my farmhouse located in Tarlai.”
 







Urges ‘democratic’ forces to unite and draft a new charter to restore democracy

The conference, attended by opposition parties, lawyers, and media figures, criticised what speakers called the “undemocratic behaviour” of the government.
Speaking to the participants, Mr Achakzai said the group gathered for the supremacy of the constitution, freedom of the judiciary and media, and restoration of the ‘stolen’ public mandate from Feb 8 elections.
“As everyone knows, on the night of February 8, a brazen robbery of the public mandate took place through money and coercion,” Mr Achakzai said. “Whoever paid the highest price was awarded victory with a check mark. What followed was the auction of the entire state apparatus — consciences, government jobs, and public resources were all put up for sale.”
Mr Achakzai argued that “powerful undemocratic forces have treated the Constitution as nothing more than a piece of paper”.
 






He claimed that after the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party was stripped of its electoral symbol, voters still overwhelmingly chose its candidates, only to have their mandate “snatched at gunpoint” by the night of Feb 9.
He asserted the country was engulfed in corruption, with 45 per cent of the population living below the poverty line, and questioned military actions in certain regions.
“Areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other Pashtun and Baloch regions are routinely subjected to bombardment and shelling,” he said. “What was the fault of the unarmed people of Tirah and the innocent children of Bajaur who were riddled with bullets?”
Mr Achakzai appealed to all “democratic” forces to unite and formulate a new consensus charter and social contract.
In a warning to the international community, he said any agreements made by the current government regarding national resources have no legal legitimacy because the government does not represent the people.
A formal resolution from the conference is expected to be released Friday.

BANNU: Smoke billows from an alleged terrorist hideout, which was destroyed by security personnel during an intelligence-based operation.—Dawn

LAKKI MARWAT: At least six law enforcement personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station in Bannu district on Thursday amid an ongoing operation against terrorists in the Nurar area.
A police official said a joint intelligence-based operation was launched by police, security forces and Counter-Terrorism Depar­tment (CTD) commandos targeting terrorists in the Miryan police station area. The operation followed intelligence about the presence of “Fitna al-Khawarij” — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — in the region.
“During the aerial att­a­ck, a quadcopter dropped explosives on the police station, causing an explosion that left two army soldiers, three CTD personnel and one police constable inju­red,” the police official said.
The wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital and the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu.

Miryan police station targeted by aerial strike

The official said the ongoing security operation has resulted in the destruction of several terrorist hideouts. Law enforcement personnel have set up barriers and cordons at various points in the area, carrying out raids and strikes on terrorist hideouts.
The operation came after the presence of over 200 terrorists in the Miryan police station area had caused panic among residents of Nurar five days ago. Armed groups of Fitna al-Khawarij militants roamed the streets, forcing local businesses to shut down and prompting civilians to stay indoors, halting all business activity.
 
 

“The timely and effective actions of law enforcement have forced the terrorists to flee the area,” the police official said, adding that targeted operations continue to ensure the terrorists are arrested and eliminated.
Residents of the area described the situation as curfew-like, with business activities halted as a result of the security operation. Bazaars and markets were closed and many villagers stayed indoors.
Reports indicated that loudspeakers in local mosques issued warnings in the early hours of Thursday, urging residents to stay at home and cooperate with the security forces conducting the operation.
 
 

Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan confirmed that the region would be purged of terrorists at all costs. He emphasised the police’s commitment to taking firm action against anti-law elements to restore peace to the area. He said terrorists have suffered heavy casualties during ongoing operations.
RPO Khan also visited the hospital to check on the injured personnel and praised their bravery.
The RPO directed the hospital management to ensure high-standard treatment for the inju-red officers.

The assessment came in the thirty-sixth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, which was submitted to the UN Security Council Committee earlier this week.
The report, covering January to June 2025, warned that terrorist groups were increasingly likely to exploit regional tensions between India and Pakistan to expand influence and carry out attacks.
After the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people, Pakistan and India engaged in a brief but inte­nse conflict in May, trading heavy fire and missiles for several days.

Says TTP given ‘permissive environment’ by Kabul; has ties with IS-Khorasan, Al Qaeda, Baloch insurgents

The Resistance Front (TRF) initially claimed the attack but later withdrew its claim. The incident reignited debate over TRF’s alle­ged ties to Lashkar-i-Tayyiba (LeT).
“One member state said the attack could not have happened without Lashkar-i-Tayyiba (LeT) support, and that there was a relationship between LeT and TRF,” the report said.
“Another member state said that the attack was carried out by TRF, which was synonymous with LeT. One member state rejected these views and said that LeT was defunct.” The member states with diverging views were not named.
‘Substantial logistical and operational support’
It also said that the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) continued to receive “substantial logistical and operational support” from Afghanistan’s de facto authorities and maintained tactical ties with Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), Al Qaeda, and Baloch separatist groups.
The report said that the TTP, operating under a “permissive environment” inside Afghanistan, has access to a range of weapons that have enhanced the lethality of its operations. “TTP had approximately 6,000 fighters and continued to receive substantial logistical and operational support from the de facto authorities,” it said.
 
 

The report said that in Central and South Asia, various groups, including the TTP, acquired weapons (including Nato-standard) and equipment through cross-border smuggling and black-market trade.
“Member states reported that some of these groups employed “asymmetric” unmanned aerial vehicle attacks on Pakistani military installations in Sibi, Balochistan Province, and Machi, Punjab Province,” the report added.
Despite internal debates within the Taliban leadership about the need to distance itself from TTP to improve regional ties, member states assessed that the group’s operational capabilities remain robust. The report also cited instances of TTP training separatists in Balochistan and sharing facilities with Baloch separatists in southern Afghanistan.
“One member state reported that, in January 2025, TTP provided training to terrorists in Balochistan,” the report said, adding that “they (TTP and BLA) shared four training camps, including ones in Walikot and Shorabak and that Al Qaeda provided ideological and weapons training”.
However, others, who disagreed with the assessment about the TTP-BLA nexus, suggested that their coordination could be tactical at best in the shape of a non-aggression pact rather than a formal alliance. It added that the TTP also maintained tactical-level connections with IS-K. “Some member states reported that [the] TTP maintained tactical-level connections with [IS-K],” indicating operational coordination that enhances TTP’s capabilities in carrying out high-profile attacks in the region. Additionally, TTP shared training facilities with Al Qaeda.
Afghanistan’s Taliban regime was once again accused of enabling terrorist groups present on its soil. “The de facto authorities in Afghanistan continued to maintain a permissive environment for a range of terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda and its affiliates, posing a serious threat to the security of Central Asian and other countries,” the report warned.
Rising IS-K threat
Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), more commonly known as ‘Daesh’, was identified as the most significant current terrorist threat in the South and Central Asian region, with an estimated 2,000 fighters. The report used the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) to refer to the terrorist group.
The group, led by Sanaullah Ghafari, as per the report, continues to recruit across Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the Russian North Caucasus, while targeting Shia communities, foreign nationals, and Taliban officials.
The report also noted IS-K has been indoctrinating children for suicide missions. “In North Afghanistan and areas close to the Pakistani borders, IS-K indoctrinated children in madrassas, establishing a suicide training course for minors aged approximately 14 years old,” the report said.
Although Taliban crackdowns have weakened IS-K’s capabilities, it continues to operate with “relative impunity,” leveraging a diverse base of fighters, including Central Asians and female supporters.
Al Qaeda’s diminishing strength
The report said Al Qaeda’s footprint in Afghanistan has diminished significantly, with limited resources and reduced numbers, largely confined to six provinces: Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kunar, Uruzgan, and Zabul. However, the group retains aspirations for a global resurgence.
“Member states assessed that Al Qaeda in Afghanistan did not present an immediate threat for regional states since it possessed limited resources and had been drastically downsized,” the report noted.
The global network remains operational. Sayf al-Adl, believed to be the group’s de facto leader, has reportedly tasked senior operatives with reactivating cells in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and parts of Europe. Meanwhile, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) has grown more confident under Osama Mahmoud, who was formally named emir in March 2025. “There were concerns that the confidence and ambition of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) were increasing,” the report said.

The case, registered by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), Makran, accuses a seven-year-old boy of sharing the video of a speech by human rights activist Gulzar Dost in Turbat.
The boy was presented in a court on Thursday.
Officials said the controversial speech delivered by Mr Dost was shared on TikTok by the minor, which was a crime under the Anti Terrorism Act, since the orator was placed in the Fourth Schedule by the provincial government.
Mr Dost has been in detention for the last two weeks.
HRCP ‘appalled’
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has condemned the action.
In a statement, the commission said it was “appalled” by reports that a minor has been presented before an anti-terrorism court on charges of “terrorism” for allegedly sharing the speech of a rights activist on social media.
The “misuse” of anti-terror laws reflected a “gross violation of child rights and due process”.
“We demand the immediate withdrawal of charges, a thorough review of the FIR and accountability for the officials responsible for this alarming overreach,” the HRCP statement added.

The bodies of Abdul Majeed, 40, his wife Mrs Sakeena, 28, and their three-year-old son, Abdul Nabi, were recovered from their home near Ghaghar Phatak on Wednesday.
The couple had married of their own freewill about seven years ago. The police believed that the gruesome incident was linked with their marriage. The victims bore multiple injuries apparently caused with sharp-edged weapon, like axe.
The couple hailed from Lasbela where coffins were taken to but the relatives of the woman did not allow the burial in their area. Eventually, the bodies were brought back and laid to rest near Ghaghar Phatak, according to police and rescue services officials.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said in a statement that they had transported the bodies by ambulances to Lasbela but the couple’s relatives resisted their burial there. The bodies had to be brought back to the Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth, he said.
Steel Town SHO Aslam Billu said that Imam Bakhsh, the brother of the deceased Abdul Majeed, had come to Karachi from Lasbela on Wednesday night to lodged an FIR against the deceased woman’s brother Shahzad alias Raja in the triple murder case.

The proportion of people living in extreme poverty has risen from 4.9pc to 16.5pc. This revision, based on revised threshold, does not take into account the fallouts from the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2022 floods, and recent years’ phenomenal spike in cost of living, that may have pushed more people into poverty.
Meanwhile, per capita income has increased to $1,824 in FY25. But this rise conceals worsening income disparity across the country. These aren’t just statistics; they are a reflection of policy choices and an indictment of the country’s economic direction. It shows that our economic model is broken, necessitating a complete rethink of our economic strategy to fighting poverty.
Successive governments have poured billions into subsidies and relief programmes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), while neglecting growth, job creation, human development, and rural development. Poverty in Pakistan is not simply rising; it is being manufactured and maintained through decisions that entrench inequality and suppress opportunity.
BISP has played a crucial role in Pakistan’s social safety net by providing financial assistance to low-income families and vulnerable groups since 2008. In FY26, BISP allocation has been increased by 20pc to Rs 722bn (0.5pc of GDP) to expand coverage to 10m families. The quarterly stipend will increase from Rs13,500 to Rs14,500. While the government is striving to expand beneficiary coverage and improve transparency in fund distribution, the overall poverty reduction strategy needs a serious rethink, given limited fiscal space and the low-growth, low-investment trap.

Poverty in this country is the outcome of deliberate policy choices, neglect and systemic flaws.

Broadly speaking, the government needs focused policies to address critical issues directly affecting the public. The FY26 budget was directed at the IMF, business elites and government employees. There was no vision, strategy, or action plan to address economic stagnation, unemployment, poverty, inequality, or the country’s dismal state of human development.
Poverty in Pakistan is not just accidental. It is a consequence of deliberate policy choices, neglect and systemic flaws. For example, our farmers incurred Rs2.2 trillion losses in wheat production alone this year, jeopardising food security and reducing rural incomes. Agriculture, which accounts for 23pc of GDP, employs 37pc of the labour force, and contributes 60pc to export earnings, has been hit hard by climate shocks, plummeting prices, policy missteps and state neglect. Crop production fell by 13.5pc in FY25: cotton by 30.7pc, maize by 14.7pc, and wheat by 8.9pc. Fertiliser shortages during sowing seasons, removal of wheat support prices under IMF pressure, and abandonment of commodity procurement left farmers exposed to market volatility and exploitation by middlemen. Instead of ensuring a smooth policy transition and putting in place an alternative market mechanism to protect farmers, the government simply backed off. This underscores the lack of planning and blind implementation of IMF advice.
In a painful example of fiscal irresponsibility, the government has been increasing salaries and benefits of ministers, legislators, judges and bureaucrats. In a country scrambling for aid and barely managing debt repayments, such extravagance reflects a shocking disregard for the hardships faced by ordinary Pakistanis.
Likewise, our tax system perpetuates inequality. Salaried individuals contributed around Rs555bn in FY25, 51pc more than last year. Meanwhile, large retailers, landlords, speculators and grey-market earners remain untouched. The FBR’s Tajir Dost Scheme raised a mere Rs4m, against a Rs50bn target. Eminent economist Dr Hafeez Pasha estimates that the average real income of salaried individuals has declined by 30pc due to inflation and aggressive taxation.
Beyond the cynicism, let’s look at the global efforts to end extreme poverty, and to understand what works, and what doesn’t. Africa’s reliance on foreign aid offers a cautionary tale. Despite receiving billions in development assistance annually over decades — $53.5bn in 2022 alone — African countries are home to three-quarters of the world’s poor. Sub-Saharan Africa still has the highest number of people living in extreme poverty: 411m in 2023, 45pc up from 1990. Foreign aid has failed to eradicate poverty, highlighting the limitations of externally funded relief without structural reforms. Instead, Africa is drowning in debt.
In contrast, China, India and many Latin American countries pulled hundreds of millions out of poverty through sustained economic growth, institutional reforms and targeted support. China combined broad-based economic transformation with targeted assistance to disadvantaged regions and households, starting with agricultural reforms and later developing labour-intensive industries. India, the world’s fastest growing major economy over the last decade, more than doubled its GDP from $2.1tr in 2015 to $4.3tr in 2025, while investing in basic infrastructure such as toilets, clean water and electricity to uplift rural communities. Latin American countries, too, made significant progress by strengthening institutions, reducing inequality, and adopting sound policy frameworks.
Meanwhile, during the last three years, Pakistan has experienced negative per capita growth with GDP growth rate of -0.5pc in FY23, 2.5pc in FY45, and an estimated 2.68pc in FY25. Stabilisation without growth is becoming the country’s new normal and we can no longer afford it. It only exacerbates unemployment, poverty and inequality. With inflation easing and commodity sectors underperforming, we must use both fiscal and monetary policies to boost private investment and stimulate growth.
The 2023 digital census has shown startling gaps in literacy in rural Sindh, Balochistan and KP. Likewise, healthcare lacks adequate infrastructure and resources. Within provinces, there are substantial disparities between urban and rural areas, and between different districts. The government must focus on improving development outcomes in the districts that have the lowest development indicators.
The nations that have seen the most dramatic improvements in poverty reduction and other measures of human well-being have all focused on growth, economic reforms and targeted social protection policies. Pakistan must learn from these lessons. This will require sincere political will, a strong policy focus and coordination amongst the different tiers of government.

• Islamabad says agreement includes reduction of tariffs; diplomatic circles believe US will charge 15-20pc on Pakistani goods
• Trump rails against India, Russia; many countries still in a lurch as tariff deadline expires
WASHINGTON: A day after signing an agreement with the United States to develop “massive oil deposits” in Pakistani territory, Pakistani officials said the two nations had concluded a trade deal on Thursday, establishing a uniform tariff rate for bilateral trade.
“The agreement will result in a reduction of reciprocal tariffs, especially on Pakistani exports to the United States,” said an official statement released by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington.
In a statement issued in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called it “a landmark deal, which will enhance our growing cooperation and expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in the days to come”.
 






He also thanked US President Donald Trump “for his leadership role in finalising this historic US-Pakistan trade agreement”.
The embassy noted that the deal would boost bilateral trade, expand market access, attract investment and foster cooperation in areas of mutual interest.
The breakthrough was reached during a meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, along with United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, in Washington. Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United States Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present.
President Trump announced the trade deal via a post on Truth Social, though he only mentioned the agreement to explore oil deposits. Similarly, the Pakistani statement placed more emphasis on the oil arrangement.
While Pakistan is celebrating the deal, the United States has yet to make an official statement regarding the agreement.
Moreover, while President Trump has mentioned specific tariff rates in announcements with other countries, he did not provide such details regarding the agreement with Pakistan.
However, diplomatic sources said the United States has agreed to charge a 15 to 20 per cent tariff on goods from Pakistan. The sources noted that the deal gives Islamabad an edge over India, which has been slapped with a 25pc tariff rate and penalised for buying weapons and oil from Russia and Iran.
The embassy noted that the deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration, especially in energy, mining and minerals, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors.
It complements Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to broaden the scope of Pakistan-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US state level. The agreement enhances Pakistan’s access to the US market — and vice versa.
The deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan’s infrastructure and development projects.
“This trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties,” the official statement added.
‘Changing attitude in Washington’
Hours after announcing the oil exploration deal, President Trump posted another message on his official site, clearly expressing his frustration with India.
“I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” he wrote. “We have done very little business with India. Their tariffs are too high — among the highest in the world.”

Dr Aparna Pande, the director of the India Initiative at the Hudson Institute in Washington, told the New York Times that “for the first time in 35 years, [India] is faced with an American administration that is not driven by strategic altruism”.
The nuance in the bilateral relationship embraced by US presidents since Bill Clinton — because of India’s rising importance to America’s national security — “appears to be fading”, Dr Pande said.
Analysts and officials in New Delhi told the Times that the changing attitude in Washington “has disrupted a relationship built painstakingly over decades, one that recognised India’s balancing act in a difficult region dominated by China and Russia”.
India had been allowed to grow closer to the United States on its own terms and had taken a firmer stance on China, the report added.
Christopher Clary, associate professor of Political Science at the University at Albany, said in a social media post that “if you were to summarise the history of US-India and US-Pakistan ties, it would go something like this: India sometimes refuses to make positive-sum compromises out of principle, and Pakistan has often compromised — or at least pretended to compromise — to ensure positive ties with Washington.”
Other analysts argued that the discovery of vast deposits of rare earth materials and oil also caused the change in Washington’s thinking.
Some analysts also draw a parallel between recent developments in Iran and the shift in Washington, pointing out that Pakistan borders two sensitive countries, Afghanistan and Iran.
‘New world trade order’
Meanwhile, Trump’s dream of a new world trade order faced a crucial test on Thursday, with dozens of economies — including key commercial partners like Canada — yet to secure US tariff deals ahead of a midnight deadline.
The last-gasp scramble to strike bilateral accords came as an appeals court in Washington considered the legality behind Trump’s strategy of invoking emergency economic powers to declare sweeping duties on imports.
The 79-year-old Republican doubled down on the wide-ranging levies, posting on Truth Social: “Tariffs are making America GREAT & RICH Again”.

He insisted in a separate post that the world’s biggest economy would have “no chance of survival or success” without protectionist measures.
However, in a sign of flexibility, he announced on Friday that he was delaying a tariff hike on Mexican products originally due on Friday for 90 days after talks with counterpart Claudia Sheinbaum.
So far, Washington has announced pacts with Britain, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea and the European Union, with those new rates expected to take effect Friday.
South Korea squeezed in a last-minute agreement on a 15pc tariff, significantly below the 25pc that Trump threatened on its goods.
But Trump announced 50pc tariffs on Brazilian products — while postponing imposition and allowing key exemptions — as an effort to pressure the US ally to drop its prosecution of right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro on coup charges.
He also unveiled a 25pc levy on Indian imports, and warned Canada it would face trade repercussions for planning to recognise a Palestinian state.
And the details of the agreements that have been made remain vague. For example, the EU, while having reached a pact, continues pushing for a carve-out for its wine industry.

Both sides claimed on Thursday that they have reached a deal. American President Donald Trump said it will help the two allies tap Pakistan’s “massive oil reserves”.
“We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership,” he announced on social media. While the US president did not mention tariffs, Islamabad said the agreement would lead to a reduction in the steep reciprocal import taxes Washington had slapped on its exports under the so-called Liberation Day duties announced in April but temporarily suspended for 90 days to give room for trade talks. Pakistan faces a potential tariff of 29pc.
The country’s finance ministry said this deal signals “the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration especially in energy, mines and minerals, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors”. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb described it as a win-win situation for both nations. While neither side gave too many details, Pakistani authorities expect the pact to boost bilateral trade, expand market access, attract investment and foster strategic cooperation.
The minister said: “From our perspective, it was always going beyond the immediate trade imperative. The whole point of this is that trade and investment have to go hand in hand.” The announcement came a day after Mr Trump slapped 25pc tariffs on imports from India to punish it for its Russian oil purchases. Therefore, the ‘symbolism’ of the pact is likely to matter more than the sketchy specifics of the agreement — especially the tariff reductions which Islamabad claims to have secured.
That said, the deal reflects a willingness on the part of the leadership of the two countries to recalibrate their transactional security-focused relationship in favour of a greater focus on strategic trade and investment ties. This surprise turn in bilateral relations should send a positive signal to foreign investors, especially American firms, which have so far been reluctant to bring their capital to Pakistan due to the chill in relations for the last several years.
Whether or not Mr Trump plans to convert his energy cooperation rhetoric into action will only be known after a final tariff deal is announced. Islamabad is seeking a substantial reduction in reciprocal tariffs from 29pc to 15-20pc, on a par with other recent US trade agreements, particularly with Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. But Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar believes that Pakistan should be fine “as long as we are better than or equal to our peers”. A favourable tariff deal is critical for us as the US is our single largest export market. The deal will also determine the future direction of economic and investment cooperation between both states.

Clearly not. How do societies ensure that the people abide by the law when there is little fear of being caught in the absence of the law-enforcement officer? Through ethics, community standards and the fear of being thought ill of.
For instance, you are alone on a street where a fancy car is parked. You see a Rs5,000 note lying on the front seat of the car. Will you break the window of the car to get it? No one else is visible on the street and there are no video cameras either. So, the probability of being caught is zero. Would you break the window to get the note? Some might. Others might not. The reasons will vary.
Some might feel they have nothing to lose as they will not be caught and the broken window is not their problem, while they would gain Rs5,000. So, they may go ahead and break the window. If they are desperate for the money, it will add to their reasons for doing so. Others might feel that Rs5,000 is just too small an amount to justify the effort and perceived risk. But they could change their mind if the amount were Rs50,000. There would be others who would not take the money because of the fear of being caught, out of habit, or for religious and ethical reasons.
What sort of society should we aim for? A society that follows its self-interest and only deviates from it when there is fear of law or punishment? Everyone is ready to break the window; they only refrain if a policeman is present or if they fear being caught and punished. Clearly, such a society would be a terrible one to live in, even if it were possible to have a ‘society’ like this.

When norms are violated, the first response is to look towards strengthening the law.

Take the example of a society that has some focus on community and a sense of belonging; it is one in which individuals are brought up with a sense of citizenship and community rights and responsibilities. It does not mean this society would be without laws or their enforcement but that a lot of the societal interactions would be based on the norms of the community and the ways of doing things. The law would be enforced as a measure of last resort. The examples of how citizens behave in Japan, Europe or traditional societies and tribes can be taken from societies with strong norms, which are invested in seeing the latter internalised in their population — this may be implemented for the younger people through education systems and parental and community guidance.
In this country, over the last few decades, we have been sliding in the other direction. When norms are found to be inadequate for addressing certain issues, or when they are violated, the first response is to look towards strengthening the law or its enforcement. If people do not wear helmets when driving motorcycles, let us fine them. If they still do not comply, let us raise the fine and strictly enforce it. If it still does not work, how about lodging FIRs against them and locking up vehicles and so on? And all this is for what? For the protection of the person who is driving the motorcycle and the people around him or her. We might achieve compliance this way eventually, but will compliance then become the norm? The moment enforcement lags, and we have seen it happen a number of times, people start to ignore the law.
Take the example of speeding on the Motorway. Fines were imposed — the Motorway Police was quite good at this. But then, things became lax and many people started to drive fast. Fines were hiked, but that was found to be inadequate, so now, if you drive above a certain limit, an FIR is registered against you and you can be arrested and your car can be impounded.
We can see this in the realm of expression as well — in both physical space and online. Norms were not enough to deter excesses when protests took place and people let their views be known on online forums. What was the solution? The social media platform X was shut down for a long period. And laws were made stricter, with their enforcement now on steroids. This has, of course, not solved the issue; in fact, it cannot solve the issue.
Underlying issues need to be addressed and we have to learn how to disagree with each other and manage this disagreement. Every time a person expresses anger against the government, a department of the state, or individuals in the government or departments, it is not disloyalty, not grounds for persecution and definitely not a reason for a ‘software update’ — the ugly term we have coined for abduction, torture and destruction of an individual’s human dignity.
Where does society go from here? Once we have set off in the direction of invoking the law and ensuring its enforcement, the importance of norms is reduced. Thus norms become weaker. So, the use of the law is not norm-neutral. Escaping from the vicious cycle of infringements of norms, stricter law and enforcement, weaker norms, more infringements and even stricter laws, gets harder and harder. We are already caught in more than one cycle in some of the areas mentioned.
Can we reverse the trend? It will take a major social and political upheaval to change things. And the upheaval will have to dislodge beneficiaries of the current system to allow reconfiguration. The current beneficiaries will, of course, continue to resist. So, for the foreseeable future, we will see the continuation of a vicious cycle.

• NHA gets flak for awarding Carec project contract to joint venture led by ‘disqualified’ firm
ISLAMABAD: The top-priority Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway project will start in April next year, the National Highway Authority (NHA) informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Communications.
“We will start the project by April next year,” NHA Chairman Sheharyar Sikandar told the meeting, chaired by MNA Ijaz Jakhrani on Thursday.
In his briefing to the NA panel on Thursday, the NHA chairman said the project would be financed by the Islamic Development Bank, adding that the advance procurement approval from the bank had been requested, with land acquisition expected to commence within a month.
It may be noted that there is ambiguity about the timeline of this project, which has already faced delays.
In June this year, Communications Minister Aleem Khan said the much-needed road project would start this year but did not specify if he was referring to the financial year or the calendar year.
Similarly, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, acknowledging the importance of the vital artery, said the work on the top-priority project would “begin next year”. He made this statement in February, but did not specify whether he meant the fiscal year or calendar year.
Meanwhile, the committee expressed displeasure over the absence of the communications ministry’s secretary, warning that future instances of non-attendance would be brought before the house and the privilege committee for appropriate action.
Toll tax revisions
The committee also expressed concerns about the third revision in toll tax within a short period, which appeared to contravene its policy of revising the tax every three years. The committee deemed this repeated increase against the public interest and directed the NHA to submit a detailed justification at the next meeting.
The motorway police chief also briefed the committee on the legal framework under which FIRs were being registered against motorists exceeding the 150 km/h speed limit, saying the practice had the cover of Section 279 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) relating to fast and negligent driving. It was noted that since the enforcement of this law, the casualties on the motorway had significantly decreased over the past five months.
The committee asked for a review, suggesting the replacement of corporal punishment with stricter financial penalties and possible licence suspensions.
Meanwhile, a calling-attention notice, moved by a member regarding the presence of two toll plazas within a five-kilometre stretch on the M-9 Motorway, termed it contradictory to the existing policy that mandated a minimum distance of 35km between two toll plazas.
The NHA responded that a major bridge was located at that point, and under current policy, toll plazas were permitted at each major bridge regardless of the distance. The committee directed the NHA to submit a list of all bridges where toll plazas had been installed.
The committee was further informed that the Karachi Northern Bypass would be a part of the M-10 project, which would resolve the congestion issues faced by Karachi.
Carec project
The NA committee also discussed the issue of alleged wrongdoing in the bidding process of the Rs170 billion Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (Carec) Tranche-III corridor project, as all four contracts had been awarded to a firm previously disqualified by the NHA.
The committee members reprimanded the NHA for allegedly favouring a joint venture of the Chinese firm Ningxia Communication Construction (NXCC) and two local firms. The NXCC was disqualified in 2023 for allegedly failing to complete a previous project.
Since the matter is already being scrutinised by the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division, the body decided to write to the Senate committee to seek the findings of its sub-committee.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani satellite has been successfully launched from China’s Xichang Satellite Launch Center, the national space agency announced on Thursday.
The Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite-1 (PRSS-1), aboard a Kuaizhou-1A carrier rocket, was launched at 10am (GMT+8) on Thursday.
It has successfully entered its preset orbit, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has said.
The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said the new Remote Sensing Satellite will be a major milestone in Pakistan’s space exploration efforts and strengthen its position in Earth observation capabilities.

Celestial object to help in urban planning, disaster management, food security, ecology protection

“The Remote Sensing Satellite will provide imaging capabilities to revolutionise urban planning, disaster management, food security, and environmental protection. It will also greatly aid in monitoring climate change, managing water resources, mapping agricultural patterns and tracking deforestation,” said the space agency.
 
 

The launch was a result of the collaboration between Suparco, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation and MICROSAT China.
The satellite will support precision agriculture to boost crop yields, monitor infrastructure growth and urban expansion, and enable more effective regional planning.
It will also enhance disaster management efforts by providing timely warnings for floods, landslides, and earthquakes, while tracking glacier recession and deforestation.
Suparco Chairman Muhammad Yousaf Khan said the satellite would support national priorities across multiple sectors and will contribute towards sustainable socio-economic development.
It will contribute to national development initiatives such as CPEC by mapping transportation networks and identifying geohazard risks, Suparco said.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who witnessed the launch ceremony as the chief guest, said the event was not only a technological milestone, but a “moment that lifts our national spirit and elevates our friendship with China”.
The Chinese embassy in Pakistan congratulated the country on the satellite’s launch.
In a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Suparco on the successful launch and thanked Chinese partners for their contributions to the project.

GAZA: Palestinians rush towards aid packages being airdropped over the besieged enclave.—Reuters

• Portugal to also weigh recognition
• Trump’s envoy meets Netanyahu, will head to Gaza today
• US imposes sanctions on Palestinian Authority, PLO officials
OTTAWA: Canada plans to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September, Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Wednesday, a major policy shift that drew an angry response from US President Donald Trump and was rejected by Israel.
Meanwhile, Portugal will also consider whether to recognise the State of Palestine at the UN in September, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro’s office said on Thursday.
Carney said the move was necessary to preserve hopes of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a long-standing Canadian goal that was “being eroded before our eyes”.
“Canada intends to recognise the State of Palestine at the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025,” the prime minister said.
This makes Canada — a G7 nation — the third country, following recent announcements by France and the United Kingdom, to signal plans to recognise a Palestinian state in September.
Israel blasted Canada’s announcement as part of a “distorted campaign of international pressure”, while Trump warned that trade negotiations with Ottawa may not proceed smoothly.
“Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform. “That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them.”

Asked by reporters if there was a scenario where Canada could change its position before the UN meeting, Carney said: “There’s a scenario (but) possibly one that I can’t imagine.”
Canada’s intention “is predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to much-needed reforms,” Carney said, referring to the body led by President Mahmoud Abbas, which has civil authority in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Meanwhile, Portugal Prime Minister Montenegro’s office said in a statement that the country “is considering recognition of the Palestinian state, as part of a procedure that could be concluded during the high-level week of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, to be held in New York in September”,
US envoy to enter Gaza
Separately, Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff held talks in Israel on Thursday on ways to end the crisis in Gaza, where nearly 22 months of grinding war and dire shortages of food have drawn mounting international criticism.
Witkoff, who has been involved in months of stalled negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after his arrival, the Israeli leader’s office said.
Witkoff and ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee will also enter Gaza on Friday (today) to inspect aid distribution and meet with residents of the war-wracked territory.
Sanctions on Palestinian Authority
The US imposed sanctions on Pales­tinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) on Thursday, accusing them of undermining peace efforts with Israel.
The State Department said it would deny visas for travel to the US by those it was targeting, although it did not name any specific individuals.
The PA and PLO serve as representatives for the Palestinian people and have long pushed for recognition of a Palestinian state by international organisations and foreign nations. The two groups had no immediate comment on the US move.

• Medvedev brushes aside Trump’s attack
NEW DELHI: By declaring the Indian economy as dead in the water on Thursday, President Donald Trump has put Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
 
 

The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Mr Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end. Encouraging words have come from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who poohpoohed Mr Trump’s vitriol and continued to see a world in good cheer despite the US president’s hissed warnings.
On the other hand, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was sanguine that Trump was right at least about the state of the Indian economy. “He [Trump] is right. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy, except the prime minister and the finance minister. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact.
“The whole world knows – India’s economy is a dead economy and the BJP has destroyed the economy. Why did they destroy it? To help Adani,” said Mr Gandhi while speaking to reporters outside the parliament on Thursday.
Mr Gandhi was carefully silent about India’s Russia ties. The reference to tycoon Gautam Adani seemed more severe as the billionaire businessman close to Mr Modi is facing a corruption case in the US.
Rahul Gandhi’s statement came hours after Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that a 25 per cent tariff, plus a penalty, will be imposed on India starting Aug 1. The Modi government has responded to it saying that it “will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest”.
Later on Wednesday, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Medvedev’s ‘unmoved’
In Moscow, Mr Medvedev responded to Trump’s comments with studied calm, saying they were “nervous reaction” and are evidence that Moscow is pursuing the right path.
The US president had described Medvedev as a “failed” former leader and warned him to “watch his words”, adding that Medvedev was “entering very dangerous territory”.
Medvedev was unmoved. “If some words from the former president of Russia trigger such a nervous reaction from the high-and-mighty president of the United States, then Russia is doing everything right and will continue to proceed along its own path,” Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, wrote on social media.
He also ridiculed Trump’s claim that the Russian and Indian economies were “dead” and going “down together” due to lack of cooperation with the US.
Medvedev had earlier dismissed Trump’s demands for Moscow to swiftly end its military campaign against Ukraine, calling the threats of secondary sanctions against Russian energy customers “theatrical” and ineffective.
Trump previously criticised the BRICS group of nations, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and several other states, for pursuing a new multipolar world order. The US president claimed proposed tariffs on countries doing business with BRICS members could cripple the organisation.
Trump’s statement regarding India and Medvedev followed New Delhi’s refusal to accommodate US demands on trade.
Mr Gandhi said that the Modi government had “destroyed India’s economic, defence and foreign policy. They are running this country into the ground”.

According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), the heavy rainfall led to flooding in Khatam village in Ghizer’s Gupis Valley, blocking the Ghizer-Shandur Road and damaging agricultural land and private properties.
The floodwaters also caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in Gojal, upper Hunza, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.
The Gilgit-Baltistan government has declared 37 villages across the region as calamity-hit areas. According to a notification issued by the GB Home and Prisons Department, the affected areas include 12 villages in Diamer, nine in Gilgit, five in Ghizer, four each in Skardu and Shigar, two in Ghanche, and one each in Nagar and Kharmang.
 
 

GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement that the recent floods across Gilgit-Baltistan have caused an estimated Rs20 billion in damages. The floods have destroyed infrastructure, homes, agricultural land and public utilities.
Mr Faraq added that 22 vehicles were swept away by the floods, while 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives. Four individuals have sustained injuries and between 10 and 15 tourists are still missing. Search operations are currently underway.
Over 500 homes and agricultural land, crops, roads, bridges and both public and private infrastructure have been significantly damaged.
The Gilgit-Baltistan government has initiated emergency and rehabilitation operations across the affected areas.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the Gilgit-Baltistan region among the hardest hit.

Judge Abual Hasanat Mohammad Zulqarnain expressed displeasure over the continued non-appearance of the accused despite repeated summons, expanding the list of warrants in a case registered at the Karachi Company Police Station on Nov 26, 2024.
The order added 41 PTI leaders to nine others already facing similar orders.
Among the prominent figures now liable to be arrested are KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur; Senators Shibli Faraz, Azam Khan Swati and Faisal Javed; and former National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser.
The list also includes senior lawyers Salman Akram Raja and Shoaib Shaheen; PTI Information Secretary Raoof Hassan; former federal ministers Murad Saeed and Hammad Azhar; MNA Omar Ayub Khan; and Aleema Khan, a sister of the party’s jailed founder, Imran Khan.
The development comes a week after a separate anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi issued arrest warrants for Alvi and other prominent figures, including Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, in multiple cases connected to the same Nov 26 protests.
Judge Amjad Shah of the Rawalpindi court also cited the repeated failure of the accused to appear before the court.
According to court documents, several individuals named in the cases have not been arrested.

• Committee discusses bill to establish legal, ethical framework for AI regulation
ISLAMABAD: A Senate standing committee on on Thursday questioned the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication over its apparent collaboration with a mobile service provider and a public sector university in a project that aims to develop an indigenous Large Language Model (LLM).
LLMs are trained on immense amount of data to make them capable of generating responses based on the input prompt. They are at the back of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and DeepSeek.
The IT ministry has collaborated with Jazz and the National University of Sciences and Technology to produce Pakistan’s first LLM.
Chaired by Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan, the meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecommunication expressed concern that the ministry had apparently excluded other capable players from academia and industry.
 
 

Senator Humayun Mohmand took the lead in grilling ministry officials. “Why were other telecom companies and technical universities not invited to participate?” he asked.
Responding to the criticism, the IT secretary clarified they had not formally selected Jazz and Nust, rather both entities had independently launched the initiative and were self-financing it.
“No public funds are involved,” he assured the committee.
Nonetheless, Senator Mohmand recommended that the opportunity be publicly advertised to invite open participation from other stakeholders — a proposal the Secretary accepted, adding that universities across the country were now being invited to express interest.

To justify their involvement in the venture, representatives from Jazz made a presentation before the committee, underscoring that many native languages in Pakistan are on the verge of extinction. They said the LLM initiative was aimed at preserving the country’s rich linguistic heritage, though they admitted data collection remains a significant hurdle.
The Jazz delegation subsequently left the meeting after cross-questioning from lawmakers.
Senator Mohmand also expressed the concern that the mobile company could have an unfair advantage in the field, given its association with the ministry.
Acknowledging these concerns, IT secretary assured the committee that future projects will ensure transparency and open participation for all stakeholders.
Regulation of AI bill
The committee also held detailed deliberations on the proposed ‘Regulation of Artificial Intelligence Bill, 2024,’ introduced by Senator Afnan Ullah Khan.
The legislation seeks to establish a legal and ethical framework for AI development in Pakistan amid growing global adoption of intelligent technologies. Committee members stressed the urgency of such regulation to ensure responsible and safe AI deployment.
The ministry also revealed that a newly established Emerging Technology Wing has been assigned the task of accelerating work in four high-priority domains: AI, semiconductors, cybersecurity, and quantum computing.
In response to a query from Senator Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee regarding financial feasibility, the IT secretary confirmed that Rs16 billion had been allocated under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for FY2024–25 to support these efforts.
The meeting also featured a briefing by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency on a sweeping crackdown on illegal call centers operating across the country.
The committee was informed that 54 call centers were raided, resulting in the arrest of 254 individuals, with Islamabad emerging as the hotspot.

• Opposition alliance TTAP condemns ‘kangaroo courts’
• Ministers call it ‘timely and commendable decision’
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: The op­­­­­position PTI on Thursday rejec­ted the verdict of a special anti-terrorism court (ATC) as a politically-motivated “travesty of justi­­ce”, after several senior party lea­ders were sentenced to 10 years in prison for their role in the May 9 riots.
In a sharply-worded statement, a PTI spokesperson condemned the ruling, calling it “one of the darkest chapters in the country’s judicial history and nothing short of a judicial murder”.
He described the conviction of PTI leaders and workers as a “hasty, one-sided, and politically motivated trial—an utterly failed and desperate attempt to crush the unwavering resolve of PTI’s leadership and loyal workers”.
The party claimed the convictions were “acts of revenge” and said the timing was designed to stifle a nationwide protest plan­ned for 5 August. He added that this ‘sham decision’ sentenced six National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members, and one senator, calling it a grave violation of the Constitution and dark stain on the face of justice, as well as a global embarrassment.
“This is the first time opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced solely based on their loyalty to the unlawfully incarcerated PTI Patron-in-chief Imran Khan’s political narrative, public representation and constitutional struggle,” the spokesperson said.
However, PTI spokesperson categorically said that these campaigns of oppression and suppression would neither intimidate nor weaken their resolve.
Instead, he added, such coercive and brutal tactics would only fuel their determination as they prepare for the nationwide protests scheduled for Aug 5.
Opposition alliance
The party’s condemnation was echoed at an All Parties Confere­nce convened by the Tehreek-i-Tah­af­fuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), a coalition of opposition groups.
In a joint statement, the TTAP called Thursday “another black day in the political and democra­tic history of Pakistan,” and appe­aled to the country’s chief justice to intervene, warning that the verdicts posed a “question mark on Pakistan’s judicial system”.
 
 

“We completely reject the verdicts of these kangaroo courts and condemn them,” the statement read. “This once again makes it clear that the government, which stan­­ds on the crutches of the establishment, and this hybrid system want the complete elimination of the opposition in the country,” it added.
In Lahore, PTI Punjab media head Shayan Bashir called the ruling a “massacre of law, justice, and the Constitution”, and vowed that the party’s protest would go ahead regardless of the government’s actions.
“Even if they arrest the party’s entire leadership, people will shut down Pakistan on August 5 and fight till the last drop of their blood for the true leader,” he said.
Ministers welcome verdict
The government, however, welcomed the sentences as a necessary step to uphold the rule of law.
Punjab’s information minister, Azma Bokhari, said the verdict sent a “clear and strong message to those with anti-state agendas that such actions will no longer be tolerated”.
She insisted that inciting atta­cks on state institutions was “an intolerable offence” and that “terrorism under the guise of political activism must come to an end”.
Federal information minister Attaullah Tarar, in a televised address, hailed the court’s decision as a “victory of the law” and accused PTI supporters of orchestrating attacks on military installations, government property, and law enforcement personnel.
“The trial that took place for this was a very fair trial,” Mr Tarar said, adding that the process included cross-examinations, witness testimonies, and the presentation of evidence.

The plan was approved at a meeting of the civil and military leadership on Thursday.
The meeting of the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ (Harden the State) was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. It was also attended by the chief of army staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn the prime minister addressed the meeting, which was covered by the media, and followed by a closed-door session.

High-level meeting finalises strategy to eliminate threat posed by terrorists

“The meeting decided how the next phase of the National Action Plan can be implemented,” the source said, while referring to the counterinsurgency plan made after the horrific attack on Peshawar’s Army Public School in 2014 in which over 140 children were killed.
Under the strategy, people from all segments of society will be taken on board to play their role in eradicating terrorism and extremism.
The meeting also discussed the repatriation plan for Afghan refugees and decided to expedite the process, the source added.
According to an official press release, PM Shehbaz said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the threat posed by menace posed by the proscribed Fitna al-Khawarij — the official term for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan — and other militant outfits.
“Pakistan is working on a comprehensive, effective and workable strategy to completely eliminate Fitna al-Hindustan, Fitna al-Khawarij and other such anti-social elements,” the prime minister said.
 
 

The prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” to use ground operations, legislation and meaningful public communication discouraging extremist thinking.
The prime minister directed the committee to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments and strictly implement the recommendations.
PM Shehbaz lauded the role of security personnel and law enforcement agencies who have taken “very effective steps” in the war against terrorism.
“With the joint actions and cooperation of all the relevant institutions, effective actions were taken against smuggling, which made it possible to prevent it,” he said.
The prime minister said only a peaceful and strong state structure free from terrorism could restore the confidence of investors at the international level.

Puran Circle Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Usman Munir told Dawn.com: “The young girls had gone to the river to fetch water for domestic use, but suddenly, due to the fast flow of the river, the sand and mud collapsed and swept them away,” adding that the incident occurred in the Kamach area.
He said one of the girls was rescued by some residents present at the river’s bank in the area.
The SDPO said a search operation was launched in the area by Rescue 1122, but the flow of water in the river was too high.
Ibadullah Khan, a local activist, said that there was no Rescue 1122 outpost in the area. “Locals had no alternative source of potable water but to fetch it from the river and such accidents were common in the area”, he said.
On Wednesday, at least four people drowned, and one child went missing after a seven-seater van fell into a rain drain in Punjab’s Attock district, according to Rescue 1122.
Earlier in the month, four children drowned while bathing in a pond in the Daulat Khel area of KP’s Lakki Marwat district, according to Rescue 1122.</p><small>2025-07-31 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3123371263e378f.png?r=234302' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927841/govt-slashes-petrol-price-by-rs754-hikes-high-speed-diesel-by-rs148' target='_blank'><strong>Govt slashes petrol price by Rs7.54, hikes high-speed diesel by Rs1.48</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Thursday night slashed the price of petrol by Rs7.54 per litre while raising that of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs1.48 per litre for the next fortnight.
Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.
In a press release issued today, the Finance Division stated that the price of petrol was set at Rs264.61 per litre and that of HSD at Rs285.83 per litre.
It added that it decided on these new rates “following a review of prevailing international market trends” and upon the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.
Sources had previously said that after four consecutive hikes, petrol and diesel prices were expected to fall by about Rs9 and Rs3.50 per litre, owing to lower international oil prices and reduced import premiums.
Based on prevailing tax rates, the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to decline by around Rs9 per litre (3.3 per cent), while HSD was expected to see a reduction of Rs3.50 per litre (1.3pc), depending on final cost calculations.
According to informed sources, global oil prices softened slightly over the past fortnight, while the import premium on petrol dropped by nearly one-third — from about $9.70 to $6.75 per barrel — as regional tensions eased.
The government is currently collecting about Rs98 per litre on both petrol and diesel through various levies, despite maintaining a zero rate of general sales tax (GST) on all petroleum products. This includes Rs77.01 per litre on diesel and Rs78.02 per litre on petrol and high-octane products as petroleum levy and climate support levy (CSL), of which Rs2.25 per litre is attributed to CSL alone.
In addition, Rs20-21 per litre is being charged as customs duty on both fuels, regardless of whether they are imported or locally refined. Distribution and dealer margins account for another Rs17 per litre.
Petrol and HSD remain the government’s main petroleum revenue sources, with combined monthly sales of around 700,000-800,000 tonnes. In contrast, kerosene demand stands at just 10,000 tonnes per month. The government collected Rs1.161 trillion through petroleum levy in 2024-25 and projects a 27pc increase — reaching Rs1.470tr — in the current fiscal year.
Ogra slashes LPG price by Rs17.7 per kg
Earlier, Ogra reduced the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs17.7 per kilogramme.
Last month, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of LPG by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1 per cent for July. The new price for 11.8kg cylinder was Rs2,750.6 for July, against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said that the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.
In a notification from the regulator today, available with Dawn.com, Ogra set the new consumer price for an 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,541.36 for August, compared to Rs2,750.6 last month. The maximum consumer price for LPG per kg was set at Rs215.37.
These prices will go into effect on August 1 (Friday).
The prices “shall be regulated as the maximum LPG price at all levels of the supply chain for indigenous as well as imported LPG”, Ogra said.
The notification also showed that the new producer price for an 11.8kg cylinder stood at Rs2,054.02.
This is the third month in a row where LPG prices have fallen, with an 11.8kg cylinder costing Rs2,892.91 in May, Rs2,838.31 in June and Rs2,750.6 in July.
Earlier this month, a parliamentary panel expressed concern over the “poor regulatory environment” in the petroleum sector, observing that lives were in danger after an official disclosure that almost half of a total of 2,000 bowsers handling LPG have not been registered anywhere.
Of an estimated 2,000 bowsers in operation, only 800 are registered with the Department of Explosives and just 247 have licences issued by Ogra. This points to a significant oversight lapse, the participants observed.</p><small>2025-07-31 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/312301520230288.jpg?r=230546' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927843/indian-state-refiners-pause-russian-oil-purchases-in-wake-of-trump-warning' target='_blank'><strong>Indian state refiners pause Russian oil purchases in wake of Trump warning</strong></a><br><p>Indian state refiners have stopped buying Russian oil in the past week as discounts narrowed this month and United States President Donald Trump warned countries not to purchase oil from Moscow, industry sources said.
India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, is the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian crude, a vital revenue earner for Russia as it wages war in Ukraine for a fourth year.
The country’s state refiners — Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Mangalore Refinery Petrochemical Ltd (MRPL)  — have not sought Russian crude in the past week or so, four sources familiar with the refiners’ purchase plans told Reuters.
IOC, BPCL, HPCL, MRPL and the federal oil ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The four refiners regularly buy Russian oil on a delivered basis and have turned to spot markets for replacement supply — mostly Middle Eastern grades such as Abu Dhabi’s Murban crude and West African oil, sources said.
Private refiners Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy, majority owned by Russian entities, including oil major Rosneft, have annual deals with Moscow and are the biggest Russian oil buyers in India.
On July 14, Trump threatened 100 per cent tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil unless Moscow reaches a major peace deal with Ukraine.
Indian refiners are pulling back from Russian crude as discounts shrink to their lowest since 2022, when Western sanctions were first imposed on Moscow, due to lower Russian exports and steady demand, sources said.
Refiners fear the latest EU curbs could complicate overseas trade, including fundraising — even for buyers adhering to the price cap. India has reiterated its opposition to “unilateral sanctions”.
Trump on Wednesday announced a 25pc tariff on goods imported from India from August 1, but added that negotiations were ongoing. He also warned of potential penalties for the purchase of Russian arms and oil.
On Monday, Trump cut the deadline to impose secondary sanctions on buyers of Russian exports to 10-12 days from the previous 50-day period, if Moscow does not agree to a peace deal with Ukraine.
Russia is the top supplier to India, responsible for about 35pc of India’s overall supplies.
Private refiners bought nearly 60pc of India’s average 1.8 million barrels per day of Russian oil imports in the first half of 2025, while state refiners that control over 60pc of India’s overall 5.2m bpd refining capacity bought the remainder.
Reliance purchased Abu Dhabi Murban crude for loading in October this month, an unusual move by the refiner, traders said.</p><small>2025-07-31 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/31203329bf120f4.png?r=213439' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927831/authorities-abandon-recovery-of-german-mountaineer-laura-dahlmeiers-body-at-gbs-laila-peak' target='_blank'><strong>Authorities abandon recovery of German mountaineer Laura Dahlmeier’s body at GB’s Laila Peak</strong></a><br><p>Authorities abandoned efforts on Thursday to recover the body of German Olympic biathlete Laura Dahlmeier, who died in a mountaineering accident while attempting to scale Gilgit-Baltistan’s Laila Peak.
Dahlmeier was confirmed dead on Wednesday, having been hit by falling rocks while climbing at an altitude of 5,700 metres on Laila Peak in the Karakoram range.
Attempts to recover her body were abandoned due to “dangerous” conditions at the site, Dahlmeier’s management agency said on Thursday.
In consultation with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the agency said her relatives would “continue to monitor the situation … and are keeping the option of arranging a rescue at a later date”.
Several of Dahlmeier’s colleagues confirmed the two-time Olympic gold medallist had said she did not want her body recovered if it put any would-be rescuers at risk.
German mountaineer Thomas Huber was part of a team that had attempted a rescue but told reporters on Thursday: “We have decided she should stay, because that was her wish.”
Another member of the rescue team, American Jackson Marvell, told AFP it would be “disrespectful” to recover her body contrary to her wishes.
Marvell said, “The recovery of Laura’s body will be possible, but it involves incredible risks, both on foot and by helicopter.”
Dahlmeier’s climbing partner, Marina Krauss, who was with her at the time of the incident, said at a press conference on Thursday that the former Olympian did not move after being caught in a rockfall.
“I saw Laura being hit by a huge rock and then being thrown against the wall. And from that moment on, she didn’t move again,” Krauss told reporters.
Krauss said she was unable to reach Dahlmeier and called for outside support.
“It was impossible for me to get there safely.
“It was clear to me that the only way to help her was to call a helicopter. She didn’t move, she didn’t show any signs [of movement]. I called out to her, but there was no response.”
“She only had a chance if help arrived immediately,” she said.
Dahlmeier won seven world championship gold medals, and at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, she became the first woman biathlete to win both the sprint and the pursuit at the same Games.
Dahlmeier retired from professional competition in 2019 at the age of 25.</p><small>2025-07-31 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616721-pakistan-determined-to-root-out-scourge-of-terrorism-says-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan determined to root out scourge of terrorism, says PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

Established in 1971, USC was an SOE tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households. It operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide.
According to a USC notification from the Ministry of Industries and Production, available with Dawn.com, the decision was taken in compliance with directives issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on June 28 and a meeting of the board of directors earlier this month.
“All the sales and purchases at utility stores have been closed with effect from July 31, except shifting of stock from stores to warehouses and returned to vendors and handing-taking of stores’ inventories,” the notification reads, instructing strict compliance with the order.
Additionally, sales through the business-management suite Odoo have been permanently discontinued as of today, a second USC notification read.
“All point of sale systems connected with Odoo will be rendered inactive across all stores effective July 31,” the notice read. “No store in charge or designated official is authorised to conduct any sales through the Odoo system after this date. Additionally, no procurement transactions shall be initiated through Odoo either.”
According to the notification, the Odoo system will only be utilised for inventory reconciliation and record maintenance and any attempt to carry out sales or purchase transactions after today will be treated as “a serious violation of official policy”.
It added that “any employee found conducting or facilitating sales or purchases through Odoo after July 31 shall be held personally responsible, and strict disciplinary action will be initiated under USC rules.”
According to the finance ministry’s Federal SOE Performance Overview for the first half of FY25, USC posted a loss of Rs4.1 billion over six months, with cumulative losses rising to Rs15.5bn — highlighting persistent structural and operational challenges.
In January, the federal cabinet formed a high-level committee to develop a comprehensive strategy for the prompt shutdown of USC operations nationwide. The committee was tasked with determining a plan for the immediate closure of the USC, as well as arrangements for placing permanent USC employees in the surplus pool or absorption against existing vacancies in other federal government organisations.
The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed in April that under the restructuring plan of USC, 1,203 Utility Stores were closed while 2,237 employees were laid off.</p><small>2025-07-31 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3114475449f73b5.jpg?r=145013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802/may-9-riots-faisalabad-atc-sentences-omar-ayub-shibli-faraz-and-other-pti-leaders-to-10-years-in-jail' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and other PTI leaders to 10 years in jail</strong></a><br><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Faisalabad on Thursday sentenced PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza, and Zartaj Gul Wazir, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Out of 185 PTI workers accused, 108 have been sentenced by the court today.  PTI’s Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), Junaid Afzal Sahi, was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Zain Qureshi, and former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry have been acquitted in the cases.
Reacting to the development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party will challenge the decision in the high courts.
Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Gohar said: “We will raise the issue with PTI Founder Imran Khan on the future course of action regarding whether we should return to the parliament or launch a movement.”
He said that the “political cases against PTI members were baseless”, adding that the PTI believed in running the system instead of believing in extremism.
“We do not believe in violence or incitement in politics. Those who have been convicted today do not believe in politics of violence.”
According to a copy of the court order — available with Dawn.com — “the prosecution has successfully proved its case without any shadow of doubt” against 17 of the accused, including the opposition leaders and Zartaj Gul. They were sentenced to:


10 years rigorous imprisonment, Rs1 million fine under Section 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC)


10 years of rigorous imprisonment, Rs 1m fine under Section 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) read with Section 34 PPC

According to the order, the 108 convicts will receive copies of the order and will be able to file an appeal within 15 days. Additionally, arrest warrants have been issued for those convicted in absentia, including Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Rai Murtaza Iqbal and Zartaj Gul.
Meanwhile, 77 accused were acquitted because the prosecution “miserably failed to prove the alleged offence”.
In a post on X, the PTI condemned the sentences in the strongest terms and branded the cases “false, fabricated, and politically motivated”, adding that the opposition leaders in both houses were sentenced to prevent the party’s mass mobilisation on August 5.
“Through this decision, six of our National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members and one senator have been sentenced,” the party stated. “This decision is not only a clear violation of the Constitution and the law but also another dark stain on the face of justice.
“The judiciary’s continuous transformation into a rubber stamp at the behest of the state system, issuing such grave verdicts one after another under political pressure without transparent trials, evidence, cross-examination of witnesses, or the right to defence, is a dangerous trend that is completely undermining the credibility of the judicial system,” the statement added.
The PTI added that this is the “first time” opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced “solely based on their loyalty to Imran Khan’s political narrative, public representation, and constitutional struggle”.
“The real purpose of these decisions is not to deliver legal justice but to make a concerted effort to prevent the public protest scheduled for August 5, which was announced by Imran Khan himself,” the party claimed.
 






“Today’s sentences and the warrants issued against several other leaders this morning are all links in the chain of fear that the state system harbours toward Imran Khan’s peaceful public movement.”
Moreover, the party branded the sentences “part of a systematic plan aimed at suppressing the public awakening and political consciousness emerging under Imran Khan’s leadership”.
However, the PTI wrote that these sentences only ignited their resolve, ahead of the protests slated for August 5.
“Imran Khan’s vision lives in our hearts, and our loyalty to it remains unwavering.
Our leaders and workers are ready for every sacrifice, because we believe that only those nations survive the darkness of oppression that resist,” the statement read.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan deplored the mass sentencing.
“While those involved in violence must be held accountable, the use of anti-terror laws to try civilians raises serious due-process concerns and is symptomatic of the continued erosion of democratic values. We reiterate that all those accused must receive fair, transparent trials in civilian courts and urge the state to refrain from using draconian laws to stifle political dissent.”
 






In May, an ATC in Islamabad sentenced PTI members, including MNA Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the May 9 riots.
In December 2024, military courts had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.
