According to the latest updates, the fire is yet to be put out while a rescue operation is still under way, hours after the fire erupted.
Initially, Dr Sabir Memon, executive director of the Civil Hospital trauma centre, said three dead bodies had been brought to the facility. He said that all three were dead when they were brought to the hospital.
On Sunday morning, South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn the death toll had risen to five.
Separately, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan also confirmed the death toll to Dawn, further stating that 20 people had been injured in the incident.
As of early Sunday morning, he said, the fire had been controlled up to 30 per cent.
The rescue service spokesperson said there were around 1,200 shops in the mall. “There are goods such as crockery, clothes, electrical appliances, cosmetics and perfumes in various shops, due to which the fire intensified.”
Khan added that on Sunday morning, 20 fire tenders from different departments and institutions were being employed to extinguish the blaze.
“But the building appears very old, and there is a danger that its structure may fall anytime because of the impact of the fire. Thus, the rescue operation is being carried out with extreme caution,” he said.
He earlier told Dawn that the fire had erupted in shops located on the building’s ground floor.
Edhi, which is also participating in the rescue operation, said in a statement that a part of the part had collapsed due to the intensity of the fire.
Garden Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Mohsin Raza said in a statement on Saturday night that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit at one of the shops, before spreading to the entire mall.
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, expressing concern over the incident, ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations, according to a statement from his office.
He also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed officials to divert traffic in the area to alternative routes for the safe passage of citizens.
In a statement, he said that the cause of the fire should be ascertained through a thorough investigation. He said that the building should be secured so that the fire does not spread.
The minister said the routes should be cleared so that fire brigade vehicles could access the scene.
A Sindh Rangers spokesperson said in a statement that personnel had been deployed to the scene of the incident.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in rescue activities and rescue operations along with the fire brigade staff,” the statement, which was issued shortly after the fire erupted, said. “Officers and personnel will remain at the scene until the rescue operation is completed.”
The statement further read that in addition to aiding in rescue operations, a contingent of Rangers had been deployed to cordon off the building for the safety of civilians and to ensure traffic flow.
“Alongside fire tenders, Rangers personnel are evacuating trapped people and ensuring the safety of valuables,” the statement read, adding that protecting lives and preventing the fire from further spreading was a top priority.
The development comes a day after at least 20 containers, mostly containing electrical batteries, were destroyed as a huge fire erupted at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on Friday afternoon.

MUZAFFARABAD: The Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) has accused the government of violating a landmark agreement signed in October last year and has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene, citing serious delays in implementation and expressing concern over the induction of a “controversial figure” into the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) ahead of the upcoming elections in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

 

In an open letter addressed to the prime minister on Saturday, the JAAC said the agreement was signed on October 3–4, 2025, following deadly protests in late September that claimed several lives. A high-powered delegation from Islamabad, dispatched on the premier’s directives, had visited Muzaffarabad and concluded what the committee described as a historic accord, reassuring the people of AJK of Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding their legitimate rights.
However, the committee alleged that the agreement had been repeatedly breached. It pointed out that the final clause required meetings of the negotiating committee to be held every 15 days, followed by the issuance of an official communiqué. Over the subsequent three months, however, only two meetings were held, on October 21 and November 4. A third meeting scheduled for January 5 this year was boycotted by the JAAC.
The committee also highlighted delays and shortcomings in the implementation of the Health Card Scheme. Although funds were released after a delay of more than 100 days, many major local hospitals in AJK were not included in the State Life Insurance Corporation’s panel. This, it said, would force even poor patients to travel to Rawalpindi or Islamabad for treatment, undermining the utility of the scheme.
Referring to compensation for victims of the protests, the JAAC said the agreement promised financial compensation equivalent to law enforcement allowances for those killed on October 1 and 2, Rs1 million for each gunshot injury, and a government job for a family member of each deceased person within 20 days.
“However, this clause has yet to be fully implemented, which amounts to a serious breach of the agreement,” the letter stated.
The committee further said that FIRs registered against JAAC members and members of the public between May 9, 2023, and October 4, 2025, were to be withdrawn under the agreement, but the issue remained unresolved. It added that young people continued to face difficulties in obtaining police character certificates, while several individuals seeking employment abroad had been offloaded from flights and arrested after being placed on exit and passport control lists, causing financial losses and mental distress.
The JAAC also accused the authorities of violating another clause calling for the formation of a high-powered committee to review the issue of AJK Assembly members elected from constituencies outside the territory. It said the committee’s formation had been unjustifiably delayed, while MLAs elected on refugee seats were granted parliamentary privileges and standing committee positions. The committee further alleged that non-residents continued to be admitted to educational institutions under refugee quotas, in violation of the agreement.
Expressing alarm over political developments ahead of the forthcoming AJK elections, the JAAC strongly criticised the PML-N for inducting Saqib Majeed, whom it accused of opening fire on peaceful protesters in Muzaffarabad on September 29, 2025, killing three people and injuring dozens. The committee said the incident had triggered widespread protests and clashes across AJK, resulting in further loss of life.
It noted that Mr Majeed, the son-in-law of Muslim Conference chief Sardar Attique Ahmed Khan and a former chief organiser of the party, was now being given political cover by the PML-N, a move it said had generated strong resentment across the region.
The JAAC said it had boycotted the negotiation process in protest against Mr Majeed’s inclusion in the PML-N and urged the prime minister to take personal interest in the matter, hold the local PML-N leadership accountable, and reconsider the party’s decision to induct what it described as an individual responsible for killing peaceful demonstrators.

Light snowfall was recorded in parts of Skardu, Kharmang, Shigar, Ghanche, Astore and Ghizer on Friday and Saturday. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast further rain and snowfall in several areas until Jan 23.
Officials said Skardu received about two to three inches of snow on Saturday, while parts of Ghizer saw intermittent snowfall over the past two days.
Light snow was also reported in Hunza, Nagar and other areas last week, but residents said most valleys remained dry, with mountains largely bare and rocky.

Experts warn ‘snow drought’ could worsen flood risk downstream

Muhammad Ali Alam, a resident of Skardu, said the region typically received heavy snowfall by mid-January. “The mountains should be snow-clad by now, but the first snow of the season in Skardu and adjoining areas only fell on Friday,” he told Dawn. He said residents had observed later and lower snowfall over the past two years.
Karim Hayat, a resident of Hussaini village in Upper Hunza’s Gojal valley, said snowfall usually began in late November.
“It is alarming that we are facing a snow drought till January,” he said, adding that the light snow on surrounding peaks would melt quickly in the sun. He also said temperatures remained unusually high until the end of December.
Saeed Farooqi from the Tirashig area of Astore said the district would normally be blanketed in snow by this time. “This year, the area remained dry through January,” he said.
Experts said a shift in winter patterns had been observed across GB in recent years, with snowfall starting later, the areas receiving less snow and temperatures remaining higher than usual.
Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn the region’s fragile ecosystem was being disturbed by climate change and environmental degradation.
He said snowfall had increasingly shifted to mid-January and February, reducing the chance of snow compacting and turning into ice on mountains and glaciers.
“Late snowfall does not compact and can melt rapidly when the summer season starts, which increases the risk of floods downstream,” he said.
Mr Hussain said climate change was a major driver of the shift, but local factors were also contributing. He cited deforestation, unplanned construction of roads and other infrastructure, the influx of tourism and increasing human activity near glaciers.
“Greenhouse emissions, increasing traffic discharge emissions in the fragile environment, human settlements near glaciers, burning of tyres, animal dung and cutting of forests for firewood impacted glaciated areas,” he said.
He said uncontrolled population and increasing human activities in environmentally sensitive areas also contributed to the weather pattern change in the area.
Citing data collected by GBEPA, he said the average temperature in GB rose by about 0.6 degrees Celsius between 1987 and 2013. He said the region had faced a rise in flash floods, accelerated glacial melt and other climate-linked hazards in recent years.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump escalated his bid to acquire Greenland on Saturday, threatening tariffs of up to 25 per cent on eight European nations until his purchase of the Danish territory is achieved.
Trump aimed the threat at Denmark and fellow NATO members who have deployed troops to the mineral-rich territory in recent days. The ultimatum threatens to create unprecedented tension within the alliance.
Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump announced that starting Feb 1, all goods sent to the United States from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would be subject to a 10 per cent tariff.
“On June 1st, 2026, the Tariff will be increased to 25pc. This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump wrote.
The US president argued that the European nations are “playing this very dangerous game” and have introduced unsustainable risks.
“Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question,” he added.
It was not immediately clear what legal authority the president would invoke to impose the levies. Since returning to office, Trump has frequently utilised sweeping tariffs to combat what the administration labels unfair trade practices and to press foreign governments on US interests.
The president has repeatedly claimed the US “needs” Greenland for national security reasons and that Denmark is incapable of ensuring the defence of the island, which is home to 57,000 people and sits at the strategic gateway to the Arctic.
European NATO members recently deployed troops to Greenland for military exercises. France stated the mission was designed to demonstrate a commitment to defending the territory. Denmark confirmed the US had been invited to participate in those exercises.
Trump characterised the resistance from European allies as a threat to global stability, warning that the nations opposing the deal “have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.”
Protests in the Arctic
Trump’s announcement coincided with mass demonstrations on Saturday in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, and across Denmark. Thousands of protesters joined Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen in Nuuk, waving flags and chanting slogans under light rain.
Many demonstrators wore caps reading “Make America Go Away” — a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.
“We don’t want Trump invading Greenland, that is the message,” said Paarniq Larsen Strum, a 44-year-old nurse at the rally. She described the geopolitical stand-off as “nerve-wracking.”
Opposition to the US annexation plan is widespread among residents. A poll published in January 2025 showed 85pc of Greenlanders oppose joining the United States, with only 6pc in favour.
“We demand respect for our country’s right to self-determination and for us as a people,” said Avijaja Rosing-Olsen, an organiser of the demonstration. “This is not only our struggle, it is a struggle that concerns the entire world.”
The situation spurred groups like Uagut, an association of Greenlanders in Denmark, to mobilise. Organisers said their aim was “to send a clear and unified message of respect for Greenland’s democracy and fundamental human rights”. In a display of cultural unity, demonstrators chanted traditional Inuit songs, rejecting the view of their homeland as merely a strategic asset to be bought or sold.
Allies push back
In Copenhagen, protesters showed solidarity, waving Danish and Greenlandic flags and chanting “Kalaallit Nunaat”, the island’s name in Greenlandic.
“You cannot be bullied by an ally. It’s about international law,” said Kirsten Hjoernholm, a 52-year-old charity worker at the protest.
Some placards read “USA already has too much ICE”, a reference to Trump’s deployment of armed immigration officers in US cities.
The dispute occurred as a delegation of US lawmakers, led by Democratic Sen Chris Coons, visited the region for talks with Greenlandic and Danish politicians. Coons told reporters that Trump’s stance was misguided and not supported by the majority of Americans.
Coons insisted there was no security threat justifying the administration’s aggressive posture.
“There are legitimate reasons for us to explore ways to invest better in Arctic security broadly, both in the American Arctic and in our Nato partners and allies,” Coons said.

Mehmood Khan Achakzai

• Newly appointed NA opposition leader terms preventing Imran from meeting his family a violation of fundamental rights• Urges political parties to decide whether ‘voice of majority’ or ‘undemocratic forces’ will be supreme
SANN (Jamshoro): The leader of the country’s main opposition alliance believes that there can only be talks if the other side realises that excesses have been committed that need to be redressed.
Dawn caught up with Mehmood Khan Achakzai, the newly-appointed Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, at the residence of Syed Zain Shah on Saturday, where he had arrived to attend the 122nd birth anniversary celebrations of G.M. Syed.
However, Mr Achakzai made it clear that he was speaking in his ca­­pacity as leader of the Tehreek Tah­afuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance.
“I haven’t yet received the notification, that’s why I will comment as TTAP leader,” he said in response to a question about how he would manifest his role as the opposition leader in the assembly.
On the subject of possible talks with the rulers to defuse prevailing political tensions, Mr Achakzai said, “If someone has the realisation that excesses have been committed, then there is recourse and treatment too. Let’s then talk.”
The TTAP leader was adamant that denying Imran Khan’s family access to him was a violation of fundamental rights, basic ethics, and humanity.
Questioned about Rana Sanaul­lah’s claim that while PTI leaders want negotiations, but Mr Khan does­n’t, Mr Achakzai posed a counter-question: “Talks on what issue? If someone robs the home of Saeen [Zain Shah] and loots everyone,” he said, gesturing towards his surro­undings, “then talks will be held [with the robbers] to recover the looted goods”.
He said everyone knows it was Imran Khan who won the elections with a resounding majority, and the fact that the most popular leader in the country was not even being al­­lowed to meet his family while in prison, was deplorable.
“A car can be invented, not a political leader. A leader emerges from amongst the masses,” he said.
Talking about his bitter past with the incarcerated PTI founder, he said it was no longer an issue since he and MWM chief Raja Nasir Abbas had joined hands with Mr Khan when he was in trouble.
While his associates are being punished or offered bribes, “I am one of those jumping in to help people in trouble”, he said.
Mr Achakzai urged major political parties to generate a consensus on a few crucial things — Pakistan being a federation; constitutional supremacy; parliament to serve as a bastion of power and to frame external and internal policies; people of federating units to have first right over their resources; and, respect for their languages and cultures.
“There should be talks whether Jamhoor (the people) will be supre­­me or the undemocratic forces,” he opined. He said that Pakistan was a pluralist state where people’s languages and cultures should be respected. Injustices engender hate and this leads to conflict, he said.
He was of the view that ever since the inception of Pakistan, civilian authority had not been allowed to establish itself.
On whether 26th and 27th Amend­ments served democracy, he said: “Many believe there has been constitutional demise in their wake. Two judges, who are supposed to interpret the Constitution, resigned. The judiciary’s wings are clipped, journalism is banned. Now, parliament is no longer even a debating society. To date, nothing has been brought before parliament for debate.”
He noted that a single individual could not handle the current situation. “Collective wisdom” could work.
“The TTAP was formed because we had foreseen then that this parliament [after the Feb 8 polls] will come after the Constitution, because everything is being done through the assembly,” he said, recalling that after Gen Ayub Khan’s martial law, parliament had passed a two-line resolution to forgive him for his crimes.

According to an official of the polio laboratory located at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, as many as 127 sewage samples from 87 districts were tested for the presence of poliovirus in December 2025. Of these, 87 samples tested negative, while 40 samples were found positive for poliovirus.
“As many as 23 samples were collected from Balochistan, of which 21 were found negative and two were found positive. A total of 34 samples were collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, of which 26 were negative and eight were found positive. From Punjab, 31 samples were collected, of which 25 were negative and six were positive. In Sindh, six samples were found negative and 23 were positive. In Islamabad, one out of five samples was found positive. However, five samples collected from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan were found negative,” the official said.
Replying to a question, the official explained that if the virus causing the crippling disease was found in sewage, the sample was termed positive, while the paralysis of a child caused by the virus was recorded as a positive case. “A sewage water sample from an area is a basic parameter used to determine whether polio vaccination campaigns are being carried out successfully. After detection of positive samples, polio campaigns are immediately launched to eradicate the virus from the area,” he said.
“A polio case can be reported in any city due to the frequent movement of people from one city to another, but the presence of the virus in sewage water means that a vaccination campaign in the area did not meet its target. The presence of the virus in sewage water also indicates that the immunity level of local children has fallen and that they are at risk of the disease,” the official explained.
According to a statement, in 2025 the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, led by the government of Pakistan, conducted six vaccination campaigns, including five nationwide and one subnational drive, reaching over 45 million children.
As part of this roadmap, the first nationwide polio campaign of 2026 will be conducted from February 2 to 8 in all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children under the age of five.
“To further strengthen immunity, the government of Pakistan continues to provide free routine immunisation services for all children up to two years of age. Together, routine immunisation and repeated polio vaccination provide the strongest and most reliable protection against polio and other preventable diseases.
Parents and caregivers are strongly urged to en­­sure that children under five re­­ceive polio drops during every vaccination campaign to protect them from lifelong disability,” it stated.

The announcements from those leaders came after the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel.
Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory, which lies in rubble after two-plus years of relentless Israeli bombardment.
The moves came after a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue.
In Canada, a senior aide to Prime Minister Mark Carney said he intended to accept Trump’s invitation, while in Turkiye, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had been asked to become a “founding member” of the board.
Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said Cairo was “studying” a request for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to join.
Sharing an image of the invitation letter, Argentine President Javier Milei wrote on X that it would be “an honor” to participate in the initiative.







Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the heads of state of around 60 countries had recieved the charter of Trump’s proposed ‘Board of Peace’.
The document was sent to 60 heads of state — including in Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia — along with an invitation to join the board, the publication reported while quoting diplomatic sources.
According to the document, the board will work to “restore dependable and lawful governance and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” in place of other organisations, the report said.
“The charter also implicitly criticises the UN. It opens with emphasising the need for ‘a more nimble and effective international peace-building body’, adding that durable peace requires ‘the courage to depart from … institutions that have too often failed’,” the report added.
Meanwhile, in a statement sent to AFP, Blair said: “I thank President Trump for his leadership in establishing the Board of Peace and am honored to be appointed to its Executive Board.”
Blair is a controversial figure in the Middle East because of his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Trump himself said last year that he wanted to make sure Blair was an “acceptable choice to everybody”.
Blair spent years focused on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as representative of the “Middle East Quartet” — the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia — after leaving Downing Street in 2007.
The White House said the Board of Peace will take on issues such as “governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding and capital mobilisation”.
The other members of the board so far are World Bank President Ajay Banga, an Indian-born American businessman; billionaire US financier Marc Rowan; and Robert Gabriel, a loyal Trump aide who serves on the US National Security Council.
Trump has created a second “Gaza executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role.
It was not immediately clear which world leaders were asked to be on each board.
The White House, which said on Friday that additional members would be named to both entities, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Israel objects to line-up of Gaza governing body
Separately, Israel said on Saturday it objected to the line-up of the Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern post-war Gaza, which began its work in Cairo this week.
“The announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy,” said a statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“The prime minister has instructed the foreign affairs minister to contact the US secretary of state on this matter,” it added.
Israel strikes
Washington has said the Gaza plan had gone on to a second phase — from implementing the ceasefire to disarming Hamas.
On Friday, Trump named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to head the International Stabilisation Force, which will be tasked with providing security in Gaza and training a new police force to succeed Hamas.
Jeffers, from special operations in US Central Command, in late 2024 was put in charge of monitoring a ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, which has continued periodic strikes aimed at Hezbollah militants.
Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath was earlier tapped to head the governing committee.
Trump, a real estate developer, has previously mused about turning devastated Gaza into a Riviera-style area of resorts, although he has backed away from calls to forcibly displace the population.</p><small>2026-01-17 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1718270443769f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967495/u-19-world-cup-no-handshake-between-india-and-bangladesh-at-toss-but-players-shake-hands-after-game' target='_blank'><strong>U-19 World Cup: No handshake between India and Bangladesh at toss but players shake hands after game</strong></a><br><p>The captains of India and Bangladesh skipped the customary handshake during the toss of their U-19 World Cup match but the two sides did shake hands at the end of the game, which the former won.
At the toss, Bangladesh’s acting captain Zawad Abrar and India’s captain Ayush Mhatre did not do the customary handshake at the pre-match toss, which the former won.







“There were, however, handshakes between the teams at the end of the game, which India won by 18 runs (DLS method),” ESPN Cricinfo reported.
The report also quoted a statement from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) as saying that the “absence of a handshake with the opposition captain was completely unintentional and resulted from a momentary lapse in concentration”.
“There was no intent whatsoever to show discourtesy or disregard towards the opposition,” the report quoted the BCB as saying in a statement.
“The board has viewed the matter with due seriousness, as upholding the spirit of cricket and respect for opponents is a fundamental prerequisite for representing Bangladesh at any level and immediately advised the team management accordingly,” the BCB was quoted as saying.
“The players have also been reminded of their responsibility to maintain the highest standards of sportsmanship, camaraderie and mutual respect in all interactions with opposing teams,” it added.
It is worth mentioning that Indian cricketers had refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during last year’s Asia Cup matches, in the aftermath of a military conflict between the two countries.
Saturday’s development comes as Bangladesh has announced that it will not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team.
Mustafizur, who has played in the IPL for other teams in previous editions, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million. His sacking sparked fury in Dhaka.
Subsequently, Bangladesh “formally requested” the International Cricket Council to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
Earlier this week, during a video conference with the ICC, the BCB said it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.
Political relations between India and Bangladesh had soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.</p><small>2026-01-17 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1721570533aaf16.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967502/inquiry-committee-formed-to-probe-karachi-port-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Inquiry committee formed to probe Karachi port fire</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Maritime Affairs on Saturday constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the cause of a fire at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT) a day earlier.
Imported goods, mostly lithium batteries, stored in at least 20 containers were destroyed as a huge fire erupted at the KICT at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on Friday afternoon, according to officials.
A press release issued on Saturday said that Maritime Affairs Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry had constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the cause of the fire and to “fix responsibility to prevent similar incidents in the future”.
The committee will comprise senior officers from KPT, who will coordinate with KICT operators to determine the reasons for the incident, it said.
“KICT is a private terminal and the primary responsibility for safety measures at the container terminal rests with its administration,” the minister was quoted as saying.
The press release further said the minister took immediate notice of the incident and directed all concerned officials, including KPT Chairman Rear Admiral (retd) Shahid Ahmed, to utilise all available resources to bring the blaze under control and also sought a detailed report on the incident.
The statement said the KPT team supervised the firefighting operation and brought the fire under control, adding that no loss of life was reported.
It added that the minister also announced appreciation certificates for members of the KPT team involved in the firefighting operation, and particularly lauded the role of KPT General Manager (Engineering) Rear Admiral Kashif Munir and his team.
He added that the extent of financial losses and the exact cause of the fire were yet to be determined, and that investigations were ongoing, the statement said.
The statement also said that a report by KPT was submitted on the directives of the minister. According to the report, the fire erupted at around 1:35pm near Berth Number 27 at KICT Terminal, Karachi Port.
The incident was reported to KPT Central Fire Brigade and fire tenders were dispatched to the scene, the statement said.
“Upon arrival, it was observed that the fire/smoke was spreading quickly in the closely placed set of containers which were also placed on one another [sic],” it said.
It said that KPT fire tenders responded effectively in containing the fire, while support was also requested from the Pakistan Navy, the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works and Rescue 1122.
“The report stated a total of eight fire tenders from KPT were deployed on-site, supported by four fire tenders from the Pakistan Navy, one from Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works and two fire tenders from Rescue 1122,” it added.
“Through swift action, effective coordination, and professional handling by all responding teams, the fire was successfully brought under control, preventing its spread and ensuring the safety of port infrastructure and operations,” the press release said.
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Friday that during the initial probe, it emerged that the fire erupted due to a short circuit inside a container.</p><small>2026-01-17 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17213017ccd8b72.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967501/india-fines-indigo-record-245m-after-december-flight-cancellations' target='_blank'><strong>India fines IndiGo record $2.45m after December flight cancellations</strong></a><br><p>India’s aviation regulator on Saturday fined IndiGo a record 222 million Indian rupees ($2.45m) for poor pilot roster planning that led to mass flight cancellations in December.
The regulator also issued warnings to senior personnel, including to Chief Operating Officer Isidre Porqueras and to Jason Herter, senior vice president of operations control centre, with directions to IndiGo to relieve Herter “of current operational responsibilities”.
A government source said the fine was the largest to date.
IndiGo has been ordered to provide a bank guarantee of $5.51m in favour of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, to ensure “compliance with the directives and long-term systemic correction,” the regulator said.
IndiGo said in a statement that the board and management were “committed to taking full cognisance of the orders and will, in a thoughtful and timely manner, take appropriate measures”.
India’s largest airline cancelled about 4,500 flights in the initial weeks of December, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded all over the country and leading to chaos at airports.</p><small>2026-01-17 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17204821ed720ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967500/speaker-sadiq-says-statements-against-pakistan-armed-forces-will-not-be-allowed-in-national-assembly' target='_blank'><strong>Speaker Sadiq says statements against Pakistan, armed forces will not be allowed in National Assembly</strong></a><br><p>Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Saturday said that statements against Pakistan, the judiciary or the armed forces would not be allowed on the floor of the National Assembly.
According to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat, the speaker made the remarks while visiting the National College of Arts (NCA) in Lahore.







“Negative or controversial remarks on the role of the judiciary, the armed forces of Pakistan and judges are unacceptable,” he said. He further stated that any kind of remarks against the armed forces was “intolerable”.
He further stated that only those remarks that fell within the ambit of the law and the Constitution would be allowed.
“Those who speak against Pakistan will not be allowed to express their views on the floor of the National Assembly,” he was quoted as saying.
Sadiq further asserted that as the NA speaker, he would continue to play an impartial role.
He further said that in a democratic society, protesting was a citizen’s right. However, this protest should be peaceful and remain within the ambit of the law and the Constitution, he said.
“There is no room for arson, damage to life and property or vandalism,” Sadiq was quoted as saying, adding that the “use of sticks and weapons” was a threat to the rule of law.
The development comes a little over a month after Senate Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasar barred criticism of “national heroes” and political leadership in the House.
“You cannot speak against political heroes who suffered martyrdom, went into exile, worked for the nation and the country, conducted nuclear tests, and made [the] nuclear bomb,” he had remarked just after finishing the day’s agenda amid voices of dissent from the opposition benches.
He had later vowed to enforce his ruling. In an informal conversation with media persons at the Parliament House, he had made it clear that derogatory or disrespectful remarks against national heroes whether from the armed forces, politics, judiciary, or any national institution cannot be tolerated within the House.
“Every member has the right to express views, but that right must be exercised within the constitutional framework, rules of procedure, and established parliamentary traditions,” he had emphasised.</p><small>2026-01-17 16:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17202647d314670.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967491/incarcerated-pti-leaders-call-for-appointing-mwm-chief-abbas-opposition-leader-in-senate-immediately' target='_blank'><strong>Incarcerated PTI leaders call for appointing MWM chief Abbas opposition leader in Senate ‘immediately’</strong></a><br><p>Senior PTI leaders imprisoned in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail on Saturday demanded that Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas be appointed the Senate opposition leader immediately.
In a letter seen by Dawn, PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and Umar Sarfraz Cheema congratulated veteran politician Mehmood Khan Achakzai on his appointment as the opposition leader in the National Assembly after a months-long delay.
The letter was shared with the media by their counsel, Rana Mudassir.
The PTI leaders hoped Achakzai, under the guidance of party founder Imran Khan, would fulfil his responsibility in restoring democracy and the Constitution, ensuring the rule of law, the supremacy of the judiciary and the protection of the fundamental rights of the people and political workers.
They also hoped that Achakzai would hold consultations on lifting Pakistan out of the quagmire and economic crisis it has been dealing with for the past four years.
They noted that the government had appointed the NA opposition leader after much delay, adding that Nasir should be appointed the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament “immediately”.
Earlier in the day, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had also commented on the matter while speaking to Geo News in Lahore.
Asked when the Senate opposition leader would be appointed, he said: “That will also happen. The Senate chairman is serving as the acting president right now … Sherry Rehman chaired yesterday’s meeting.
“Once the Senate chairman returns, then this will also happen,” the minister added.
Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Achakzai was finally appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly on Friday — a slot that had been lying vacant for almost five months since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub.
Incarcerated PTI founder Imran had named Achakzai and Abbas for the opposition leader’s slot in the NA and the Senate, respectively, last year in August.
The Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan (ECP) had disqualified both the-then NA and Senate opposition leaders, Ayub and Shibli Faraz, respectively, in August following their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023 riots.</p><small>2026-01-17 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1719231961dbc5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967498/presidents-trophy-ptv-creates-world-record-for-lowest-target-defended-in-first-class-cricket' target='_blank'><strong>President’s Trophy: PTV creates world record for lowest target defended in first-class cricket</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Television (PTV) created a world record of defending the lowest target in all first-class cricket when they stopped the opposition in a chase of just 40 runs.
PTV, defending champions in the President’s Trophy, shot Sui Northern Gas (SNGPL) for a paltry 37 to win the match by a mere two runs on day three of the four-day game.
This becomes a new record in 253 years of first-class cricket, beating England’s Oldfield’s 1794 feat when they successfully defended 41 against MCC at the Lord’s Old Ground to win by six runs.







PTV’s head coach Mohammad Waseem praised his team’s historic effort.
“I am delighted with my team’s world record effort,” Waseem told AFP. “My team’s motto is to never give up, fight till the last ball,” he said.
“This is not the first time we have won all our three matches coming from well behind by remaining positive in all situations.”
The star-studded SNGPL batting led by Pakistan Test captain Shan Masood were bowled out in 19.4 overs with just one batter, Saifullah Bangash, crossing double figures with 14.
Masood was out without scoring while Test players, Mohammad Ali made six and spinner Sajid Khan just three.
Pakistan’s international players Omair Bin Yousuf made six and Abdul Samad five.
For the winners, left-arm spinner Ali Usman wrecked the batting with 6-9 and pacer Ammad Butt took 4-28 - the only two bowlers used in their second innings innings.
SNGPL’s head coach is former Pakistan Test skipper Misbahul Haq with another former captain Azhar Ali their batting coach.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar lauded the PTV team for their record win, saying: “Well done my boys! Kudos to you.”







“PTV’s rise is no coincidence,” he said, adding that “this is what happens when talent is backed, hard work is valued, and merit is rewarded”.
Tarar noted the previous as well as current success of the team was due to the importance of merit and refusal of favours. “Merit and only merit. Have refused all sifarish,” he said.
He said it was a proud moment for the entire PTV management.</p><small>2026-01-17 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171757243da7749.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967496/social-media-posts-case-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-for-imaan-hadi-reissued' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: Non-bailable arrest warrants for Imaan, Hadi reissued</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A district and sessions court on Saturday reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, for their repeated absences from trial proceedings.
In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
Court proceedings on Saturday were conducted over three sittings — 9am, noon and 2pm. At each stage, Imaan and Hadi were absent from the proceedings.
In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka — presiding over the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Court (Islamabad-West) — noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest.
At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad High Court.
The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused.
Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants.
The court ordered that once Imaan and Hadi were arrested, they could be produced via video link to join proceedings on Monday.
On Thursday, the same court had cancelled Imaan and Hadi’s bail following repeated absences and heated scenes in the courtroom.
The court had expressed displeasure over the conduct of the accused and the defence, revoked their right to cross-examination, and ordered that their statements under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) be recorded.
The prosecution, led by Special Public Prosecutor Rana Usman, had opposed adjournments, while the courtroom proceedings had been disrupted by a heated exchange between the prosecutor and Islamabad District Bar Association President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, prompting the judge to briefly rise from the bench.
The case will now be taken up on Monday, subject to the execution of the arrest warrants.
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-17 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171639590f69121.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967489/irans-khamenei-says-trump-guilty-for-the-casualties-in-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s Khamenei says Trump ‘guilty for the casualties’ in protests</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday accused US President Donald Trump of being responsible for “casualties” during a protest wave in the country that rights groups said was met with a deadly crackdown.
“We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,” he told a crowd of supporters during an address marking a religious holiday.
“This was an American conspiracy,” Khamenei said, adding that “America’s goal is to swallow Iran … the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination”.
“By God’s grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition,” he said.
“We do not intend to lead the country to war, but we will not spare domestic criminals,” he added, saying that “international criminals” were “worse” and would also not be spared punishment.
Iranian authorities have blamed the United States for fuelling a “terrorist operation” that they say hijacked peaceful protests over the economy.
Iran was rocked by weeks of demonstrations sparked by anger over economic hardship that exploded into the biggest protests against the Islamic republic in more than three years.
Meanwhile, after repeated warnings, Trump on Thursday had changed his stance on military intervention in Iran, adopting a “watch it and see” posture instead.
He had cited assurances from “very important sources on the other side” indicating that Tehran had ceased using lethal force against demonstrators.
“They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place,” Trump said. Asked by a reporter if US military action was now off the table, the president replied: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is.”</p><small>2026-01-17 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171644183f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967486/institutionalised-islamophobia-pakistan-condemns-profiling-of-mosques-in-occupied-kashmir' target='_blank'><strong>‘Institutionalised Islamophobia’: Pakistan condemns profiling of mosques in occupied Kashmir</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Saturday condemned the reported profiling of mosques and mosque management committees in India-occupied Kashmir, saying the “blatant intrusion into religious affairs constitutes a grave violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion and belief”.
The FO’s statement comes after police in the occupied valley distributed forms to “collect” financial and personal details of mosques and seminaries, including mosque leaders and members of management committees, according to a report by the Hindustan Times, which quoted local residents and Kashmiri leaders.







The action “reflects yet another coercive attempt to intimidate and marginalise the Muslim population of the occupied territory,” the FO said.
The forms included sections for seminary teachers and mosque leaders to provide details of their “Aadhaar cards, bank accounts, property ownership, social media handles, passport, ration card, driving licence, SIM cards and mobile phone model along with the IMEI”, the Hindustan Times reported. It added that details regarding the “religious sect” of the mosques were also sought.
A lawmaker from Srinagar called it “an infringement of the religious freedom guaranteed under the Indian Constitution,” saying the move aimed to “control religion and mosques”, the report said.
In the statement released on Saturday, the FO said, “The forcible collection of personal details, photographs and sectarian affiliations of religious functionaries amounts to systematic harassment, aimed at instilling fear among worshippers and obstructing the free exercise of their faith.
“These actions form part of a broader pattern of institutionalised Islamophobia driven by the Hindutva ideology of the occupying Indian government,” said the statement, adding the “selective targeting of mosques and Muslim clergy lays bare the discriminatory and communal character of these policies”.
The FO maintained that the “people of Jammu and Kashmir possess an inalienable right to practice their religion without fear, coercion or discrimination”.
“Pakistan will continue to stand in solidarity with them and will persist in raising its voice against all forms of religious persecution and intolerance targeting Kashmiris,” said the statement.
In November, United Nations experts sounded the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the Indian government, issuing the warning in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p><small>2026-01-17 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171838352b516f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967493/thousands-join-anti-trump-hands-off-greenland-protests-in-denmark' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands join anti-Trump ‘Hands off Greenland’ protests in Denmark</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of people took to the streets of Denmark’s capital on Saturday to protest at US President Donald Trump’s push to take over Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory.
The protest followed Trump’s warning on Friday that he “may put a tariff” on countries that oppose his plans to take over mineral-rich Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.
They also coincided with a visit to Copenhagen by a bipartisan delegation from the US Congress that has made clear the opposition of many Americans to the Trump administration’s sabre-rattling.
Waving the flags of Denmark and Greenland, the protesters formed a sea of red and white outside Copenhagen city hall, chanting “Kalaallit Nunaat!” — the vast Arctic island’s name in Greenlandic.

Thousands of people had said on social media they would take part in marches and rallies organised by Greenlandic associations in Copenhagen, and in Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense and the Greenlandic capital Nuuk.
“The aim is to send a clear and unified message of respect for Greenland’s democracy and fundamental human rights,” Uagut, an association of Greenlanders in Denmark, said on its website.
A sister demonstration was scheduled to happen in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, at 3pm GMT (8pm PKT) to protest the US’s “illegal plans to take control of Greenland”, organisers said. Demonstrators would march to the US consulate carrying Greenlandic flags.
The Copenhagen rally, which began at 12pm (4pm PKT), was due to make a stop outside the US embassy in the Danish capital.

‘Demand respect’
“Recent events have put Greenland and Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark under pressure,” Uagut chairwoman Julie Rademacher said in a statement to AFP, calling for “unity”.
“When tensions rise and people go into a state of alarm, we risk creating more problems than solutions for ourselves and for each other. We appeal to Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark to stand together,” she said.
The demonstration in Greenland was “to show that we are taking action, that we stand together and that we support our politicians, diplomats and partners,” Kristian Johansen, one of the organisers, said in a statement.

“We demand respect for our country’s right to self-determination and for us as a people,” added Avijaja Rosing-Olsen, another organiser.
“We demand respect for international law and international legal principles. This is not only our struggle, [but] it is a struggle that concerns the entire world.”
According to the latest poll published in January 2025, 85 per cent of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the United States. Only six per cent were in favour.
‘No security threat’
Speaking in Copenhagen, where the Congressional delegation met top Danish and Greenlandic politicians and business leaders, US Democratic Senator Chris Coons insisted there was no security threat to Greenland to justify the Trump administration’s stance.
He was responding after Trump advisor Stephen Miller claimed on Fox News that Denmark was too small to defend its sovereign Arctic territory.
“There are no pressing security threats to Greenland, but we share real concern about Arctic security going forward, as the climate changes, as the sea ice retreats, as shipping routes change,” Coons told the press.

“There are legitimate reasons for us to explore ways to invest better in Arctic security broadly, both in the American Arctic and in our Nato partners and allies,” said Coons, who is leading the US delegation.
Trump has repeatedly criticised Denmark — a Nato ally — for, in his view, not doing enough to ensure Greenland’s security.
The US president has pursued that argument, despite strategically located Greenland — as part of Denmark — being covered by Nato’s security umbrella.

European Nato members are deploying troops in Greenland for a military exercise designed to show the world, including the United States, that they will “defend (their) sovereignty”, French armed forces minister Alice Rufo said this week.
Britain, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have announced they are sending small numbers of military personnel to prepare for future exercises in the Arctic.
The US has been invited to participate in the exercise, Denmark said on Friday.

In Sargodha, six children were among 14 dead, while nine others were injured in the early hours of Saturday when a truck carrying cargo and passengers fell into a canal from the Galapur Bangla bridge due to fog, said Rescue 1122.
According to Punjab Rescue 1122 officials, the truck was travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad with 23 people on board for a funeral when the unfortunate incident took place.
“Due to heavy fog, the motorway was closed, so the vehicle took a local route. In the area of Kot Momin tehsil, the truck fell from the Galapur bridge into the canal,” said a statement from Rescue 1122, adding that the truck “lost control because of poor visibility”.
The Rescue 1122 statement added that the canal was dry, but passengers were stuck beneath the truck when it overturned.
The injured were provided first aid on site and were then taken to Civil Hospital Kot Momin, along with the bodies. Three of the injured were later shifted to Kot Momin Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.
“The incident was reported at 1:48am on January 17, 2026, after which rescue operations were launched immediately,” said the statement.
Dense fog often paralyses traffic on Punjab’s motorways and major thoroughfares during the winter months.
Earlier in the day, different sections of motorways, including the M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4 and M-11 were closed due to dense fog, according to the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP).







On Tuesday, 10 people died and 21 were injured in multiple fog-related accidents across Punjab.
Four lost their lives in a collision between a bus, a car and a motorcycle in Toba Tek Singh; three were killed when a car and a truck collided near Bhaban on the Indus Highway; three died in two separate accidents in Okara; and seven were critically injured in a multi-vehicle accident in Gujrat.
In early December, reduced visibility due to fog resulted in the collision of six trailer trucks on the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5), leaving seven people injured.
10 dead, over dozen injured in Makran Coastal Highway accident
Separately, 10 people died and over a dozen were injured when a speeding passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway at Hudd Goth near Gwadar’s Ormara tehsil.
In an update, the Edhi rescue service said 10 individuals, including a girl, had died in the accident.
It added that an Edhi mobile morgue had been sent to Ormara to bring the bodies to Karachi.
The coach was heading to Jiwani from Karachi, according to Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police (SP) Aslam Bangulzai. Earlier in the day, the officer had said nine people died and 14 others were wounded in the accident.
He added that the deceased hailed from various parts of Sindh and were going to Jiwani for labour.
SP Bangulzai said the bodies and the injured were initially taken to PNS Darman Jah Hospital in Ormara.



Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti held a telephone conversation with Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah to discuss the accident, his office said on X.
They exchanged details regarding the condition of the injured passengers and the medical treatment being provided to them.
The statement added that on the directives of CM Bugti, critically injured passengers were being airlifted to private hospitals in Karachi for advanced medical care.
The chief minister instructed Gwadar Deputy Commissioner Naqeebullah Khan and other relevant authorities to ensure the “immediate shifting of the injured and timely completion of all administrative arrangements”.
DC Naqeebullah was quoted as saying that all passengers injured in the accident hailed from Sindh.







Condolences
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed their deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the Sargodha and Ormara accidents, Radio Pakistan reported.
President Zardari offered condolences to the families of the deceased and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
He stressed that changing weather conditions were an undeniable reality and exercising caution while travelling was essential.
Affirming that safeguarding human lives was the state’s foremost priority, the president instructed provincial governments to enhance public awareness on safe driving.







In his statement, PM Shehbaz prayed for the deceased and directed the authorities concerned to provide the best treatment to the wounded.
He also instructed the authorities to ensure the implementation of traffic laws and safety measures on national highways.
The premier ordered strict monitoring of precautionary measures in view of dense fog to prevent any unfortunate incidents.







Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz Sharif also expressed her deep grief over the loss of precious human lives in the Sargodha truck accident, APP reported.
She emphasised the need for timely rescue and relief operations to support the victims’ families and mitigate the impact of the incident.
CM Maryam directed the commissioner to submit a detailed report on the circumstances leading to the accident and the measures taken for assistance.
She also urged authorities to ensure strict safety protocols on roads and near water channels to prevent such tragic incidents in the future.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
Earlier this month, five passengers lost their lives while 24 others sustained injuries after a bus plunged into a ravine in Punjab’s Talagang district when the driver opted for an alternative route.
On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed and 16 others injured in a head-on collision between a bus carrying players of a university and a van on Jhang-Faisalabad road near the Adda Faqeer Di Kulli area.
According to Rescue 1122, the police and the district administration, the accident occurred due to speeding by both vehicles when one was overtaking while the other was crossing a sugarcane-laden tractor trolley.
Following the incident, four officials of the Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) were suspended for failing to stop the overspeeding vehicles.</p><small>2026-01-17 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645689-blatant-intrusion-pakistan-assails-india-over-mosques-profiling-in-iiojk' target='_blank'><strong>'Blatant intrusion': Pakistan assails India over 'mosques profiling' in IIOJK</strong></a><br><p>

The agreement was reached as Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held a meeting with a high-level US delegation led by US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker.
The meeting featured in-depth deliberation on boosting relations between the two countries and expanding cooperation in shared areas of interest.
It was mutually agreed to further strengthen existing cooperation with the US Anti-terrorism Assistance Programme and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.
During the meeting, matters relating to the establishment of a centre for crime and an academy within the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) with US support also came under review.
The delegation also discussed training programmes for officers of the FIA, Federal Constabulary and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
‎It was also agreed that border security agencies, coastal guards and other institutions would be equipped with modern US-supplied equipment.
Naqvi stated that modern technology would enhance the capacity of border security agencies and coastal guards.
He also welcomed US assistance in the reorganisation of the Federal Constabulary and in strengthening the capabilities of the FIA and the NCCIA. He added that US support in activating FIA’s counterterrorism wing would prove highly beneficial, making it the first federal anti-terrorist wing with effective coordination with provinces.
‎Naqvi said that the NCCIA was carrying out an extensive crackdown on illegal call centres across the country. He noted that advanced software was vital for preventing financial fraud and terror financing, and US cooperation with the NCCIA in this regard was highly significant.
The minister emphasised the need to further expand collaboration with Pakistani institutions. Meanwhile, the US delegation appreciated Pakistan’s efforts to increase security cooperation and strengthen bilateral ties.
Baker acknowledged the ongoing collaboration between the Ministry of Interior and US agencies at various levels and reaffirmed that efforts would continue to further enhance the partnership with Pakistan.</p><small>2026-01-17 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645706-aga-khan-university-graduates-over-400-students' target='_blank'><strong>Aga Khan University graduates over 400 students</strong></a><br><p>

Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, following the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025, that ended a suspension of the festival after almost two decades.
The report identified areas of concern for the 2026 festival, based on data from the last decade, and urged full implementation of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.
It stated that registration of every kite and spool of string is mandatory through a QR code and there would be zero tolerance for glass, chemical-coated, or metallic wire.
According to the report, Lahore has been divided into red, yellow, and green zones, while officials will continuously monitor kite-flying activities through drones, social media, and control rooms.
It also warned that strict action will be taken against aerial firing, drinking, and illegal activities on rooftops.
The report stated that it would be mandatory for motorcycle riders to wear a helmet and prohibited their entry into red zones without a safety antenna installed.
On January 6, the LHC sought reports from the Inspector General of Police and the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) regarding security and safety arrangements being taken for the festival.
Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Judicial Activism Panel (JAP) through Advocate Azhar Siddique questioning the alleged failure of the government and the police to make security arrangements for Basant under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.</p><small>2026-01-17 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171259198d1e77c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967483/nobel-prize-inseparable-from-winner-but-medal-can-be-given-away-award-body-says' target='_blank'><strong>Nobel Prize inseparable from winner but medal can be given away, award body says</strong></a><br><p>The Nobel Peace Prize remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation that won it, though the medal can be given away, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said on Friday, a day after last year’s winner gave her medal to US President Donald Trump.
Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her medal on Thursday to Trump, who thanked her for it. The White House released a photo of Trump and Machado, with Trump holding up a gold-coloured frame displaying it, and a White House official said Trump intends to keep it.
Machado’s award also consists of a diploma and 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.19 million).
“Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,” the award body said in a statement.







“There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money. This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items,” it added.
‘Inseparably linked’
The medal and the diploma are physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the prize, said the five-strong award committee.
“The prize itself the honour and recognition remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee,” it said.
The committee, which did not refer to Trump and Machado by name in its statement, said it does not comment on a laureate’s statements, decisions or actions after the prize is announced.
It was not the first time a Nobel laureate has given away the medal. In 1943 Nobel literature laureate Knut Hamsun gave his to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
In 2022, Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov sold his medal for $100 million to raise money for the UN children’s fund UNICEF to help Ukrainian refugee children.
In 2024, the widow of former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan donated his 2001 Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma to the UN office in Geneva.</p><small>2026-01-17 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645633-man-accused-of-sexually-abusing-over-100-children-arrested-with-accomplice-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Man accused of sexually abusing over 100 children arrested with accomplice in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

The United Nations treaty, also known as Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), was finalised in March 2023 after 15 years of negotiations, and will allow the creation of a global network of “marine protected areas” in vast and previously unregulated ocean ecosystems lying in international waters.
“It’s two-thirds of the ocean, (and) it’s half the surface of the planet that for the first time will have a comprehensive legal regime,” said Adam McCarthy, first assistant secretary at the Australian foreign ministry and a co-chair of the treaty’s preparatory committee, speaking at a media briefing.
The treaty reached the threshold of 60 national ratifications on September 19 last year, meaning that it would go formally into operation within 120 days. The number of ratifications has since risen to more than 80, with China, Brazil and Japan adding their names to the list.
Others, including Britain and Australia, are expected to follow soon. The United States signed the treaty during the previous administration but has not yet ratified it.

 

“Whilst we only needed 60 for it to enter into force, obviously it’s really critical for its implementation and for it to be as effective as possible for us to achieve global or universal ratification of the treaty,” said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups.
“We’re really aiming for all UN member states to ratify the treaty.”
Under the treaty, countries must conduct environmental assessments of activities that have an impact on ocean ecology. It will also create mechanisms allowing nations to share the spoils of the “blue economy”, including “marine genetic resources” used in industries such as biotechnology.
Environmentalists say more than 190,000 protected areas would need to be established in order to meet the “30 by 30” target to bring 30pc of the oceans under formal protection by 2030. Currently, only about 8pc — or 29 million square kilometres — is protected.
But the treaty will have little impact on what some conservationists identify as one of the greatest threats facing the marine environment — the clamour to extract mineral resources from the ocean bed.
“BBNJ is very ambitious but there are certain defined limits,” McCarthy said.
“The question of mining in the substrate or in the seabed simply belongs to the ISA (International Seabed Authority). It’s not something where the BBNJ gets a role.”</p><small>2026-01-17 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171150056266a8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967480/dar-expresses-hope-for-peace-stability-in-iran-in-phone-call-with-araghchi-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Dar expresses hope for peace, stability in Iran in phone call with Araghchi: FO</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar expressed his hope for peace and stability in Iran on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
According to a post by the FO on X, Dar spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in a phone call in which the two diplomats discussed the current situation in Iran and the wider region.
Dar “expressed hope for peace and stability, and both sides agreed to continue bilateral consultations on matters of mutual interest”, the statement added.







On Thursday, Pakistan had expressed hope at the United Nations Security Council for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, which saw its largest demonstrations in years, challenging the country’s government.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds.
Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions.
US President Donald Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters. However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country.
Meanwhile, the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in neighbouring Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in Iran were directly linked to Pakistan’s own interests. He also said that Pakistan was engaging with Washington on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran.
Earlier this week, Iran’s envoy to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, met the chairman of the National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem, where he expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support. He said it had been given “wholeheartedly”, stressing that the country needed moral and political support, rather than material assistance.</p><small>2026-01-17 07:19</small></div><hr>
