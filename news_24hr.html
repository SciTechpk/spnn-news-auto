He continues to serve as the chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA).
A notification from the Cabinet Division, signed October 13, said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accepted Saqib’s resignation from the position with effect from August 21.
He was appointed to the role on May 26, with the status of a minister of state.
Saqib was appointed the PVARA chairman with the status of a minister of state on a pro bono basis for three years on August 1.
PVARA is an autonomous federal body governed by a multi-stakeholder board including the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue. Its mandate is to curb illicit finance, protect consumers and unlock opportunities in fintech, remittances and tokenised assets, while fostering Shariah-compliant innovation through regulatory sandboxes.­
According to Forbes, Saqib — who is part of their ‘30 under 30’ list — is the cofounder of Tayaba, which the publication describes as “a social enterprise that aims to provide solutions to the water crisis in Pakistan”.
He also received his MBE in 2023 for contributions to the UK’s National Health Service, the statement added.

The traffic police’s crackdown on traffic violations across the province left motorists in turmoil when they lodged over 4,600 cases and arrested around 3,100 citizens, including a large number of schoolchildren, during the last 72 hours, creating a criminal record for a majority of them.
Parents lambasted the Punjab government for making criminal profiles of these children, saying it would have long-term consequences on their careers and declaring it an overreaction by the traffic police.
According to a statement from the office, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed her displeasure over minors being handcuffed for violating traffic rules.
“A decision has been made in principle to issue smart cards and motorcycle licences to 16-year-olds,” the statement read. “Traffic police across the province will also host an awareness week for the public, especially for students.”
The statement added that a warning would be issued for motorcyclists not wearing helmets for their first offence, while drones and police body cameras would be employed for the first time by the traffic police officials.
“Parents should be playing a greater role in abiding by traffic rules, more so than children and students,” CM Maryam was quoted as saying. “Traffic rules have been created to protect people. The public needs to change their habits for their own safety.”
She added that she did not want to arrest children, but emphasised that they needed to obey the law.
“It’s not the children’s fault, we did not teach them to wear helmets,” the CM was quoted as saying. “Parents need to teach their children about the importance of helmets for road safety.”
Last week, the Punjab government introduced 20 major reforms in the 60-year-old Traffic Act, aiming to bring about better traffic management in the province, including a decisive crackdown to end underage driving, which may be punishable by six months’ imprisonment.</p><small>2025-12-02 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/02201552380e507.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958740/imran-perfectly-fine-says-uzma-khanum-after-meeting-pti-founder-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Imran ‘perfectly fine’, says Uzma Khanum after meeting PTI founder at Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>Uzma Khanum, sister of PTI founder Imran Khan, said on Tuesday her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
Prison authorities had allowed her to meet the former prime minister today. She was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as Uzma went inside the prison to meet her brother.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
The meeting took place under strict supervision and without mobile devices, she added, declining to provide further details.
In a separate talk with the media, flanked by Aleema Khanum and PTI leader, Uzma said: “When I met him, he was very disturbed and very angry. He said that they are keeping him and Bushra Bibi in such mental torture in a small room, he said he was not allowed to meet anyone for four weeks … he said this mental torture is worse than physical torture.”
She said the PTI founder was even more disturbed when informed about the treatment meted out to his sister, Noreen Niazi, a few weeks ago.
Uzma said Imran also gave a message to the party to support the candidates nominated by PTI’s Salman Akram Raja and Hamid Khan for the Pakistan Bar elections, along with ensuring that Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were notified as the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate.
She said Imran had also tasked the PTI with supporting and following any call by the two nominees for the opposition leaders. Uzma added that Imran further directed that Shahid Khattak be made the parliamentary leader of the opposition.
“About Sohail Afridi, he said that he is very happy and supports him completely.”
In a strict warning for PTI members seen fraternising with those from the government, she said Imran gave one direction: “My party members who play on both sides of the wicket have no place here and are the Mir Jafar and Mir Sadiq of my party.”
The development comes amid the PTI’s protests outside the Islamabad High Court and the Adiala jail today against restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights. The party had claimed that the ex-premier’s family and party leaders had been denied access to him for the last several weeks.

According to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code was imposed in Islamabad and Rawalpindi ahead of PTI’s protests. It is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
Tallal’s warning
Earlier today, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that compliance with Section 144 would be ensured in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
“Whether they come to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) or the Adiala jail, action under Section 144 would be carried out without any discrimination,” Chaudhry warned while speaking to the media in Islamabad. He particularly urged PTI-backed parliamentarians to “abide by the law”.
Chaudhry said Section 144 had been imposed in the twin cities “in light of intelligence reports”.
He further linked the matter to terrorism, saying: “Terrorists look for instances [which they can use] to spread fear and make headlines; be it [a] political gathering, courts or important places or offices.”
The state minister further said that terrorists used social media applications, particularly for communication. “They use these apps with virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their identities and locations.”
So, Chaudhry continued, the interior ministry had decided that it, along with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), would find a solution to this problem.
“The PTA has issued a detailed press release regarding the registration of VPNs,” he said, adding that the government did not want IT-related businesses to be affected by this measure. “But, it has to be done at any cost to ensure that mobile and social media apps are not used for terrorist activities.”
The state minister also recalled that the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had ruled that state resources were not to be used for political activities.
So, “we hope that the KP (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) chief minister, who repeatedly comes to Islamabad and Pindi, will not use state resources for his political activities”, he added.
The state minister asserted that “KP police will [only] be used in KP for security”.
“If they come to Islamabad or any other province, prior intimation will be required in a proper manner. If any state resources are used without any intimation, action will be taken and criminal cases will be registered against government employees [concerned], in line with the PHC’s directive,” he warned.
He further stated that Section 144 had been imposed for the protection of lives. “An incident has occurred in Islamabad, and threats still exist,” he said.
The minister pointed out that the PTI had staged protests in Rawalpindi, demanding meetings with Imran, several times.
The administration, he said, was closely monitoring the situation to ensure that citizens’ lives and peace in the city were not affected. “To ensure that such gatherings of protests do not cause any loss.”
Here, he also recalled the violent protests of May 9, 2023, which were held after Imran’s arrest. “They will do it themselves just like on May 9, and entire Pakistan will face the consequences. They will do it themselves, and will then deny [any responsibility].”
He maintained that KP Chief Minister had no authority to demand a meeting with Imran.
Reiterating that Section 144 had been imposed in light of terror incidents. “And I hope that terrorists will not be facilitated — that such gatherings are held where they could carry out [terror] activities with ease and spread fear in Pakistan. We have made foolproof security arrangements, and God willing, no such incident will take place. But, we need the cooperation of other political parties and civil society to ensure this.”
He again warned Section 144 would be “strictly imposed” and action would be taken in light of the PHC order if any provincial public office holder used state resources for political activities.
To a question about whether Imran would be shifted from the Adiala jail to a prison in Islamabad, Chaudhry said: “It is too early to say anything.”
The minister said that the prison’s construction was in its last stages, after which its staff would have to be trained. “That jail is not being constructed for just one prison. It was needed in Islamabad as prisoners from the federal capital had to be sent to jails elsewhere,” he added.
He also said if the authorities were provided all the necessary documents and “tracking number, Imran’s sons would be issued visas in the next 24 hours”.
Security beefed up in Pindi
Rawalpindi police said effective arrangements had been made to ensure law and order in the city. In a statement, police said at least 3,000 security officers were performing traffic and other security duties.
“Section 144 has been imposed across Rawalpindi for three days which restricts unlawful assembly, rally and protest,” it said.
It added that Rawalpindi police would deal strictly with those who breached the law and it would ensure the implementation of Section 144 to maintain law and order in the city.
Reports from the twin cities said pickets were set up on routes leading to the Adiala jail. Meanwhile, roads leading to the Red Zone, which houses key government buildings, from Serena Hotel and the National Database and Registration Authority office were also reported to have been blocked.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser said on Monday the opposition lawmakers from both houses of parliament will protest outside the IHC before taking their demonstration to Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. “It has been decided to hold protests because IHC has failed to implement its order and the Adiala jail administration is not willing to implement the court orders,” he said.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and other leaders will stage protests in the twin cities, Qaiser said.
Last week, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was barred from meeting Imran for the eighth time.
Imran’s sisters had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI also alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters after they, along with other party members and supporters, held a protest outside the jail on November 19.
There were also speculations about his health, but the government and the PTI leaders had said that he was in good health.</p><small>2025-12-02 16:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637052-pakistan-sends-aid-to-sri-lanka-via-sea-after-india-denies-airspace-access' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan sends aid to Sri Lanka via sea after India denies airspace access</strong></a><br><p>

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the two operations were carried out on the reported presence of khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“An intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in [the] general area [of] Mir Ali,” the statement read. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, six khawarij were sent to hell.”
Another terrorist was killed in an IBO in Spinwam, the ISPR said, adding that weapons and ammunition were seized from the terrorists who “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as [a] relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by [the] security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Earlier today, Miranshah Assistant Commissioner Shah Wali and two cops were among four martyred after the official’s vehicle came under attack in KP’s Bannu district.
Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan confirmed the number of casualties.
“The attack was sudden, and after opening fire on the vehicle, the assailants also set it on fire,” he said. The DIG said the area was cordoned off after the incident and a search was underway to locate the attackers.
“Security forces and police are conducting a joint operation. Security in the area has been put on high alert and investigations are being carried out from every angle,” he said.
Meanwhile, Bilal Saqib, the assistant commissioner’s secretary, told the media that the incident took place at around 10am and that Wali was on his way to appear before a court when he was “ambushed” near Mamash Khel’s Masoomabad.
Giving details about the deaths, he said that two constables and a civilian, who was working in the fields, were martyred, while two police officials were injured.

In a post on X, the FO said: “India continues to block humanitarian assistance from Pakistan to Sri Lanka. The special aircraft carrying Pakistan’s humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka continues to face a delay of over 60 hours now awaiting flight clearance from India.
“The partial flight clearance issued by India last night, after 48 hours, was operationally impractical: time-bound for just a few hours and without validity for the return flight, severely hindering this urgent relief mission for the brotherly people of Sri Lanka.”







A statement issued later by the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka said aircraft were awaiting clearance to fly and accused India of blocking the humanitarian relief operation through “shenanigans”.
The statement said that a “robust relief operation” was initiated on the special directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who had instructed the “immediate mobilisation of national resources” to support Sri Lanka during its hour of need.
It said that since Saturday, the Pakistan Army and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) have been ready for relief operations in Sri Lanka.
“However, for more than two days, Pakistan’s emergency relief mission comprising C-130 aircraft carrying a fully equipped urban search and rescue team, field hospitals, highly trained sniffing dogs and nearly 200 tonnes of life-saving supplies have remained stranded at Noor Khan Air Base in Islamabad due to delaying tactics deployed by India in granting flight clearance to C-130 aircraft.
“India in a cunning move has granted one day diplomatic clearance at 1800 hours, on Nov 1 through its embassy in Islamabad. The clearance was valid for around six hours for Pakistan’s assisted emergency and relief aircraft to depart, which was not sufficient for an aircraft to move back and forth to Colombo.
“Earlier, Indian authorities were reportedly engaged in deliberate delaying tactics, repeatedly asking Pakistan to resubmit and re-route flight plans despite already receiving complete documentation. These procedural hurdles appear to cause further delays, undermining timely relief delivery to a disaster-struck neighbour.”
The high commission said that by delaying emergency humanitarian aid, India had disregarded universally accepted norms of humanitarian conduct.
“The behaviour is callous, politically motivated and in violation of established international humanitarian norms, UN guiding principles as well as SAARC humanitarian charter principles.”
The high commission said that India’s “continued use of procedural manoeuvres and airspace restrictions” raised serious concerns about its adherence to humanitarian obligations and its commitment to regional solidarity in times of tragedy.
“Pakistan hopes that India will take a responsible and humanitarian approach by granting immediate airspace access with doable flight operational time and will refrain from politicising a purely humanitarian mission meant for the people of Sri Lanka in times of distress.
“Having, everlasting bilateral friendship, the humanitarian operation of relief supplies carries heartfelt solidarity of the Pakistani nation with its Sri Lankan brothers and sisters. and underscores powerful message that Sri Lanka is not alone and Pakistan will stand by it always,” the statement said.
Later in the day, the FO said that 200 tonnes of humanitarian aid had been dispatched by sea due to the delay in authorising overflights.
“Pakistan has dispatched 200 tons of humanitarian assistance to Sri Lanka via sea cargo to support relief efforts following the devastating Cyclone Ditwah,” the FO wrote on X, adding that a send-off ceremony was held for the cargo, attended by Sri Lanka High Commissioner to Pakistan Admiral Ravindra C Wijegunaratne, among other officials.
“Pakistan stands in full solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka,” the post read.







The development comes a day after diplomatic sources told Dawn that Pakistan had received India’s permission to use its airspace for humanitarian aid flights to Sri Lanka to provide flood relief.
Sri Lanka President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency to deal with what he called the “most challenging natural disaster in our history”.
It should be mentioned that India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s aircraft since tensions between them escalated in April in the wake of an attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people and the subsequent four-day conflict. In October, Islamabad extended the airspace ban until November 24.
Sri Lanka flooding death toll hits 410
The death toll from flooding and landslides in Sri Lanka was now 410, the Disaster Management Centre said Tuesday, with another 336 people missing following a week of heavy rains.
It said over 1.5 million people were affected by the worst natural disaster to hit the country since the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004.
An official in the central town of Welimada told local reporters he expected the toll to rise, as his staff dug through the mud looking for victims buried by landslides.
In the capital Colombo, meanwhile, floodwaters were slowly subsiding on Tuesday.
The speed with which waters rose around the city surprised local residents used to seasonal flooding.
“Every year we experience minor floods, but this is something else,” delivery driver Dinusha Sanjaya told AFP.
Rains have eased across the country, but landslide alerts remain in force across most of the hardest-hit central region, officials said.</p><small>2025-12-02 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/02175543fb36306.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958785/at-least-7-injured-in-gas-leak-explosion-at-islamabads-national-university-of-modern-languages-police' target='_blank'><strong>At least 7 injured in gas leak explosion at Islamabad’s National University of Modern Languages: police</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people were injured in an explosion, caused by a gas leak, within the premises of Islamabad’s National University of Modern Languages (Numl) on Tuesday, according to the police.
Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IG) Ali Nasir Rizvi, speaking to the media, said the explosion occurred around 4pm and was caused by a gas leak ignited by a short circuit.
“When summer ends, the university turns off its gas connection. They turned it on at 3:30pm, but there was an accumulation of gas and a short circuit somewhere,“ the IG said. “A gas leakage caused the explosion.”
The IG outlined that the explosion occurred in a prayer room, which was near a clerk’s office. He stated that seven people were caught in the explosion.
“Five students were there with a clerk and a junior assistant,” IG Rizvi explained.
“The clerk sustained 60-65 per cent burn injuries, the clerical assistant was burned and the students suffered minor burn injuries. Seven people are under treatment; of those, six are out of danger as per the hospital.”

IG Rizvi added that multiple teams were present at the scene, including Operations, Investigations, Special Branch and the Counter-Terrorism Department.
“We have examined the scene thoroughly and have ruled out the use of explosives,” the IG said. “No traces have been found. We are telling the media that this explosion was caused by a gas leakage and a short circuit.”
He added that standard operating procedures were invoked to close all gas connections, and Numl’s administration was instructed to check the gas lines as a precaution.
“We have also instructed them to check the structural stability of the building where the explosion took place,” IG Rizvi added.
Rescue 1122 control-in-charge Subhan told Dawn earlier that the emergency service first received a call at 4:06pm.
“The caller did not know the nature of the explosion, but the administration called us and said that it was caused by a gas cylinder or a gas leak in a room,” he said over the phone.
He added that the fire was controlled by emergency services.
The official added that damage from the explosion was contained to a single room and the rest of the building was not affected.
Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi, speaking to Dawn soon after the incident, had also said that a gas leakage caused the explosion.
Visuals from the varsity showed panicked students evacuating the campus as emergency and rescue personnel tried to extinguish the blaze in one of the rooms on the premises.
Bystanders could also be seen rushing to the help of an injured person lying on the ground.
In 2002, the National Institute of Modern Languages was upgraded to a university.

His remarks came ahead of President Vladimir Putin’s two-day visit to New Delhi from Thursday, looking to restore defence and energy ties as India is set to trim its Russian oil purchases this month to at least a three-year low.
Russia’s top buyer of seaborne oil, India has cut crude imports from Moscow under pressure from Western sanctions, particularly by Washington, on Moscow’s top oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil.
“There can be, for a very brief period of time, insignificant decreases in the volume of oil trade,” Peskov told Indian journalists, in response to a question about the impact of sanctions.
Working to build the necessary environment for buyers
Russia is the top oil supplier to India, the world’s third biggest oil importer and consumer.
Moscow is working to build the “necessary environment” for buyers who seek its oil, Peskov said, speaking by video link organised by Russia’s Sputnik news agency.
“We have deep experience in performing under regime of these illegal sanctions,” Peskov added.
“We have our own technologies in doing that. We will continue to make those technologies more sophisticated should this practice of sanctions continue.”
Trade between Russia and India should be secured from pressure from third countries, he said, adding that payment methods would feature in the leaders’ talks.
Activities of Indian refiners
Indian refiners, such as Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd, have stopped buying Russian oil.
State-run Indian Oil Corp has placed orders to buy Russian oil from non-sanctioned entities, while Bharat Petroleum Corp is in an advanced stage of negotiations for Russian oil imports.
Russia-backed Indian refiner Nayara Energy, partly owned by Rosneft, is exclusively processing Russian oil after other suppliers pulled back, following British and EU sanctions.
Russia wants India to continue to provide support to Nayara to boost its local sale and capacity use.
Reliance Industries Ltd, formerly Russia’s top Indian client, has said it loaded Russian oil cargoes “precommitted” by October 22, and will process any arriving after November 20 at its refinery geared to domestic supply.</p><small>2025-12-02 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021247054bce99b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958742/miranshah-assistant-commissioner-among-4-martyred-in-bannu-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Miranshah assistant commissioner among 4 martyred in Bannu attack</strong></a><br><p>Miranshah Assistant Commissioner Shah Wali and two cops were among four martyred after the official’s vehicle came under attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Bilal Saqib, the assistant commissioner’s secretary, told the media that the incident took place at around 10am. He said the assistant commissioner was on his way to appear before a court when he was “ambushed” near Mamash Khel’s Masoomabad.
Giving details about the deaths, he said that two constables and a civilian, who was working in the fields, were martyred, while two police officials were injured. He said that an investigation was underway into the incident.

 

Miranshah is the administrative headquarters of North Waziristan district and is adjacent to Bannu.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed sorrow over the lives lost in the incident. A statement shared by the PPP on X said he condemned the terrorist attack.
He further said that the elimination of terrorists operating with external support against the country was being carried out with national consensus.
He also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel and directed the relevant agencies to ensure the immediate arrest of the attackers.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed sorrow on the terrorist attack in Bannu that martyred four people, including the assistant commissioner, according to a statement on X issued by the PM Office.







He prayed for the departed souls and extended prayers of patience for the bereaved.
“The government is committed to eliminating terrorism from the country.”
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also condemned the attack and expressed sorrow at the lives lost in the incident. According to an official statement, he also sought a detailed report from the KP police chief.
“The sacrifices of the martyrs will not go in vain. The elements involved will be brought to justice,” he said. Afridi also directed to provide the injured with the best possible medical treatment.
Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TTP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
The development comes a day after two policemen embraced martyrdom and five others were injured in a suicide bombing and a gun attack in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
In July, an assistant commissioner and a tehsildar were among five people martyred, while 17 others, including several police personnel, sustained injuries when a roadside bomb explosion struck an official vehicle in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area.</p><small>2025-12-02 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021829145b2dd4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958791/sri-lanka-grapples-with-trauma-loss-after-deadly-cyclone-that-killed-hundreds' target='_blank'><strong>Sri Lanka grapples with trauma, loss after deadly cyclone that killed hundreds</strong></a><br><p>Nawaz Nashra recalls grabbing her three-year-old daughter, wrapping her in a bedsheet and running out of their home in central Sri Lanka as a landslide struck, triggered by a deadly cyclone that killed 410 people in the worst floods in a decade.
Nashra and her pregnant sister, who lived with her, spent the next 20 minutes scrambling down the hillside from Alawathugoda village on Friday night, sometimes knee-deep in mud, until they reached a mosque at a lower altitude, where they spent the night.
“It was pitch dark…We could only hear a sound like thunder,” she told Reuters. “The house next to ours collapsed as we watched. There was no time to warn anyone.” About 10 houses in the neighbourhood were swept away by Cyclone Ditwah and at least 25 people are feared dead, residents said on Tuesday, when they returned with long poles to dig through the mud and search for bodies.
Deadly storms have swept across South and Southeast Asia in recent days, devastating large parts of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand and claiming hundreds of lives.
In Sri Lanka, the Kandy region where Alawathugoda is located has recorded 88 deaths - the highest in the South Asian country - with 150 people still missing. More than 20,000 people have been moved to 176 shelters set up to house them.
Across the country, 336 people remain missing and 1.2 million have been affected, officials said, as hundreds of army and police personnel combed through regions hit by landslides to retrieve bodies.
Authorities on Tuesday used bulldozers and backhoes to clear roads, removing mud and trees to create a path for food and fuel to reach affected areas.
Work was also underway to restore communication links and electricity, which was cut after strong winds snapped transmission lines, officials said.
About 3 kilometers (2 miles) away from Nashra’s home, another neighbourhood in the village also bore signs of being struck by landslides, with houses partially damaged and a tangled mess of phones, books, furniture, and clothes visible in the slush.
“They tell us to leave but where do we go? There is a temple nearby but there is only one bathroom for about 100 people. The facilities are not enough,” said Manjula Jayalath, 43, a resident of the area.</p><small>2025-12-02 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021714050926a52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958756/pakistan-successfully-emerged-as-regional-stabiliser-following-marka-i-haq-says-paf-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan successfully emerged as ‘regional stabiliser’ following ‘Marka-i-Haq’, says PAF chief</strong></a><br><p>Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday noted that Pakistan had emerged as a regional stabiliser after the May conflict with India.
The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief made the remarks during the passing out parade at PAF Academy Asghar Khan in Risalpur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district.
“In the wake of Marka-i-Haq, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net stabiliser in this part of the world,” ACM Sidhu said.
“As a responsible nuclear power, our relations with key global and regional powers have further strengthened, which is a testimony to the untiring effort of our diplomatic strategy and credible military prowess.”
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India, from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, as Marka-i-Haq in May.



“The rising global relevance of Pakistan remains a growing concern for our adversary, and it exploits every opportunity to malign and destabilise Pakistan on the international front,” said the air chief in a veiled reference to India.
Speaking further on the May conflict, ACM Sidhu said, “The people of Pakistan and its armed forces defeated the enemy with far greater numerical might.
“This resounding success during Marka-i-Haq and Bunyanum Marsoos was the outcome of a unified approach by all elements of national power, and above all, Allah’s special blessing.”
The PAF chief highlighted: “Undoubtedly, the victory also reflects great credit on the firm resolve of our national leadership alongside well-executed tri-service synergy, aggressive decision-making, and full support of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.”

 

He reiterated that the “strength of military organisation solely hangs upon a value system based on character and credibility”, asserting that the PAF’s each and every claim was based on “evidence and undeniable hard facts”.
During his speech, the air chief noted that “we live in challenging times in the wake of a complex global and regional environment”.
While affirming that Pakistan “wishes to maintain friendly relations with all, especially with our neighbours”, ACM Sidhu warned: “However, let me make it clear; if our nation’s sovereignty is challenged, our adversary will find Pakistan’s armed forces even harder and better prepared.”
He asserted, “While celebrating this success with humility, we singularly remain focused on preparing for the future challenges, as the enemy’s rhetoric continued to suggest.”
‘PAF’s first full-spectrum multi-domain operation’
ACM Sidhu highlighted that the PAF conducted “full-spectrum multi-domain operation” for the first time in its history, employing elements of “space, cyber and electronic warfare, along with long-range vectors, unmanned aerial systems, killer drones and loitering munitions”.
Recalling the downing of multiple Indian jets on May 7, the PAF chief noted that it was being “regarded as one of the most intense and longest BVR vs BVR (beyond-visual-range) battles of modern aerial history”.

 

On the subsequent missile exchange on May 10, he said, “We also responded to their pre-amption on May 10 with the Pak Army with a paralysing punch, and struck their bases and ground assets deep into the enemy territory from north to south.”
He added that the armed forces also “neutralised state-of-the-art defence system S-400 and command and control centres” of India. He said the operations were “calibrated and balanced with a single aim to ensure peace with honour”.
The air chief added that the PAF’s “mastery and employment of multi-domain capabilities is being acknowledged and studied by warfare professionals around the globe”.
‘PAF vigorously pursued very innovative strategy of modernisation’
The air chief noted that the PAF’s performance during Marka-i-Haq was not an isolated event but the “outcome of a comprehensive strategy of restructuring, modernisation and indigenisation campaigns undertaken” by the air force in the past few years.
The PAF, he said, recognised the “rapidly changing character of war” and realigned its “operational doctrine, concept and strategy, keeping in view the limitations of fiscal space and availability of technologies”.
ACM Sidhu noted that the PAF “vigorously pursued a very innovative and practical strategy of modernisation and adapted, as well as operationalised, numerous advanced combat and combat-support capabilities, along with niche technologies in record time”.
“The smartly executed homeground kill chain comprising indigenously developed unmanned system, EW and space assets, along with cyber capabilities developed in record time under the ambit of newly established National Aerospace Science and Technology Park (NASTP) form the very core of PAF’s multi-domain operational strategy.”

 

The PAF chief said the range and capabilities of the NASTP were “expanding at an unprecedented pace”, adding that “a host of indigenous projects are still in the pipeline that are being vigorously pursued”.
“Indeed, through rigorous retrospection, concept development, validation cycle, war gaming, the Pakistan Air Force now stands as a vault into the operational ecosystem whose manifestation was seen during the recent conflict.”
‘Recent paradigm shift in training’
Congratulating the graduating cadets, the air chief said, “Today marks the beginning of your journey in one of the most distinguished, respected and professional air forces of the world.”
“Indeed, you are entrusted with the noble mission of defending the aerial frontiers of the motherland, and carry on the hopes of the entire nation on your young shoulders.
“You are being trained well at this leading air force academy on the strength of the recent paradigm shift in training based on future-focused technological interface, with equal emphasis on character, leadership, intellectual progress, mental resilience and physical robustness.”
Noting the presence of Saudi cadets at the ceremony, he said it was a “symbol of strong friendship and cooperation between our two great nations and our armed forces”.</p><small>2025-12-02 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637020-16-year-olds-can-now-secure-motorcycle-licences-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>16-year-olds can now secure motorcycle licences in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>

Organised by DawnMedia, the summit is bringing toge­ther politicians, economists, development specialists, private sector leaders, and experts to develop a shared vision as rapid population growth continues to place pressure on health systems, food and water security, and employment.

 

On Monday, policy­makers, experts, diplomats and lawmakers had expressed the unanimous view that prosperity was not possible if the number of mouths to feed kept rising.
They argued that without managing the population in terms of resources, all of the government’s efforts — aimed at development, progress and social uplift — would amount to nought.

Thank you for following our live coverage of the event, which focused on a pressing challenge facing the country, as highlighted by leaders and experts. Read more about Day 1 coverage here.

2:11pm — KP CM Sohail Afridi stresses need for investment in ‘human capital’
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a video message to the summit, stressed the need for investing in “human capital”.
“In my opinion, population is a blessing. If your purpose is to invest in people, give them basic facilities, fulfil their basic rights, and improve human capital, then the population becomes a blessing for you,” the chief minister said.

However, CM Afridi noted that in Pakistan, “we only think of the next election and not the next generation.”
“Our investment is made only for political benefit,” he added.
Detailing efforts made by his government towards developing the human capital, he said: “In KP, as per the vision of Imran Khan, we have started investing in people. We introduced the Sehat Card for the people of KP, in which around 40m people are receiving free of cost treatment.”
“I have also announced that healthcare for pregnant women in KP would be free, and if she gives birth to a daughter, the government will take the responsibility of the child,” he continued.
“With this kind of investment, the population will no longer feel like a burden, but you will actually receive the output of the investment,” CM Afridi added.

2:08pm — CM Murad details Sindh’s population strategy with education, health ‘at its heart’
Describing his government’s population management strategy as “comprehensive and forward-looking”, CM Murad Ali Shah said, “First, we are focused on expanding economic opportunity; a growing population requires a growing economy.
“Sindh is working to create a job-rich environment by supporting the industry, agriculture, services and new technology sectors through skill development and investment facilitation.”
CM Murad asserted that education and health were “at the heart” of the Sindh government’s population policy, vowing to prioritise quality schooling and strengthening maternal health.
On water scarcity, the chief minister said his government was investing in modern irrigation and protection of the Indus river to “secure our natural resources for future generations”.
“Population balance is not merely a policy ambition. It is essential for a prosperous, healthy, and sustainable Sindh. Together, we can transform demographic pressures into systems of opportunity.”

2:05pm — Achieving population balance central to social, economic progress: Sindh CM
In a video message played at the summit, Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah said his government recognises that “achieving population balance is central to our social and economic progress”.
“Sindh, as one of Pakistan’s most dynamic provinces, feels this pressure keenly. Our growing population is a national strength, but it brings profound challenges.”
Highlighting that 40pc of children under five faced stunting, 26m children aged 5-16 were out of school, and water scarcity threatened agriculture, the Sindh CM said, “These realities demand urgent and coordinated action.”

2:00pm — Tackling population growth requires ‘coordinated and swift’ response: federal health secretary
The federal secretary of the Ministry of National Health Services, Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh, called for the need to adopt a “coordinated and swift response” in tackling population growth.
“Pakistan’s population, which was around 34m at the time of independence, has now increased to around 257m,” he said, adding that “this rapid expansion placed immense strain on our resources.”
“This imbalance is impacting every aspect of national development, our education system, our food security, water security, employment opportunities, urban planning and most critically, our health sector,” he added.
“This is not a sustainable situation and requires a coordinated response and and swift and effective response,” he said.

1:50pm — ‘Living standards could have been higher with lower population growth rate’
Dr Ishrat Husain estimated that if Pakistan’s population growth rate had been 1.8pc instead of 2.5pc, the per capita income would have been $2,100 instead of 1400-1500, leading to higher living standards.
The SDPI advisor termed “institutional fragmentation” as one of the causes of the current population predicament.
“Population requires a multisectoral, multidisciplinary, all hands on the desk approach,” he said, pointing out a lack of coordination between the population and health departments.

1:44pm — Dr Ishrat Husain links lack of implementation to leaders being occupied with political incentives
Wondering why the issues of population crisis and climate change had not been tackled and some solutions implemented, Dr Ishrat Husain said a reason was leaders’ focus on political incentives.
He noted that elected leaders felt the need to show “visible projects” where they are inaugurating various development projects.
“That is very much where they are occupied because they want to appeal to their electorate.”
Dr Husain further said that had the momentum of population planning from the 1960s been sustained, Pakistan’s population growth rate would have been much lower.

1:40pm — Summit’s last session begins
The summit’s final session, titled ‘Balancing Population and Economic Growth - Reports from the Provinces’, has begun.
Dr Ishrat Husain, a senior advisor at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), is delivering his keynote address.




1:33pm — Population growth Pakistan’s ‘biggest challenge’: Azma Bokhari
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, in a video message for the summit, termed population growth the country’s “biggest problem”.
“Growing population is not just a problem for one province or an individual; it is a challenge for the entire country,” Bokhari said.
She continued: “As the population increases, you have to adjust your resources as well, make changes to infrastructure and make efforts to create basic facilities for the growing population.”
“I would like to say that population growth is Pakistan’s biggest challenge at the moment,” Bokhari stressed.
The minister underscored the need to follow the paths outlined by fellow Muslim nations in tackling population growth.

1:25pm — Shafiullah Jan highlights financial challenges faced by KP
Shafiullah Jan, KP chief minister’s aide on public relations, highlighted the financial challenges faced by his provincial government.
Speaking on the NFC award, Jan said the ex-Fata tribal areas had been merged administratively, not financially.
“The allocation we are getting is half of what it should be,” he added, terming the case of KP “very strong”.
“If you had given us these Rs560bn on time, they could have been used for health and education.”
Pointing out that KP still has the subject of population accounting for 1pc of its NFC award allocation, the CM’s merging the tribal areas financially would be a “great positive sign”.

1:15pm — PM’s spokesperson Mosharraf Zaidi calls for ‘national movement’
The prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, stressed the need for a “national movement” in tackling the population growth.
“On population, you need a national movement, and for that to happen, the conversation around the 26th,27th,28th,29th and 30th amendments has to be treated with a view to the outcomes that we want for people.”
On the matter of NFC and population, Zaidi said: “We need to revisit how we allocate resources in the country, and if it’s only on the basis of population, then I think we are in big trouble, but it cannot be at all on the basis of population either.”
“Figuring that balance out will require give and take,” he added.

1:10pm — No space for important issues, info ministries reduced to personal spokespersons: Arifa Noor
Senior journalist and DawnNews anchor Arifa Noor noted that there was “no space for important issues” amid the polarised political environment.
“What have the information ministries been reduced to? […] They’ve become personal of the political parties […] that’s still some virtue, but now they’re personal spokesperson for individuals more or less.”
She also raised her concern over “feel-good legislation” that was passed by the parliament without considering how it would be implemented.

1:05pm — Ex-senator Mushahid calls attention to ‘cousin marriage’ as reason for child stunting
Former information and culture minister Mushahid Hussain Sayed, in his keynote address, drew attention to the issue of “cousin marriages” as a cause for child stunting.
“There is one important reason that has been missed out of our narrative on stunding, and it is cultural — first-cousin marriages,” he said.
“They are a major cause of stunting according to medical sciences, and I think that needs to be incorporated,” the former senator added.

12:55pm — Empowering women’s choices ‘constitutional obligation’: NCSW head
National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) head Umme Laila Azhar termed the act of enabling women to make their own choices “a constitutional obligation”.
“Pakistan stands at a socio-economic crossroads, and empowering women’s choices is not just a soft issue; it’s a constitutional obligation,” she said.
She continued: “When girls and women can choose their education, work, mobility, marriage, and health decisions, entire communities become more resilient, productive, and peaceful, and this is not about individual empowerment; it is nation building.”

12:50pm — Healthcare providers discouraging many fertility management techniques: Madiha Latif
Stressing the need for women to make their decisions, Madiha Latif said women were often “infantilised” when they go into hospital emergency rooms or healthcare providers.
“Providers are the ones discouraging a lot of these fertility management techniques, where they are telling her ‘you are too young to make that decision’ or that ‘you have only one child’,” she said.
“Who are those providers to make those decisions for us?” she asked. “We talk about nutrition and breastfeeding, but we don’t give space to women to breastfeed safely at work.”

12:44pm — Madiha Latif stresses need to make women aware of their reproductive rights
Madiha Latif, vice president of Pathfinder’s Strategic Engagement and Innovation department, stressed raising awareness and knowledge among young women so they would have control over their bodies.
“Reproductive right is also fundamental for gender equality,” she said, adding that the rights begin the moment a child is born.
“Since she hits puberty, what are we giving her in terms of her ability to negotiate sexually? Why are we still turning our faces around to gender-based violence that occurs?” she asked.
“Censorship is not the way to give anymore,” Latif asserted, noting the need to create awareness among women about their control and choices in sexual activities.

12:42pm — ‘We must educate men’: Shamama Tul Amber Arbab
Former president of Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry Shamamatul Amber Arbab highlighted the “friction” that results between men and women when women are made aware of their rights.
She said that the friction resulted because “we are not educating their counterparts, we are not educating the men in their families.”
[While] empowering women, we must at the same time educate men also, and that is how the tug of war will not take place. They will be empowered, they will know what their power is and exactly what their choices can be,” Arbab added.

12:38pm — Dr Yasmeen Qazi notes need to ensure ‘continuity’ in providing healthcare to women
QZ Catalyst CEO Dr Yasmeen Sabih Qazi emphasised the need to ensure “continuity” in providing healthcare to women.
“From adolescence to pregnancy to post-partum, at every point of her life, she would need that kind of information which we fail to provide in a classical facility setting,” she said.
Dr Qazi cited the example of Sweden, which reached nearly 0pc mortality rate “merely through advice”, and Ethiopia, where lady health workers were doing wonders.
“We need a community-led accountability system,” she added, noting that women’s groups would be the best agents to do that, as they would understand women’s rights.

12:35pm — We need inclusion in ‘true sense’: QZ Catalyst CEO
Dr Yasmeen Sabih Qazi, who heads family planning consulting firm QZ Catalyst, underscored the need for inclusion in a “true sense” in response to a question regarding the delivery of interventions to undocumented communities.
“We need inclusion in a true sense…not for the data but for the very right that they deserve,” Qazi said.
“We should make a position that a woman’s autonomy and a woman’s right to make a decision should be central to all the policies we are leading,” she added.

12:22pm — Our rural communities are not as rural: Ayesha Leghari
Detailing a WhatsApp chatbot aimed at population growth in rural areas, Leghari remarked that Pakistan’s “rural communities are not as rural anymore”.
“We are more of a peri-urban shifted country as opposed to having deep rural communities and cities,” she said.

12:18pm — Ayesha Leghari stresses importance of ‘economic agency’ for women
Ayesha Leghari, Population Services International’s country director for Pakistan, echoed Tahira Abdullah’s comments and stressed the importance of providing women with “economic agency”.
“Giving women agency from an economic perspective is one of the most important aspects which we have seen,” Leghari said.
Detailing the outcomes of a PSI project aimed at uplifting women in rural areas, Leghari said: “These women did not have a say in their households before, but once they started becoming economic contributors in their households, their decision-making improved substantially, not just in their households.”
She noted women also became more autonomous in making decisions with regards to their bodies.
“They started choosing contraceptive methods of their choice, they started investing the money they were earning into their daughters, and we saw a dynamic change.”

12:10pm — Tahira Abdullah calls for ending ‘feminisation of poverty’
Activist Tahira Abdullah also called for an end to “feminisation of poverty”, which she described as the share of women in the country’s total poverty figures.
She cited World Bank and past figures, according to which 45pc of the country’s population lived below the poverty line, and women and transgender people made up 75pc of that.

 

The rights defender also demanded an end to unpaid labour by women.
She insisted that women’s labour force participation rate “might be 22pc in the official figures, but 100pc of Pakistan’s women, girls and transgenders do work”.

12:02pm — Conditional permission for birth spacing ‘unacceptable’: activist Tahira Abdullah
Tahira Abdullah, a rights defender, noted that the subject of population balance had become an “existential challenge”.
Donning a keffiyeh, she said that permission for anything should not be “conditional”.
She asserted: “When we give permission, it should be from a moral, ethical and rights-based background, not on a transactional basis.
“‘If a woman’s health is not good, then she can employ birth spacing’. I’m sorry; that is not acceptable,” the activist said, apparently referring to some religious scholars opining that birth spacing was allowed in Islam if there was a danger to the mother’s life.

11:46am — Need to focus on giving free of cost land to our people: Wahab
Replying to a query whether migration should be reduced, Murtaza Wahab termed Karachi an “extremely stretchable city”.
He noted that the city had a “humongous” land mass, which has tremendous potential.
The Karachi mayor underscored the need for development planning, noting that any restrictions on land allotment to the poor would lead to “unplanned growth in the city”.
“We should as a state be focusing on giving free of cost land to our people, incentivising them to develop proper settlements,” he said.

11:44am — Wahab calls for developing more cities as ‘alternate to Karachi’
Mayor Karachi was of the opinion that the state should invest in developing more cities to serve as alternatives to Karachi.
“I think as a matter of policy, Pakistan should be focusing on developing more cities, alternates to Karachi, so that the population can be moved to other cities as well,” said Wahab.

11:40am — Karachi faces brunt of Pakistan’s ballooning population: Murtaza Wahab
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in response to a question about long-term planning for Karachi’s population management, highlighted that his city was “facing the brunt of ballooning population”.
Wahab noted that “one common denominator amongst Pakistan’s problems is the ballooning population”. “Karachi, arguably, being the only cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, faces the brunt of it.”
He cited figures from the first census in 1951 when the population of Karachi was 1m, then it increased to 8.5m in 1995, and later, as per the census of 2023, “we are a city of 20.3m, which again is debated”.

 

Comparing it to the population growth in cities such as New York and London, Mayor Wahab said, “There is no example of a city anywhere in the world where the city’s population has increased over 20 times.”
“That shows that perhaps the state has not prioritised the issue of ballooning population, and the second aspect is that the state has not developed alternate places for people to reside,” he said.
“People from all over Pakistan come to Karachi,” Wahab added.

11:33am — ‘No govt has produced any amount of houses’
Arif Hasan recalled that although many governments promised to construct many houses, “nobody has produced any amount of houses”.
On the PPP building “one-room houses” for flood-affected people, Hasan said, “Let’s see how it works out.”
Asked about pressing issues faced by the society, he said flooding was the biggest. He also stressed the need to control population density, adding that dealing with these issues required a major land reform.

11:28am — Arif Hasan terms ‘affordability’ biggest problem in housing
Asked about the national housing policy, urban planner Arif Hasan said he believed there was “no housing policy for the poor”. “It’s almost always the private sector that deals with this,” he added.
He termed affordability as the biggest problem, adding that another issue was that the only space available to the poor was at the city’s fringe.
“They are pushed out ot teh periphery or environmentally degraded areas,” Hasan said, pointing out that old katchi abadis were turned into high rises as the informal sector invested in that.

11:21am — Arif Hasan notes changing urbanisation trends
At the summit’s ninth session, titled ‘Population Challenges for a Highly Urbanised Pakistan in 2050’, architect and urban planner Arif Hasan detailed the rising trends in urbanisation.
“The major trend is social, which, of course, is a result of economic change.
“The extended family has reduced considerably, the nuclear family has evolved and consolidated, especially in the urban areas, and that gives a lot of freedom to individuals within nuclear families,” Hasan said.
He continued: “So women can acquire education, without pressure from their aunts and uncles, not to have an education. Also, the freedom to marry whoever they want, although this is not consolidated, but the trend is certainly there even within low-income groups.”

 

He noted that the shift to nuclear families “has changed settlement patterns as well”.
Speaking about changing trends in rural areas, Hasan observed that the “change in production patterns, mechanisation, fertiliser, middle man economy … all this has given rise to an economy where cash is desperately needed and that cash is not available in the rural areas”.
“So that has become a push factor,” he added.




11:15am — Not having women’s consent for pregnancy is inconceivable: Humaira Masihuddin
Humaira Masihuddin said that women bore the “main burden of pregnancy — physical, psychological and emotional“.
She said: “In every pregnancy, the risk and threat of death is very real. Not asking the person who has to take such a huge risk or their consent not being included is inconceivable.
“I cannot believe that the Sharia would ever allow something like this,” she added, prompting a huge applause from the audience.
Stressing the importance of justice in Islam, Masihuddin asked, “Where would the justice be in this if a pregnancy is forced upon a woman?”
“ […] Consultation is a cardinal principle in all relationships in Islam.”

11:08am — Women’s representation extremely important in family planning discussions: Humaira Masihuddin
Legal expert Humaira Masihuddin recalled that in July, the CII held a consultation with the Population Council to discuss “pregnancy issues” where 47 men and only three women were present.
“So I think this needs to be rectified; women’s representation is extremely important,” she asserted.
Masihuddin also stressed the importance of women in Islam, citing a Quranic verse that declares men and women each other’s “allies”.

11:06am — Dr Qibla Ayaz calls for ‘de-linking’ population with ‘rizq’
Dr Qibla Ayaz called for the need to “delink” the concept of rizq (sustenance) with population, and associate population with health instead.
“Scholars believe that rather than linking population growth with sustenance, link with health, because if you do not take gaps in childbirth, both the mother and child will suffer,” he stressed.
“The child will be born stunted, and the mother will be weak, and she will face difficulty in raising her children and guiding them towards a better future.”

11:00am — CII ‘coined’ concept of population balance, says Dr Ayaz
Dr Qibla Ayaz, a member of the Supreme Court’s Shariat appellate bench, appreciated the CII for “taking the lead” in the matter and “coining” the concept of population balance.
He recalled that “back in the 60s, it came to be known as family planning”.

10:50am — Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani says Pakistan has not utilised resources
While noting that the growing populace was an issue, Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani asked whether the country had utilised the resources given by God “in the right way”.
Citing the example of China, he said population was much larger there but it managed its resources.
“Allah has blessed our country with treasures worth billions, but we are selling those to others for pennies and not utilising our resources,” he said.
The Jamia Darul Uloom vice president noted that even the Sunnah underscored “moderation” in everything.

10:45am — Islam allows birth control in select situations: Jamia Darul Uloom vice president
Jamia Darul Uloom Vice President Mufti Zubair Ashraf Usmani also shed light on what the Sharia says about the issue of rapid population growth.
“Growing population is not an issue, it is a waseela,” he said, adding that a balance could be struck as birth control could be used in certain situations, such as when there was danger to a woman’s health.
However, Mufti Usmani said Islamic laws did not favour “birth control due to fear of poverty and starvation”, or if parents wanted to avoid a girl’s birth.

10:35am — Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad terms tackling population growth ‘a collective responsibility’
Chairman Ruet-i-Hilal Committee Abdul Khabeer Azad stressed that tackling population growth was “our collective responsibility”, recalling his 15 years of association with the Population Council.
Detailing their efforts, he said: “When we created this awareness that saving one human life was equivalent to saving the entirety of humanity, and then when we talked about the health of mother and child, people understood that this was indeed a noble cause.”
“We often see that when such topics come under discussion, they are labelled as foreign agenda, but we believe that the life of a person is very precious,” he added.

10:28am — ‘Religious scholars ready to play role in raising public awareness’
The CII chief affirmed that religious scholars were determined to play their role in raising awareness among the public.
“Neither are the scholars behind in this, nor do they think that birth spacing should not be adopted,” he said.
Dr Raghib Naeemi called for public sessions, discussions at the graduate level in colleges and universities, and formation of think tanks to work on the issue.

10:22am — Birth spacing parents’ duty: Council of Islamic Ideology chairman
CII chief Raghib Hussain Naeemi said that keeping in mind Islamic rules, appropriate birth spacing to consider the children’s health was the parents’ responsibility.
He further said that scholars of all sects were of the view that Sharia allowed for birth planning and spacing if there was danger to the mother’s health during pregnancy, or risk of “untolerable pain”, or issues related to lactation, or the mother would have to face multiple complications.
The CII chairman also advocated for a social media campaign to raise awareness. He said that Islam’s “fundamental principle” of balance also favoured a balance between resources and population.

10:20am — CII chairman terms family planning ‘Islamic responsibility’
CII chairman Muhammad Raghib Hussain Naeemi recalled that in July, CII organised a conference aimed at discussing the Islamic perspective on population growth, where they adopted a resolution.
“The basis of our resolution was that the protection of the family system, the health of the mother and child, in the context of an increasing population…has become increasingly important”, he said.
He continued: “Quran and Sunnat have declared the protection of one’s life and their offspring as the fundamental purpose of Shariat, which is why the protection of one’s life, the betterment of mother and child, and family planning is an Islamic responsibility.”
“Keeping in view the Sharia, taking a gap between children is the responsibility of the parents in the context of their child’s health,” he added.

10:16am — Info minister calls for joint working group, parliamentary debate
Suggesting some steps that could be taken, Attaullah Tarar called for a charter on the population crisis and recommended that a debate be held in parliament.
“One size fits all strategy might not work,” he noted, adding that religion was not an impediment in population planning.
The minister called for a joint working group that could work on a charter on the issue.

10:11am — Postpartum depression is a reality: info minister
The information minister also highlighted that postpartum depression was a “reality which should be realised and accepted”.
He stressed that mental health was a major aspect of “health linked to the population problem”.
Tarar further wondered what role legislators and the parliament could play in this regard. The minister also pointed out that lack of resources was an issue.
“There needs to be a realisation of rights and responsibilities — who has rights and who has responsibilities.”

10:08am — ‘Right to life’ impeded by population growth: Tarar
Attaullah Tarar believed that the fundamental right to life guaranteed under the Constitution was directly linked to population growth.
“If one’s right to life gets impeded because of the population issue […] It is tragic,” he said.
The minister noted that “we were losing a lot of lives” due to issues amplified by the population explosion, particularly in relation to infant mortality rates, neonatal healthcare, mother-child healthcare, and reproductive health.

10:05am — Must acknowledge scale of issue: Attaullah Tarar
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar began by commending the DawnMedia group for speaking about the issue. He then stressed that, to him, “acknowledging the issue itself was quite important”.
“Until and less we accept it as a huge challenge, we will continue to face problems,” he said.
“First of all, it’s acceptance and the realisation that it is a huge issue,” the minister cautioned.

9:58am — Population Council official speaks
Ali Mazhar, the director of communications at the Population Council, opened the second day.
He said that the first day of the summit focused on the gap between an expanding population and the available resources.
Experts highlighted that ensuring a safe and educated Pakistan is not possible until we take better steps for population management, he said.
Mazhar also noted that the role of Islamic scholars in tackling population growth came under much discussion.
“Scholars have the most influence on our family planning and societal behaviour,” he noted.

9:56am — 2nd day of Pakistan Population Summit begins
The second and final day of the Pakistan Population Summit has begun in Islamabad. The day kicked off with the recitation of the Holy Quran.</p><small>2025-12-02 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/021447524e16c66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958754/first-jcp-meeting-post-27th-amendment-elevates-justice-miangul-hassan-aurangzeb-to-permanent-sc-judge' target='_blank'><strong>First JCP meeting post-27th Amendment elevates Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb to permanent SC judge</strong></a><br><p>The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), which is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary, elevated Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb to a permanent judge of the Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the JCP held its first meeting following the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
The JCP had appointed Justice Aurangzeb as an acting judge of the Supreme Court in February after elevating him from the Islamabad High Court (IHC),
The forum also approved the elevation of Justice Zafara Ahmed Rajput as the chief justice of the Sindh High Court (SHC), and Justice Kamran Mullahkhail as the chief justice of the Balochistan High Court (BHC).
During the meeting, held at the conference room of the SC building, the JCP had considered the appointment of the SHC chief justice from among the three senior-most judges of the high court.
Those considered for the office included Justice Rajput, Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalohoro and Justice Mahmood A. Khan.
Similarly, the JCP had also considered the appointment of the BHC chief justice from among the three senior-most judges of the high court. Those considered for the office included Justice Mullahkhail, Justice Iqbal Ahmed Kasi and Justice Shaukat Ali Rakhshani.
With the establishment of the FCC, where four judges from the SC — Justices Aminuddin Khan, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi — have been appointed, as well as the resignation of Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, the total strength of the SC has reduced to 18 judges from 24.
The JCP meeting was also attended by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Pakistan Bar Council representative Ahsan Bhoon, Senator Farooq Hamid Naek, Senator Syed Ali Zafar, and MNAs Sheikh Aftab Ahmad and Gohar Ali Khan.
A press release issued later said the JCP constituted a committee comprising Justice Farooq, AGP Awan, Naek, Zafar and Bhoon to make draft rules under clause 20 of Article 175A of the Constitution.
The clause calls for the drafting of rules related to the annual performance evaluation of high court judges and to the period granted to a high court judge to improve their performance if it is found to be inefficient.
After the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, changes were made to key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies.
Following these changes, SC’s Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail was included in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Practice and Procedure Committee, while the FCC’s Justice Farooq was made a member of the JCP.
Among the three statutory bodies, the SJC is the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges, the Practice and Procedure Committee forms benches and fixes cases, and the JCP is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.
The SJC also held a meeting today and constituted a committee comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Rizvi and Justice Aalia Neelum to draft rules for regulating its procedures and conduct of business under clause 10 of Article 209 of the Constitution.
“In the meanwhile, the council unanimously adopted the Supreme Judicial Council Procedure of Inquiry, 2025, provisionally,” a press release issued by the body said.</p><small>2025-12-02 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637007-jcp-nominates-bhc-shc-chief-justices' target='_blank'><strong>JCP nominates BHC, SHC chief justices</strong></a><br><p>

Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar tabled the bill amid outcry from some members, particularly those belonging to the PTI and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam—Fazl (JUI-F), and with National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq presiding over the session.
The bill was supported by 160 members, with 79 voting against it.
While the law minister was presenting the bill, several members vocally opposed the bill. At this, Tarar clarified that “neither the law and the Constitution, nor our conscience allows us to make a proposal that contradicts the Quran and Sunnah”.
He said four amendments were suggested to the original draft of the bill, and they had been incorporated into the proposed legislation.
Saying that minorities were defined as “non-Muslims” in the Constitution, he said: “This is a commission for non-Muslims. Our Hindu, Christian and Parsi brothers are as good Pakistanis as we are.”
The minister recalled that a 2014 Supreme Court judgement called for the constitution of a commission for minorities. The matter had landed in the joint sitting after around 10 years, he added, before the debate on the bill began.
During the debate, PTI chairperson and MNA Barrister Gohar Ali Khan pointed out that the bill had landed in the joint session after the President returned without giving his assent and with some objections.
The bill was referred to the president after separate approvals by both houses of Parliament for his assent. However, in late August, the presidency announced that a consensus had been reached on amendments to bill, following which and a revised version was finalised and forwarded to Parliament for reconsideration in a joint session.
“It should be debated why the President did not give his assent to the bill,” Barrister Gohar said.
The PTI chairperson also objected to Section 35 of the bill, which was further elaborated on by JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza.
He said Section 35 of the bill stated that the legislation would have an overriding effect. This meant that being the more recent law, which would be the bill under consideration after its approval, would have an overriding effect on all previous legislation.
He said that the provision should be omitted from the bill in its entirety.
Moreover, he also objected to Section 12 of the bill, which he said gave suo motu powers to the commission to be established under the proposed legislation.
“On one hand, you are taking away suo motu powers from courts. And on the other hand, you are giving this power to commissions,” he said, seemingly referring to the recent 27th Constitutional Amendment that curtailed the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers.
If these two provisions were omitted, he said, “we could say that this [bill] is acceptable”.
Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also participated in the debate, saying that “we are here today to give some people their rights, to legislate so that they get more rights”.
He said at present the biggest issue in Pakistan was the violation of fundamental and civil rights. “There is democracy, [and] you are presiding over a session where there is no opposition […] It is not a good sign.”
He said the opposition’s rights were being trampled. As he went on to express his grievances on this matter, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq interrupted him and asked him to debate on the bill.
At one point during the discussion, the speaker also gave Barrister Gohar the floor, who again called for debating the objections raised by the president. He said the president had pointed out that the term minorities was being defined for the first time; that the chairperson and members of the prospective commission could be removed only in the manner in which the judges of the SC and high courts; the commission would be empowered to create its own posts and upgrade them when n other commission had such powers; and that the commission was being allowed to have an independent account.
The speaker eventually put the bill before the joint session for vote, and the bill was subsequently approved by Parliament with the changes suggested by Senator Murtaza.
According to Article 75(2) of the Constitution, the legislation will now be referred back to the president for his assent. The provision states that “the president shall give his assent within 10 days, failing which such assent shall be deemed to have been given”.

Judicial magistrate Shaista Khan Kundi issued the remand order on the police’s request.
According to a First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Secretariat Police Station, the accident occurred late on Monday night near the Pakistan National Council of Arts (PNCA) in Islamabad, when a black SUV allegedly driven by the judge’s son struck two girls who worked at the PNCA.
The victims were riding a scooter when they were hit by the SUV and reportedly died on the spot. Police reported that the vehicle fled the area immediately after the collision.
The FIR, lodged on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Muhammad Asghar, states that police traced the vehicle through its registration number and later reached a private hospital where the suspect had reportedly been taken for medical treatment.
He was subsequently taken into custody, and medical and forensic samples were collected, and the vehicle was impounded for examination.
Sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 322 (manslaughter) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code have been invoked in the case.
The investigating officer informed the court that further custody was required to complete the investigation, including verification of the suspect’s medical report, vehicle inspection and eyewitness statements.
After reviewing the case record and police request, the court approved physical remand of the suspect for further investigation. The bodies of the deceased were shifted to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences for an autopsy.
Police said efforts were underway to obtain CCTV footage and determine whether speeding or negligence was involved, while authorities assured the families of the victims that the case would be investigated strictly on merit.
In Islamabad in 2022, an SUV allegedly driven by the daughter of a Lahore High Court judge ran over two persons near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.
As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague, Hasnain Ali, were going home at midnight when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
In July, 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the IHC that the vehicle involved in the hit and run case was driven by a woman and was in the use of Supreme Court Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed.
In February this year, a local court in Islamabad acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge. The verdict was announced by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.</p><small>2025-12-02 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636990-imran-khans-sister-granted-permission-to-meet-pti-founder-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sister declares him 'completely healthy' after jail meeting</strong></a><br><p>

“No passenger with complete travel documents is being stopped from travelling, and they will not be stopped,” he said, adding that, however, passengers in possession of “incomplete or bogus documents will definitely not be allowed to travel”.
Naqvi’s assurance and warning follow recent reports of arbitrary offloading at airports of passengers travelling abroad. The reports prompted clarifications by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) that only passengers without complete and correct documents were being stopped from travelling.
The interior minister has also issued similar statements, saying that only those lacking genuine and complete documents were not being allowed to travel abroad.
During his visit to the Lahore airport today, he reiterated the same.
“No passenger who brings disrepute to the country can be allowed to travel,” he further stated, according to PTV News.
The state broadcaster reported that the interior minister also reviewed the immigration process and the system in place for linking passengers’ travel histories with their identity cards and passports at immigration counters.
“He appreciated the performance of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Director Ali Zia and his team on the fast-track system,” the PTV News report said.
Moreover, he visited the immigration counters designated for Pakistanis returning from abroad and enquired from passengers how long the immigration process took.
Passengers expressed satisfaction with the immigration process, the report said, further quoting them as saying that the process was “completed in just two minutes”.







Recently, several incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crackdown on migrant smuggling following last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.
Addressing the matter during a press conference in Lahore yesterday, Naqvi claimed that just 50-70 people were being offloaded daily across the country.
The minister reasserted that there could be some negligence on part of the FIA, but travellers having all necessary documents were not being barred from travelling abroad. He added that the action against travellers with insufficient documents was necessary as “we are trying to improve the ranking of our passport”.</p><small>2025-12-02 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636914-watch-pakistan-china-begin-warrior-ix-joint-counterterrorism-military-exercise' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Pakistan, China begin 'Warrior-IX' joint counterterrorism military exercise</strong></a><br><p>

Police have arrested 13 people for suspected manslaughter in a criminal investigation into last week’s disaster, and the anti-corruption body has also arrested 12 people in a probe into possible graft. It is unclear if any of those people were arrested on both counts.
Authorities have pointed to substandard plastic mesh and insulation foam used during renovation works at Wang Fuk Court as fuelling a blaze that quickly spread to seven high-rise towers, home to more than 4,000 people.
“In order to avoid similar tragedies again, I will set up a judge-led independent committee to examine the reason behind the cause and rapid spreading (of the fire) and related issues,” John Lee, Hong Kong’s chief executive, told a news conference.
Investigators have combed all but two of the seven burnt-out towers, finding bodies of residents in stairwells and on rooftops, trapped as they tried to flee the flames. Around 30 people are still missing.
With pockets of public anger simmering, some groups have called for more transparency and accountability, amid warnings from Beijing and Hong Kong that any attempts to politicise the disaster would be severely punished.
Asked about the detention of a student from one of the groups, and two others who media reported are being investigated for possible sedition, Lee said: “I will not tolerate any crimes, particularly crimes that exploit the tragedy that we are facing now.”
He did not comment on the specific cases.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both issued statements criticising the reported arrests.
“Now is the time for the Hong Kong authorities to transparently investigate the causes of the devastating fire … rather than silencing those who ask legitimate questions,” Amnesty International said.
China’s national security office has warned individuals against using the disaster to “plunge Hong Kong back into the chaos” of 2019, when massive pro-democracy protests challenged Beijing and triggered a political crisis.
“We sternly warn the anti-China disruptors who attempt to disrupt Hong Kong through disaster,” the office said in a statement.
“No matter what methods you use, you will certainly be held accountable and strictly punished.”
Legislative elections due to take place on Sunday will go ahead as planned, Lee said.
Residents warned of fire risks
Residents of Wang Fuk Court were told by authorities last year they faced “relatively low fire risks” after complaining about fire hazards posed by the renovations, the city’s Labour Department said.
The residents raised concerns in September 2024, including about the potential flammability of the mesh that contractors used to cover the scaffolding, a department spokesperson said.
Tests on several samples of a green mesh that was wrapped around bamboo scaffolding on the buildings at the time of the blaze did not match fire retardant standards, officials overseeing the investigations told a news conference on Monday.
Contractors working on the renovations used these substandard materials in hard-to-reach areas, effectively hiding them from inspectors, Chief Secretary Eric Chan said.
Foam insulation used by contractors also fanned the flames and fire alarms at the complex were not working properly, officials have said.
Thousands of residents have turned out to pay tribute to the victims, who include at least nine domestic helpers from Indonesia and one from the Philippines.
Vigils are also due to take place this week in Tokyo, Taipei and London.
Search moves to worst affected buildings
The remaining buildings being scoured for remains are the worst damaged and the search may take weeks, authorities have said.
Images shared by police showed officers clad in hazmat suits, face masks and helmets, inspecting rooms with blackened walls and furniture reduced to ashes, and wading through water used to douse fires that raged for days.
More than 60 pets, including 34 cats, 12 dogs and 7 turtles, perished in the fire, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said. More than 200 were rescued.
The apartment blocks were home to more than 4,000 people, according to census data, and those that escaped must now try to get their lives back on track.
Nearly 1,500 people have been moved out of evacuation centres into temporary housing, with a further 945 put up in youth hostels and hotels, authorities said.
With many residents leaving behind belongings as they fled, authorities have offered emergency funds of HK$10,000 ($1,284) to each household and provided special assistance for issuing new identity cards, passports and marriage certificates.</p><small>2025-12-02 05:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0209445025c5d26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958733/samsung-unveils-first-special-edition-triple-folding-phone' target='_blank'><strong>Samsung unveils first ‘special edition’ triple-folding phone</strong></a><br><p>Samsung launched its first triple-folding phone on Tuesday, a special-edition product with an eyewatering price tag placing it out of the reach of the average consumer.
The Galaxy Z TriFold will go on sale on December 12 and costs more than twice as much as the new iPhone 17 at $2,443.
Super thin, it unfolds to a 10-inch (25.4 centimetre) display, offering “increased possibilities for creating and working”, the South Korean tech giant said.







The triple fold function is not world-first — China’s Huawei beat Samsung to the punch last year with a phone at a similarly exorbitant price.
Growth has been patchy in the competitive smartphone market, pushing makers to find new, eye-catching ways to differentiate their products.
Offered solely in a black design, Samsung’s new device comes in at 309 grammes (10.9 ounces) and at its thinnest point measures less than 0.2 inches.
Generative artificial intelligence features are integrated into the phone, which can give real-time help through screen or camera sharing.
Samsung admitted the Galaxy Z TriFold was “not intended for mass sales”.
Kim Seong-eun, Executive Vice President at Samsung Electronics said it was a “special edition” product.
The launch comes as recent industry numbers suggest Apple is on track to overtake Samsung for the first time in 14 years as the world’s top smartphone maker through 2029.
Apple has also long been rumoured to be planning a foldable iPhone, possibly as early as next year.
The US company’s smartphone shipments are expected to reach a global share of 19.4 per cent in 2025 while Samsung is expected to hold 18.7pc– with Apple effectively dethroning its rival for the first time, according to research firm Counterpoint.</p><small>2025-12-02 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636906-unanimous-kp-assembly-resolution-demands-creation-of-hazara-province' target='_blank'><strong>Unanimous KP Assembly resolution demands creation of Hazara province</strong></a><br><p>

The availability of Nvidia circuits also enables enterprises to access advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for computing and for the locally hosted AI infrastructure.

 

The development comes amid restrictions by the US on Nvidia from exporting its AI chips, particularly to China, amid a trade war between the two powerhouses. Data Vault, however, said they had a “special” approval from Nvidia for their GPUs.
Besides export restrictions, global GPU shortages and high import costs have also limited Pakistan’s ability to adopt enterprise-grade AI.

Powered by Nvidia enterprise-grade GPUs, data centre to boost artificial intelligence adoption, improve cybersecurity by keeping data within country

However, this project, which was approved after strict checks, provides Pakistan with an opportunity to capitalise on Nvidia accelerators to unlock its AI potential.
The move is likely to upgrade Pakistan’s AI adoption across sectors, such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, public safety, logistics, agriculture, and government services, by providing the high-performance computing power and compliance-ready environment needed for modern AI applications.
Mehwish Salman Ali, Data Vault chief executive officer, said Data Vault Pakistan was the only data centre in the country providing GPU services. “Though it is difficult, we have obtained more than 3,000 GPUs for usage and provide them as services,” Ms Ali said, adding, “This has made us the only AI-enabled data centre based in the country.”

 

According to Ms Ali, Data Vault Pakistan has “official and special” approval from Nvidia for GPUs and they buy these from Nvidia partners.
“There is a global shortage of GPUs and there are US export-control sanctions. Pakistan is also on the restricted list, so in normal circumstances, no one in Pakistan can buy these enterprise-grade GPUs legally,” she said, adding that their company went through very “strict technical, compliance and financing checks” for this.

 

“We started this process early, committed to a multi-year programme and went through their authorised partners, so our project was approved,” she added.
It may be noted that GPU is a specialised electronic circuit designed for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present either as a component on a discrete graphics card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles. This partnership will also help Telenor customers to gain on-demand access to GPU-as-a-Service (GPUaaS).
Data protection
The company has said that the availability of sovereign GPU infrastructure locally will help Pakistani researchers, startups, enterprises, and universities develop LLMs for Urdu and regional languages, as well as sector-specific AI for fintech and other purposes. As AI is redefining every industry, the core of this revolution lies in GPU computing.
Moreover, by keeping all data within Pakistan, the sovereign cloud strengthens cybersecurity, defence, auditability and transparency, access control and identity management, privacy and digital trust, and national data protection.
As data processing will be entirely within Pakistan’s borders and hosted inside Data Vault’s high-density AI data centre, this will eliminate the risk of the transfer of sensitive datasets, including financial transactions, healthcare imaging, telecom data, and government records, to be processed outside the country.
Currently, there are several sovereign cloud services primarily managed by telecom companies, including the state-owned PTCL and the National Telecommunication Corporation (NTC). But the Pakistani enterprises and public institutions have relied on offshore cloud regions for AI workloads.

According to officials, a woman “launched the suicide bombing” at 8:40pm, targeting the paramilitary force’s headquarters. The banned Balochistan Liberation Front issued the bomber’s picture and identified her as Zinat Rafiq.
Officials said that three militants were killed as soon as they entered the FC fort, while others managed to enter the compound, adding that they had cleared the compound. Locals, however, said intermittent firing continued till Monday evening.

Winding up the debate on a motion moved by JUI-F’s Kamran Murtaza in the Senate on Monday, the finance minister said the report covered seven areas, including judicial oversight and corruption, and identifies structural deficiencies — which he termed a positive development. He said it provided 15 recommendations for institutional reforms.
He assured the Senate that work on these recommendations was underway, citing the recent law passed by parliament requiring public servants to declare their assets. “We will share our action plan on institutional reforms with the public and parliament,” he said, adding that such diagnostic reports had been released for many countries and represented best practices to assess governance in other jurisdictions.
He dismissed concerns over a delay in releasing the report, which some critics linked to corruption-related findings, saying the process took time because input had to be gathered from relevant institutions.

Aurangzeb rejects delay claims, cites thorough review process

The finance minister rejected the perception that the government had delayed or attempted to withhold the publication of the IMF report, telling the house that the document underwent a rigorous review process involving extensive consultations. “I come from the private sector,” he said. “When a report is issued, it is circulated among departments, feedback is taken, some points are incorporated, others are rejected.”
Mr Aurangzeb said that around 100 meetings were held and more than 30 institutions were involved in the compilation process. He dispelled the impression that the IMF report had any connection to the latest audit report of the Auditor General of Pakistan or a separate report issued by the State Bank of Pakistan.
He also endorsed points raised regarding governance improvements, professional capacity in technical ministries and remuneration reforms. These matters, he said, were being reviewed by the Civil Service Reforms Committee headed by Planning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal, of which he is also a member.
The finance minister also highlighted the government’s efforts to digitise the economy, emphasising its potential for transparency and efficiency, saying it was faster, cheaper and more transparent.
He added that the FBR chairman should brief lawmakers on steps taken to shift towards a digital economy. Kamran Murtaza suggested referring the matter to a committee for discussion, calling the report an important document that raised concerns about the country’s judicial system and overall governance.
Climate change
Meanwhile, Federal Minister Aurangzeb on Monday said climate change is an urgent economic reality for Pakistan, reaffirming the government’s commitment to advancing sustainable finance, implementing green taxonomy and establishing climate-aligned disclosure frameworks.
Stressing the need to support SMEs in formalising their financial reporting practices, he highlighted the country’s proactive regulatory approach in digital assets and emerging technologies, where new institutional frameworks are being established to integrate innovation into a formal, transparent, and compliant economy.
The finance minister made these observations while meeting a delegation, led by Jean Bouquot, president of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).—With input from APP

In its latest monthly report, the Islamabad-based think tank said 292 people were killed and 164 injured in anti-state violence and security forces’ counter-measures across the country in November.
PICSS noted that November witnessed “more measured actions” by security forces, reflected in a steep decline in their losses — from 72 fatalities in October to 25 in Nov­ember — a reduction of about 65pc. Civilian deaths, however, surged by 80pc, rising to 54 in November compared with 30 in October.

 

Data showed that militants accounted for the overwhelming majority of those killed as 206 militants — about 71pc of total fatalities — were eliminated during the mon­th, while militancy also claimed the lives of seven members of pro-government peace committees.

PICSS records 292 fatalities in November

The injured comprised 83 security forces personnel, 67 civilians, 10 militants and four peace committee members.
The report said the country experienced 97 militant attacks in November, up from 89 in October. Mainland Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) remained the main theatres of counter-militancy operations, with the killing of 137 militants in the former and 58 in the latter.
The month also recorded a notable spike in suicide attacks. Four suicide bombings were documented in November, compared with just one in October. One attack each occur­red in Islamabad, KP, Balochistan and erstwhile Fata.
These attacks left 31 people dead, including 15 militants, 12 civilians and four security forces personnel. A total of 64 people were injured in suicide attacks, among them 41 civilians and 23 security forces personnel.
The report underlined that suicide bombings have increased on a year-on-year basis. PICSS said 24 suicide attacks were recorded in the first 11 months of 2025, compared with 17 in all of 2024, indicating a clear upward trend in this particularly lethal tactic.
Overall, the first 11 months of 2025 have been exceptionally bloody. Citing its database, PICSS reported a total of 3,144 conflict-related deaths between January and November 2025. These include 1,940 militants, 626 security forces personnel, 563 civilians and 15 members of pro-government peace committees.
It assessed that 2025 is the deadliest year for militants since 2015.

The meeting, mediated by Saudi Arabia late on Sunday evening, was aimed at addressing tensions between the two countries following border clashes in October and Pakistan’s demand for action against terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil.
According to officials, the Afghan Taliban delegation was led by Anas Haqqani and Rahmatullah Najib. The Pakistani side included officials who had participated in earlier rounds in Istanbul under the Turkiye-Qatar track. A diplomat from the Foreign Office (FO) was added to the Pakistani delegation.
However, unlike the lengthier sessions held in Doha and Qatar, the Riyadh conversation wrapped up quickly, with one source describing it as “a short exchange rather than extended negotiations”.

Saudi authorities facilitate talks quietly; Pakistan rejects appeal for bilateral trade resumption; another round of negotiations likely

Sources said Islamabad reiterated the clear message that Kabul must take concrete action against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist groups based on Afghan soil.
The Taliban delegation, too, held firmly to its stance, resulting in no tangible movement.
Trade resumption
Saudi officials, who remain keen to play a sustained diplomatic role, urged both sides to keep channels open. They also encouraged Pakistan to consider allowing the resumption of bilateral trade while counterterrorism dis­c­­­u­­s­­sions continue. The proposal was, however, rejec­ted by Islamabad, the sources added.
The Riyadh initiative came as the separate Tur­kiye-Qatar-mediated track rema­ined stalled. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had earlier signalled plans to send a delegation to Islamabad, but the visit has not materialised. The Turkiye-Qatar effort had produced a fragile ceasefire, though the FO spokesperson said the truce had faltered because it was “contingent on a halt in terrorist activities”.
Despite the lack of breakthrough, sources said, Saudi Arabia intends to stay engaged and may convene another round of talks in the near future.

Speaking on a point of order, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan member Iftikhar Alam strongly protested the incident and asked when the provincial government would address the issue.
He said that a large number of manholes across the city, including the areas administered by cantonment boards, were without covers.
Jamaat-i-Islami’s lone MPA Muhammad Farooq called for the mayor’s resignation, citing repeated failures in ensuring public safety.

Muttahida stages walkout; JI wants mayor’s resignation; PTI demands stringent laws; Sharjeel promises accountability

Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmaker Rehan Bandukda expressed deep sorrow over the incident and pushed for new laws to hold officials accountable for negligence leading to such incidents.
The situation took an unpleasant turn when Deputy Speaker Anthony Naveed denied Leader of the Opposition Ali Khurshidi to speak about the tragic incident, leading to a walkout by the MQM-P members.
Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon assured the house that those responsible would be punished, emphasising that human life was precious.
“The chief minister has ordered an inquiry into the incident, and the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation has been directed to investigate,” he added.
Mr Memon said that as soon as the incident occurred, rescue teams had reached the spot, and all the images of the rescue operation were available.
He said that the city mayor had told him that 88,000 sewer covers have been installed this year.

 

The senior minister said that the person whose negligence caused this incident must be held accountable, and if there was any responsibility on his part as a minister, he was ready to accept it.
He emphasised that nothing was more precious than human life and that ensuring safety was a collective responsibility.
Mr Memon praised the opposition’s approach in raising this issue and assured that a strictest action would be taken against any officer of any department found negligent, and full action will also be taken against those responsible for this incident.
Later, Speaker Syed Awais Qadir Shah adjourned the house to Tuesday (today).
