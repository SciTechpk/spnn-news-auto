The premier made the remarks while addressing a breakfast event at the Pakistan Pavilion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.
In his remarks, the premier said Pakistan “is moving forward with a sense of achievement and a sense of purpose”, noting a drop in the inflation rate and a reduction in the policy rate.
However, he noted that exports were facing challenges and that social indicators “need to be improved through continuous joint efforts”.
“Our exports, collectively, do face different kinds of challenges,” the premier noted. “But the way forward is very clear: Pakistan has to have export-led growth,” he asserted.
PM Shehbaz said that the government brought in “fundamental structural changes” to the system, such as digitalising revenue collection. He stated that the tax collection-to-GDP ratio stood at 10.5pc, compared to 9pc two years ago, hailing it as a “significant achievement”.



“We are now in the mines and minerals business in a big way,” PM Shehbaz added, citing agreements and memoranda of understanding with American and Chinese companies.
“Pakistan has been blessed with infinite natural resources still buried in the heap of mountains in the north of Pakistan, in Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan,” he said.
He added that Pakistan was “moving speedily” in the fields of cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and information technology (IT).
“Our IT exports have shown remarkable progress in the last few years, in that we brought a lot of instruments which have facilitated IT exports, which stand at $3bn annually,” he said.
In terms of the youth, PM Shehbaz said that the federal and provincial governments had enacted many programmes to empower the youth through vocational training.
“As a result, our youth [are] getting productive employment in Gulf states and other parts of the world because they are highly qualified and highly trained,” he emphasised.
PM Shehbaz then touched on improving relations with the United States, expressing the hope that Islamabad and Washington would “cooperate with each other in a big way” in the fields of mines and minerals, counter-terrorism, IT and AI.
“I think Pakistan is at a point in time where we are going to take off rapidly in agriculture, industry, the mining industry, AI and IT,” the prime minister said. “I think that the future is very promising, I have no doubt about it.”
IMF’s Georgieva acknowledges Pakistan’s reform efforts
Earlier, PM Shehbaz had met International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the WEF.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz briefed Georgieva on the improvement in Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators, stabilisation efforts and progress on institutional reforms.
He stressed Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal discipline, revenue mobilisation and sustainable development, the statement said.







The IMF official acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s reform efforts, the statement said. She stressed the importance of maintaining the momentum of reforms to ensure long-term economic resilience, it added.
The two sides discussed the global economic outlook, challenges faced by emerging economies and the importance of multilateral cooperation in safeguarding economic stability, it added.
Earlier, PM Shehbaz had also met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
According to the PMO, Mustafa expressed his heartfelt gratitude to PM Shehbaz for “Pakistan’s consistent, principled and unwavering support for the Palestinian people”.







“Mustafa personally walked up to PM Shehbaz and introduced himself,” the statement said.
“The Palestinian prime minister thanked Pakistan for supporting the Palestinian stance at international forums and for its role regarding the Palestinian cause,” it added.
The premier is on a three-day visit to the Swiss town (from January 20-22), primarily to lead a high-level delegation from Pakistan, including Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The premier arrived in Davos on Tuesday. In a post on X, PM Shehbaz wrote that he was visiting Davos to advance Pakistan’s engagement at the WEF with global trade and investment partners.
“Pakistan’s ongoing economic reform journey is unlocking profound opportunities, driven by a resilient and entrepreneurial workforce and significant potential across energy, agriculture, minerals, and emerging technologies,” PM Shehbaz said.







He added that Pakistan was “ready to harness this potential into mutually beneficial economic cooperation and long-term investment”.
Dar’s engagements
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar inaugurated the Pathfinder Group’s Pakistan Pavilion on the sidelines of the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, according to a post by the Foreign Office on X.
The foreign minister lauded the initiative to showcase Pakistan’s vast economic potential and emerging opportunities on a global platform, while highlighting the dynamism and innovation of the country’s start-ups.







He underscored the critical role of start-ups in advancing socio-economic development and driving innovation across diverse sectors.
FM Dar reaffirmed the government’s commitment to facilitating and promoting entrepreneurs and start-ups, particularly those led by youth, to fully realise the economic potential.
In another post on X by the FO, the foreign minister met his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand on the sidelines of the WEF 2026 meeting.
The two foreign ministers “agreed to explore ways to enhance Pakistan-Canada ties” and “discussed to upscale and strengthen economic and trade relations”, the social media post said.







Later, a post by the FO said Dar also met Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen and expand Pak-Finland bilateral cooperation in key areas, including trade and investment,” the FO’s post stated.







It added that they also exchanged views on important regional and global developments.
“Both sides emphasised advancing a forward-looking and mutually beneficial partnership,” it further stated.</p><small>2026-01-21 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21220522dcb0a9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968246/dispersal-of-power-actually-multiplies-it-khawaja-asif-again-argues-in-favour-of-empowered-local-govt-system' target='_blank'><strong>‘Dispersal of power actually multiplies it’: Khawaja Asif again argues in favour of empowered local govt system</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday reiterated his argument in favour of an empowered local government system, saying that the “dispersal of power actually multiplies power” and “concentration of power diminishes it”.
His fresh remarks come a day after he called for a “meaningful” constitutional amendment to introduce an empowered local government system in the country. During a speech in the National Assembly on Tuesday, he had also remarked that the 18th Amendment had proven to be a “farce” and had “concentrated all powers in provincial capitals”.
The debate in the lower House of Parliament was sparked during a discussion on the Gul Plaza inferno, with Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s Farooq Sattar calling for the creation of more administrative units for better governance in Karachi and strengthening local government systems.
Asif had endorsed Sattar’s views during the NA session.
On Wednesday, he said on X that “empowering local governments means taking the government to the common man’s doorstep”.







In such a scenario, he said, governments in cities such as Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, and Peshawar would be accessible to 250 million people in the country.
He decried that the local government system had not been made functional despite the 18th Amendment — which has devolved several ministeries and departments to the provinces from the Centre but also requires them to further devolve powers to local governments.
The defence minister contended that when a local government system will become functional, “people will not be dependent on bureaucracy and will be able to elect empowered representatives and institutions through their vote”.
And the common man would be able to hold them accountable if they don’t deliver, he added.
He further stated that amenities such as water, sanitation, education and healthcare would be available to the people through the local government system, which would establish its own taxation system.
“There are countless examples of this in the world; to some extent, even the judicial system and police are under the authority of elected local governments,” he said, adding that “weak and local bodies do not deliver”.
“Politically, they cause damage, not benefit.”
The defence minister stressed that strengthening local bodies would help establish the authority of the people and strengthen and sustain the bond between the government and the people.
“Empower the people through local institutions. Do not keep these institutions subordinate to the bureaucracy.
“Dispersal of power actually multiplies power. Concentration of power diminishes it,” he said.
Constitutional amendments
The MQM-P has been calling for empowering local governments for long, and had also proposed that a provision to this effect be included in the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed last year. It later blamed the PPP for opposing the proposal, saying that it was eventually withdrawn from the legislation.
The party has, however, claimed that its proposal will be included in the next constitutional amendment.
During his speech in the NA on Tuesday, Asif said: “The 18th Amendment has proved to be a farce. All powers have been concentrated in provincial capitals. There are no local governments, and where they do exist, they have no power.”
He supported the MQM-P’s demand for empowering the local government system, saying that given Karachi’s size, it was not humanly possible to manage it within the existing system.
“If we want to empower the people of Pakistan in a true sense, a local government system would have to be introduced,” he said.
He also recalled the initially proposed provision pertaining to local governments included in the 27th Amendment, saying that it had to be withdrawn due to “political wrangling”.
The defence minister also called for a uniform curriculum across the country, which he said was also proposed in the 27th Amendment. But the recommendation had to be “dropped as no agreement was reached” on it, he regretted.
Reiterating his demand for a local government system, he said, “This House will be meaningless unless the people are empowered.”
He said this country needed a system in which the people feel empowered, calling for constitutional amendments for the introduction of an empowered local government system and a uniform curriculum across the country.</p><small>2026-01-21 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2119564987f1bc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968203/30-bodies-recovered-from-single-shop-following-deadly-fire-at-karachis-gul-plaza' target='_blank'><strong>30 bodies recovered from single shop following deadly fire at Karachi’s Gul Plaza</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: In a harrowing development, at least 30 bodies were recovered from a gutted shop as rescuers combed through the wreckage of Karachi’s Gul Plaza on Wednesday.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the remains of 30 humans had been recovered from a shop called “Dubai Crockery” located on the mezzanine floor.
He said that earlier in the day, rescue workers had recovered three more bodies, which had taken the toll from 28 to 31. He added that with the discovery of the bodies from the gutted shop, the death toll was estimated to have risen to 61.
However, he cautioned that a final conclusion about the death toll could only be reached after receiving the DNA reports.
He said that the relatives of those missing as well as the shopkeepers had previously indicated the possibility of there being a large number of people at the shop.
Raza said that as per the last contact with the victims, they had believed they would be safe and the fire would be controlled but had suffocated to death while waiting.
Regarding the visit of a bomb disposal squad to the scene of the fire, the South police chief said that so far no evidence of mischief had emerged during the initial investigation.
A resident of the area, Rasheed, told Dawn that the shop had announced a sale for the wedding season. For this purpose, it had decided to stay open till 2am, even though it usually closed at 10pm.
The fire had erupted at the Gul Plaza on Saturday night. While the fire at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, visited the gutted plaza. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner.
Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous.
Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards.
The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far.
“We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared.
KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots.
He said one portion of the building had been cleared while two other portions were in the process of being cleared.
“We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable.
He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was recieved about the fire on Saturday night.
He further added that shopkeepers had created a chaos-like situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops.
He said that the door leading to the buildin’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted which was why all the exits were closed.
Rimpa Plaza affected due to blaze
According to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), a part of the structure of Rimpa Plaza — another shopping mall adjacent to Gul Plaza — has also been affected due to continued exposure to heat and fire.
SBCA Director General Muzammil Halepota told Dawn that three floors of the 13-storey building had been affected, and a SBCA technical committee had visited the site on Tuesday.
They found that two pillars had been weakened and the SBCA suggested jacketing to strengthen the pillars by adding a layer of steel supports around them.
“An SBCA team has started the process,” Halepota said, adding that a notice had also been issued to the owners of Rimpa Plaza regarding the pillars’ repair.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi also visited Gul Plaza. Speaking to the media at the site, he said the inquiry into the incident was a complicated one as it had multiple angles.
He said the matter would have to be probed from all angles, and the inquiry committee would try to make “long-term and far-reaching recommendations” to the government.
Tessori meets delegation of traders
Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met a delegation led by Gul Plaza President Tanveer Pasta and Karachi Chamber of Commerce’s Javed Balwani.
A statement issued by the governor’s office said Pasta appreciated Tessori’s efforts for the “timely rescue operation and effective measures” after the fire erupted at Gul Plaza and thanked him for “raising his voice for the victims” of the tragedy at every forum.
“During the meeting, Tanveer Pasta agreed, in principle, with the recommendations of the Sindh governor and Karachi Chamber of Commerce,” the statement said, without elaborating on the said recommendations.
All Gul Plaza records available, SBCA maintains
The SBCA, a day earlier, had rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”.
“The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”.
According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998.
“Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said.
“A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.”
The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies.
It is worth noting that South DIG Asad Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire.
“The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body.
“The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.</p><small>2026-01-21 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/212126105ec97c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968236/pakistan-7-muslim-countries-announce-decision-to-join-trumps-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, 7 Muslim countries announce decision to join Trump’s Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and seven other Muslim-majority countries on Wednesday released a statement announcing their decision to join US President Donald Trump’s so-called ‘Board of Peace’.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Qatar welcomed the invitation “extended to their leaders” by Trump.
“The ministers announce their countries’ shared decision to join the Board of Peace. Each country will sign the joining documents according to its respective relevant legal and other necessary procedures, including Egypt, Pakistan, and the UAE, that have already announced to join,” the joint statement said.
It should be noted that all eight countries had worked with Trump in October last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. The UAE had announced its decision to join the board on Tuesday while Pakistan and Egypt had separately announced it on Wednesday.







“The ministers reiterate their countries’ support for the peace efforts led by President Trump, and reaffirm their countries’ commitment to supporting the implementation of the mission of the Board of Peace as a transitional administration, as set out in the Comprehensive Plan to end the Gaza Conflict and endorsed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803, aimed at consolidating a permanent ceasefire, supporting the reconstruction of Gaza, and advancing a just and lasting peace grounded in the Palestinian right to self-determination and statehood in accordance with international law, thereby paving the way for security and stability for all countries and peoples of the region,” the statement said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working with regional partners for peace in Gaza.
“Pakistan has been and will continue to work with our brotherly Arab- Islamic countries for lasting peace in Gaza and for ensuring the right to self-determination of our Palestinian brothers and sisters,” he said on X.







The development came hours after a separate announcement by the Foreign Office (FO) said Pakistan had accepted US President Donald Trump’s invitation to join the so-called “Board of Peace” with the view to “achieving lasting peace in Gaza”. The invitation for Pakistan to join the Board of Peace was extended last week.
“In response to the invitation extended to Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif by President of the United States Donald J. Trump, Pakistan would like to announce its decision to join the Board of Peace as part of its ongoing efforts to support the implementation of the Gaza peace plan under the framework of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803,” the FO said in a statement.







The statement added that Pakistan was hopeful that with the creation of this framework, “concrete steps will be taken towards the implementation of a permanent ceasefire, further scaling up of humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, as well as reconstruction of Gaza”.
“Pakistan also hopes that these efforts will lead to the realisation of the right to self-determination of the people of Palestine, through a credible, time-bound political process, consistent with international legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions, resulting in the establishment of an independent, sovereign, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital,” the statement read.
The FO concluded the statement, saying: “Pakistan looks forward to continuing to play a constructive role as part of the Board of Peace for the achievement of these goals as well as to end the suffering of our Palestinian brothers and sisters.”
Trump had originally proposed establishing the board when he announced his plan last September to end the conflict in Gaza. But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlined a broad role for the body in ending conflicts globally.
A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.
The inclusion of a ‘charter’ in the invitation letter triggered concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.
Meanwhile, Financial Times has reported that the Trump administration plans to expand its Board of Peace into a permanent global entity to rival the UN.

 

According to the charter sent to prospective members, the board is designed to be a “more nimble and effective international peace-building body” chaired by Donald Trump himself.
The board would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts, according to the charter’s copy seen by Reuters.
The draft charter grants broad executive authority to Trump and allows him to serve as chairman indefinitely, subject only to voluntary resignation or removal due to incapacity confirmed by a unanimous board vote.
The document gives the chairman the authority to appoint and remove member states — decisions that would require a two-thirds majority vote to overturn. According to the text, Trump would hold effective veto power over board decisions. The charter states rulings will be “made by a majority of the member states present and voting, subject to the approval of the chairman”.
It also grants him the “exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities” to fulfill the board’s mission.
The charter critiques current international structures and advocates for pragmatic judgement, common sense, and courage to abandon often ineffective methods and institutions for lasting peace.
Only a few, including Hungary, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have so far accepted the invitation to join the board without reservations.

Since October 10, a fragile US-sponsored ceasefire in Gaza has largely halted the fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas, but both sides have alleged frequent violations.
In a statement, the civil defence said “the bodies of the three journalists killed in an Israeli air strike in the Al-Zahra area southwest of Gaza City were transported to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah”.
It named the dead as Mohammed Salah Qashta, Abdul Raouf Shaat and Anas Ghneim.
Shaat had contributed regularly to AFP as a photo and video journalist, but at the time of the strike, he was not on assignment for the agency.
In a statement, the Israeli military said troops had “identified several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas in the central Gaza Strip”.
The military did not elaborate on what it meant by a “drone affiliated with Hamas”.
“Due to the threat that the drone posed to the troops, the (Israeli military) precisely struck the suspects who activated the drone,” it said, adding that the details were under review.
The civil defence, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authority, said in an earlier statement that an Israeli drone strike had targeted “a civilian vehicle” near Al-Zahra.
Vehicle ‘criminally targeted’
According to an eyewitness, the journalists were using a drone to take images of aid distribution by the Egyptian Relief Committee in the Gaza Strip when a strike targeted a vehicle accompanying them.
The Egyptian aid group confirmed one of its vehicles was targeted by Israel in a strike that killed three people.
“A vehicle belonging to the Egyptian Committee was targeted during a humanitarian mission, resulting in the martyrdom of three individuals,” said Mohammed Mansour, a spokesman for the Egyptian Relief Committee in the Gaza Strip, adding that all vehicles belonging to the group “bear the committee’s logo”.
“The Israeli army criminally targeted this vehicle” when the individuals were filming the Netzarim camp, Mansour said.
AFP footage showed the vehicle charred, with mangled remains lying in an open area.
Hamas called the strike “a dangerous escalation of the flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement.”
The Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate, meanwhile, condemned the strike as part of a “systematic and deliberate policy pursued by the Israeli occupation to intentionally target Palestinian journalists”.
Israeli forces have killed at least 466 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect, according to the territory’s health ministry.
The Israeli military said Palestinian fighters killed three of its soldiers during the same period.
Gaza’s health ministry said another eight Palestinians were also killed in Israeli attacks in the territory on Wednesday.
Journalists under fire
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said that Israeli forces killed at least 29 Palestinian journalists in Gaza between December 2024 and December 2025.
The deadliest single attack was a so-called “double-tap” strike on a hospital in south Gaza on August 25, which killed five journalists, including two contributors to international news agencies Reuters and the Associated Press.
Since Israel’s bombardment of Gaza began in October 2023 following Hamas’s attack, nearly 220 journalists have been killed by Israel, making the Palestinian territory by far the deadliest place for journalists, RSF data says.
The Israeli military claims that several journalists it targeted in Gaza had been “terrorists” affiliated with Palestinian armed groups.
Last week, US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff announced the start of phase two of the Gaza ceasefire, saying it aimed to pave the way for reconstruction and the demilitarisation of all armed factions in the territory.
The strike on Wednesday came hours after the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he had accepted an invitation to join US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” aimed at resolving conflicts.</p><small>2026-01-21 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646465-politicians-behind-18th-amendment-responsible-for-its-non-execution-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Politicians behind 18th Amendment responsible for its non-execution: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>

“People thought I would use force, but I don’t have to use force,” Trump said at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Switzerland.
“I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.”
Trump took a hectoring tone, chastising the United States’ European allies for their insolence, disloyalty and policy missteps in areas ranging from wind power and the environment to immigration and geopolitics.
Trump’s increasing threats to Europe over Greenland have frayed transatlantic ties and worried Europeans, overshadowing a speech that was intended to focus primarily on the US economy.
Calling Denmark “ungrateful,” the Republican US president played down the issue as a “small ask” over a “piece of ice” and that an acquisition would be no threat to the Nato alliance, which includes Denmark and the United States.







“No nation or group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland other than the United States,” Trump said, adding: “I’m seeking immediate negotiations to once again to discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States.”
On several occasions during a speech that lasted more than an hour, Trump mistakenly referred to Greenland as Iceland.







Trump, who marked the end of a turbulent first year in office on Tuesday, is set to overshadow the agenda of the WEF, where global elites chew over economic and political trends.
Nato leaders have warned that Trump’s Greenland strategy could upend the alliance, while the leaders of Denmark and Greenland have offered a wide array of ways for a greater US presence on the strategic island territory of 57,000 people.
“We want a piece of ice for world protection, and they won’t give it,” Trump said in his speech to a packed congress hall.
Hundreds of delegates gathered in the lobby to listen or watch Trump’s speech on video monitors or on mobile phones. After an hour, most of them had tuned out and resumed chatting.
Greenland releases ‘crisis’ guidelines as Trump threat looms
Meanwhile, Greenland’s government on Wednesday unveiled a new brochure offering advice to the population in the event of a “crisis” in the territory.
Guidance includes stockpiling food and water, hunting weapons and ammunition.
The document is “an insurance policy”, said Self-Sufficiency Minister Peter Borg at a press conference in Nuuk, the Greenlandic capital.
“We don’t expect to have to use it,” Borg said.
Work on the brochure, titled ‘Prepared for Crises — Be Self-Sufficient for Five Days’, began last year “against a backdrop of power outages of varying duration”, according to the Greenland government.
The guidance recommends storing five days’ worth of food, three litres of water per person per day, toilet paper, a battery-powered radio, plus weapons, ammunition and fishing equipment.
Greenland’s 57,000-strong population — nearly 90 per cent indigenous Inuit people — has long traditions of hunting and fishing as the primary means of subsistence.</p><small>2026-01-21 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/212121210e51e2b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968245/ptis-gohar-urges-govt-to-hold-unconditional-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Gohar urges govt to hold ‘unconditional’ dialogue</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday urged the government to hold “unconditional” talks with the opposition, saying that there should be no conditions in dialogue between political parties.
Speaking to the media, Gohar said that it was wrong to say that negotiations would only be held on specific topics.
“It is wrong to say that negotiations will be held on this topic but this topic cannot be included in negotiations,” he said.
“If you want to hold dialogue, you should speak on all topics,” he said. At the same time, the PTI chairman said that he did not have the authority to negotiate with the government.
He said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas — who were recently appointed opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate, respectively — had been given the authority to hold talks with the government.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has stated that PTI founder Imran Khan has given Achakzai and Abbas the responsibility of making decisions — be it about talks with the government or protests.
“I will give them my consultation if they require it,” Gohar said.
He further said that if the government wished to “shake the hand” of the opposition, it should do so with both of its hands.
“The stick and carrot policy does not work. [Throwing] a punch with one hand and extending the other one does not work,” he said.
Gohar also said that PTI founder Imran was facing a multitude of cases, adding that the ex-premier’s lawyers should be allowed to meet him.
He said that a PTI delegation had held a meeting with National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and highlighted the fact that meetings with Imran were not being allowed.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
However, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran.
Meanwhile, in his maiden speech as the National Assembly opposition leader on Monday, Achakzai had extended an olive branch to the government and offered “unconditional support” to empower Parliament.
PTI rejects NA’s passage of bill seeking to amend Elections Act
Separately, the PTI rejected the passage of the Elections (Amendment) Bill 2026 by the National Assembly, terming it a “direct assault” on the fundamental principles of the right to information, transparency, and accountability.
“This bill grants parliamentarians the ability to hide details of their assets from the public under the vague and undefined guise of ‘security concerns,’ which essentially provides a legal shield for the current ruling class,” the party said in a statement.
“Such laws do not strengthen democracy; instead, they weaken it and severely undermine the public’s trust in the government,” it said.
The PTI alleged that parties which claimed to champion democracy, transparency, and parliamentary values were now legislating to “conceal the ill-gotten wealth” they had accumulated through “corrupt practices and misuse of power”.
“The nation is well aware of the sources of their illicit wealth; it is the result of corruption, looting, and the abuse of authority,” it said.
“The public is fully informed, and no law can hide the truth. This bill is an affront to the consciousness of the people.
“These parties, who repeatedly preach about accountability, good governance, and democratic values, are practically erecting walls of immunity and protection for themselves,” it stated.
The PTI contended that such laws proved that some political parties represented not the public but their own personal and class interests, and the dual standard was hollowing out Pakistan’s democratic system from within.
“If any member of parliament has genuine security concerns, the solution is not to hide assets, but for the government to ensure the protection of their life and property,” it said.
“Keeping asset details hidden from the public opens the door to corruption and provides the political elite with unjust protection for their ill-gotten wealth,” it said.
The PTI said that this bill contradicted the global principles of transparent governance and was a “conspiracy” to push Pakistan further into the quagmire of unchecked corruption.
“In line with the vision of PTI’s leader Imran Khan, the party has always been a strong advocate for transparency. Therefore, this controversial amendment must be immediately revoked,” it said.
“The nation has the right to be informed about the sources of its representatives’ wealth. Transparency is not a privilege but the foundation of democracy,” it added.</p><small>2026-01-21 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646461-pakistani-national-deported-from-us-after-green-card-interview-family-appeals-for-review' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani national deported from US after green card interview; family appeals for review</strong></a><br><p>

Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omar Sarfraz Cheema made the remarks in a letter sent through their advocate.
The development comes as debate has been raging in the country on raising the voting age from 18 to 25, with the topic also being discussed on TV shows. It is worth mentioning that no formal bill has been tabled in parliament for raising the voting age in Pakistan.
A column published in Dawn on Wednesday also stated that “well-connected people” were floating the idea of raising the voting age to 25 as a possible reform.
In the letter, seen by Dawn, the PTI leaders said Pakistan had witnessed its first general elections in 1970, when the voting age was 21 years. However, with the advent of the 21st century, the world transformed into a global village because of which any incident anywhere in the world could be seen in “real time”.
They said that Pakistan too realized that the voting age limit should be reduced from 21 years to 18 years. And no segment of society objected to it, they added.
They said that since the government had set the age for obtaining a national identity card and getting married at 18 years, there was no justification for increasing the voting age.
“Is this mindset suggestive of fear of the power of the youth and distrust of their conscience?” they asked in the letter.
They said that in the past, a reform was introduced for graduation being compulsory for contesting elections, which had be withdrawn later.
They added that the youth’s insight, perception, decision-power and collective wisdom were the nation’s assets and could be used to do wonders in the country.
The jailed leaders warned that the youth would not let the wheel of history move backwards and would fight against the “fear-driven mindset”.
The PTI leaders hoped that all political parties in the country, particularly the PML-N and the PPP, would not support any fear-driven mindset to suppressthe the youth’s right to vote.
In recent days, social media has been abuzz with commentary noting that since Pakistan’s electorate is primarily between the ages of 18 and 25, any change in the voting age would significantly alter the voter base.
The opposition voices and analysts also argue that such a move would amount to youth disenfranchisement rather than reform.
Commentators on social media have also pointed out that raising the voting age would require a constitutional amendment, which requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.</p><small>2026-01-21 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/211830158a11848.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india' target='_blank'><strong>ICC rejects Bangladesh’s plea to play T20 World Cup matches outside India</strong></a><br><p>The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday announced that it would not be making any changes to the Men’s T20 World Cup schedule or groups, days after Bangladesh requested that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka after refusing to play in India.
Bangladesh announced on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had “formally requested” the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England’s Group C. The team is scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the ICC said the decision was reached after “considering all security assessments conducted, including independent reviews, all of which indicated there was no threat to Bangladesh players, media persons, officials and fans at any tournament venues in the country”.







“It was noted that it was not feasible to make changes so close to the tournament and that altering the schedule under the circumstances, in the absence of any credible security threat, could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body,” the statement added.
According to the statement, an ICC spokesperson said that the governing body had engaged the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for the past few weeks with the “clear objective of enabling Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament”.
But that despite these efforts, the BCB repeatedly linked its participation “to a single, isolated and unrelated development concerning one of its player’s involvement in a domestic league”.
“This linkage has no bearing on the tournament’s security framework or the conditions governing participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.
Separately, Cricinfo reported that the ICC had given the BCB one more day to confer with the Bangladesh government about whether its team would travel to India.
Should they continue to refuse, the ICC Board will replace Bangladesh with Scotland in the tournament, based on team rankings, the report said.

Late on Tuesday night, the Bangladesh government’s sports adviser Asif Nazrul had reiterated that under no condition would the national team travel to India for the World Cup.
“If the ICC bows to pressure from the Indian cricket board and tries to impose pressure on us by setting unreasonable conditions, we will not accept those conditions,” Nazrul had told reporters, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency.
“In the past, there are examples that Pakistan said that they will not travel to India and ICC changed the venue. We have asked to change the venue on logical ground and we cannot be pressurised to play in India by putting illogical pressure.”</p><small>2026-01-21 15:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/211859508b4a27c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968230/civil-society-comes-together-to-support-affectees-of-gul-plaza-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Civil society comes together to support affectees of Gul Plaza fire</strong></a><br><p>As Karachi reels from the devastating Gul Plaza fire that has claimed the lives of at least 20 people as of Wednesday, civil society has once again come together to help those affected by the inferno.
The fire had erupted at the iconic mall, located on MA Jinnah Road, on Saturday night, but it was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday. Firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
BVS, Mama Parsi schools offer 100pc fee concession
The Bai Virbaijee Soparivala (BVS) Parsi High School offered 100 per cent concession in school fees to students whose parents or guardians suffered financial losses in the Gul Plaza blaze.
“This measure has been introduced to provide temporary relief to families facing hardship as a result of this unforeseen incident,” read a statement from BVS dated January 20. “The school stands in solidarity with the affected families during this difficult time.“



Speaking to Dawn today, BVS Principal Mehernaz Bharucha emphasised the importance of standing in solidarity at a time of crisis.
“We always tell our students and parents that BVS is like family, and the best a school can do at a time like this is to help in any capacity,” she said.
Eligible students and families will be granted the concession for one year, but there is a possibility of extension if the family is in need and applies beyond that, Bharucha explained.
Mama Parsi, the sister school of BVS, also offered 100pc concession to affected families.



Both schools are located within one kilometre of Gul Plaza in the city’s historic Saddar area.
Atrium Mall, also located in the Saddar area, offered exhibition stalls to vendors affected by the Gul Plaza fire to resume their business operations.
“We are offering free exhibition stalls to help the retailers of Gul Plaza resume their business operations after the recent fire. Together, we rebuild and support each other,” the mall’s administration wrote on Instagram.

The Cedar Charity Carnival and Bazaar said it would offer space to businesses affected by the fire at Gul Plaza, Cedar College business department head Dilnaz Avari told Dawn today.
“Additionally, a part of the carnival’s proceeds would go directly to help rehabilitate those who have suffered a devastating loss,” she said.
Online platforms and communities stepped up in the digital world to offer support and circulate resources for those affected.
“Please feel free to advertise your business as a full separate post with pictures and [an] Instagram or website link on Soul Sisters Pakistan,” founder Kanwal Ahmed said on the 320,000-strong women-only online group on Facebook.
Lifestyle brand Mashion was one of several platforms which shared a list of Gul Plaza businesses to support as they shifted online after the fire.
“Gul Plaza has been a part of Karachi for decades, and this fire has impacted so many small businesses and families,” the platform wrote in a post on Instagram, which gained significant traction.
“If you’re wondering how to help, the easiest way is to support them online.”

Content creator Osamah Nasir, through his platform ‘Shukar hai”, also shared a list of businesses affected by the fire and encouraged people to shop from them, share their pages and help them set up a digital platform.

On the flipside, one Gul Plaza business, Home Solutions, said that while their entire business has been affected, “the love, support and humanity [gained] is beyond words.”
“From across Pakistan, influencers offered free shoutouts and PR, and customers reached out with condolences, prayers, and support. Many even offered financial help — with deep respect and gratitude, we chose not to accept it,” the business wrote in a post on social media.
“Your prayers, empathy, and moral support are more than enough for us. This unity reminded us that humanity is alive and strong.“

Lals, a chocolate and gifting brand, also shared a list of affected vendors and urged people to support them.
“Our hearts remain with the community at Gul Plaza. We are doing what we can to help, and we invite you to do the same by supporting these businesses,” the brand wrote on Instagram.

Sialkot team owner Kamil Khan unveiled ‘Sialkot Stallionz’ as his franchise’s name today in a social media post.
“Excited to be part of the Pakistan Super League journey,” he wrote on X.







Khan had announced on Tuesday that the name of his franchise would be unveiled at 2 pm today.
In a separate social media post today, the team announced, “The wait is over. A new force rises — Sialkot Stallionz.”







In a letter to its fans, the team said that the name “carries legacy and pride”.
“This journey is not ours alone; it belongs to every fan who stands with us, cheers for us, and believes in the spirit of Sialkot,” it said on X.







Earlier this month, a historic Rs1.85 billion bid from OZ Developers at the PSL franchise auction secured Sialkot as one of the two new teams.
OZ Developers had been in a bidding war with software company i2c before outbidding their Rs1.82 billion offer.
Hyderabad was the other PSL team selected from the allotted cities, winning the franchise for Rs1.75 billion under FKS Group.
This will be Hyderabad’s and Sialkot’s first appearance since the league’s inception in 2015, with this year’s tournament scheduled for March 26 – May 3.
Sialkot Stallionz will join Lahore Qalandars, Islamabad United, Peshawar Zalmi, Quetta Gladiators, Karachi Kings, and Multan Sultans as the other teams in the PSL.</p><small>2026-01-21 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21153042da174d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968224/ihc-grants-pre-arrest-bail-to-imaan-hadi-in-case-dating-back-to-july' target='_blank'><strong>IHC grants pre-arrest bail to Imaan, Hadi in case dating back to July</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday granted activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha pre-arrest bail in a case pertaining to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) that dates back to July 2025 and resurfaced a day earlier.
The two had filed pre-arrest bail applications in the case. However, their bail pleas could not be taken up on an urgent basis on Tuesday while the couple struggled to avoid arrest.
The couple took refuge in the IHCBA president’s office, where they spent the whole night, while a large number of police officials remained outside the premises.
During the hearing on Wednesday, Justice Muhammad Azam Khan of the IHC took up the pre-arrest application and approved Mazari and Chattha’s bail against surety bonds of Rs10,000 each.
Advocate Kamran Murtaza appeared on behalf of the petitioners, and a large number of lawyers and officials from the IHCBA were present in the courtroom in solidarity with the applicants.
Addressing the court, Murtaza said that this was the first time in the country’s judicial history that a woman had to spend the night on court premises, adding that he personally felt responsible for what happened.
“If there had been an old case, they would have arrested her first,” he said, adding that the petitioners had been appearing in various cases since July.
“You are the custodian of the high court. You must ensure that no one is taken away from here,” the defence counsel pleaded with the judge.
“We are not enemies of the country. As much as you have the right, I also have the right to be in this building,” advocate Murtaza said.
He requested that the court grant protective bail and sought directions that no arrest should be made in any other case unless it has been formally placed on record.
In response to his request, Justice Khan observed, “I am passing orders only to the extent of the FIR that is before me.”
Subsequently, Justice Khan granted protective bail to Mazari and Chattha and restrained police from arresting them in the case.
Social media posts case
July’s first information report (FIR) surfaced a day after the IHC granted Mazari and Chattha one-day protective bail in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts.
The two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. It has been registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
The case is being heard by a trial court in Islamabad, which had issued arrest warrants for the two last week. Subsequently, Mazari and Chattha approached the IHC, challenging the trial court’s January 15 arrest orders.
Yesterday, the IHC declared the trial court’s order against them null and void and directed that they be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses.
The IHC categorically clarified that Mazari and Chattha should not be arrested in the case. But, it also stated that if they failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted under the order would stand automatically terminated.
The trial court was further directed that in case of their non-appearance, proceedings may continue in accordance with the law.
An Islamabad district and sessions court resumed hearing in the case today, in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
At the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka expressed displeasure over the continued absence of the accused from the hearings and warned that their right to cross-examination would be terminated if the process was not completed within the court-mandated time.
When the proceedings commenced, an assistant counsel representing Mazari and Chattah informed Judge Majoka that the IHC was simultaneously hearing their bail pleas and that they would appear before the trial court after proceedings at the high court.
Upon receiving this information, the court adjourned the hearing until 1:30pm.
When the hearing resumed, the court directed the prosecution to read out the IHC’s order.
Judge Majoka observed that the IHC’s order had been received at 3:28pm on January 20 while the prosecution argued that the high court had upheld the trial court’s order to the extent of the cancellation of Mazari and Chattha’s bail and the issuance of arrest warrants for the accused.
The judge observed that the case’s trial had to be completed within four days, in line with the IHC’s directives.
Subsequently, the hearing was again adjourned until 2:30pm.
However, Mazari and Chattha were still not present when the proceedings resumed, which prompted stern remarks from Judge Majoka.
“Despite being granted two-day protective bail, the suspects failed to attend the proceedings, which appears to be a deliberate act intended to delay the trial,” he said.
Judge Majoka noted that the high court had directed the trial court to complete the cross-examination within four days, and that the order was received on January 20.
Accordingly, the accused had been directed to complete the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses by 3:30pm on January 24, the judge observed, issuing the directives that the accused must complete the cross-examination by the court-mandated time.
He warned that no further time would be granted “if the court’s time is wasted”.
“If the cross-examination is not completed by 3:30 pm on January 24, the right to cross-examine will stand terminated,” the court stated and adjourned the hearing till Thursday (tomorrow).
‘Legal harassment’
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), meanwhile, expressed serious concern over what it called the “continued harassment” of Mazari and Chattha.
In a statement posted on X, the HRCP noted that the two “now face yet another allegedly fabricated first information report that was filed immediately after the Islamabad High Court reinstated their bail in a previous case on charges under the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016” — a reference to the July 2025 case.







“While they have been granted protective bail in this case as well, such a pattern of serial litigation appears designed to punish and intimidate individuals through legal harassment rather than to uphold due process.
“We call on the authorities to immediately halt the misuse of the Peca laws, respect the orders of the superior judiciary and ensure that all citizens’ fundamental rights to liberty, fair trial and freedom of expression are fully protected,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-01-21 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646416-harrowing-discovery-at-gul-plaza-30-bodies-found-in-single-shop' target='_blank'><strong>Harrowing discovery at Gul Plaza: 30 bodies found in single shop</strong></a><br><p>

The body was initially envisioned as a mechanism to address Israel’s war on Gaza, though its charter does not restrict its mandate solely to the occupied Palestinian territory.
Several states have been approached by the US to join the initiative.
Pakistan also received an invitation on Sunday. Today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accepted the proposal to participate in the initiative with the aim of “achieving lasting peace in Gaza”, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO).
What is the board meant to do?
According to AFP, the Board of Peace will be led by Trump under the terms outlined in its founding charter.
The document describes it as “an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”.
It further states that the body will “undertake such peace-building functions in accordance with international law”.
Who will lead the board?
Under the charter, Trump will serve as chairman while also acting as the first representative of the United States.
“The chairman shall have exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities as necessary or appropriate to fulfil the Board of Peace’s mission,” the document says.
The initiative was initially designed to supervise Gaza’s reconstruction.
Trump will appoint members of an executive board, described as “leaders of global stature”, who will serve two-year terms and can be removed by the chairman.
He may also, “acting on behalf of the Board of Peace”, “adopt resolutions or other directives”.
The chairman can only be replaced through “voluntary resignation or as a result of incapacity”.
Who is eligible for membership?
States may only join if formally invited by the US president and will be represented by their head of state or government.
Membership is limited to a maximum of three years, according to the charter.
However, this restriction does not apply to countries that contribute more than US$1,000,000,000 in cash during the first year after the charter comes into force.
Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are among those on the board.
The board will hold voting sessions at least once a year, with each country allotted a single vote.
While decisions require a majority of members present and voting, they are also “subject to the approval of the chairman, who may also cast a vote in his capacity as chairman in the event of a tie”.
Who sits on the executive board?
According to the White House, the executive board will oversee the implementation of the organisation’s objectives. It will be chaired by Trump and comprise seven members:

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio
Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special negotiator
Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law
Tony Blair, former British prime minister
Marc Rowan, US billionaire financier
Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank
Robert Gabriel, a close Trump associate serving on the US National Security Council

Which countries have been invited?
Aside from Pakistan, dozens of governments and leaders have confirmed receiving invitations.
Among them are China, India, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.
France has stated that it will not participate in the initiative.
Invitations have also been confirmed by Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Argentina’s President Javier Milei.
Other countries to acknowledge invitations include Jordan, Brazil, Paraguay, Pakistan, as well as several states across Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.
Who is expected to join?
Countries ranging from Albania to Vietnam have signalled interest in becoming members.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a strong supporter of Trump within the European Union, has also agreed to join.
Canada has said it will participate but has clearly ruled out paying the $1 billion required for permanent membership.
It remains uncertain whether other interested states, including Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Morocco and Vietnam, would be willing to make the $1 billion contribution.
Who is staying out?
France, a longstanding US ally, has indicated it will not take part.
Trump responded by threatening to impose steep tariffs on French wine.
President Zelensky said it would be “very hard” to sit on a council alongside Russia, adding that diplomatic efforts were ongoing.
When will it take effect?
The charter states that it will come into force “upon expression of consent to be bound by three States”.

“The explosion caused minor damage to the house’s boundary wall,” he said, adding that the minister’s family members remained safe.
Following the attack, police cordoned off the area and launched an investigation to identify and arrest those responsible, DPO Khan added.
He further said that security around the residence and nearby areas had been tightened as a precautionary measure and that all possible angles were being examined.

India has imposed several restrictions in the region after revoking its constitutional autonomy in 2019, laying out rules for how the region is covered and reported.
A spokesperson for Srinagar police did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
The Indian Express, one of India’s most respected dailies, said its journalist was summoned four times between January 15 and 19 and asked to sign the pledge on January 16.
“He has not signed the bond as asked by the police. The Indian Express is committed to doing what is necessary to uphold and protect the rights and dignity of its journalists,” the paper’s chief editor, Raj Kamal Jha, said in the report.
Two other journalists Reuters spoke to said they had also been summoned, but one of them was travelling and the other did not go to the police station. They declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the issue.
The journalists and The Indian Express said the summons were issued after they reported that police in the region were seeking information from mosques about their funding, management and budgets.
The Press Club of Kashmir, an association of journalists in the region said in a statement dated Tuesday that several of its members had been either summoned or advised by police to stop covering stories on profiling of religious institutions.
“Using police powers to summon journalists over their legitimate reporting is part of a pattern of intimidation against the media in Jammu and Kashmir,” Kunal Majumder, coordinator for the CPJ Asia-Pacific Programme, a non-profit that works for press freedom, said.</p><small>2026-01-21 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646431-pakistan-joins-trumps-peace-board-for-lasting-peace-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan joins Trump's peace board for 'lasting peace' in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>

As I’m writing this, I realise that the lamp on my bedside table is from there. So is the wall clock ticking opposite me, the plant sitting just within my line of sight, the bedsheet folded at the foot of my bed, and the ceramic tray holding loose change on my desk. I hadn’t noticed how much of my living space traces back to that same address in Karachi’s historic centre — until it burned.
Each object carries its own small origin story: a practical purchase the first time we moved houses, an impulsive buy after a long walk through crowded aisles, or something my mother spotted on her trips there, sent to me on WhatsApp, and I approved from afar. At the time, none of it felt consequential. These were low-stakes decisions made between bargaining and staircases, between “let’s check one more shop” and “we’ll just take this one.”
Everything we ever bought from Gul Plaza (and there is a lot) will eventually break, fade, or quietly disappear into storage. Objects generally meet that fate. But what will inevitably remain is the memory of where they came from. The phase of life they belonged to. The small rituals of choosing and bringing things home.
When the fire tore through the plaza over the weekend, it unleashed destruction on a scale few of us have seen. Lives were lost. Livelihoods were erased. And with them, a shared archive of memories: wedding shopping trips, childhood errands, first-home splurges, birthday gift sprees.
This isn’t just one person’s story. It is the case for most Karachiites, across class and generation, for whom Gul Plaza simply existed in the background as they put together their homes and lives, one item (sometimes remarkable, sometimes gloriously ordinary) at a time.
This piece is an attempt to map that collective meaning, now rendered painfully visible in its absence.
A market of firsts
“It was the first place one would go to when they needed to prepare for moving into a new house, getting married or having a child,” said Sana Chaudhry, summing up what countless others echoed in different ways.
“It was the place I bought a wedding gift for one of my closest friends, where I bought a high chair for my nephew and where my sister and I shopped prior to her wedding all those years ago,” she added.

 

Wedding shopping, particularly, was inseparable from Gul Plaza. Taniya Awan recalled how when she was getting married, her parents went there for her jahez which included kitchenware, blankets, bedsheets, and home appliances. Years later, she returned not for herself, but for her son, Azhaan.
“When Azhaan turned five, he wanted a bicycle so I bought him one from Gul Plaza. At seven, he wanted an electric bike and I bought it from there too. In a way, it was a part of the timeline of his childhood.”
That sense of continuity, of returning to the same place at different stages of life, came up again and again. Ujala Nadeem described the ill-fated shopping mall as “a quiet witness to time passing and one that met her family’s needs across generations.” She visited first as a child with her grandmother, later as a working adult with her father, and then as a newly married woman, designing a home of her own.
“When I received my first paycheck, I could only think of going to Gul Plaza for a shopping haul,” she said, recalling the pride of buying a rug from the basement with her own earnings. “Today, as fire scars its structure, it feels like watching a chapter of my own life get erased.”
For 50-year-old Novera Shamim, Gul Plaza was an integral part of her life, as it was for many in her generation. She fondly recalled her wedding 25 years ago, when the very first crockery set she bought for her in-laws’ home came from there. And she still has it.
Her love for artificial flowers drew her there monthly. “I would go there often because there was incredible variety and quality,” Shamim stated. Just last week, she ordered Bougainvillea flowers from a shop called Fantasia Florist. “They responded so promptly when I placed an order online, and it was delivered within three days.”
Family rituals
For many Karachiites, Gul Plaza was a repository of family memories and small daily rituals that shaped childhoods. Umair Ali Jaffery recollected, “My core memories of Gul Plaza date quite far back. I used to go there with my father to buy plates, crockeries, and other household bits. I would eagerly look forward to having a samosa chaat from a thela at the corner of the plaza.” He remembers the maze of narrow lanes lined with countless vendors, selling everything from electronics and clothes to kitchenware.

 

In the same vein, for Muzhira Amin, Gul Plaza was a part of weekly routines and shared experiences with family. She described it as a central thread in her childhood: trips to the shopping complex were almost ritualistic. “Back then, we lived 10 minutes away from the shopping complex, which meant we’d visit at least once a week, sometimes three or even four times.”
She would hop into a rickshaw with her nani, navigating her way through the packed aisles for hours, sometimes buying, but mostly just brushing her hands against toys and clothes she liked. “My favourite part was the kachoris and bun kebabs we would have afterwards. They were half the joy!” she recounted, with a smile.
“The fire,” she explained, “felt a little too personal, almost like the erasure of a childhood I held on to so dearly.”
Everything under one roof, at a price you couldn’t ignore
What set Gul Plaza apart was its promise of completeness. It was that rare market in Karachi where affordability, convenience, and variety converged.
Ali Osman called it his go-to place for buying groceries and cutlery, a place where he knew everything he needed will be available under one roof. That predictability mattered, especially in a city where shopping often requires crossing neighbourhoods and negotiating multiple markets.
For Fatima Sheikh, even a single-purpose visit rarely stayed that way. She went there recently to buy clothes for her nephew’s birthday, intending to shop only at Kaka Garments. “There was so much variety there, I slipped and bought more things than I needed,” she said. What began as a quick errand turned into a full-fledged shopping trip, complete with baby items, towels, sheets — all “at reasonable rates and of good quality.”

 

“It was chaotic to find parking close by,” Anushe Engineer recalled. “We used to joke about how much of a headache it was going there, but that headache was worth it because it had the most gorgeous crockery. My mother would buy it as gifts when people invited her over, or even just as a thank-you.”
She said that over the years, those gifts became a hallmark at family dinners and get-togethers. Big salad bowls, serving platters, and delicate crockery would appear on tables, prompting compliments here and there. Many guests assumed these were pricey pieces, she added, when in reality they cost between Rs1,000 and Rs3,000 (far less than what the same items would sell for in upscale retail stores).
In a city where the gap between the haves and the have-nots streches wider by the day, Gul Plaza was something of a delightful anomaly. Because its offerings were affordable and simultaneously maintained quality, naturally, people from all socio-economic backgrounds found themselves there — one of the few places in Karachi where class lines subtly dissolved.
Vendors, familiar faces, and quiet bonds
Aside from the availability and affordability of the goods, it was the relationships that anchored people to the space. Behind every shop was a person; a fact that hit shoppers hardest as images of the blaze circulated.
Majid Ali reminisced shopping there for his children for special occasions and gradually forming personal connections with the shopkeepers. “The vendors there were really friendly,” he said. “I knew them by their faces, and vice versa. They gave me discounts very easily, especially when I took my children along. Some even offered us cold drinks and tea.” For him, these were small gestures that transformed ordinary transactions into moments of familiarity and warmth.
For Sheikh, the tragic incident stirred memories of the people she had come to know there. “I could see the faces of the vendors in front of my eyes,” she lamented. During her visit last month, some had excitedly told her they had stocked up for Eid. “They made investments with hope and anticipation, only to see them reduced to ash in an instant. It’s so heartbreaking.”
Similarly, Shamim reflected, “Just the thought of losing Gul Plaza feels like losing a piece of the city’s soul. My heart goes out to people who worked there and made it what it was.”
A preventable tragedy
Alongside grief, there is anger.
When the fire broke out late Saturday, it engulfed a complex housing nearly 1,200 shops, raging for more than 24 hours. By Monday, rescue workers were combing through debris — twisted metal, fallen signboards, air-conditioning units — cooling the structure that once pulsed with life.

 

Several Karachiites pointed to what they described as longstanding safety hazards. Narrow staircases, exposed wiring, congested floors, and crumbling infrastructure were not new discoveries.
“The ceilings were a spiderweb of exposed electrical wires,” said Chaudhry, adding that the fire “was an incident waiting to happen.”
The surrounding roads, too, have deteriorated, with sewage flooding and potholes hampering access. These issues may have compounded rescue difficulties.
“I can’t imagine what the traders and shopkeepers are going through with the loss of their entire livelihoods and the immense loss of lives,” Engineer said. While acknowledging government promises of relief, she added that accountability must not fade. “This tragedy was entirely preventable.”
Amna Kamran, who had visited the plaza three times in recent months while redecorating her home, said there were hardly any walkways and very few visible exits. “The tragedy may have been incidental,” she noted, “but anyone who’s been there would call it a predictable outcome of a chaotic, crammed-with-shops layout.”
What she found truly unforgivable, however, was the poor rescue response. She questioned how firefighters struggled to enter the building as flames devoured floor after floor, and why officials kept pointing to hydrants and water tankers while people remained trapped inside.
“The loss of material, as devastating as it is, is reversible; shelves can always be restocked. But the loss of lives … who will compensate for those?”

Under Section 137 of the Elections Act, all members of the NA, Senate, and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children.
Section 138 of the Elections Act requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.
The bill passed by the NA today proposes an amendment to Section 138 of the Elections Act, seeking to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the speaker of the assembly concerned or, as the case may be, the chairman of the Senate may, on an application made by a member for reasons to be recorded in writing, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the commission if such publication would pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the members or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.”
This means that following the submission of a written application by a parliamentarian, the NA speaker or Senate chairperson could bar the ECP from publicly publishing details of the assets of that member if it would “pose a serious threat to the life or safety” of that individual or their family.
The amendment proposes that this restriction will remain in place for not more than a year and was subject to the submission of “a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities” to the ECP confidentially.
The bill’s statement of objectives and reasons further elaborates: “The proposed amendment is to ensure a balanced approach between transparency and the protection of individual rights.
“While the publication of statements of assets and liabilities serves a vital role in promoting public accountability, enhancing trust in public office, and ensuring good governance, it is recognised that unrestricted or excessive disclosure could potentially compromise the personal security and privacy of parliamentarians and their families.”
Moreover, the bill also proposes replacing the word “Supreme” with “Federal Constitutional” in several places to represent the newly established Federal Constitutional Court under the 27th Amendment.
In August last year, the NA Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs had taken up the bill for discussion but failed to reach a consensus on it after members from PML-N and PTI joined hands to oppose the move tabled by PPP legislators Shazia Marri and Syed Naveed Qamar.
This time, however, only the PTI opposed it.
During today’s NA session, Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs Chairperson Rana Iradat Sharif Khan presented the committee’s report on the proposed legislation, following which it was taken up for consideration by the House and eventually passed.
The bill needs the Senate’s assent and the president’s approval before it becomes law.

The plant was “started at 19:02”, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) spokesman Tatsuya Matoba told AFP of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata prefecture.
The regional governor approved the resumption last month, although public opinion remains sharply divided.
On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters — mostly elderly — braved freezing temperatures to demonstrate in the snow near the plant’s entrance, whose buildings line the Sea of Japan coast.
“It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, told AFP.
Around 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September.
TEPCO said on Wednesday it would “proceed with careful verification of each plant facility’s integrity” and address any issues appropriately and transparently.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted.
The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011.
However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.
Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source.
Fourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January.
Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned.
Nearly 15 years after the disaster, “the situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that’s absolutely unacceptable”, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator.
‘Anxious and fearful’
The vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades.
However, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate.
“I think it’s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,” Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, told AFP.
On January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority.
The petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007.
“We can’t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,” it said.
“Making many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo … is intolerable.” Before the 2011 disaster — which killed around 18,000 people — nuclear power generated about a third of Japan’s electricity.
String of scandals
Japan’s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks.
At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test.
“Safety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,” TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with the Asahi daily newspaper.
Japan is the world’s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.
Nearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil — a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power.
Under a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan’s energy supply by 2040 — up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24.
Meanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.</p><small>2026-01-21 11:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/211630333de7ed0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968227/indian-air-force-training-aircraft-crashes-in-uttar-pradesh-pilots-escape-unhurt' target='_blank'><strong>Indian Air Force training aircraft crashes in Uttar Pradesh, pilots escape unhurt</strong></a><br><p>An Indian Air Force (IAF) training aircraft crashed in India’s northern Uttar Pradesh state, with both pilots emerging unharmed, police said.
On a routine sortie from Bamrauli air force station near Prayagraj, a Microlight aircraft faced a technical malfunction and was “safely force landed in an uninhabited area, ensuring no damage to civil life or property”, the Indian Air Force said on social media platform X.
“Both the pilots on board are safe,” it said, adding that a probe into the cause of the accident is underway.







Manish Shandilya, a local police officer, said the training aircraft “crashed after its engine developed a sudden technical snag,” reported The Press Trust of India.
“In Prayagraj, Deputy Commissioner of Police (City) Manish Shandilya said the aircraft was on a sortie towards Phaphamau and the Sangam area when its engine developed a technical snag,” The Hindu reported.
The report quoted him as saying that the pilots had executed a “controlled and safe landing in a pond”.
In November last year, an Indian fighter aircraft, the indigenously developed Tejas, had crashed during a demonstration flight at the Dubai Air Show.
Footage of the crash showed the fighter executing a low roll before crashing in flames about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from the show site. The IAF had confirmed the death of the pilot in the incident.
In July 2025, the IAF said two of its pilots were killed as a Jaguar fighter jet crashed near a village in Rajasthan’s Churu district. According to the IAF, the aircraft met with an accident during a routine training mission, with both pilots sustaining fatal injuries.</p><small>2026-01-21 11:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646378-ihc-grants-protective-bail-to-imaan-mazari-husband-chattha-in-terror-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC grants protective bail to Imaan Mazari, husband Chattha in 'terror case'</strong></a><br><p>

The delegation, which includes members of both the Senate and the National Assembly of Pakistan, will also engage with the members of the Pakistani diaspora to emphasise the significance of their participation in promoting national causes in the United States.
The delegation will participate in multiple forums, beginning with an Inter-Parliamentary Group (IPG) session at the Rayburn House Office Building on Wednesday, followed by a press conference at the National Press Club (NPC) and a diplomatic reception in New Jersey.
According to Dr Gholam Mujtaba, chairman of the Pakistan Policy Institute USA (PPI-USA), who has been instrumental in organising the visit, the engagements are designed to promote legislative-to-legislative dialogue, deepen institutional cooperation, and highlight Pakistan’s role in regional stability and global diplomacy.
The Rayburn IPG session will be hosted by Congressman Al Green as the congressional sponsor and Congressman Ron Estes will deliver keynote remarks. Confirmed US participants include representatives Tom Suozzi, Laura Gillen, and Josh Gottheimer.
On the Pakistani side, senators Saleem Mandviwalla, chief whip of the Senate, and Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, chairman of the standing committee on cabinet, will engage US lawmakers on parliamentary cooperation, security, trade, and diaspora-enabled diplomatic channels.
“The dialogue comes at a sensitive regional juncture, as developments in the Middle East and South Asia continue to impact global security and economic interests,” Dr Mujtaba said.
“Pakistan’s strategic relevance, its commitment to democratic values, and the contributions of the Pakistani-American community will all be highlighted during these engagements.”
The NPC briefing will allow the delegation to share insights with US and international media on parliamentary diplomacy, bilateral relations, and areas of potential cooperation. Discussions are expected to focus on trade, investment, counterterrorism, and the role of diaspora networks in strengthening ties between the two countries.
The delegation will conclude its visit with a reception in Clifton, New Jersey, on January 24, to be attended by US lawmakers, city and state officials, and members of the Pakistani diaspora to encourage dialogue on community-level cooperation and private-sector engagement.</p><small>2026-01-21 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21124506a236eb2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968217/ihc-asks-how-imran-khans-x-account-case-can-proceed-without-lawyer-access' target='_blank'><strong>IHC asks how Imran Khan’s X account case can proceed without lawyer access</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday questioned how proceedings in the case concerning PTI founder Imran Khan’s X account could continue if authorities were denying his counsel access to him.
The remarks were made by Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, who was presiding over a hearing on a petition against the incarcerated former premier regarding “inflammatory posts” made from an X account operated in Imran’s name.
During today’s hearing, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja, who is representing Imran in the case, told the court that he had not been able to meet his client for consultation.
“The court has received responses from Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and jail authorities,” Justice Tahir said.
Addressing Raja, Justice Tahir said that “final arguments in the case will be presented on February 24 if you meet (Imran)”.
The judge then directed Raja to submit a detailed response in court in connection with the contempt petition over the denial of meetings with the PTI founder. The court also issued instructions to advocate general Islamabad to submit a written response in the contempt case.
Justice Tahir was then informed by the state counsel that “a larger bench was hearing cases involving meetings”.
At this, Justice Tahir said, “They (defence) are saying that until the meeting is held, how will the case proceed any further?”
Raja argued that “a case has been filed against me, yet I am not allowed to meet my client,” adding that he has not been able to meet the incarcerated party founder “ever since the case was filed”.
The court instructed the state counsel to submit a written response on the matter.
The defence counsel further recalled that the IHC had issued an order on November 4 allowing meetings; however, “it has not been implemented for two months”.
“Should I go there today for a meeting?” the PTI leader asked, adding that the party founder was “being kept in solitary confinement”.
Justice Tahir maintained that an order will be issued regarding the meeting.
“The case will only move forward if we allow him (Raja) a meeting,” the judge said to the state counsel.
As the hearing continued, the court also found the response submitted by PTA to the petition “unsatisfactory”.
“Look at what the writ petition is and what your response is,” Justice Tahir, expressing displeasure, said to the PTA counsel.
The hearing was adjourned till February 24.
On Nov 4, 2025, Justice Tahir issued a directive to Adiala jail authorities to ensure that Raja is allowed to meet Imran in relation to the case.
The court had also instructed the deputy attorney general and the state counsel to immediately convey the order to the jail administration through a phone call.
The former premier’s family and party leaders have recently faced increased restrictions in meeting him. In December last year, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that meetings with the incarcerated leader would remain suspended till February 8.
The petition
In September, a petition was filed in the IHC challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
The petition was filed by citizen Ghulam Murtaza Khan through Barrister Zafarullah Khan Advocate, stating that the dissemination of “provocative and malicious” content from the account of a convicted prisoner is unlawful and contrary to prison rules.
The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency and the PTA to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated.
The petition further sought directions for blocking and removing such content from social media platforms.
It also called upon the court to instruct the jail superintendent to ensure that the prisoner is not allowed to access or operate social media in violation of jail regulations, terming such activity “unconstitutional and illegal.”
A written reply submitted to the court by Adiala jail authorities last year denied that the X account was being operated from within the jail.
Superintendent of the Adiala jail stated the PTI founder was under strict surveillance and had no access to any prohibited device, “particularly mobile phones”</p><small>2026-01-21 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/211237182972682.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968215/israels-netanyahu-accepts-trump-invitation-to-join-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s Netanyahu accepts Trump invitation to join ‘Board of Peace’</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted an invitation to join US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” aimed at resolving conflicts, Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday.
“Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that he has accepted US President Donald Trump’s invitation and will join as a member of the Board of Peace, which will be composed of leaders of the world,” the office said in a statement.







The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of post-war Gaza, but its charter seen by AFP does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory, and members have to pay up to $1 billion for a permanent spot on it.
The board “seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”, reads the preamble of the charter sent to countries invited to participate.
It will be chaired by Trump himself, who will also “separately serve” as the representative of the United States.
Dozens of countries and leaders have said they have received an invitation, including close US allies but also adversaries.
A day earlier, the UAE president and Bahrain’s king accepted an invitation to sit on Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’, joining a handful of countries to have endorsed the initiative.
Longtime US ally France, however, has indicated it will not join.
While announcing the creation of the board last week, Trump also unveiled plans to establish a “Gaza Executive Board” operating under the body.
The executive board would include Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi.
Netanyahu has strongly objected to their inclusion.
Ties between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated since Israel’s Gaza invasion started in October 2023 following an unprecedented attack by Hamas on Israel.</p><small>2026-01-21 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21121348b28bc0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968213/maxwell-and-waugh-among-franchise-owners-in-bollywood-backed-european-t20-league' target='_blank'><strong>Maxwell and Waugh among franchise owners in Bollywood-backed European T20 league</strong></a><br><p>Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell and former captain Steve Waugh are among the franchise owners in a new European Twenty20 league, which will begin in August after two false starts.
Backed by the cricket boards of Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands, and approved by the governing International Cricket Council, the European T20 Premier League’s (ETPL) founders include Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan.
“Mainland Europe is not known for cricket,” Bachchan told Reuters from Sydney, where they unveiled owners of the three teams, including the Amsterdam franchise owned by a group that includes Waugh and Jamie Dwyer, a five-time International Hockey Federation player of the year.
“It’s an opportunity to create a huge cricket ecosystem in and around Europe. With ETPL, we hope we can bring the magic of cricket euphoria to mainland Europe.”

Maxwell is a co-owner of the Belfast franchise, while former New Zealand internationals Nathan McCullum and Kyle Mills bought the Edinburgh side.
The ICC has 33 members in Europe, most for any continent, including full members England and Ireland. Scotland and Netherlands have played World Cups, while Italy will make their T20 World Cup debut next month.
“Italy’s World Cup qualification indicates Europe’s interest in cricket, and cricket being in the 2028 Olympics is another boost for Europe,” Bachchan said.

“We hope to turn ETPL into one of the top T20 leagues in the world.”

Waugh hoped the Amsterdam franchise would inspire more kids to take up the game.
“Franchise cricket has the world’s best players playing with locals,” the two-time World Cup winner told Reuters.
“At Amsterdam, the Dutch players will have the opportunity to play alongside players like Mitchell Marsh, the current Australia T20 captain, or Steve Smith, one of the all-time greats of the game. You can’t buy that kind of experience.”
Initially conceived as Euro T20 Slam, the league could not take off in 2019 and its planned launch last year was delayed for the second time.</p><small>2026-01-21 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646342-rainfall-strong-cold-spell-expected-in-karachi-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Rainfall, strong cold spell expected in Karachi from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh’s election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests. Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.
India’s past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two neighbours since her overthrow.
India’s withdrawal move was part of “internal readjustments”, the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi’s decision.
It was not immediately clear when the families would return.
The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In December, India summoned Bangladesh’s high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its concern over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka.
Bangladesh’s ex-premier Hasina was sentenced to death in November after a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on the student-led uprising in 2024.
The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly sought Hasina’s extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi’s concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community.
Meanwhile, a popular student leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising, Sharif Osman Hadi, was wounded in an assassination attempt last month and died after being flown to Singapore for treatment.
Hadi was a senior leader of the student protest group Inqilab Mancha and an outspoken critic of India. His death set off violent protests with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.</p><small>2026-01-21 06:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646330-gull-plaza-wont-be-demolished-until-all-missing-recovered-as-search-operation-enters-fifth-day' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza deaths surge to 60 after 30 bodies recovered from single shop</strong></a><br><p>

Calling the move a deliberate “weaponisation of water,” Pakistan’s representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, said India’s actions amounted to material breaches of the landmark 1960 treaty.







Speaking at the Global Water Bankruptcy Policy Roundtable hosted by Canada and the United Nations University on Tuesday, Ambassador Jadoon said that since April last year, India had committed several serious violations of the treaty, including unannounced disruptions of downstream water flows and the withholding of critical hydrological data.
“Pakistan’s position is unequivocal; the treaty remains legally intact and permits no unilateral suspension or modification,” he said.
He stressed that for more than six decades, the Indus Waters Treaty had provided a time-tested framework for the equitable and predictable management of the Indus River basin, which sustains one of the world’s largest contiguous irrigation systems.
The basin, he noted, provides over 80 percent of Pakistan’s agricultural water needs and supports the lives and livelihoods of more than 240 million people.
Ambassador Jadoon said water insecurity had emerged globally as a systemic risk, affecting food production, energy systems, public health, livelihoods, and human security.







“For Pakistan, this is a lived reality,” he said, describing the country as a semi-arid, climate-vulnerable, lower-riparian state facing floods, droughts, accelerated glacier melt, groundwater depletion, and rapid population growth — all of which are placing immense pressure on already stressed water systems.
Highlighting Pakistan’s response, he said the country was strengthening water resilience through integrated planning, flood protection, irrigation rehabilitation, groundwater replenishment, and ecosystem restoration.
He cited initiatives such as ‘Living Indus’ and ‘Recharge Pakistan’ as key national efforts. However, he emphasized that systemic water risks could not be managed by any country in isolation, particularly in shared river basins.
Predictability, transparency, and cooperation in transboundary water governance, he said, were matters of survival for downstream populations.
Ambassador Jadoon further called for water insecurity to be formally recognised as a systemic global risk in the lead-up to the 2026 UN Water Conference, urging that cooperation and respect for international water law be placed at the center of shared water governance to ensure real protection for vulnerable downstream communities.</p><small>2026-01-21 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2110423939b086b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968207/trumps-plane-returns-to-air-base-after-minor-electrical-issue-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s plane returns to air base after ‘minor’ electrical issue: White House</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s plane was forced to return to an air base late Tuesday due to a “minor electrical issue” shortly after departing for Switzerland, the White House said.
Air Force One returned to Joint Base Andrews out of an abundance of caution, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. It landed shortly after 0400 GMT.
Journalists traveling with Trump reported that lights in the cabin went out briefly after takeoff.

 


After returning to Andrews, Trump resumed his trip to the Davos forum early Wednesday.
Trump and his entourage changed planes at Joint Base Andrews and took off again shortly after 0500 GMT, about two-and-a-half hours after his initial departure.
With its classic blue and white livery, Air Force One is arguably the world’s most iconic plane and an instantly recognisable symbol of the US presidency.
Trump has long been unhappy with the current Air Force One jets - two highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft that entered service in 1990 under president George H.W Bush.
Last year, Trump said his administration was “looking at alternatives” to Boeing following delays in the delivery of two new 747-8 aircraft.

In May, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth accepted a Boeing 747 that the Gulf emirate of Qatar offered to Trump for use as Air Force One.
The jet - worth hundreds of millions of dollars - has raised huge constitutional and ethical questions, as well as security concerns about using an aircraft donated by a foreign power for use as the ultra-sensitive presidential plane.</p><small>2026-01-21 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2110284015c3a56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968206/lahore-again-emerges-as-most-polluted-city-in-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore again emerges as most polluted city in the world</strong></a><br><p>Lahore has again emerged as the most polluted city in the world with its air quality being classed as “hazardous”, according to air quality monitoring platform IQAir.
In past few years, air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan. Various cities of the country, most notably Lahore, deal with smog, especially in the winter months. The phenomenon is attributed mainly to industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, stubble burning and air movement.
Lahore was placed at the top of the list of most polluted cities globally on Wednesday morning, with an air quality index (AQI) of 452, while Karachi ranked ninth at 179, according to the IQAir live tracker.

On Tuesday, the platform issued an air quality alert for Pakistan as major cities experienced “unhealthy” to “hazardous” levels of air pollution, posing “serious health risks to residents, especially children and the elderly”.
At the time, Lahore’s air quality index (AQI) had soared to 507 — well into the “hazardous” bracket (301+). Karachi ranked sixth on the list with an “unhealthy” AQI of 178 a day earlier.

“Residents are advised to limit outdoor activity, keep windows closed, wear masks when outside, and use air purifiers indoors,” the alert said.
Punjab authorities have made efforts to tackle the smog in Lahore, including via the use of water sprinklers and rapid response initiatives to curb stubble-burning. However, despite claiming an improvement in the air quality, the pollution persists.</p><small>2026-01-21 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646315-over-2400-fire-incidents-reported-in-karachi-last-year-report' target='_blank'><strong>Over 2,400 fire incidents reported in Karachi last year: report</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking for more than an hour before taking questions from reporters, Trump said the UN had potential but added that he had never considered turning to the organisation to help resolve conflicts. Asked whether his envisioned Board of Peace could supplant the UN, he replied that it “might”.
Earlier in the day, Tru­mp released a list of what he described as major achi­e­vements from his first year back in office, highlighting what he portrayed as successes in both domestic and foreign policy.
Public opinion polls released around the same time showed growing voter dissatisfaction with the administration’s immigration policies.
Against that backdrop, the first 15 minutes of Trump’s appearance in the White House briefing room appeared aimed at reshaping public opinion. Holding a stack of printouts detailing immigrants with criminal records detained by US authorities in Minnesota — labelled “the worst of the worst” —the president sought to argue that his immigration policies were producing concrete results.
