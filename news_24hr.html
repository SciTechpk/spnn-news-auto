State broadcaster PTV shared images from the meeting on social media platform X, which showed Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, who is chairing the meeting, greeting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
It said that the meeting was being held at the Finance Division.







The meeting will take up three agenda items. The four provincial finance ministers and four non-statutory members — Dr Asad Sayeed (Sindh), Mehfooz Ali Khan (Baloc­histan), Nasir Mehmood Khosa (Punjab) and Dr Musharraf Rasool Cyan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) — are members of the NFC.
At the outset, the meeting will hold general discussions on the “strategy for deliberations on the 11th NFC Award, including proposed formation of sub-groups for deliberations on thematic areas, etc”.
This will be followed by 10-minute presentations by each of the four provincial governments and the federal Ministry of Finance on their respective fiscal positions. The meeting will then set the schedule and timelines for future NFC meetings, most likely to be held in all federal and provincial capitals until the conclusion of deliberations.
The 11th NFC was constituted on August 22 to give a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces. Its first meeting, initially called for August 27, was postponed repeatedly.
The terms of reference, set under Clause 2 of Article 160, require the 11th NFC to distribute between the federal government and the provinces the net proceeds of five major tax categories. These include taxes on income — including capital value tax and corporation tax but excluding taxes on income consisting of remuneration paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund.
KP CM holds consultations ahead of NFC
Ahead of the meeting, KP CM Afridi last night held consultations in preparation for the inaugural meeting in the presence of senior PTI leadership, where it was decided to “fully and effectively” uphold KP’s interests, with a special emphasis on the “financial merger of former federally administered tribal areas (Fata).”
Detailing the meeting in a post on X, the government of KP said that Afridi was briefed that Fata was “entitled to Rs1,375 billion,” adding that the funds had not yet been provided.







During the meeting, the chief minister was briefed that “at the time of the merger of the former Fata, a promise was made to provide Rs100bn annually, which now amounts to Rs700bn”.
It was further discussed that out of the total amount, the Centre had only released Rs168bn, while Rs531.9bn remained pending.
CM Afridi termed the delay in the issuance of funds a “violation of Article 160” of the Constitution, vowing to protect the province’s “financial and constitutional rights”.
The participants of the meeting included PTI’s Asad Qaiser, provincial minister Meena Khan Afridi, Finance Adviser Muzammil Aslam and others.</p><small>2025-12-04 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041212216c53c69.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959137/pakistan-kyrgyzstan-sign-15-mous-during-president-zhaparovs-visit-to-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan sign 15 MoUs during President Zhaparov’s visit to Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan signed 15 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) in various fields, including commerce, energy and health, to boost bilateral cooperation between the two nations.
The exchange of MoUs took place in Islamabad, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Zhaparov witnessing the signing ceremony.
Zhaparov arrived in Islamabad yesterday on a two-day maiden visit to Pakistan. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a post on X that the visit was the first by a Kyrgyz president in 20 years.
Following the signing of the MoUs, PM Shehbaz and Zhaparov also signed a joint statement on the strengthening of “comprehensive cooperation” in the interest of both countries.



Speaking on the occasion, PM Shehbaz termed Islamabad as the Kyrgyz president’s “second home”. “There cannot be a better moment of joy and bliss for all of us.”
Noting that a Kyrgyz president was visiting Pakistan after a period of 20 years, the premier said that “this gap between two brotherly countries is not acceptable”. “As I said, it’s never too late,” he added, extending the visiting dignitary a warm welcome.
“Our interaction today is far more than a meeting between two brothers whose hearts beat in unison. It is as though the ancient Karakoram and the majestic Ala-Too stretch out across the horizon to embrace one another,” PM Shehbaz said.
He expressed the confidence that the visit will “most definitely give a fresh impetus to our already strong bilateral relations in all fields of mutual interaction”.
Noting that the two nations had “timeless” links, the prime minister said the people of both countries were connected “not only by geography but by centuries of caravans, and ideas of faiths and friendships”.
“During our fruitful discussions today, we had a detailed exchange of […] bilateral relations as well as important regional and international developments,” PM Shehbaz said about his meeting with Zharapov.
“We have reaffirmed today, and of course in no uncertain terms, our shared resolve to elevate Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan relations to a much higher level by enhancing collaboration in political, trade, connectivity, energy, agriculture, education, defence, and of course, in cultural domains.”
The prime minister noted that a business forum would be held later today to “chart new pathways for proactive collaboration in vital sectors of economic cooperation”.
Dar meets Kyrgyz president
Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Zhaparov and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
Dar called on President Zhaparov and welcomed his delegation to Pakistan, the FO said in a post on X. It added that Dar conveyed the “warm greetings” of President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz.







“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment, at the highest political level, to further strengthening Pak–Kyrgyz relations in all areas of mutual interest,” the FO added.
Dar also briefed Zhaparov on his planned engagements with Pakistan’s leadership, interactions with both countries’ business communities, and discussions aimed at advancing broad-based bilateral cooperation.
Dar had also welcomed Kyrgyz FM Zheenbek Kulubaev at the FO yesterday, where the two held “important consultations ranging over areas of mutual interest”.







Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical, and spiritual affinities.
The two countries had agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and digital finance in August.
In July, they reaffirmed an agreement to increase bilateral trade to $100 million at a session of their intergovernmental commission.
Alongside bilateral relations, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are both members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa­tion, a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose other members include China, Russia, India, and Iran.</p><small>2025-12-04 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0411335026ada66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959139/man-arrested-in-us-in-possession-of-gun-and-written-plans-for-attack-is-afghan-not-of-pakistani-origin-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested in US in possession of gun and written plans for attack is Afghan, not of Pakistani origin: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said on Thursday that a man arrested by the US police last week in Delaware after he was found in possession of a handgun, ammunition and written plans for an attack was not of Pakistani origin and was an Afghan.
“He is not [a] Pakistani national or [of] Pakistan origin. He is an Afghan, spent a few years as a refugee [in Pakistan] and then went to the US, where he spent most of his life,” Andrabi said in a statement shared with journalists.
His clarification came after several media reports, including those from Indian and American news outlets, identified the suspect as a man of Pakistani origin.
A USA Today report said the arrested man, Luqman Khan, was a Pakistan-born US citizen, who was arrested on November 24.
Similarly, reports by the New York Post and India’s Hindustan Times and Times of India, among others, also identified him as a Pakistani immigrant.
According to a report by The Associated Press from earlier today, which also does not identify Khan as a man of Pakistani origin, the suspect was a student of the University of Delaware.
Meanwhile, a press release issued by the US Department of Justice on Dec 1 detailing charges against Khan identified him as a resident of Delaware’s Wilmington city and did not make any mention of his nationality.
It said that Khan was stopped by police at a traffic stop on November 24, and when he refused to comply, was arrested.
“During their investigation, officers discovered in Khan’s vehicle a .357 caliber Glock handgun loaded with 27 rounds,” it said. It added that officials also discovered a handwritten notebook, in which Khan discussed “additional weapons and firearms, how they could be used in an attack, and how law enforcement detection could be avoided once an attack was carried out”.
“The notebook referenced a member of the University of Delaware’s Police Department by name, and included a layout of a building with entry and exit points under which the words ‘UD Police Station’ were printed,” it said.
It added that later, law enforcement searched his residence and recovered “a Glock 19 9mm handgun equipped with an illegal machinegun conversion device, commonly called a ‘switch’”.
“Law enforcement also recovered a .556 rifle with a scope and a red dot sight, eleven more extended magazines, hollow point rounds of ammunition, and a two-plate tactical vest equipped with a single ballistic plate,” the department said.
According to the Department of Justice press release, Khan was charged with illegally possessing a machine gun on November 26.
“If convicted of the charge, Khan faces a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment. If Khan is ultimately convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors,” it said.</p><small>2025-12-04 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03214127d83c6c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958986/in-pictures-engine-roar-and-polished-chrome-steal-the-spotlight-at-lahore-car-meetups' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Engine roar and polished chrome steal the spotlight at Lahore car meetups</strong></a><br><p>Car enthusiasts from across Lahore gathered at a recent meetup to celebrate the passion that has long fuelled Pakistan’s automotive community.

A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, causing it to appear unusually large and bright — up to 14 per cent larger and nearly 30pc brighter than a typical full moon.
The final supermoon of the year, known as the Cold Moon, will be visible across Pakistan tonight and tomorrow night, Radio Pakistan said, quoting the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).
“It marks the third consecutive supermoon of the year and the last supermoon of 2025,” it said.
Suparco encourages the public, astronomy enthusiasts, students, and families to observe this natural spectacle, the report said.
“No special equipment is required; the supermoon will be easily visible to the naked eye, provided the skies remain clear,” it added.
According to CNN, the moniker ‘Cold Moon’ indicates that it’s the full moon event closest to the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
The first of the three supermoons lit up the country’s skies on October 7, followed by another on November 5, called the Beaver Supermoon, which was “the closest, biggest, and brightest full moon of the year,” as per the space agency.

The probe by the inspector general’s office concluded that Hegseth did not, however, violate rules on classification because he has the authority to declassify information, the reports said, citing sources familiar with the results of the investigation.
The watchdog’s conclusion — which has been transmitted to Congress — is nonetheless likely to reignite debate over conduct by Hegseth, who is already under fire over US strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats that experts say amount to extrajudicial killings.
The probe was sparked by the Atlantic magazine’s revelation in late March that its editor-in-chief was inadvertently included in a Signal chat in which US officials, including Hegseth and then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, discussed strikes on Yemen’s Iran-backed Huthi rebels.
The magazine initially withheld the details the officials discussed, but later published them after the White House insisted that no classified information was shared and attacked the editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, as a liar.
The chat included messages in which Hegseth revealed the timing of strikes hours before they happened and information on aircraft and missiles involved, while Waltz sent real-time intelligence on the aftermath of the military action.
In a post to X late on Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell called the review “a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth”.







Waltz fired, Hegseth survives
The Atlantic said that Waltz had set some of the Signal messages to disappear after one week, and others after four, saying it raised questions about whether federal records law was violated.
Trump rejected calls for Hegseth to be fired and largely pinned the blame on Waltz, whom he ultimately replaced as national security advisor, appointing him as US ambassador to the United Nations instead.
US media then reported in April that Hegseth had created a second Signal chat in which the March Yemen strikes were discussed with people, including his wife and brother, but the Pentagon chief likewise weathered that storm and remained in office.
The Houthis began targeting shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden after Israel’s offensive in Gaza began in 2023, claiming solidarity with Palestinians.
Houthi attacks prevented ships from passing through the Suez Canal, a vital route that normally carries about 12 per cent of world shipping traffic, forcing many companies into a costly detour around southern Africa.
The United States first began conducting strikes in response to the attacks under the Biden administration, and US forces launched a renewed air campaign against the Houthis on March 15.
Trump’s strikes against the Houthis lasted until early May, when a ceasefire agreement was reached with the help of Omani mediation.</p><small>2025-12-04 05:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0410070682606a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959134/trump-administration-orders-enhanced-vetting-for-applicants-of-h-1b-visa' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration orders enhanced vetting for applicants of H-1B visa</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration on Wednesday announced increased vetting of applicants for H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, with an internal State Department memo saying that anyone involved in “censorship” of free speech be considered for rejection.
H-1B visas, which allow US employers to hire foreign workers in speciality fields, are crucial for US tech companies which recruit heavily from countries including India and China.
Many of those companies’ leaders threw their support behind Trump in the last presidential election.
The cable, sent to all US missions on December 2, orders US consular officers to review resumes or LinkedIn profiles of H-1B applicants – and family members who would be travelling with them – to see if they have worked in areas that include activities such as misinformation, disinformation, content moderation, fact-checking, compliance and online safety, among others.
“If you uncover evidence an applicant was responsible for, or complicit in, censorship or attempted censorship of protected expression in the United States, you should pursue a finding that the applicant is ineligible,” under a specific article of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the cable said.
Details on the enhanced vetting for H-1B visas, including the focus on censorship and free speech, have not been previously reported.
The cable said all visa applicants were subject to this policy, but sought a heightened review for the H-1B applicants given they frequently worked in the technology sector “including in social media or financial services companies involved in the suppression of protected expression”.
“You must thoroughly explore their employment histories to ensure no participation in such activities,” the cable said.
The new vetting requirements apply to both new and repeat applicants.
“We do not support aliens coming to the United States to work as censors muzzling Americans,” a State Department spokesperson said, but added that it does not comment on “allegedly leaked documents”.
“In the past, the president himself was the victim of this kind of abuse when social media companies locked his accounts.
He does not want other Americans to suffer this way. Allowing foreigners to lead this type of censorship would both insult and injure the American people,” the spokesperson said.
The Trump administration has made free speech, particularly what it sees as the stifling of conservative voices online, a focus of its foreign policy.
Officials have repeatedly weighed in on European politics to denounce what they say is suppression of right-wing politicians, including in Romania, Germany and France, accusing European authorities of censoring views like criticism of immigration in the name of countering disinformation.
In May, Rubio threatened visa bans for people who censor speech by Americans, including on social media, and suggested the policy could target foreign officials regulating US tech companies.
The Trump administration has already significantly tightened its vetting of applicants for student visas, ordering US consular officers to screen for any social media posts that may be hostile towards the United States.
As part of his wide-ranging crackdown on immigration, Trump in September imposed new fees on H-1B visas.
Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly accused the administration of Democratic former president Joe Biden of encouraging suppression of free speech on online platforms, claims that have centred on efforts to stem false claims about vaccines and elections.</p><small>2025-12-04 05:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637284-pakistan-to-open-torkham-chaman-border-crossings-with-afghanistan-for-un-cargoes' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan partially opens Afghan border crossings for UN cargoes</strong></a><br><p>

Your dream job offer can be a nightmare, warns FIA</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) says criminal syndicates are operating in Southeast Asia targeting Pakistanis with fake job offers and warned all those availing themselves of such “phony opportunities” should thoroughly verify to save them from trouble.
“Criminal syndicates operating in Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia are targeting Pakistanis with fake job offers, especially in the IT sector – call center and relevant jobs, promising high salaries. However, upon arrival, these Pakistanis are forced into illegal activities, including cyber and financial crimes. Those who resist face severe consequences, including violence and extortion from the victim’s family,” FIA deputy director Mehmood Ali Khokhar said on Wednesday.

 

He urged the aspirants to first verify such job offers through legitimate sources or report such suspicious activity or persons to FIA.
“Beware of false promises! As your dream job offer could be a nightmare,” the FIA official said.

Criminal syndicates operate in Thailand, Myanmar and target Pakistanis with fake job offers

The FIA has also run a public campaign on social media in this regard after incidents surfaced wherein several Pakistanis were rescued from fake call centres in Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia.
Thai and Cambodian authorities this year conducted a joint raid on a three-story building suspected of housing a major cyber fraud operation. A total of 215 foreign nationals were freed, including 50 Pakistanis, 109 Thais, 48 Indians, five Taiwanese, and three Indonesians.
Similarly, in the other incident this year, the Thai army crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar led hundreds of trapped workers to flee across the border into Thailand. Some 38 Pakistanis were among those who crossed the border. Another 60 Pakistanis were in a shelter house awaiting identification and document verification for repatriation.
According to the FIA, the victims in these cases were often lured with false promises of lucrative jobs, but upon arrival, their passports were seized and they were forced into illegal cyber and financial crimes, such as “pig butchering” scams.
Hundreds of thousands of people reportedly are trafficked across Southeast Asia annually and forced into these scam operations.
Meanwhile, FIA Lahore Director Ali Zia paid a visit to the Allama Iqbal International Airport and reviewed the immigration counters and the facilities being provided to passengers. Immigration officials were instructed to ensure courtesy and complete transparency while dealing with passengers.
“Officers deployed at international departures and arrivals were directed to maintain the highest standards of professionalism in their conduct. The FIA is committed to strengthening the immigration system in line with international standards,” he said.
“Actions against illegal travel, fake visas, and human smuggling will be further intensified,” he said and reaffirmed the agency’s resolve that the FIA would continue its operations against human smuggling, illegal travel and corruption.

First it was an inquiry report by the KMC on the incident which attributed the tragedy to the “carelessness” of officials of the Red Line project and a department store adjacent to where the incident took place.
The body of the child, who died after falling into an open manhole near Nipa in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night, was found on Monday, around 15 hours after the incident.
The report by the KMC said that the department had received instructions from Mayor Murtaza Wahab and the municipal commissioner to initiate an operation for recovering the body of the child from the drain.

Assistant commissioner among five officials suspended by CM

It said that following the recovery of the child’s body “the site was meticulously inspected to ascertain the exact cause of the drowning”.
According to the report, the inspection revealed the ongoing BRT construction work at the location to be a “significant contributing factor”.
“Based on reports from the inspector concerned and area residents, the BRT construction has resulted in the severe damage and disruption of the entire drainage system, which runs from Nipa towards Aziz Bhatti Park,” it said.
“It was observed that, at most locations, the drains were covered with temporary two by two feet square covers. Unfortunately, one of these covers was reportedly left open in front of the departmental store. It is pertinent to mention that the procedure of covering cleaning pits with two by two feet square covers from Nipa to Aziz Bhatti Park road is a non-standard practice never implemented by the KMC at any location.”
It further stressed that BRT service officials had failed to formally notify or obtain clearance from the KMC before carrying out excavation work. “These pits were excavated by BRT officials and subsequently paved over during road construction,” the report said.
In light of those facts, the report concluded that the incident occurred due to the “carelessness of both the concerned BRT officials and the management of Chase Departmental Store” as “neither took adequate measures to secure the open drain”.
Blaming Red Line project represents ‘serious oversight’
However, within hours of the report hitting television screens and going viral across social media platforms, the Red Line management issued a strong rebuttal to the KMC’s claims, calling the findings “a distraction from the actual responsibilities” and insisting the tragedy occurred far from any of its construction activity.
In a letter to KMC authorities, it said that there has been no civil works activity on or near the site of the unfortunate incident.
“It is important to clarify that the location of the incident is at a considerable distance from the BRT Red Line construction works,” reads the letter, a copy of which is provided to Dawn.
“There is currently no excavation, no barrication for construction, or any form of activity by the BRT Red Line team at or near the incident site, even the road pavement is intact. Moreover, the BRT project has no administrative, operational, or maintenance responsibility for the sewerage or Nullah infrastructure where the incident occurred. Furthermore, there have been no civil works activity on or near the site of the unfortunate incident,” it said.

 

It said that the ongoing works of the BRT were initiated after obtaining a no-objection certificate from the relevant authorities, who all were taken on board for construction before start of any activity on the site.
“The parking area where the incident took place is utilised by the store and is [at] considerable distance from BRT works, thus, attributing this tragic incident to the BRT Red Line project represents serious oversight and distraction from the actual responsibilities,” added the letter.
Five officials suspended
Also on Wednesday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered the suspension of five officials over their alleged negligence.
The officials are Senior Director of Municipal Services at KMC Imran Rajput, Assistant Executive Engineer of Town Municipal Corporation Gulshan-i-Iqbal Rashid Fayaz, Executive Engineer of Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation Waqar Ahmed, Gulshan Assistant Commissioner and Mukhtiarkar Amir Ali Shah and Salman Farsi.

MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, who is also chairman of the District Development Advisory Committee, are yet to visit upper Bara, residents complained, saying they were now pinning their hopes on new Chief Minister Suhail Afridi, who also belongs to Bara.
The Khyber district administration and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority also have failed to complete the assessment survey of the damaged houses while residents are compelled to either live in dilapidated houses or have taken shelter in temporary abodes to get through harsh winter.

 

Most of the displaced families returned to Tirah back in 2015 and 2016, while families from Upper Bara localities were allowed to go back in 2022 after the region was de-notified.

Ironically, more than 2,500 families from the region with mostly hailing from Upper Bara were not given the status of internally displaced persons at the time of their forced displacement and were thus deprived of most of the facilities and assistance pledged by the disaster management authorities to IDPs of other regions.
Residents Dawn spoke to presented a long list of their problems, which they had been facing since their return, with immediate reconstruction of their fully and partially damaged homes as their urgent requirement.

 

They said they were still awaiting provision of drinking water, electricity, rehabilitation of health and educational facilities, repair of damaged irrigation channels, provision of quality seeds along with modern agricultural machinery and tools, construction of bridges over Bara River and creation of jobs for local unemployed youth.
Khalil Khan, a social activist, told Dawn that literacy rate in most parts of Tirah was rapidly declining due to absence of formal schooling, while people faced extreme difficulties in acquiring better health facilities due to nonexistence of a well-equipped hospital in the entire valley.
The Type-D Hospital, announced in 2015 by then Governor Sardar Mehtab Ahmad Khan was yet to be constructed, he lamented and added most people either relied on private clinics or took patients to Bara, Jamrud and Peshawar hospitals.
He warned Tirah youth could easily fall prey to insinuations of terrorist groups as they were mostly uneducated and thus unemployed. “It’s time Tirah youth were engaged in productive activities by imparting them skills development training and recruiting them to police and other departments,” he suggested.
Suhbat Shah Afridi, a resident of Upper Bara, said they had so far received limited assistance from some NGOs while the security forces stationed in the region also helped execute certain development schemes.
He, however, regretted that parliamentarians were yet to announce any development project. “The provincial government shall encourage NOGs to initiate mega projects for our region to alleviate the sufferings of the returned families,” he demanded.
“At present, it seems our region is not included in the domain of the government departments and thus we have no or little access to the basic facilities of life,” he stated.
Dawn approached MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani for their response to complaints from Tirah residents but none responded till filing of this story.

The country ranks near the top of both the corruption and climate risk indices — an overlap suggesting causation. Yet this critical nexus remains glaringly absent from the IMF’s Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Report. The omission is striking given the IMF’s own $1.4 billion investment in climate resilience through the Resilient and Sustainable Finance facility. Could systemic corruption lie at the root of Pakistan’s worsening climate exposure? Can the country build climate resilience without first confronting the governance failures that amplify environmental disasters? The GCDR has not addressed this urgent nexus between corruption and climate risk.
Fatal blind spots: Corruption in Pakistan drains up to 6.5 per cent of GDP annually, according to the GCDR. Meanwhile, climate disasters and their extended impacts are estimated by the World Bank and other sources to cost Pakistan about 9.5pc of GDP each year through direct damage and broader economic disruptions. Together, these shocks represent a combined annual economic loss exceeding 15pc of GDP, highlighting climate risk as a foundational, not secondary, threat to Pakistan’s economic stability.

 

The GCDR has glaring gaps in linking corruption to environmental and climate issues: while the opening chapters identify corruption as a development barrier and examine elite capture, they provide no detailed analysis connecting these practices to ecosystem degradation or climate vulnerability. Subsequent chapters on economic and institutional governance highlight regulatory capture in key resource sectors, yet do not explicitly link these failures to environmental degradation or climate shocks. Even sections on rule of law and accountability systems emphasise weak enforcement without addressing environmental law or climate-risk screening gaps.
The GCDR treats climate vulnerability as largely separate from corruption and fiscal analyses, never clarifying how Pakistan’s governance failures multiply climate costs. This separation obscures the causal mechanism: when 30-40pc of climate finance is diverted through corrupt practices, adaptation becomes maladaptation. The 2022 floods exposed this deadly equation: substandard embankments built through kickback-laden contracts failed catastrophically, transforming what hydrological models predicted as manageable flooding into a national displacement crisis affecting 33 million people. Investigation revealed that contractors had used substandard materials while billing for reinforced structures, with inspection reports falsified by complicit officials.

The IMF report sidesteps how governance rot directly manufactures climate catastrophe.

The IMF report provides a detailed multi-sectoral analysis of how institutional failures haemorrhage 6.5pc of GDP, yet critically sidesteps how governance rot directly manufactures climate catastrophe. Consider water allocation: elite-captured irrigation authorities divert flows to politically connected landowners growing water-intensive crops during droughts, leaving smallholder farmers with empty canals and forcing rural-urban migration. This isn’t just corruption. It is climate vulnerability engineered into resource governance, creating conditions where natural climate variability becomes social catastrophe.

 

The GCDR’s analysis examines regulatory capture in resource sectors, weak environmental law enforcement and accountability gaps but does not synthesise these failures into the compound climate impact. This approach prevents an integrated policy response: climate-resilient procurement standards that turn infrastructure risk assessments into corruption deterrents, rather than bureaucratic add-ons.
Corruption as climate multiplier: When viewed through a climate lens, each governance failure the IMF has documented is a compound climate risk. Corruption, defined as the illegal misuse of public office for private gain, differs from elite and state capture that is embedded in the political economy. Elite capture is a more complex phenomenon where powerful interest groups not only break the rules but also manipulate state structures to design policies, laws, rules and procedures, exemptions and waivers, subsidy and tax regimes that legally channel public resources for their private benefit.
This distinction matters for climate policy design. Technical anti-corruption fixes such as stronger audits, digital procurement systems and whistleblower protections fail if they ignore the unequal power dynamics that allow a narrow elite to steer the system away from climate resilience towards maladaptive development. Elite capture increases climate vulnerability through opaque land-use rules that permit construction on floodplains, unregulated water allocation favouring politically connected agricultural exporters, and fast-track infrastructure projects that bypass environmental standards. This makes climate maladaptation an official, legal outcome of economic activity that no corruption investigation can touch.
Despite prioritising public procurement reform within one year, the report fails to address over 1,000 stalled or ongoing public sector projects with a cumulative throw-forward of Rs8.5 trillion or so. An inordinately high percentage symbolises elite capture: for instance, the Reko Diq copper-gold project without adequate water security assessments in Balochistan’s water-scarce areas, motorways routed through ecologically sensitive zones to benefit connected developers, and coastal highways accelerating erosion and displacing fishing communities.
These projects don’t just waste resources, they also increase climate vulnerability while consuming the budgetary capacity for the next decade, creating locked-in maladaptation that reforms cannot easily reverse. Without confronting this legacy portfolio, improved procurement transparency cannot deliver climate-resilient infrastructure. The solution requires political economy mapping to identify which elite groups benefit from maladaptation.
Cost of inaction: Pakistan cannot build climate resilience without reforming corrupt institutions, yet it cannot delay climate adaptation while undertaking decade-long institutional reforms. This is not a sequencing problem; it is a simultaneity imperative. Every year spent ‘fixing governance first’ means a corrupted disaster response converts manageable floods into displacement crises, elite-captured water allocation intensifies droughts, and diverted climate finance ensures infrastructure fails at the next shock. A recent analysis projects that climate inaction will cost Pakistan $250bn by 2030 and $1.2tr by 2050.
The way forward requires abandoning false choices between governance reform and climate action. Pakistan needs climate-conditioned governance interventions. In Pakistan, governance failure is climate failure.

A couple of things must be borne in mind when advancing suggestions or ideas about how the NFC ought to be changed. First, the funds being divided up under the NFC award do not belong to the federal government. They belong to the federation as a whole, which includes the federal government as well as the provinces. This is important because some people seem to think that the funds are the property of the federal government which is giving these to the provincial governments. This is not the case.
Second, the relationship between the centre and province in a federation is not that of a senior and junior partner. It is a relationship of equals. This is important because some people seem to think that the federal government should ask the provincial governments to explain what they are doing with the funds that are ‘given’ to them, and perhaps develop known performance metrics to measure outcomes and link future disbursements to success. The provincial governments, in a federation, are not accountable to the centre for anything. They are accountable to their voters.
To understand this better, it is important to go into a bit of history. Pakistan’s fiscal federalism was born out of the Government of India Act, 1935, which gave the provinces the right to collect all taxes on incomes, sales and production within their territory. The central government was to sustain itself on taxes on foreign trade and non-tax collections only. This was fairly standard practice in federations of that time, for example, Australia. It was also common for federating units to vertically delegate powers to levy and collect certain taxes to the central authorities against an agreement that such an arrangement would either be temporary, or the funds collected would be transferred back to the provincial authorities as per a formula.
These delegations of power happened for various reasons. In some countries, they happened to help the central authorities meet war expenses. In India this delegation happened to help meet the requirements of creating a national market, and in Pakistan it happened for helping create a national market and helping the centre meet the extraordinary burden of state making in the days following Partition.

Do the provinces have the right to ask where all the money poured into SOEs since 2009 has gone?

Needless to say, once delegated upwards, the powers to levy and collect these taxes were never returned. In all countries where this happened, this turned into a source of friction that was settled, often partially, through some sort of an arrangement. In Pakistan, such an arrangement never materialised, and this refusal to honour the provinces’ rights over their own resources became one of the points of friction in the wrangling between East and West Pakistan over the distribution and allocation of state resources. But since Pakistan was a dictatorship in those days, there was no way within the system for the aggrieved party (the eastern wing) to seek redressal. The rest, as they say, is history.
The matter was resolved in the 1973 Constitution, through the creation of the NFC mechanism, and the associated structures to deal with state resources. The Constitution created a divisible pool where all taxes collected via those heads that are supposed to belong to the provinces will be deposited. Once in the divisible pool, the resources were then to be transferred to all federating units — the centre and the four provinces — according to a formula developed consensually and updated every five years. There is, therefore, one Federal Divisible Pool into which all resources that belong to the federation as a whole are deposited. And there are five consolidated funds, one for each of the four provinces and one for the federal government, into which the resources of the divisible pool are transferred. Each unit owns the resources in their consolidated fund. All of them collectively own the resources in the divisible pool.

 

So it is wrong to think that the money collected under the taxes identified as part of the divisible pool are somehow the property of the federal government, even if the powers to levy and collect these taxes are with the federal government. And the Constitution ensures that ownership rights do not vest with any federating unit until after they have been transferred.
If the federal authorities demand results for the money that has been transferred to the provinces under the NFC award, then the provinces have the same right in reverse. So it is true that the provinces have failed in producing health and education improvements or in mobilising some new revenue heads like agriculture taxation. But the federal authorities have also failed in reforming the state-owned enterprises or in raising their tax-to-GDP ratio above 10 per cent. In FY24, for example, the government extended Rs1.586 trillion in fiscal support to the SOEs while they, in turn, contributed Rs367 billion in taxes.
Do the provinces have a right to ask where all the money poured into the SOEs over the years since 2009 has gone? Are these SOEs today powering Pakistan’s exports? Are they drivers of technological innovation? Is PIA an airline competitive with its counterparts in Turkey, Ethiopia or Thailand? Why does the federal government still carry these entities and their losses? Should the provinces demand performance-based indicators from the federal authorities for reforms in tax reform or SOE restructuring before agreeing to any federal allocations under the NFC award?
Let’s agree this would be a fruitless discussion between the centre and province. Neither is answerable or accountable to the other. They are both answerable to their voters (in theory anyways). And neither has the right to impose performance criteria on the other. If the federal authorities feel they are poorer after making all the NFC transfers, they should walk the hard road of tax reform rather than look to cannibalise the federation to secure their own survival.

CJP Afridi, who is also chairman of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC), also emphasised that the integration of modern technology was no longer optional but essential for delivering accessible and efficient justice across the country.
He expressed these views while addressing the participants of a consultative workshop on “National E-Court Reform Agenda: Require­ments and Challenges”, held at the Federal Judicial Academy.
The event brought together Justice Muham­mad Ali Mazhar of the Supreme Court, the in­formation technology and telecommunication secretary, chairman of the Pakistan Digital Authority, secretaries of the National Com­mi­ssion on Status of Women and Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, registrars of the Supreme Court and all high courts, IT experts and senior judicial officers from across the country to deliberate on the national digital transformation agenda for the judiciary.
CJP Afridi highlighted the pivotal role of the National Judicial Automation Committee (NJAC), chaired by Justice Mazhar, in spearheading the digital transformation of the judiciary. He noted that the NJAC, functioning under the NJPMC, provides the institutional backbone for harmonising digital initiatives across all courts in the country.
Earlier during the workshop, the registrars of high courts and members of the Pakistan Digital Authority presented detailed assessments of the existing technological landscape, digitisation progress, and the challenges faced by courts at various tiers.
Their presentations focused on establishing an integrated national e-court ecosystem, developing a unified digital master plan, and promoting interoperability among judicial institutions.

The approved projects inc­lude the Next Generation Bro­adband Services for Sustai­n­able Development (NGBSD), with six projects set to deliver high-speed broadband and voice services to 1.267m people across 753 mauzas in seven districts.
The USF board also approved three projects to lay 1,428km optical fibre network (OFC) across 178 towns and union councils in four districts, enabling connectivity for 4.29m people.

 

The new projects received formal approval during the 101st meeting of the USF Bo­­ard of Directors, chaired by its Chairman and Information Te­­chnology and Telecomm­uni­ca­tion Secretary Zarrar Hasham Khan. The meeting was atte­nded by PTA Chairman retir­­ed Maj Gen Hafeezur Rehman, Member Telecom Jahanzeb Rahim, independent board members Muhammad Yousuf and Ayla Majid, USF CEO Chaudhry Mudassar Naveed, and other senior officials.
The USF board awarded the projects to various service providers following a rigorous and transparent process, selecting the lowest compliant bidders.
The NGBSD projects will be initiated in Umar Kot district (Sindh), Gujranwala, Mandi Bahauddin and Muzaffargarh districts (Punjab), Kohat and Mansehra districts (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), and Khuzdar district (Balochistan). The optical fibre projects will cover Sialkot and Narowal districts (Punjab) and the Quetta-Ziarat region.
Zarrar Hasham emphasised the urgent need to enhance fiberisation of mobile towers and base transceiver stations (BTS) nationwide, urging the USF to lead this effort within its mandate.
He said USF projects play an instrumental role in empowering rural communities, with connectivity serving as a key driver for digital growth and the IT sector. He also noted the fund’s vital support for the IT industry, freelancers, and essential health and education services.
To date, approximately 39.4m rural residents have been served or enabled with broadband, voice, and fixed-line services through USF projects, he added.
Mudassar Naveed outlined the highlights of the new projects, detailed the transparent bidding process, and explained the expected positive impact in the designated areas.

Sadly, over the decades we have witnessed the space for non-Muslim minorities shrink considerably. This has been manifested in the form of prejudice and discrimination that these communities face, while in worse instances, non-Muslim citizens, their properties and places of worship have come under violent attack from extremists.
The state has pledged after every such atrocity to protect minorities and crack down on extremism. Yet to achieve both goals, institutional responses are required, and the state has a mixed report card in this area. In a related development, the National Commission for Minorities Rights Bill, 2025, was passed by parliament on Tuesday in order to create a proper framework to address the issues of non-Muslim citizens.
The federal law minister told parliament that the commission would look into issues such as forced conversions, job quotas, sanitation workers’ rights and other “matters of dignity”. The bill’s passage faced significant opposition from both religious and mainstream parties over its proviso that it would have ‘overriding effect’ — meaning that when passed, it would have precedence over previous laws. Many felt this would dilute earlier laws which concerned the Ahmadi community.

 

In order to get the legislation passed, that clause, as well as suo motu powers for the minorities commission, were dropped. While theological matters are best left to scholars and ulema, when it comes to basic constitutional protections, the fundamental rights of all communities must be protected and guaranteed.
This would not be the first body concerning minorities’ rights in the country. The human rights ministry and the National Commission for Human Rights do similar work, and provincial bodies to protect non-Muslims’ rights already exist. Moreover, a minority rights commission had previously been formed. What the current bill does is give the commission a statutory status.
Creating a dedicated body for the welfare of minorities, and the protection of non-Muslims’ rights, is a welcome step. Yet the body has much work to do in order to create a level playing field for non-Muslim Pakistanis. This body, along with all state organs, must work proactively to address the key issues affecting minorities, and work to resolve these as per the demands of justice.
Moreover, a complementary effort is needed to counter extremism and zealotry in society. Laws and commissions matter little when rabble-rousers decide to work up mobs using religious justifications. Therefore, the primary effort of the state should be to penalise hate-mongers. If incidents targeting minorities occur, then those who are involved in violent episodes need to be swiftly brought to justice. Through such combined endeavours, the journey towards a more equal Pakistan can begin.

The petitioner argued that Mr Khan was facing “multiple health complications” and “required assessment from specialist doctors”.
He claimed that the PTI founder had been jailed as a political victim under alleged pressure from the government and, therefore, was entitled to quality medical facilities in the interest of justice.
The Punjab government has been made a respondent in the petition through its prison department.
The IHC has fixed the petition for hearing and sought records from relevant authorities.

Plea moved by KP CM says ex-premier facing multiple health complications

The plea comes a day after Mr Khan’s sister, Uzma Khanum, dispelled rumours regarding her brother’s health following a supervised meeting with him in Adiala jail.
Speaking to the media, she said the former premier was “perfectly fine”, though “extremely angry” and alleging that he and his wife Bushra Bibi were being subjected to “mental torture” by confining them to a small room and denied communication for weeks.
She said her brother complained that he had not been allowed to meet anyone for four weeks and was confined to his cell most of the day with minimal time outdoors. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes and was held under strict monitoring without mobile devices.
Weekly protests
Separately, Aleema Khanum announ­ced that she and Uzma would stage a sit-in outside Adiala jail on Tuesdays until six family members and six lawyers were allowed visitation, while PTI workers would hold their own sit-in on Thursdays.
PTI supporters had staged demonstrations outside the jail and the IHC a day earlier to protest restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights, claiming that no one had been allowed to meet him or Bushra Bibi since Oct 27. Islam­abad and Rawalpindi administrations had imposed Section 144 ahead of the protests.
Four protesters remanded to jail
Meanwhile, Judicial Magistrate Shahzad Khan on Wednesday sent four PTI workers to Adiala jail on judicial remand after they were arrested for violating the ban imposed on gatherings in twin cities by staging protests.
According to the police, the accused were detained from Sector G-14 and were found in possession of PTI flags, badges and photographs of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi.
An FIR was registered at Sumbal police station, and the police told the magistrate that further investigation was underway.

CAIRO: Israel announced on Wednesday it would unilaterally open the Rafah crossing to allow residents to flee the Gaza Strip, a move swiftly rejected by Egypt as Cairo insisted on lifting the blockade in both directions to relieve the besieged Palestinian territory.
The clash over the crossing underscores the desperate reality for Gaza’s population, who have been trapped under an intensifying siege since the Israeli military seized the Palestinian side of the terminal in May 2024.
While Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said the crossing would open in the “coming days” exclusively for the exit of residents, Egypt denied any such agreement exists, refusing to facilitate what critics fear is the forced displacement of Palestinians.
“If an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip,” Egypt’s State Information Service said in a statement, insisting on adherence to the terms of the US-brokered peace plan which mandates full humanitarian access.
The Rafah crossing, the only vital artery to the outside world for the residents of Gaza not controlled directly by Israel, has been shuttered for months, strangling the flow of life-saving aid.
COGAT claimed the operation would be supervised by an EU Border Assistance Mission, mirroring a mechanism from a brief truce in early 2025. However, European diplomatic sources indicated that previous preparations to open the crossing were delayed, prolonging the suffering of civilians.
While COGAT claimed convoys are passing through the nearby Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, humanitarian actors on the ground described the aid volume as pitifully inadequate compared to the scale of devastation.
UN sources in Cairo revealed that while agreements promised 600 trucks daily, Israeli restrictions have kept that number at just over 100. “The vast majority of cargo entering is food, while essential goods like tents and medical equipment are still denied or face significant delays,” the UN sources said.
Residents stranded
For the Palestinians inside Gaza, the continued closure of the territory’s main gateway is a death sentence, particularly for the sick and wounded.
At least 16,500 patients in the war-ravaged enclave urgently require medical care outside the strip, according to the United Nations.
Since the Israeli military seized control of the border zone and shut down movement, the vast majority of these patients have been left stranded without access to specialised treatment.
The situation has drawn pleas from medical officials who witness preventable deaths daily. Hani Isleem, an official with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), warned that the current trickle of medical evacuations is negligible.
“The need is really huge,” Isleem said. He noted that the numbers accepted by foreign countries so far remain “just a drop in the ocean.”
The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 8,000 patients have been evacuated since Oct 2023, but thousands more remain trapped. Isleem said the official count of 16,500 seeking treatment is likely a severe underestimate, placing the true figure three to four times higher.
More than 900 people have died while waiting for evacuations since the war began, a statistic Isleem called a conservative estimate.
Another truce violation
Beyond the humanitarian catastrophe, the ceasefire remains fragile as bloodshed continues.
On Wednesday, health officials at Al-Ahli Hospital reported that two Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire in the Zeitoun suburb of Gaza City.
Diplomatic efforts are currently stalled over Israel’s refusal to fully reopen the border until the bodies of deceased prisoners are returned.
Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have already released 20 living prisoners and 26 bodies in exchange for roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.
Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad said it handed over a body to the Red Cross, found during a search in northern Gaza. The refusal to open the border for incoming aid constitutes a violation of the framework envisioned to end the conflict.

Workers aged 55 and older have been the fastest-growing group in the US labour force for more than two decades. Their share has risen from 10 per cent in 1994 to 24pc in 2022. Yet the distribution of older workers is far from uniform across industries and states. Some sectors and regions have far higher concentrations of older employees than others, according to the Census Bureau’s survey of Business Dynamics Statistics of Human Capital (BDS-HC).
The utilities sector has seen the most dramatic shift. In 2006, 35pc of employment in this sector was at firms where at least a quarter of workers were over 55. By 2022, that figure had jumped to 80pc.

 

Manufacturing and wholesale trades have also seen substantial increases: in 2000, only 14pc of employment in these sectors was at firms with at least a quarter of older workers; by 2022, the share exceeded 40pc.
In contrast, Retail Trade and Accommodation and Food Services remain largely populated by younger workers. Only 14pc of Retail Trade employment and 10pc of Accommodation and Food Services employment is at firms with high shares of older employees.
State-level differences are equally pronounced. Maine, with the nation’s highest median age of 44.7 in 2022, has 39pc of employment at firms where at least a quarter of workers are over 55. Utah, the youngest state with a median age of 32, has only 14pc.
States with median ages between 39 and 41 — including New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois — have at least 30pc of employment at firms with high shares of older workers.
Even within states with older populations, patterns vary: Florida’s median age of 42.6 is higher than New York’s, yet only 25pc of employment is at firms with a quarter of older employees, reflecting differences in local industries and occupations. The survey also shows how workforce age shapes firm dynamics. Companies with more older workers tend to create fewer jobs and launch fewer new establishments, though they are equally likely to close existing ones compared with younger-workforce firms.
On average, firms with 25pc – 50pc of employees over 55 shrank about 2pc per year, while firms with less than 10pc older employees grew around 2pc. Start-ups are consistently younger: 10pc of employment at newly opened firms is at businesses where over half of workers are aged 19–24, compared with only 3pc at firms older than 11 years.
More mature firms are more likely to have higher shares of employees over 55, while start-ups tend to hire younger workers in their 20s, 30s, and early 40s.
Metro-level population trends reinforce the picture. Nearly all of the nation’s 387 metropolitan areas saw growth in residents aged 65 and older between 2020 and 2023, while about 80pc of metro areas experienced declines in children aged 0–14. Large metros such as New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago have seen the number of children decline, whereas younger metros like Provo–Orem–Lehi, Utah, and some Texas cities retain a lower median age and more children.

ISLAMABAD: Amid disagreements within the opposition party, PTI founding chairman Imran Khan has dissolved the party’s political committee in his first move after weeks of being incommunicado.
A tweet posted on his X account, which the ex-prime minister does not have access to while incarcerated, said a smaller committee would replace the existing body and put Salman Akram Raja in charge of the reconstitution process.
“I am dissolving the political committee of the PTI today. Party’s Secretary General Salman Akram Raja has full authority to form a smaller committee to formulate a political strategy and implement it,” the tweet based on the account of the Tuesday meeting said.







It may be noted that a day earlier, Uzma Khan met her brother in prison after weeks of effort.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram told Dawn the political committee, comprising about 40 members, would be replaced by a smaller body. been resolved, and a committee having fewer members will replace it. He said the new committee most likely will include provincial heads, leaders of the opposition, and a few other members.
Since the PTI’s intra-party elections have been repeatedly rejected by the Election Commission of Pakistan, the party does not have an elected leadership structure in the form of a core committee, and the day-to-day functions of the party are being handled by the political committee.
Senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said the proposal for the dissolution of the political committee had been floated many a time by the members. He said one of the reasons for its dissolution was that its decisions were being leaked, adding that the timing of the decision did not matter since the proposal had been under consideration for some time. He said a coordination committee, comprising the provincial and central leaders as well as the allies, will be established instead.
It may be noted that an internal memo by the party was issued recently, which aimed to centralise control in the office of the secretary general, Salman Akram Raja.
The move had come under fire, as party insiders said it seemed to be an attempt to “end democracy and silence dissent” in the PTI.
Imran Khan also said Shahid Khattak should be appointed as the parliamentary leader in the National Assembly. It may be noted that Zartaj Gul, who was convicted earlier this year, was the parliamentary leader. Imran Khan also authorised Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to reorganise the body of the Insaf Lawyer Forum (ILF).
NDU meeting
The PTI founder also said there was no place for those who were fraternising with his opponents. “The participation of PTI people in the NDU workshop is shameful. On the one hand, we are enduring all kinds of hardships, and on the other hand, when our own people try to increase social ties with those who oppress us, I feel extremely hurt,” his tweet read.
This was an apparent reference to the presence of several PTI leaders at a workshop hosted by the National Defence Univ­e­r­sity. The participation att­racted flak on social media as well, particularly the “socialisation” at the eve­nt. KP spokesperson Shafi­ullah Jan, while speaking on a DawnNewsTV show, said these leaders participated in the NDU workshop after their names were forwarded by the parliamentary committee and the KP Assembly speaker.
He said in future, such decisions will be taken following the approval of the leadership.

The government has completely suspended customs clearance for both exports and imports, along with Afghan Transit Trade (ATT) cargos, at major border crossings — including Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective October 12, and at the Chaman border from October 15.
An official letter was issued to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the Directorate Gen­eral of Transit Trade to initiate the movement of consignments belonging to three United Nations agencies through the border crossings at Chaman and Torkham.
In the first phase, a total of 143 containers of humanitarian goods will be allowed for clearance at Chaman and Torkham. The breakdown shows that the containers incl­ude 67 containers of food assistance from the World Food Programme (WFP), 74 containers of supplies for children from Unicef, and two containers of healthcare and family support items from UNFPA.
Officials confirmed that the decision followed instr­uctions issued by the foreign ministry after consultations with the UN resident coordinator in Pakistan.
According to letter, the cargo movement will proceed in three stages: the first covers food shipments, the second covers medicine and medical equipment, and the third covers items for education services. More consignments are expected to follow once agencies provide updated requirements.
It further stated that the Directorate General of Transit Trade and FBR were requested to undertake the necessary actions for the clearance and onward transportation of the mentioned containers via Chaman and Torkham, as originally manifested under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement and ATT rules.
Truck drivers and customs workers in Chaman and Torkham had faced long periods without cargo activity, with hundreds of vehicles parked along the routes during the closure.

 

Officials said the reopening applied only to humanitarian ATT cargos and did not signal the restoration of routine trade. Senior officials added that the remaining UN cargo lists would be shared in stages once documentation was verified.
In terms of transit cargo, approximately 495 vehicles are queued for border crossing at Torkham and Chaman. Of these, the majority — 412 vehicles — are stranded at Chaman, while the remaining 83 are held up at Torkham, the announcement added.

 

In the fiscal year 2024–25, Pakistan recorded transit trade imports valued at $1.012 billion, comprising a total of 42,959 containers.

The festival was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.

 

Basant Panchami, with ‘panchami’ meaning the fifth day of the lunar month Magh, is a celebration of future crop prosperity, spring, and good luck. Historically, in the 19th century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh held an annual Basant fair and introduced kite flying as a regular feature. The association of kite flying with Basant soon became a tradition centred in Lahore, which remains the regional hub of the festival throughout Punjab even today. However, the festival has also traditionally been celebrated in other parts of Punjab, including Indian Punjab. Over time, the festival began to be celebrated across the country.
During the festival, the city sky is filled with colourful kites of all shapes and sizes flown from rooftops. The kites are controlled with strings usually embedded with thin shards of glass, which help cut the threads of competing kites more effectively.
Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, promulgated by Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, teenagers under 18 are barred from kite flying. A fine of Rs50,000 will be imposed for the first violation and Rs100,000 for subsequent violations. In case of non-payment of the fine, action will be taken against the father or guardian.
Kite flying associations will be registered with the relevant deputy commissioner of the district, and shopkeepers will also be registered, who will be linked to a QR code. To identify a seller or manufacturer, every kite will have a QR code.
The violators will be imprisoned for three to five years, and they will pay a fine of up to Rs2 million for violation of the rules.
As per the ordinance, the manufacturing of only thread-based kite strings will be allowed. Use of metallic, chemical-coated, or sharp strings has been strictly banned, and anyone found using them will face severe legal consequences.
It said manufacturers, traders and sellers of kite flying material would have to be registered with the deputy commissioner or authorised officer, subject to the payment of a fee.
The ordinance could not be taken up on Wednesday, as the assembly session was adjourned to Thursday due to a quorum issue. The expected passage of the ordinance will allow shopkeepers to sell kites.
Despite its promulgation by the governor, the ordinance needs to be passed by the provincial legislature to become an act.
As per its statement of objects and reasons, the ordinance generally prohibits kite flying in Punjab but also empowers the government to allow permissible kite flying under a regulatory framework at “specific places and days”.
Furthermore, it provides for the registration of manufacturers, traders and sellers of permissible kite flying material, as well as that of kite flying associations.
It also provides punishments to deter people who may violate its provisions and provides measures for whistle-blowers to identify those involved in the violations.
The Punjab government brought the festival to a drastic end in 2007 following deaths due to sharp strings.
Motorcyclists were particularly vulnerable to injuries or even fatal accidents while speeding through the narrow lanes of the Walled City, where almost invisible stray kite strings could appear out of nowhere. The strings, allegedly laced with glass and metal, caused multiple critical injuries to bikers.</p><small>2025-12-03 20:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/032346337f690f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958974/childs-drowning-in-manhole-karachi-mayor-assures-impartial-inquiry-action-against-those-found-negligent-in-visit-to-family' target='_blank'><strong>Child’s drowning in manhole: Karachi mayor assures ‘impartial inquiry’, action against those found ‘negligent’ in visit to family</strong></a><br><p>Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab visited the grieving family of a three-year-old boy who fell into an open manhole and drowned in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Wednesday night, assuring them of an impartial inquiry and action against those found negligent.
The body of the boy, who drowned in an open manhole near Nipa in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night, was found on Monday, around 15 hours after the incident occurred.
The child’s tragic death, particularly the lack of cooperation from relevant civic agencies to launch an immediate search, had angered relatives and area residents, who staged a protest on University Road on Sunday night and again during the day on Monday.
On Tuesday, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials.
A post by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation on X on Wednesday night said the mayor visited the boy’s family and extended his condolences.
“An impartial inquiry will be conducted, and anyone found negligent will face action. We will take structured measures to prevent such incidents in the future,” the post quoted the mayor as saying.







Addressing a press conference after meeting the family, the mayor termed the incident a “painful, shameful loss” and said he had no words to describe it adequately.
“I say I seek forgiveness, it was my fault … I believe as mayor I was not successful, for which I am expressing my remorse.”
He said the response by the government, administration and authorities should be “prompt and appropriate” to prevent anyone else falling victim to the same circumstances in the future.
Wahab added he did not want to get bogged down in a “blame game” and said he accepted responsibility, since bickering over the matter would not solve the issue.
The mayor further stated that he was relaying the sentiment from the top level of the provincial government and the PPP leadership that the reasons and issues that led to the death of the toddler would no longer be tolerated, and that action was now being taken.
KMC report attributes death to ‘carelessness’ of BRT, department store officials
A report by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) on the incident attributed the incident to the “carelessness” of officials from the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service and a department store adjacent to where the incident took place, it emerged earlier today.
The report by the KMC, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said that the department had received instructions from the Karachi mayor and the municipal commissioner to initiate an operation for recovering the body of the child from the drain located in front of Chase Departmental Store in Nipa.
It said that following the retrieval of the child’s body, “the site was meticulously inspected to ascertain the exact cause of the drowning”.
According to the report, the inspection found the ongoing BRT construction work at the location to be a “significant contributing factor”.
“Based on reports from the concerned inspector and area residents, the BRT construction has resulted in the severe damage and disruption of the entire drainage system, which runs from Nipa towards Aziz Bhatti Park,” it said.
“It was observed that, at most locations, the drains were covered with temporary two-by-two-foot square covers. Unfortunately, one of these covers was reportedly left open in front of the Chase Departmental Store,” it said.
“It is pertinent to mention that the procedure of covering cleaning pits with two-by-two-foot square covers from Nipa to Aziz Bhatti Park road is a non-standard practice never implemented by KMC at any location,” it said.
It further stressed that BRT service officials had failed to formally notify or obtain clearance from KMC before carrying out excavation work.
“These pits were excavated by BRT officials and subsequently paved over during road construction,” the report said.
In light of those facts, the report concluded that the incident occurred due to the “carelessness of both the concerned BRT officials and the management of Chase Departmental Store” as “neither took adequate measures to secure the open drain”.
It should be mentioned that the construction of the BRT’s Red Line project has turned the city’s major arteries, including one of the busiest thoroughfares, University Road, into construction zones.
The report added that under the monitoring of the deputy commissioner for District East, the assistant commissioner of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, and BRT engineers, the excavated pits had been refilled to maintain the flow of traffic.</p><small>2025-12-03 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03194746c9f4b94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958979/kyrgyzstan-president-arrives-in-islamabad-on-2-day-maiden-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Kyrgyzstan president arrives in Islamabad on 2-day maiden visit</strong></a><br><p>Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Zhaparov arrived in Islamabad on Wednesday for a two-day maiden state visit.
The Kyrgyz president and his high-level delegation comprising senior cabinet ministers, top officials and prominent business leaders landed at Nur Khan Airbase, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari received them.
State-run Radio Pakistan reported that a 21-gun salute was presented in honour of the visiting dignitary while children, dressed in traditional attire, offered him a bouquet.







PM Shehbaz later said in a post on X the visit was the first by a Kyrgyz president in 20 years.
“This long-awaited visit marks a significant moment in our enduring brotherhood.
“I look forward to a meaningful and forward-looking engagement. Pakistan and Kyrgyz Republic are poised for a bright future together.”







A press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office earlier said the invitation for the visit was extended to the Kyrgyzstan president by PM Shehbaz.
Separately, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar welcomed his Kyrgyz counterpart at the Foreign Office.







The FO said the two reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral relations, with a particular focus on trade, energy, connectivity, education and people-to-people contacts, as well as enhanced cooperation at multilateral forums.
“They also exchanged views on recent regional & international developments of mutual interest.
“Both sides reiterated their commitment to further strengthen and diversify bilateral cooperation in all areas of shared interest.”







It later said both sides agreed to hold regular meetings of Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Bilateral Political Consultations and Bilateral Inter-governmental Commission to “unlock the full potential” of their bilateral relationship.
“Both leaders agreed to enhance the bilateral economic cooperation and noted with satisfaction convening of business forum on the sidelines of the visit. The two leaders also hoped that early finalisation of the Transit Trade Agreement would help achieving the bilateral trade target of $100 million.
“Both sides reiterated their shared vision of timely and effective implementation of the CASA-1000 project. They also highlighted the importance of secure, sustainable and diversified connectivity routes between Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan for further enhancement of bilateral as well as regional trade.”
FM Dar appreciated the government and people of the Kyrgyz Republic for being “gracious hosts” to Pakistani students and workers and agreed to take measures to institutionalise and enhance cooperation in the people-to-people sphere.







Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical and spiritual affinities.
The two countries had agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and digital finance in August.
In July, they reaffirmed an agreement to increase bilateral trade to $100 million at a session of their intergovernmental commission.
Alongside bilateral relations, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are both members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa­tion, a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose other members include China, Russia, India, and Iran.</p><small>2025-12-03 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/032241343f9cb4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958988/us-halts-all-asylum-cases-reopens-thousands-under-sweeping-security-review' target='_blank'><strong>US halts all asylum cases, reopens thousands under sweeping security review</strong></a><br><p>The Trump administration has imposed the most sweeping internal freeze on immigration benefits in decades, ordering United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to halt all asylum adjudications and suspend a broad range of applications from nationals of 19 “high-risk” countries, while reopening thousands of previously approved cases for fresh security screening.

 

The directive, issued this week to USCIS field offices, follows a series of violent incidents involving Afghan nationals admitted under earlier programmes. Those cases prompted the White House to conclude that vetting procedures between 2021 and 2024 were “dangerously insufficient”, triggering a system-wide overhaul of immigration screening.
The freeze is the domestic counterpart to Presidential Proclamation 10949, which in June barred the entry of nationals from 19 countries. Now the same nationalities face extensive restrictions inside the US. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has already recommended that the travel-ban list be expanded to more than 30 countries.
“Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom — not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to Americans. We don’t want them. Not one,” Noem said in a statement posted on her X account.







Secretary Noem issued the statement after a Monday meeting with President Donald Trump, who has also signed a series of executive orders tightening immigration controls.
The USCIS memorandum directs officers to place an immediate hold on all asylum applications, regardless of nationality. This includes applicants from countries rarely associated with security concerns. Immigration attorneys say they are not aware of any previous instance in which asylum adjudications were frozen across the board.

 

The order also suspends all immigration benefit applications filed by nationals of the 19 restricted countries. These include green card petitions, replacement green cards, travel documents, parole extensions and applications to preserve continuous residence for naturalisation. Even routine services — such as replacing a lost green card — are now paused.
But the most far-reaching element may be the retroactive review. USCIS officers have been instructed to reopen and re-examine all approved immigration benefits granted to nationals of the listed countries who entered the US on or after Jan 20, 2021. Mandatory interviews — with no possibility of a waiver — will be required in many cases, and cases may be referred to law enforcement if concerns arise during the review.
The memo mentions that the shift began after two recent incidents: the guilty plea of Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, accused of plotting an Islamic State-inspired attack on Election Day 2024, and the arrest of Rahmanullah Lakanwal, charged with killing a National Guard member in Washington. Both men entered the US after 2021. The administration says these cases exposed “critical failures” in identity verification and cross-agency vetting systems.
The memo cites President Trump’s Executive Order 14161, issued on his first day in office, which directed the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to reassess security vulnerabilities across the immigration system. Under the new policy, even individuals who have already passed background checks, including some who obtained green cards or asylum protections, may now be required to undergo additional interviews and updated screening.
The agency acknowledges the delays this will cause but says national security concerns outweigh processing timelines. USCIS has offered no indication of when asylum adjudications or the suspended benefit categories may resume.
In an earlier post, Noem wrote: “If you are a legal professional, the Trump administration is calling on you to join the Justice Department as a deportation judge and help restore integrity and honour to the nation’s immigration court system.”
The call included an offer of an annual salary ranging from $159,951 to $207,500.
Immigration advocates predict legal challenges, noting that the memo effectively shuts down asylum processing nationwide and reverses years of completed cases. Administration officials counter that the steps are necessary to “protect the American people” at a moment when, they say, security gaps remain too wide.
For now, hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and applicants from the restricted countries are left in limbo as the administration undertakes what officials describe as a “top-to-bottom” review of US immigration vetting.
DHS launches new operation against ‘criminal illegal aliens’
Separately, the DHS said it launched a federal law enforcement operation titled ‘Operation Catahoula Crunch’ in New Orleans, Louisiana, targeting what it said were “criminal illegal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies that force local authorities to ignore US Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest detainers”.
“Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin was quoted as saying in the statement.
“It is asinine that these monsters were released back onto New Orleans streets to commit more crimes and create more victims. Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto and rape. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are restoring law and order for the American people.”
The press release mentioned details of 10 individuals who it said had been released back onto the streets of Louisiana, five from Honduras and one each from Vietnam, Jordan, Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico.
It said two of the individuals had since been deported.</p><small>2025-12-03 18:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/03202743b2c0e20.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958985/frustration-in-indonesia-as-flood-survivors-await-aid-toll-crosses-700' target='_blank'><strong>Frustration in Indonesia as flood survivors await aid, toll crosses 700</strong></a><br><p>Officials in Indonesia and Sri Lanka battled on Wednesday to reach survivors of deadly flooding in remote, cut-off regions as the toll in the disaster that hit four countries topped 1,500.
In Indonesia, survivors expressed growing frustration about the slow pace of rescue efforts and aid delivery, as humanitarian groups warned the scale of the challenge was almost unprecedented, even in a country that has faced no shortage of natural disasters.

 

Monsoon rains paired with two tropical storm systems dumped record deluges across Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia’s Sumatra, southern Thailand and northern Malaysia last week.
In Indonesia, 770 were confirmed dead, the country’s disaster management agency said on Wednesday, revising the toll down from 812 it announced earlier in the day. Another 463 people are also missing.
Information is only trickling in as many regions remain physically cut off by flood damage, isolated by electricity and communications failures, or both.
“It’s very challenging logistically to respond,” said Ade Soekadis, executive director of aid group Mercy Corps Indonesia.
“The extent of the damage and the size of the affected area is really huge.” The group is hoping to send hygiene equipment and water, both from Jakarta and locally.
He said reports of food and water shortages were already “very concerning” and the situation will be “more problematic as time goes by”.
‘Like an earthquake’
At an evacuation centre in Pandan, 52-year-old Reinaro Waruwu told AFP he was “disappointed” in the government’s immediate response and the slow arrival of aid.
“Some waited a day and night before receiving help, so they couldn’t be saved,” he said, surrounded by evacuees sitting on mats on the floor in the hall-turned-shelter.
“I am frustrated, it doesn’t need to be said twice,” he added.
He described the floodwaters and landslides as unprecedented.
“It came like an earthquake … I thought ‘Well, if I am going to die, then so be it,’” he said, beginning to sob heavily.
Traumatised, he could not even eat on arrival, and food has only been patchily available, though vegetables arriving on Tuesday offered a “semblance of hope”, he said.
Nearby, Hamida Telaumbaunua, 37, described watching her entire kitchen swept away by floodwaters.
“My heart … this was the first time I experienced such a flood,” she said.
Her home was lost entirely, along with everything but the few possessions she took when she left.
“It’s hard to think about what lies ahead. Maybe as long as we’re still here, it’s okay, but later … I don’t know what will happen.”
In North Aceh, 30-year-old M. Atar said some areas were only just becoming accessible as roads were cleared.
“We are in dire need of clean water. Very much in need,” he said.
The weather system that hit Indonesia also brought heavy rains to Thailand, killing at least 267 people, authorities said today, and Malaysia, where two people were killed.
Sri Lanka ‘open’ for tourists
Though floods are common in Asia during the monsoon season, climate change is making heavy rain events more frequent because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture.
Warmer oceans can also turbocharge storm systems.
A separate weather system, Cyclone Ditwah, brought torrential rain and deadly floods and landslides to much of Sri Lanka last week.
At least 474 people were killed, and authorities have estimated the disaster’s cost at up to $7 billion.
Another 356 people are unaccounted for, including in some of the hardest-hit regions that remain largely inaccessible.
Officials said laws that allow a person to be declared dead only after being missing for six months could be shortened to expedite the issuance of death certificates.
The government has said it will offer 25,000 rupees ($83) to families to help clean their homes. Those who lost homes will receive up to $8,000.
On the outskirts of Colombo, RMV Lalith was beginning the clean-up at his two-storey home.
“We managed to salvage some furniture by moving it upstairs, but the kitchen is a mess,” he told AFP, as a relative helped push mud out of the living room.

Despite the disaster, the tourism-reliant country welcomed a luxury cruiseliner to Colombo port on Tuesday, authorities said.
The arrival sends “a clear message to the world: Sri Lanka is safe, open, and ready to embrace visitors once again”, the country’s tourist board said.
PM Shehbaz offers flood relief support to President Prabowo
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif conveyed Pakistan’s deep condolences and solidarity to Indonesia during a telephonic conversation with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
“The prime minister extended heartfelt sympathy on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan, calling the devastation a tragic human loss that Pakistan deeply mourns,” said a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office.







Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support, PM Shehbaz assured President Prabowo that the country was ready to provide all possible relief and humanitarian assistance.
He offered to share Pakistan’s extensive experience in handling large-scale natural disasters, including emergency response, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts.
Highlighting the shared vulnerability of both countries to climate-induced calamities, the premier underscored the need for stronger bilateral cooperation in disaster preparedness, crisis management and climate resilience.
President Prabowo expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s message of solidarity and informed PM Shehbaz that Indonesian authorities had acted swiftly and effectively to manage the unfolding crisis.







The premier said he looked forward to welcoming President Prabowo to Pakistan during his scheduled official visit next week.
He noted that the visit would provide an important opportunity for both leaders to strengthen diplomatic ties and expand cooperation across all areas of mutual interest.</p><small>2025-12-03 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637251-centre-seeks-control-over-education-population-welfare-rights-of-provinces-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Centre 'seeks control' over education, population welfare rights of provinces: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

Muttaqi’s comments are the first on the incident by the Afghan Taliban government, and come a week after events in Washington when suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal is accused of opening fire on guard members, killing one and critically wounding another.
On Tuesday, Lakanwal was charged with murder and other offences as he made his first court appearance, appearing remotely from a hospital bed.
“This incident has nothing to do with the honourable people of Afghanistan or with the Afghan government,” Muttaqi said.
“This is an individual criminal act, and the person who committed it was trained by the Americans themselves.”
US officials have said Lakanwal was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan. He entered the US in 2021 through then-president Joe Biden’s Operation Allies Welcome scheme for those fearing reprisal by the Taliban forces, who seized control of Afghanistan after the US military’s withdrawal.
“They (the Americans) trained him, they assigned him, and through an illegal process, contrary to any international standard, they brought him from Afghanistan to the United States,” Muttaqi said.

The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
A statement posted on X by state broadcaster PTV News said COAS Munir met Royal Saudi Land Forces (RSLF) Commander Lieutenant General Fahad Bin Saud Al-Johani at the General Headquarters.
“COAS expressed satisfaction on robust defence collaboration between the two countries and emphasised upon the need for continued cooperation in training, capacity building, and intelligence sharing. Commander RSLF acknowledged the professionalism of Pakistan Army and appreciated the positive role played by Pakistan in regional peace and stability,” the press release said.
It added that matters of mutual interest, regional security and avenues for enhanced bilateral defence cooperation were also discussed with both sides reiterating their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations.







The army chief also separately met Bahrain National Guard Commander General Shaikh Mohammad Bin Isa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, with both sides reaffirming their resolve to enhance existing military-to-military ties.
They also discussed matters of mutual interest, regional security, and bilateral defence cooperation.
“The visiting dignitary appreciated the professionalism of Pakistan Army and acknowledged its role in regional peace and stability. COAS highlighted long-standing brotherly relations between the two nations and expressed Pakistan’s continued support for Bahrain in all domains.”

The government has been seeking to sell a 51-100 per cent stake in the struggling national airline to raise funds and reform cash-draining, state-owned enterprises as envisaged under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
It would be the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades. Four bidders have been pre-qualified for the sale: Lucky Cement Consortium, Arif Habib Corporation Consortium, Fauji Fertiliser Company Limited and Air Blue Limited.
A press release posted on X by state broadcaster PTV News said that the prime minister held a meeting with all corporate entities and company representatives participating in the privatisation process of the national airline.
“PIA’s bidding will take place on December 23, 2025, which will be broadcast live on all media,” the statement quoted the prime minister as saying.
He said the process was proceeding smoothly to restore the national carrier’s “lost prestige” and align it with modern requirements.
“Soon, PIA will once again live up to its tradition of ‘Great People to Fly With’.“We are ensuring transparency and merit in the privatisation process of PIA,” he was quoted as saying.
The prime minister said the restoration of PIA’s flights worldwide would provide convenience to overseas Pakistanis, stressing that aligning it with modern requirements was “extremely essential” for the tourism sector’s development.
“I am hopeful that whoever among you takes on this important responsibility after the bidding will focus all their energies on restoring the prestige of the national airline and its development,” the prime minister said.
The statement added that the participants “commended the professional and transparent approach adopted by the government” during the entire process.







A parliamentary committee was informed in September that Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited was expected to be privatised by November. PM Shehbaz had directed authorities on Nov 20 to expedite and complete all phases of the privatisation with complete transparency.
But the development did not come to pass and last week, the National Asse­mbly Standing Committee on Privatis­ation sought a clear timeline to complete the ongoing bidding process and directed that the process be accelerated.
Once a leading global airline, PIA resumed European flights in January after a four-year EU ban linked to safety concerns.
A previous attempt to sell the airline failed as a $36 million bid from real estate firm Blue World City fell short of the $305 million floor price, with concerns over debt, staffing and limited control.</p><small>2025-12-03 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637221-cleric-engineer-muhammad-ali-mirza-gets-bail-in-blasphemy-case' target='_blank'><strong>Cleric Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza gets bail in blasphemy case</strong></a><br><p>
