Shockingly, the official vehicles in the use of top-ranked officers were spotted violating the traffic laws. They included inspector general of police, Lahore Commissioner and DC, DGs of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Pakistan Post, Agriculture, Excise and Taxation, Punjab Food Authority and Health Services, Lesco CEO and additional chief secretaries.
It was revealed in a report formed by the City Traffic Police (CTP) Lahore, carrying the record of total 3,896 official vehicles that were spotted ignoring traffic rules.
As per the report, the Punjab Police was at the top among other federal and provincial departments whose 496 official vehicles committed traffic violations in Lahore, followed by 358 vehicles of the Services & General Administration Dept and 328 of the Lahore Electricity Supply Company (Lesco).

Vehicles of IGP, commissioner, DC, FIA DG, other top officers found committing violations, not paying fines

About the departments, the traffic police said many vehicles belonged to the CM Monitoring Cell, Law, Parliamentary Affairs & Human Rights Department Punjab, the Pakistan Railways, Punjab Revenue Authority, Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd, National Highways Authority, Ministry of Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines, Punjab Home Department, the Environment Protection Department Punjab, the Lahore Development Authority.
A vehicle (LRZ 6076), in the use of an SP, violated the traffic laws 107 times (highest violations) in Lahore and fines imposed on this vehicle, amounting to Rs50,300, were still unpaid. Another vehicle (LZR 9872), which was under the use of the Punjab Agriculture DG, violated the traffic regulations 83 times and its Rs74,000 fine was not paid. An official vehicle (LWQ 1235) belonging to the additional chief secretary (S&GAD) Punjab committed 47 violations and its fine Rs21,300 was still unpaid. Seven other vehicles belonging to the same officer were spotted violating traffic laws 65 times.
The report further revealed that 300 vehicles which violated traffic laws belonged to Wapda, 184 to Livestock & Dairy Department, 181 PTCL, 130 SNGPL, 122 irrigation department, 117 of PFA Punjab, 107 DC office, 102 belonged to the Lahore Cantonment Board, 104 National Highways Authority, 99 of agriculture department, 89 LDA, 76 Pakistan Railways, 69 Punjab Revenue Authority, 68 of Punjab health department, 61 Punjab Horticulture Authority, 42 of Punjab Home Department, 41 of Ring Road Authority, 40 of Punjab Board of Revenue, 37 of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, 31 of FIA etc.
An official said the statistics came to the limelight when the Punjab Safe City cameras spotted the vehicles and issued them e-challan tickets. The city traffic police conducted detailed investigations and found out that these vehicles belonged to 73 departments.
Another irritating part of the development is that all officials in charge of these vehicles never bothered to pay fines, prompting the traffic police high-ups to write them letters to ‘identify the violators and pay fees’ besides initiating action against them.
Lahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Athar Waheed has brought the matter to the notice of Chief Secretary Zahid Akthar Zaman and IGP Dr Usman Anwar. He has requested the both higher officers of the province to intervene to stop violations being committed by those running the province.
On the other hand, the traffic police lodged 4,541 FIRs against the citizens for violating traffic rules in Lahore during the last 10 days. Many of them were arrested on the spot, the official said.

The India-Pakistan one from earlier this month was no different.
Its aftermath leaves behind a combination of heightened security for some, and heightened insecurity for many others. Incumbents in power in both countries benefited from the strengthening of their domestic positions. When the adrenaline of nationalism runs high, difficult questions about security lapses, geographic vulnerabilities, and long-term policies are set aside. The mood becomes celebratory, lauding, feting, and consecrating those in the driving seat.
Laudatory outcomes in Pakistan include a fresh promotion for the army chief, another extension for the air chief, a significant bump in public approval for the military as per at least one survey, and unquestioning acceptance of the need for greater defence spending to stave off the Indian threat in the future.
 
 

Civilian partners in the incumbent regime also gained an advantage. They can take some comfort in the renewed vigour and tenure security of their ‘same-page’ arrangement. The PML-N might actually be able to see off an entire five-year term without changing their prime minister. And the prospects of a deal between the establishment and the PTI, one that would be beneficial for the latter and harmful for the incumbent party, appears to be off the table for now.
Mirroring the same in India, the BJP-led coalition government appears to have staved off some growing public apathy and incumbent fatigue. It has won space for its security agenda (as demonstrated in the recent anti-Naxal operations), and set itself up well for the upcoming state elections in Bihar. Under the ambit of a national threat, it has also managed to sideline a few irritants in the domestic media space, and shut off indirect people-to-people cultural contact through YouTube and music-streaming platforms.
Going forward, the Indian population’s view of their neighbours will filter through whatever the state deems acceptable. The task of ‘otherising’ the enemy and creating cultural gulfs amidst shared heritage — a long-term agenda of right-wingers in both countries — will be considerably easier.

The bonanza of security for some, opens up a world of insecurity for most others.

This bonanza of security for some, opens up a world of insecurity for most others. One obvious consequence is the vulnerability felt by common citizens in different parts of the region. People living in Pakistani Punjab’s big cities will now go about their daily lives knowing that they remain fair game for missiles and drones launched from India; knowledge made worse by the fact that the trigger for such an attack may be something relatively miniscule and unrelated to their actions. The same is true for those residing in parts of India along its western borders.
 
 

For those already existing under insecurity, such as the people of Kashmir, the skirmish intensifies distress and caution. Pakistan and India may be bitter rivals, but they appear to have forged an implicit agreement around the cheapened worth of Kashmiri lives. These lives in and around the LoC are deemed to be the most dispensable under the ambit of artillery fire. Their level of dispensability is now up by several notches.
Upon its conclusion, open warfare is also leaving behind ‘sub-conventional warfare’ as a strategy for both states. Civilian populations are fair game. Terrorism will continue to rear its ugly head. No one will be spared, not even — as we’ve recently learnt — children on their way to school.
Vectors of heightened insecurity don’t just operate across national borders, they run through internal fault lines as well. States under siege turn their attention to ‘local collaborators’ and domestic nuisances. For Muslims of India-held Kashmir, the terrorist attack and its subsequent aftermath makes a bad situation even worse. The region is already one of the most militarised in the world. Security force deployment is likely to go up further. The practice of regulating movement and communication will become more common. A state of exception, where fundamental rights and civil liberties are distant concepts, will remain the norm.
In Pakistan, all manner of opposition will experience new forms of insecurity. Freshly legitimised, recently rewarded, and thriving in the afterglow of a successful military response to Indian aggression, the establishment is far better placed to move forward with its domestic agenda. Opposition parties, mainly the PTI, find the already small space available to them shrinking even further.
Other initiatives being pushed by the centre, such as the ones related to land allocation and control in Gilgit-Baltistan, have been quickly approved by the local assembly; opposition to the Land Reform Act was summarily dismissed. Several activists were rounded up and incarcerated.
 
 

In the context of such swift domestic action, it might be unsurprising if the contentious issue of canal irrigation in Cholistan rears its head once again. Will opposition be as vigorous this time around, especially considering how the domestic political situation has changed?
No one asked for war, least of all the average Pakistani. The state responded justifiably well to a blatant act of aggression from across the border. In doing so, it carried out an essential task that defines the modern state — securing territorial integrity through the use of violence.
But that is not the only task of the state. Making citizens feel secure and drawing legitimacy from their security and prosperity are also essential. While one particular form of insecurity — the one posed by a belligerent neighbour — has been addressed, other forms have deepened, either inadvertently or on purpose. Perhaps it makes sense to turn some of our attention to these other forms as well.

The latest victim, Sheema Ibrahim, was undergoing treatment at Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta, where she died of her injuries. She was the daughter of a Levies official and had been in critical condition since the explosion.
 
 

The fatalities now include eight APS students, seven girls and one boy, along with two adults. On the day of the attack, three students — Saniya Soomro (Grade 6), Hafza Kausar (Grade 7) and Ayesha Saleem (Grade 10) — died on the spot. In the days that followed, Haider, Mala­ika and Sehr Saleem succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment. The identity of one more student could not be ascertained.
Security officials have condemned the assault, alleging foreign involvement in the targeted attack on schoolchildren. “Eight innocent lives have fallen victim to India’s campaign of terrorism within Pakistan,” a senior security official said.

With feel-like temperature soaring past 40°C and humidity adding to the misery, frustration among the public reached boiling point.
The Sakhi Hassan hydrant is the only operational hydrant supplying water to the densely populated Central district.
The protesters, including women and children, blocked both sides of the road outside the hydrant, disrupting traffic for hours.
Many carried empty water containers, which is a symbol of the growing desperation in the city, already reeling under infrastructural challenges.

Many areas continue to face severe shortage

For over a month, large parts of Karachi, particularly in the Central district, have been experiencing a severe water shortage.
Areas like Buffer Zone, North Karachi, North Nazimabad, Federal B Area and Shadman Town have reported little to no water supply for weeks, forcing residents to rely on expensive private water tankers or travel long distances to fetch water.
“This is not the first protest,” said Shahid Ali, a resident of Shadman Town. “We protested here two weeks ago. The authorities made promises, but nothing changed. We’re still without water. How long can people survive like this?”
The city’s total daily water demand is estimated at over 1,200 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the supply falls drastically short, hovering around 550 to 600 MGD even under optimal conditions.
Both experts and officials agree that chronic infrastructure issues, rampant water theft, deep-rooted corruption within Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation and poor governance have further exacerbated the situation.
Electricity outage at Gharo pump
The fresh crisis got further deeper when the KWSC issued a statement attributing the latest disruption to a technical fault caused by a power outage at the Gharo Pumping Station — a critical component of the city’s water supply network.
According to the KWSC spokesman, a cable fault at 10:35am led to a complete shutdown of the pumping station.
“Due to a cable fault on KE’s network, the Gharo Pumping Station is non-operational at the moment,” the statement read. “We are in continuous coordination with KE to restore operations. However, the fault has not yet been resolved.”
The Gharo Pumping Station is responsible for supplying nearly 30 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to key areas of Karachi, including Port Qasim, Bin Qasim Town, Shah Faisal Town, PNS Mehran, PAF Base Faisal, and Karsaz. With its operations stalled, several districts face further strain on already stretched water resources.

For good reason.
The slew of actions he took would certainly have troubled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Washington lifted sanctions on Syria and Trump met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa in Riyadh, praising a man who previously had a US bounty on his head. Trump also praised Turkiye’s President Tayyip Erdogan, another of Israel’s adversaries, whose advice to lift sanctions he said he listened to. Netanyahu had urged Trump not to end sanctions.
Trump also forged a truce with the Houthis in Yemen with both sides agreeing to halt military strikes against each other. This too bypassed Israel. Trump secured the release of the last remaining American hostage in Gaza after direct talks between the US and Hamas. But what would have worried Tel Aviv the most was Trump pursuing direct nuclear negotiations with Iran, which Israel vehemently opposes.
There are reports now of US receiving ‘new’ intelligence about Israel making preparations for a military strike on Iranian nuclear installations. If Israel takes this reckless course, it would sabotage Trump’s diplomatic efforts and damage Netanyahu’s relations with Washington, especially as Trump recently told Netanyahu in a phone conversation that talks were moving in the right direction.
Writing in the Financial Times Kim Ghattas saw Trump’s Middle East moves “springing surprises on Netanyahu [and] cutting Israel out of the deals it is making”. She pointed out that Trump’s patience with Netanyahu was running out even though the “decades-long alliance between Israel and the US will endure”. Other commentators referred to the Israeli prime minister being downgraded to a “spectator” during his visit as Trump moved closer to Israel’s enemies.
Despite all this Trump has been unable or unwilling to get Israel to halt its genocidal war on Gaza even though he has long wanted a quick end to the conflict. Although the White House has warned Netanyahu he would be on his own if he continued the war, Israel has expanded its military offensive in Gaza and continued to block humanitarian aid.
With Palestinians being killed every day by air strikes, Netanyahu has threatened to take over all of Gaza ostensibly to “destroy Hamas once and for all”. Additional military forces have been deployed to carry out Israel’s Gideon’s Chariots offensive targeting both southern and northern Gaza, whose aim is to push Palestinians out of the strip. Hundreds of thousands are again being forced from their homes. Forcible displacement of people outside Gaza has long been Netanyahu’s aim.
This has created a catastrophic situation and worsened the humanitarian crisis, forcing millions of Gazans into starvation. The Israeli offensive and blockade of humanitarian aid has provoked an international outcry. UN Secretary General António Guterres called this dire situation “beyond description, beyond atrocious and beyond inhumane”. Demanding an end to the blockade he said, “The entire population is facing the risk of famine.”
 
 

Even Israel’s closest Western allies lashed out against Tel Aviv. In a joint statement, France, the UK and Canada condemned Israel’s military escalation in Gaza and the West Bank, and threatened “concrete actions” including targeted sanctions, if Israel did not end its offensive and lift aid restrictions. The EU announced it would review its trade relations with Israel while countries such as Spain called for tougher action including sanctions.
Twenty-three countries issued a joint statement calling on Israel to allow aid into Gaza and warning that people faced “starvation”. Under mounting pressure, Israel permitted some aid into Gaza but this was slammed as wholly inadequate by the international community.
The response from Amnesty International was telling: “It is outrageous and morally reprehensible that it took the world nearly 80 days of broadcast starvation and cruelty amidst genocide to exert enough pressure on Israel to even slightly ease its total siege that has blocked the entry of all food, medicine, fuel and other vital goods.”
Meanwhile, efforts to renew the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel are going nowhere at Doha. Despite the Trump administration’s unease with the lack of progress in the talks it has been unable to goad the Israelis in that direction. This seemed a factor behind US Vice President J.D. Vance’s recent decision not to visit Israel this month. Although talks have continued after Israel launched its offensive, Netanyahu has little interest in a truce. He unilaterally broke the ceasefire in March and has repeatedly declared he will not end the war until “total victory” is achieved over Hamas.
 
 

This leaves Gaza facing more bloodshed, displacement and devastation. The US-backed Israeli plan to manage and deliver aid to Gaza is hugely controversial and entails establishing a few central distribution sites where people will have to travel from long distances. These hubs will be secured by the military and private armed contractors.
A Swiss-incorporated company, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, will manage the centres. The UN has denounced the plan as a tool for more displacement, which is a war crime. The UN aid chief also said this makes “starvation a bargaining chip”. UN agencies have refused to be part of this arrangement. Humanitarian organisations have condemned the ‘militarisation of aid’.
With Israel embarked on a relentless military campaign to seize and permanently occupy all of Gaza, its far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich told a news conference the goal is to “destroy everything that’s left of the Gaza Strip” and force the population out of ‘combat zones’. From there, he said, “the population will reach the south of the Strip, and [then] move to third countries under President Trump’s plan”. Meanwhile, Netanyahu has said he will end the war only if Hamas releases all hostages and Trump’s plan to relocate the population outside Gaza is implemented.
It is now incumbent on Washington to clarify if Israel is really carrying out Trump’s plan. This is necessary because if untrue it would put pressure on Israel to stop the offensive. If true, it would make a mockery of the image Trump is seeking to cultivate as a man of peace.

Countries Israel had long counted on as allies have been adding their voices to growing international pressure after it expanded its operations against Hamas.
Madrid is hosting 20 cou­ntries as well as international organisations with the aim of “stopping this war, which no longer has any goal”, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Alb­a­res told France Info radio.
Humanitarian aid must enter Gaza “massively, unimpeded, neutrally, so that it is not Israel who decides who can eat and who cannot”, he said.
The meeting, which also includes representatives from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, will promote a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
A previous such gathering in Madrid last year brought together countries  including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye as well as Euro­pean nations such as Ireland and Norway that have recognised a Palestinian state.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast that the city will continue to face hot and humid weather throughout the coming week, with conditions expected to worsen toward the end of the week.
According to a Met department official, the coming Thursday and Friday could be particularly intense, with daytime temperatures potentially exceeding 40 degrees Celsius.
The rising humidity levels, he said, are also expected to persist, which could result in higher “feels-like” temperatures, raising concerns for heat-related health risks.
“The weather pattern indicates a significant rise in temperatures, especially during the latter half of the week,” said the PMD official. “Karachiites should prepare themselves for extremely hot days and avoid unnecessary outdoor activities during peak hours.”

The mushroom growth of illegal cattle markets in densely populated localities of the city have also posed risks to safety for pedestrians and residents.
Several illegal cattle markets were found established in an organised manner by mounting large tents, provision of electricity, security guards and entry points in different parts of the city.
Illegal cattle markets were established underneath the Gizri flyover, at the backside of Dubai Palace in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Plot 39 and adjacent ground near Mosimiat in Block-6, in Scheme 33, Yousuf Goth and near Rais Goth at Hub River Road in district Keamari and near Kala Pul in district South.
Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, who had recently through a notification imposed a ban on illegal cattle markets and roadside sale of livestock, said that the city’s administration was taking strict measures to regulate market activities and ensure compliance with municipal regulations.

Commissioner has allowed markets for sacrificial animals only at 14 spots in seven districts

He said that any market operating without permission from the city administration was considered illegal and would face action.
The illegal cattle markets, which emerged mainly on roadsides and open spaces along the streets, not only cause traffic disruption in different localities, but also create sanitation issues.
Hundreds of thousands of sacrificial animals from various parts of the country are brought for sale in the city on the occasion of the religious festival and many small traders move the livestock to different areas and set up illegal cattle markets.
In many areas across the city, seasonal traders occupy open spaces along the streets and roads, establishing their trading hubs with a dozen or so animals.
Residents of several localities said that the traders brought their animals on the streets a little after dusk and continue their business late in the night, disrupting both vehicular and pedestrian flow.
A resident of Burns Road, Muhammad Shahid, said that the entire vicinity was stinking with the animal waste as several lanes had become trading hub of the sacrificial animals.
The city administration had imposed Section 144 of the criminal procedure code in the city for one month to ensure orderly arrangements for cattle markets.
As per the commissioner’s order, the sale of animals will be banned at the places, other than the permitted cattle markets.
Karachi’s seven district administrations have allowed animal markets at 14 spots in the city.
Officials said that the strict orders had been issued to the authorised market organisers regarding cleanliness, security, and noise prevention.
They said that an effective system for disposing of animal remains and waste had also been imposed in all markets and action would be taken against violators under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The officials said that the crackdown on illegal cattle market was in full swing and the action against illegal trading hubs was being taken on day to day basis.
They said that over 40 unauthorised cattle markets had so far been removed in different parts of the city.
They officials said that the 18 unauthorized markets were removed in district Malir, three in Korangi, four in Central, 12 in East, three in Keamari and two in South.
The illegal trading hubs have even emerged along with the major arteries of the city, including M.A Jinnah Road.

Lahore Qalandars were Pakistan Super League champions again, sealing their third title in four seasons after pulling off a remarkable chase.
Quetta Gladiators had been in the ascendancy in Sunday’s final, headed towards what they believed was their destiny — a second PSL crown — having clinched their first six long years ago. They had tightened the noose around the Qalandars, who, in their chase of 202, needed 57 runs to win off the last 20 deliveries when Raza joined Perera at the crease.
But the Qalandars found inspiration, as Gladiators lost theirs; Perera played a masterful knock of an unbeaten 31-ball 62 featuring four sixes and five fours, with Raza providing the ideal foil with 22 off seven balls to take their side home with a ball to spare. As their teammates ran onto the pitch in jubilation, the Gladiators sank to the ground, left wondering what could have been.
 


Raza, who had flown in from England after featuring for Zimbabwe in a four-day Test that only ended on Saturday and only arrived 10 minutes before the toss for the final, began the recovery when he deposited the first two balls he faced for a four and a six. The hits, both in the mid-wicket region, came immediately after Mohammad Amir had dismissed Bhanuka Rajapaksa to put the Gladiators on top.

Perera, Raza star in nerve-jangling last-over victory against Quetta Gladiators to seal third title in four seasons

Perera launched the offensive from the other end; the left-hander — who only came into the Qalandars’ side after the PSL was halted with eight games to go due to Pakistan-India skirmishes — hit Khurram Shahzad for two sixes and then punished Amir in the penultimate over for two fours and a slog-sweep for six.
That left Qalandars needing 13 off the final over and Raza came to the fore after Hasan Nawaz, who had earlier scored 76 for Gladiators, acrobatically saved a boundary. The Zimbabwean slashed an audacious six over point and then used his wrists to spark Qalandars’ celebrations in front of a partisan home crowd.
Qalandars skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi ran to lift Raza on his shoulders. The pacer — who was the pick of Lahore’s bowlers with 3-24 — had given his side the ideal start in the final when he dismissed his Gladiators counterpart Saud Shakeel early on. Saud’s opening partner Finn Allen departed in the third over, but Hasan checked Qalandar’s building momentum.
 
 

On the first six balls he faced, Hasan got two fours and a massive six over long-on. Rilee Roussow, at the other end, was also dealing in boundaries; his first three scoring shots being two fours and a pull off Haris Rauf for six. The left-hander then found joy on the off side, getting two fours in the sixth over by Salman, and the Gladiators ending the powerplay at 57-2. Rossouw, however, fell soon after, with Raza striking as the South African found Shaheen at short cover.
Losing his partner didn’t stop Hasan, though. Rishad Hossain was belted for two fours off the first three balls of the eighth over. Raza was then deposited for six in the next over before Hasan took Rishad to the cleaners in the 10th with 6, 4, 4 off the first three balls to raise his 50 off just 21 balls as Gladiators got to 100-3 at the midway point of their innings.
Avishka Fernando (29) hit five fours before becoming Rishad’s first victim, but Hasan — seemingly struggling with an injury — kept going on, using brute force to dispatch Raza over his head for six more and he got lucky when he was spilled by Fakhar Zaman two overs later.
Dinesh Chandimal chipped in with 22, hitting two sixes, before holing Shaheen to substitute Mohammad Azab on the second ball of the 18th over with Hasan’s 43-ball knock ending four deliveries later when he found Raza at wide long-on.
Haris returned to dismiss Amir and Abrar Ahmed as Gladiators seemed to crumble late on, but Faheem Ashraf (28 not out) pulled and flicked Salman for three sixes in the final over to take his side to 201-9.
 
 

Mohammad Naeem (46) got Qalandars off to a flier in their chase, bludgeoning Faheem for two sixes, but just when he was threatening to take it away from the Gladiators single-handedly, he saw his partner Fakhar trapped lbw by Abrar.
Naeem survived after Usman Tariq dropped a sitter and with Abdullah Shafique crunching a glorious late cut for four off Abrar, Qalandars reached 56-1 by the end of the powerplay. Naeem hit six sixes in his 27-ball innings, which ended when Faheem had him caught at deep square, bringing Perera to the crease.
Abdullah made 41 off 28 with four fours and a six, but after he top-edged Usman to be caught in the 13th over, the Gladiators seemed to have reined in the Qalandars, who needed 71 off the last five overs. Rajapaksa never got going, but his dismissal only paved the way for Qalandars’ stunning late charge.

For its part, the government considers the contested expenditures critical to providing relief to the middle class, which is burdened with heavy taxes and elevated cost of living, as well as to strengthening Pakistan’s military defences against India. After multiple inconclusive rounds of discussions on the budget proposals for the coming year, the IMF mission left the country, agreeing to continue talks on tax measures and expenditures virtually over the next week.
 
 

Following its visit, the lender issued a statement calling the discussions with Pakistani authorities on the “budget proposals and broader economic policy, and reform agenda supported by the 2024 Extended Fund Facility and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility” constructive. It said that the authorities had “reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6pc of GDP” during the next fiscal year. It said that the “discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including by bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and prioritise expenditure”.
The difference of opinion on higher allocations for defence following India’s unprovoked aggression and on certain tax relief measures for the salaried class is not something to fret over. Previously too, we have seen both sides disagreeing on fiscal measures before finding middle ground. The IMF mission head’s statement also does not indicate any major gap between the two sides on the budget proposals.
The Fund probably wants the government to cover all the bases through additional revenue measures to absorb the impact on its budget left by any tax relief and increase in defence spending. The government must continue on the path of sound macroeconomic policy and fiscal consolidation to protect its fragile recovery that remains vulnerable to potential slippages on account of, for instance, pressure from the real estate lobby for tax breaks and exogenous shocks.
 
 

Indeed, the government is under a lot of political stress from various segments of the population and industry to provide some kind of relief and push growth. Going forward, the pressure will increase and the political leadership may find it difficult to resist the temptation of creating a feel-good atmosphere in the country.
The question is: is it in a position to break free from the IMF’s conditions? It can hardly afford this. Living off multilateral funds and loan rollovers by friendly countries as it is doing at the moment, Pakistan is at a critical juncture and must carefully weigh every step it takes.

• Both sides reaffirm principled support for ‘core concerns’, including Kashmir dispute; call for Gaza ceasefire
• Premier advocates investments in renewable energy, IT, defence production, agriculture
ISLAMABAD: In the first leg of his four-country tour, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday arrived in Turkiye, where he met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to not only thank Ankara for its support during recent tensions with India but also cement bilateral economic cooperation.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” said an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Sunday.
In his meeting with President Erdogan, the PM advocated joint ventures and enhanced bilateral investment, highlighting key sectors, including renewable energy, information technology, defence production, infrastructure development, and agriculture as potential areas of mutual interest.
The two leaders also conducted a comprehensive review of the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reiterated their resolve to elevate the strategic partnership. They also followed up on the implementation of key decisions taken during the 7th session of the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC), held in Islamabad on Feb 13 this year. Both sides agreed to take steps to achieve the $5 billion annual bilateral trade target agreed earlier by the two leaders.
 
 

In addition to bilateral issues, Prime Minister Shehbaz and President Erdogan discussed pressing regional and international developments. They also expressed concern over the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, urgently calling for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to the affected Palestinian population.
PM Shehbaz, who was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of Turkiye for their unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent developments in South Asia. He lauded Turkiye’s principled stance and the outpouring support of goodwill of the Turkish people for Pakistan and termed it as a source of great comfort and strength for Pakistan.
 






The premier highlighted the commitment, courage and the spirit of sacrifice of the armed forces of Pakistan and the resolute patriotism that was demonstrated in an unprecedented manner, which contributed to Pakistan’s victory in Marak-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.
According to state-run PTV News, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minis­ter Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also participated in the meeting.
Moreover, both leaders also presided over a delegation-level meeting between the two sides.
Earlier, on his arrival at the airport, the PM was received by Defence Minister Yashar Guler, Istanbul Deputy Governor Erdogan Turan Ermis, Pakistan’s ambassador in Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, and other diplomats.
After the two-day Turkiye visit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan during this week.
During the visits, he is expected to hold “wide-ranging discussions” with the nations while acknowledging their support during Pakistan’s recent escalation with India.
According to Dawn.com, in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Confe­rence on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dus­hanbe, on May 29 and 30.
 
 

The visit comes a fortnight after Pakistan and India reached a US-brokered ceasefire following a brief military confrontation. During the conflict, the Iranian foreign minister visited both nations to act as a mediator. According to the FO’s statement, the PM will have “wide-ranging discussions” with the leaders of the four countries on issues including bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance.
Pakistan, Uzbekistan ties
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Mini­ster Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich discussed bilateral relations and the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project in a phone call on Sunday, the Foreign Office said in a press release.
During the conversation, the two leaders expressed optimism about the early finalisation of the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project.
The ministers also exchanged views on the regional situation, according to the statement.

Ukraine’s emergency services described a night of  “terror” as Russia launched a second straight night of massive air strikes, including on the capital Kyiv.
The renewed strikes came after Russia launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 drones overnight Friday to Saturday, which wounded 15.

Kyiv seeks more global pressure on Moscow

Ukraine’s military said on Sunday it had shot down a total of 45 Russian missiles and 266 attack drones overnight. Air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said a total of 298 drones were launched, adding that this was “the highest number ever”.
 
 

Four people were reported dead in Ukraine’s western Khmelnytskyi region, four in the Kyiv region, and one in Mykolaiv in the south. Emer­gency services said 16 people were also injured in the Kyiv region, including three children.
“Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said. “The silence of America, the silence of others around the world only encourages Putin,” he said, adding:  “Sanctions will certainly help.”
EU’s diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called for  “the strongest internatio­nal pre­ssure on Russia to stop this war.”
Russia, meanwhile, said its strikes were aimed at Ukraine’s  “military-industrial complex” and said it had brought down 110 Ukrainian drones.

• Man whose nine children killed battling for life in ICU
CAIRO: Israeli military strikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, including a journalist and a rescue service official, health authorities said.
The latest deaths resulted from Israeli strikes in Khan Yunis, Jabalia and Nuseirat areas, medics said.
In Jabalia, local journalist Hassan Majdi Abu Warda and several family members died when an air strike hit his house.
The air strike in Nuseirat killed Ashraf Abu Nar, a senior official in the territory’s civil emergency service, and his wife in their house, medics added.
There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military.
The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said Abu Warda’s death raised the number of Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza since October 7, 2023, to 220.
 


In a separate statement, the media office said Israeli forces were in control of 77 per cent of the Gaza Strip, either through ground forces or evacuation orders and bombardment that keeps residents away from their homes.
Islamic Jihad, a wing of Hamas, said that fighters had carried out ambushes and attacks using bombs and anti-tank rockets against Israeli forces in several areas across Gaza.
Meanwhile, the father of nine children killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza over the weekend remains in intensive care, said a doctor at the hospital treating him.
Hamdi Al-Najjar, himself a doctor, was at home in Khan Yunis with his 10 children when an Israeli air strike occurred, killing all but one of them. He was rushed to the nearby Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza where he is being treated for his injuries.
Abdul Aziz Al-Farra, a thoracic surgeon, said Najjar had undergone two operations to stop bleeding in his abdomen and chest and that he sustained other wounds including to his head.
“May God heal him and help him,” Farra said, speaking by the bedside of an intubated and heavily bandaged Najjar.

The Israeli military confirmed it conducted an air strike on Khan Yunis on Friday. The military is looking into claims that “uninvolved civilians” were killed, it said, adding that the forces had evacuated civilians from the area before the strike began.
According to medical officials in Gaza, the nine children were aged between one and 12 years. The child that survived, a boy, is in a serious but stable condition, the hospital said.
Najjar’s wife, Alaa, also a doctor, was not at home at the time of the strike. She was treating Palestinians injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza in the same hospital where her husband and son are receiving care.
“She went to her house and saw her children burned, may God help her,” said Tahani Yahya Al-Najjar of her sister-in-law.
“With everything we are going through only God gives us strength.”
Tahani visited her brother in hospital on Sunday, whispering to him that she was there: “You are okay, this will pass.”

The Resettlement Programme in Pakistan has been active since the 1980s and more than 20,000 vulnerable refugees have now departed for resettlement to third countries to find safety and rebuild their lives, UNHCR says in its latest resettlement factsheet on Pakistan Operation.
In 2021, following the changed situation in Afghanistan, there was a renewed interest by the international community in the resettlement of Afghan refugees, leading to an increase in resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
 
 

The US topped the list of nine countries that accepted Afghan refugees for resettlement. The US accepted 10,823 Afghan refugees, followed by Australia (4,362), Canada (2,253), the United Kingdom (954), New Zealand (817), Norway (248), Sweden (182), Finland (116), and Italy (72).

Over 300,000 Afghans returned, deported by Pakistan, Iran in a month, says IFRC

Since 2021, several diplomatic missions in Pakistan established their own “Safe Passage” programmes to facilitate the evacuation and relocation of Afghan nationals affiliated with their foreign missions in Afgha­nistan, they are outside the framework of UNHCR’s Resettle­ment Programme, the agency clarified.
“Resettlement is unique in that it is the only durable solution that involves the relocation of refugees from an asylum country to a third country,” the UNHCR said. Those prioritised include survivors of violence, vulnerable women and girls, at-risk children, and individuals with serious medical conditions.
Worsening crisis
Meanwhile, the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) warned that Afghanistan’s humanitarian crisis — marked by extreme poverty, food insecurity, and a strained health system — is worsening due to a mass influx of returnees, largely triggered by Pakistan’s Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“This influx of Afghan nationals has put further strain on an already fragile infrastructure, complicating efforts to provide essential services to those in need,” the IFRC said.
 
 

Last month, the IFRC launched a Federation-wide Emergency Appeal in response to escalating humanitarian needs, seeking 25 million Swiss francs to scale up multi-sectoral immediate and longer-term assistance.
In April, over 144,500 people returned from Pakistan, with more than 29,900 deported. “During the month of April, between 4,000 and 6,000 people were arriving in Afgha­nistan each day,” the IFRC reported.
The influx of returnees, amidst persistent drought, pre-existing internal displacements, and deteriorating economic conditions, is placing immense pressure on already overstretched services.
Adding to the pressure, returns from Iran are also increasing due to policy shifts hindering access to legal protection. Between March 20 and April 30, 170,200 Afghans arrived from Iran. The combined returns from Pakistan and Iran, exceeding 300,000 in April alone, are placing “extreme pressure” on Afghanistan’s border regions and urban areas ill-equipped for such large movements, the IFRC concluded.

Arne Slot’s side wrapped up their record-equalling 20th English crown with a demolition of Tottenham in April, but the long-awaited trophy presentation was saved for the final game of the season.
Liverpool’s last title in 2020 was won during the Covid-19 lockdown, meaning the trophy was held aloft by then-captain Jordan Henderson in front of an empty stadium.
The Reds made the most of their first title celebration in a packed Anfield since 1990 as the 61,000-capacity crowd partied along with the great and good of Liverpool’s illustrious past.
“It’s always special to win something, but at certain clubs maybe a little bit more,” Slot said. “I don’t think you expect anything like this. If you look at the Premier League in the last few seasons, it was always a race to the end.
“To be part of it was already nice, let alone to win it.”
Alan Hansen, who captained Liverpool in their last trophy lift at a full Anfield in 1990, presented the silverware to current Reds skipper Van Dijk.
Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool’s manager 35 years ago, was watching from the stands, as was Jurgen Klopp, who masterminded the Reds’ Premier League triumph in 2020 before leaving last year.
Fireworks, smoke and red ticker tape filled the air as the trophy was paraded around Anfield, with the famous Kop stand adorned with banners and flags emblazoned with slogans hailing their heroes.
Even Trent Alexander-Arnold — the Liverpool right-back controversially set to leave in a widely-expected move to Real Madrid — was embraced by fans on his final appearance for his boyhood club.
Alexander-Arnold had been booed after coming on as a substitute for the recent draw with Arsenal in the first game following his announcement that he will depart when his contract expires in June.
Rousing scene
With Anfield in party mood, tearful Alexander-Arnold was granted a fond farewell as he was cheered when he came off the bench in the second half, the Liverpool-born defender responding by kissing his badge.
Liverpool failed to win any of their four games after sealing the title.
But that couldn’t detract from the festive atmosphere, which was in full swing before the game even kicked off as Slot’s team were given a guard of honour onto the pitch by Palace’s players, before the Reds returned the favour to salute the FA Cup winners.
Ismaila Sarr’s ninth-minute goal for Palace couldn’t spoil the occasion either.
Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who had been booked for diving, was shown a straight red card after his foul on Daichi Kamada in the 68th minute.
But Mohamed Salah ensured Liverpool avoided defeat in their finale when he bundled home in the 84th minute.
Salah’s 29th goal this season equalled the Premier League record of most goal involvements in a season, previously held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer, who both achieved 47 in a 42-game season.
The Egypt forward finished as the Premier League’s golden boot winner for a record-equalling fourth time.
Liverpool’s players gathered in one long line to sing the club anthem ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ in a rousing scene after the trophy presentation.
The party is set to continue on Monday when Liverpool will parade the trophy through the city on an open-top bus.</p><small>2025-05-25 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25225916205ac6b.jpg?r=230005' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913237/pm-shehbaz-thanks-turkish-president-erdogan-for-supporting-pakistan-during-escalation-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz thanks Turkish President Erdogan for supporting Pakistan during escalation with India</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday expressed gratitude to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for his nation’s support during a brief military confrontation with India.
The PM is visiting Turkiye for two days as part of his four-nation tour to friendly countries, where he will express his gratitude for supporting Pakistan during the recent conflict.
Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported that the PM and Erdogan had a delegation-level meeting in which Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar took part.
According to PTV News, the meeting was “warm and most cordial” and both nations “reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Türkiye, anchored in shared values, mutual respect, and a common vision for progress and prosperity”.
A video posted by the broadcaster showed PM Shehbaz embracing President Erdogan before boarding a car and leaving Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul.
 






Taking to X, the PM wrote that he expressed gratitude to Erdogan for Turkiye’s support during the brief conflict with India earlier this month.
“[I] conveyed the sentiments of gratitude from the people of Pakistan to their Turkish brothers and sisters,” the prime minister wrote.
“We also reviewed the ongoing progress of our multifaceted bilateral engagements particularly in trade and investment and reaffirmed our resolve to reaffirmed our resolve to continue working closely to further strengthen these unshakable bonds of brotherhood and cooperation,” he added.
 






Earlier, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office said that upon his arrival at the Istanbul Airport, the prime minister was received by Turkish Minister for National Defence Yasar Guler, Governor Istanbul Davut Gul, President of Pakistan-Turkiye Cultural Association Burhan Kayaturk, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, senior officials of the Turkish government and Pakistani diplomats posted in Turkiye.
 






“PM Shehbaz Sharif will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan today,” the statement said. “The two leaders will discuss further expanding cooperation between Turkiye and Pakistan in diverse fields, including defence, economy, tourism and culture.”
The statement added that the purpose of the prime minister’s visit was to “thank the people of Turkiye, particularly President Erdogan, for supporting Pakistan’s principled stand in the recent Pakistan-India tension.”
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi also accompanied the premier.
This is the first leg of the premier’s four-nation visit aimed at strengthening ties with the friendly countries. Apart from Turkiye, he will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan from May 25-30, according to the Foreign Office.
The tour follows diplomatic support voiced by three of these countries for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.
 






During the visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance,” the Foreign Office said.
“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.
Fahrettin Altun, Erdogan’s head of communications said on X said, “During the meeting, bilateral relations, regional and international issues, including the fight against terrorism, will be discussed.”
Altun said “various aspects of bilateral relations between Turkiye and Pakistan will be evaluated”, according to a Google translation of his post.
Joint steps taken within the scope of the Pakistan-Turkiye High Level Strategic Cooperation Council as per the two leaders’ last meeting in February will be reviewed, the Turkish official said.
While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.
As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had conveyed his solidarity to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.
Following the tit-for-tat airbase attacks and a US-brokered ceasefire between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “warmly congratulated PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.
Iran had also offered to mediate during the escalation and paid a visit to both Islamabad and New Delhi in peace efforts, which were appreciated by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.
 
 

The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people cancelled their holidays in popular resorts in the two countries.
The moves intensified as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.
Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a boycott of Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.
PM Shehbaz’s tour adds to Pakistan’s spree of diplomatic engagement amid tensions with New Delhi.
Earlier today, Dar held a telephonic conversation with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, where views were “exchanged on current regional situation”.
The two leaders discussed existing bilateral relations, particularly the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project, the FO said.
They expressed the hope that the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project would be finalised soon.
 






A high-level diplomatic delegation is also set to visit important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” Radio Pakistan had said.</p><small>2025-05-25 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606170-four-nation-tour-pm-shehbaz-president-erdogan-discuss-regional-global-issues' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Turkiye vow to elevate strategic partnership to ‘greater heights'</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), nine “Indian-sponsored khawarij” were killed in three separate engagements.
“An intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in Dera Ismail Khan district, on [the] reported presence of Indian sponsored khwarij,” the military’s media wing said, using the term designating terrorists affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
During the engagement, security forces “effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell”.
According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in Tank District and two more Indian-sponsored khawarij were “sent to hell” by the security forces.
In the third operation in Khyber district’s Bagh area, “own troops successfully neutralised three more Indian-sponsored khawarij”, the ISPR said.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari both expressed appreciation for the security forces following the operations, The Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Due to [the] professional expertise of Pakistan’s armed forces, [the] eradication of terrorists and terrorism was underway at great pace,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
Vowing to foil the designs of terrorists, he said, “Justice will be meted out to the terrorists patronised by India for causing damage to the life and property of the citizens.”
The PM added that the government and security forces were “determined to completely wipe out terrorism from the country”.
Meanwhile, President Zardari praised security forces for killing the nine terrorists and said that operations against will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism.
“The successful operations of the security forces against the Indian-supported terrorists was commendable,” the president was quoted as saying. “Our determination to root out terrorist elements and defend the country is unwavering.”
Last week, 12 terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces while two personnel were martyred in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the ISPR had said on Monday.
It added that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted on Saturday and Sunday against the TTP in KP and the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Front in Balochistan.
An IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat district during which troops engaged the enemy at its location and sent “five Indian sponsored” terrorists to “hell”, it said. In a second IBO in the Bannu district, two “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were “successfully neutralised” by the security forces.
It further said that terrorists ambushed a security forces convoy in another incident in North Waziristan district’s general area of Mir Ali, adding that two “Indian sponsored” terrorists were “sent to hell” after the effective response of troops.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of the soil, Sepoy Farhad Ali Turi (age: 29 years, resident of Kurram district) and Lance Naik Sabir Afridi (age: 32 years, resident of Kohat district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom.”
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitnah-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned TTP.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
A significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-05-25 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25175843b3e71aa.jpg?r=175850' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913259/ex-senator-farhatullah-babar-warns-against-unilaterally-declaring-activists-terrorists' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-senator Farhatullah Babar warns against ‘unilaterally declaring activists terrorists’</strong></a><br><p>Former PPP senator and prominent human rights defender Farhatullah Babar has warned against labelling Baloch Yakjehti Committee Chief Mahrang Baloch, her group, or anyone “a terrorist” without evidence or trial, terming such statements “extremely problematic” that could “backfire”.
Babar, head of the PPP’s Human Rights Committee, said this in response to remarks made by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry earlier this week, who during a press conference vehemently criticised the BYC and Mahrang, saying that the media needed to “unmask” the group and its membership.
He had said that the group spoke about human rights and missing persons, yet when the armed forces eliminate terrorists and conduct DNA identification, “many of them turn out to be the very individuals listed as missing.”
Lt Gen Chaudhry also talked about the Jaffer Express hijacking incident, in which more than 400 people were taken hostage by the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and said: “Innocent people were targeted […] who is she and who are they (BYC) to claim terrorists’ bodies? It is now clear that the BYC is a proxy of terrorism. Terrorists and their proxies have to be dealt with in the way that any nation deals with proxies. There is no doubt; there should be absolute clarity on that.”
 


In a Saturday post on X, Babar wrote that unilaterally declaring the BYC, or any group or individual, was “extremely problematic” and could backfire.
“[It is] unwise and dangerous to mount a high horse without knowing how to dismount,” the former senator wrote. “Curb the impulse to dub rights defenders as terrorists.”
 






While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang — who has been jailed along with some BYC members since  March for what the government alleges was an attempt to claim the bodies of the Jaffer Express attackers and “inciting people to violence” — is included on its list of proscribed persons.
A day before the arrest, Mahrang and BYC members had faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
In response to the DG ISPR’s comments, Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch also published a post on the BYC leader’s behalf on X on Sunday, writing, “My activism is peaceful, principled, and grounded in universal human rights values. I have consistently condemned violence, whether committed by non-state actors or the state itself.”
Calling the DG ISPR’s allegations “unsubstantiated”, Mahrang said that the press conference was “widely misused” to distort her message and that she did not condone any acts of violence during her own press conference in March, according to the statement.
Her statement continued: “In response to the DG ISPR’s latest accusations, I ask: where is the evidence?”
In April, she and other BYC leaders launched a hunger strike to protest alleged “torture” by jail staff, as well as the transfer of activist Beebow Baloch to District Jail Pishin.
Nadia wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi requesting “urgent intervention” against the alleged mistreatment of her sibling and other leaders of the group in prison.
The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.</p><small>2025-05-25 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25203242aba2932.jpg?r=203452' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913267/norris-wins-dream-maiden-monaco-grand-prix' target='_blank'><strong>Norris wins ‘dream’ maiden Monaco Grand Prix</strong></a><br><p>Lando Norris won his maiden Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday to close the gap on his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri in the battle for the 2025 drivers’ world title.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc took second, with Piastri completing the podium in the eighth race of the season.
Norris closed to within three points of Piastri after adding the jewel in the F1 calendar to his season-opening win in Australia.
Four-time reigning world champion Max Verstappen took fourth with Lewis Hamilton in the other Ferrari rounding out the top five.
“Monaco, baby! It’s a dream,” Norris exclaimed over the team radio, after becoming the first McLaren driver to win on the sinuous streets of the Principality since Hamilton in 2008.
“It feels amazing, it’s a long, gruelling race. An amazing weekend with pole, with today. This is what we dream of, this is what I did dream of as a kid,” beamed the 25-year-old.
He was pushed hard to the end of the gruelling and at times chaotic afternoon in the Monaco sunshine by Leclerc, who took second, 3.131 seconds behind.
“Lando did a better job and he deserves to win. It is above our expectations here, I thought we would struggle to be in the top 10, so it has been a good weekend, but I wish I’d won,” said the Monaco-born Leclerc.
Piastri rued a tricky time in qualifying on Saturday.
“I got close but not close enough, and you run around here where you started,” said the Australian.</p><small>2025-05-25 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606154-nine-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-separate-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Nine Indian-sponsored terrorists killed in separate KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The suspected strike took place in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. The police have held talks with tribal elders, which have so far remained inconclusive.
Earlier this week, the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), had clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the local elders, the sit-in near the Mir Ali cantonment area continued for the seventh day as authorities allegedly blocked all network and internet systems in the district.
The local elders threatened to cut internet cables providing connectivity to the cantonment area if the internet system and mobile signals were not restored in the rest of the district by Sunday evening.
The organisers of the sit-in issued a statement, seen by Dawn.com,  seeking justice for the children who lost their lives in the incident.
“The people of Waziristan will not remain silent and will launch a long march towards Islamabad on May 26, 2025 (tomorrow), if our demands are not fulfilled,” the statement, issued by the Mir Ali sit-in committee, said.
“The long march will commence from the venue of the protest sit-in in Mir Ali, pass through Bannu Bazaar and Township Chowk, and reach Domel Highway Chowk where locals will join them. It will then march toward Karak and Kohat and others will join the procession,” the statement said.
It added that the long march will reach Peshawar where the protesters will stay the night and will be joined by people from other districts.
“The next morning, the participants will march toward Islamabad, after passing through Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan and Swabi where other processions will join them,” it said.
The protests also laid out their demands, including “a judicial inquiry into the Mir Ali incident and punishment of the culprits; justice, protection, and state assistance to the families of the victims; and a complete end to drone attacks”, among other stipulations, according to the statement.
The statement further said that after reaching Islamabad, protesters will hold a peaceful demonstration for their demands in front of government offices and state institutions.
“We believe in peaceful protests and this long march will mark a milestone in the struggle against oppression, injustice, and silence and awaken the nation’s conscience,” the statement said.
In its statement on Wednesday, the ISPR said initial findings had established that this “heinous act has been orchestrated and executed by Indian-sponsored Fitnah Al Khwarij,” using the term the state uses to refer to the TTP.
“Following a tragic incident on May 19, 2025, in the general area of Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, which regrettably resulted in civilian casualties, unfounded and misleading allegations have been circulated by certain quarters, falsely implicating Pakistan’s security forces,” it added.
“These claims are entirely baseless and are part of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the security forces’ steadfast efforts in the ongoing counterterrorism operations.”
It said that a “comprehensive investigation was promptly initiated” in response to the accusations.
“It is evident that these elements — acting at the behest of their Indian masters — continue to exploit civilian areas and vulnerable populations as shields to conduct their reprehensible acts of terrorism. Such tactics aim to unsuccessfully sow discord between the local population and the security forces, who together remain resolute to uproot the menace of terrorism.”
It further said that security forces reaffirmed “their commitment to ensuring that the perpetrators of this inhuman act are brought to justice.”</p><small>2025-05-25 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606133-khuzdar-blast-death-toll-rises-to-eight-as-two-more-students-succumb-to-injuries' target='_blank'><strong>Khuzdar blast death toll rises to eight as two more students succumb to injuries</strong></a><br><p>

The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection with the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.
The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity. Four are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
“The formal trial has begun,” Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters. “The prosecution believes that this prosecution will be able to prove the crimes done by the accused.”
It is the first formal charge in any case related to the killings during last year’s student-led uprising, which ended Hasina’s iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.
The list of those facing trial includes Dhaka’s former police commissioner, Habibur Rahman, who is among those being tried in absentia.
Hasina also fled by helicopter to India, her old ally. She remains in self-imposed exile, defying Dhaka’s extradition request to face charges of crimes against humanity.
‘Command responsibility’
The launch of the trials of senior figures from Hasina’s government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power as the South Asian nation awaits elections that the interim government has vowed will take place before June 2026.
Islam said the eight men were accused of “different responsibilities”, including the most senior for “superior command responsibility, some for direct orders … [and] some for participation”.
He said he was confident of a successful prosecution.
“We have submitted as much evidence as required to prove crimes against humanity, both at a national and an international standard,” he said.
Among that evidence, he said, was video footage of the violence, as well as voice recordings of Hasina in “conversations with different people where she ordered the killing of the protesters using force and lethal weapons”.
The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009. It sentenced numerous prominent political opponents to death over the following years and became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate rivals.</p><small>2025-05-25 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606123-nation-and-army-have-always-stood-united-will-remain-so-says-ispr-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Nation and army have always stood united, will remain so, says ISPR chief</strong></a><br><p>

“Why isn’t Harvard saying that almost 31 [per cent] of their students are from foreign lands, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay nothing toward their student’s education, nor do they ever intend to,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
“We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday revoked Harvard’s ability to enrol foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
She had threatened last month to block international students at the school unless it turned over records on visa holders’ “illegal and violent activities”.
But a judge quickly suspended the move after the university sued to “stop the government’s arbitrary, capricious, unlawful and unconstitutional action”.
The White House is cracking down on US universities on several fronts, justified as a reaction to what the administration says is uncontrolled anti-Semitism and a need to reverse diversity programmes aimed at addressing historical oppression of minorities.
It has also moved to revoke visas and deport foreign students involved in protests against Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, accusing them of supporting Palestinian group Hamas.
At Harvard, the government has threatened to put $9 billion of funding under review, then went on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2bn of grants and $60 million of official contracts. It has also targeted a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation.
The loss of foreign nationals — more than a quarter of its student body —could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition.
Harvard is the wealthiest US university with an endowment valued at $53.2bn in 2024.</p><small>2025-05-25 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/251541567b603f5.jpg?r=154754' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913250/crew-rescued-as-container-ship-sinks-off-indias-south-coast-with-hazardous-cargo' target='_blank'><strong>Crew rescued as container ship sinks off India’s south coast with hazardous cargo</strong></a><br><p>A Liberian-flagged container ship with hazardous cargo has sunk off the coast of Kerala in India’s south, the navy said on Sunday after rescuing all 24 crew members safely.
India’s navy said the MSC ELSA 3, listed as a 184-metre-long freight ship, which was sailing from the Indian port of Vizhinjam to Kochi, ran into trouble on Saturday and issued a distress call.
Navy aircraft scrambled to the area and spotted two life rafts, with the container ship listing at a dangerous angle, some 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi.
“All 24 crew members on board were rescued,” the Ministry of Defence said in a statement, with the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and a navy patrol boat collecting the sailors, who were from Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, and the Philippines.
“The vessel went down with 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo and 12 containing calcium carbide,” the statement said.
 






The Defence Ministry did not specify what was inside the containers it said were hazardous. Calcium carbide is used in the chemical industry, including for fertiliser production and steelmaking.
“Given the sensitive marine ecosystem along Kerala’s coast, ICG has activated full pollution response preparedness,” the navy said.
The vessel also contained some 370 tonnes of fuel and oil but while the coast guard had deployed “detection systems”, it said that “so far, no oil spill has been reported”.</p><small>2025-05-25 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25134931d8b2573.jpg?r=135003' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238/govt-allocates-2000mw-for-bitcoin-mining-and-ai-data-centres' target='_blank'><strong>Govt allocates 2,000MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres</strong></a><br><p>In a groundbreaking move to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.
The government recently decided to legalise cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
The federal government appointed entrepreneur Bilal Bin Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the council.
A statement by the Finance Division says this ambitious initiative is spearheaded by the PCC — a government-backed body under the Ministry of Finance — as part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that this strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.
“Pakistan is uniquely positioned — both geographically and economically — to become a global hub for data centres. As a digital bridge between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Pakistan offers the most strategic location in the world for data flow and digital infrastructure,” the statement says.
It said that since the inception of the PCC, there has been tremendous interest from global Bitcoin miners and data infrastructure companies. Several international firms have already visited the country for exploratory discussions, and following this landmark announcement, more global players are expected to visit in the coming weeks.
“Pakistan’s underutilised power generation capacity is now being repurposed into a high-value digital asset. AI data centres and Bitcoin mining operations, known for their consistent and heavy energy usage, provide an ideal use case for this surplus.
“Redirecting idle energy, especially from plants operating below capacity, allows Pakistan to convert a long-standing financial liability into a sustainable, revenue-generating opportunity,” the statement added.
PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib emphasised the transformative nature of this initiative and explained that with proper regulation, transparency, and international collaboration, Pakistan can become a global crypto and AI powerhouse.
Saqib said that this energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in US dollars through Bitcoin mining.
Additionally, as regulations evolve, Pakistan can accumulate Bitcoin directly into a national wallet — marking a monumental shift from selling power in Pakistani rupees to leveraging digital assets for economic stability.
By offering stable and affordable energy, the statement said Pakistan presents a highly competitive environment compared to regional counterparts like India and Singapore, where rising power costs and land scarcity limit scalability.
Pakistan’s strategic advantage is further underscored by the global context as while AI data centre demand has soared to over 100 gigawatts (GW), the global supply remains around 15GW. This massive shortfall creates an unprecedented opportunity for countries like Pakistan with surplus power, land and an emerging regulatory framework, it added.
The statement further said the country’s digital connectivity has also been significantly strengthened by the landing of the world’s largest submarine internet cable. The Africa-2 Cable Project, a 45,000-kilometre global network connecting 33 countries through 46 landing stations, has now landed in Pakistan.
This milestone enhances Pakistan’s internet bandwidth, latency and resilience through redundant fiber routes — key for ensuring high availability and operational continuity for AI data centres.
With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres will not only address growing concerns around data sovereignty but will also enhance cybersecurity, improve digital service delivery, and empower national capabilities in AI and cloud infrastructure.
These centres are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, catalysing the development of a skilled workforce in engineering, IT, and data sciences.
The statement adds that this announcement marks only the first phase of a broader, multi-stage digital infrastructure rollout. Future developments are expected to include renewable energy-powered facilities — leveraging Pakistan’s immense wind (50,000MW potential in the Gharo-Keti Bandar corridor), solar, and hydropower resources — as well as strategic international partnerships with leading blockchain and AI companies, and the establishment of fintech and innovation hubs.
These efforts will be complemented by proposed incentives such as tax holidays, customs duty exemptions on equipment, and reduced taxes for AI infrastructure developers, it added.
“Pakistan’s combination of surplus power, geographic advantage, advanced subsea cable connectivity, renewable energy potential, and a large, digitally engaged population creates a compelling case for becoming a regional epicentre of Web3, AI, and digital innovation.
“With the right incentives, strategic investments, and collaborative partnerships, Pakistan is positioning itself not only as a destination for global digital infrastructure but also as a sovereign economy that can accumulate digital assets, export digital services, and lead in the next generation of technological transformation.”</p><small>2025-05-25 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/251315123f8ef7d.jpg?r=134953' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913239/pakistan-launches-3rd-anti-polio-drive-of-this-year' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan launches 3rd anti-polio drive of this year</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Polio Programme on Sunday launched the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
Earlier this week, two new cases of polio were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, taking the tally for the current year to 10.
“The Pakistan Polio Programme today launched its third National Immunisation Days (NIDs) campaign of the year at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad,” a statement from the Centre read.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.
“To mark the launch, Farooq administered oral polio vaccine and Vitamin A drops to children under five, reinforcing the government’s unwavering commitment to eradicating the crippling disease from every corner of the country,” the NEOC continued.
Scheduled to begin on May 26, the weeklong campaign aims to vaccinate over 45 million children under five, the statement noted, adding, “making [the drive] a critical intervention in Pakistan’s final push to interrupt poliovirus transmission and achieve eradication by the end of 2025”.
“Polio eradication is not just a health goal — it is a national imperative and a matter of immense pride for our country,” the statement quoted Farooq as saying.
“This third campaign of 2025 marks a decisive milestone in our 2-4-6 roadmap. These back-to-back rounds from September 2024 to May 2025 represent our most strategic opportunity to close immunity gaps and halt virus circulation before the high transmission season begins,” she added.
Farooq acknowledged that the persistent challenges in key reservoirs such as Karachi, South Khyber Pakhtunkwa, and Quetta Block, but noted encouraging progress in reaching previously underserved populations.
She also extended heartfelt appreciation to the 400,000 frontline workers powering the campaign — including 225,000 women vaccinators — and recognised the critical role of civil and military law enforcement in ensuring safe access to children.
“Despite major gains, wild poliovirus continues to pose a threat. Pakistan has confirmed 10 cases so far this year. Environmental surveillance has detected the virus in 272 sewage samples from 127 testing sites, across 68 districts, signalling continued circulation,” it added.
Speaking at the event, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil expressed confidence in the programme’s direction. As he concluded his tenure in Pakistan, Fadil commended the national leadership and Farooq for their tireless dedication to polio eradication.
“Pakistan is closer than ever to making history. With continued political will, community engagement, and coordinated action by all partners, I believe this country can soon achieve a polio-free future,” he said.
“The public is strongly encouraged to cooperate with vaccination teams and report any missed children via the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline 1166 or the WhatsApp,” the statement concluded.
Polio is a paralysing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children with high immunity against this terrible disease.
Pakistan has pledged to eradicate polio by the end of this year, Federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal said earlier in the week during a meeting with the President of Global Development at the Gates Foundation Dr Chris Elias.
Attributing the recent progress to successful immunisation campaigns and better community outreach, Kamal reaffirmed his commitment, noting a significant decrease in parental vaccine refusal.
“The fight against polio has required a tremendous sacrifice from all stakeholders, including law enforcement personnel who have rendered invaluable services,” Kamal had said. “This mission will continue until we reach complete eradication [of the poliovirus].”</p><small>2025-05-25 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2512234257653bf.png?r=122427' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913182/balochistan-journalist-resisting-kidnapping-bid-shot-dead-in-his-house' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan journalist resisting kidnapping bid shot dead in his house</strong></a><br><p>• Latif Baloch’s son was also abducted, slain a few years ago
• Journalist bodies condemn killing, demand justice
QUETTA: A journalist, Abdul Latif Baloch, who worked for a Quetta-based newspaper as a correspondent, was gunned down by unknown assailants in the Mashkey area of Awaran district on Saturday, police said.
The gunmen barged into the journalist’s house in the wee hours of Saturday morning and tried to take him away. When he offered resistance, the intruders opened fire, killing him on the spot.
The killers fled the scene and could not be arrested till late into the night.
Police have launched an investigation into the incident.
According to police officials, Mr Baloch was also working in the Levies force department.
They said that a few years ago, the body of Mr Baloch’s kidnapped son was found in Mashkey.
Journalist organisations strongly condemned the killing of Mr Baloch, who was working for Daily Intikhab.
 
 

While the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) expressed its deepest shock and outrage over the brutal killing, the Balochistan Union of Journalists (BUJ) termed the incident part of a broader conspiracy to silence independent voices in Balochistan.
PFUJ acting President Khalid Khokhar and Secretary General Arshad Ansari said this senseless act of violence is a stark reminder of the risks journalists face while performing their duties.
“We demand that the authorities take immediate and concrete actions to investigate this crime, identify the perpetrators, and bring them to justice,” they demanded in a statement.
The PFUJ also called for enhanced security measures to protect journalists and ensure their safety while reporting.
It condemned the threats Mr Baloch received prior to his murder. Such acts of intimidation create a climate of fear, undermining press freedom and democracy, it added.
“We stand in solidarity with Abdul Latif Baloch’s family, colleagues, and the Baluchistan journalist community, and pledge to continue advocating for journalists’ rights and safety,” they urged
The PFUJ leadership called upon the government to take concrete steps to address the deteriorating security situation for journalists and media workers across Pakistan.
In a separate statement, BUJ President Khalil Ahmed and General Secretary Abdul Ghani Kakar described Mr Baloch as a dedicated and honest journalist, adding that his targeted killing raises serious concerns about press freedom in Balochistan. The union demanded a high-level inquiry into the murder.
“Journalists in a sensitive region like Balochistan already face grave threats, and such attacks highlight the government’s failure to ensure their safety,” the statement said. “If immediate action is not taken, this dangerous trend could escalate further.”
The BUJ urged the Balochistan government to swiftly arrest the perpetrators and ensure that justice is served.

It was explained by PIIA chairperson Dr Masuma Hasan there was a need to hear different voices, especially the voices of the youth, regarding the recent conflict. Therefore, they decided to call on their research assistants to talk about the different themes of the conflict, as identified by them, for the audience to then take it from there.
Taking the audience through the events of the past month or so, she also reminded how India, out of the blue, with no credible evidence, held Pakistan responsible for April 22’s Pahalgam attack, which was an intelligence failure on the part of India.
“Then India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 and Pakistan suspended the Simla Agreement of 1972,” she said.
“Then on May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. While defending the country very well, Pakistan retaliated on May 10, which was followed by a ceasefire after US president Donald Trump’s intervention,” she added.
 
 

Research assistant Mohammad Usman presented a paper on ‘Water Assets and Resources’. He said that if India were to stop the water flow to Pakistan, it would risk flooding its own upper regions. “But if they stopped our water during the dry seasons, it could be a concern for us because the flow of water is lower and storage matters the most. It can affect our farmers, which could result in lower yields,” he said.
“But if India blocked our water, it would require significant infrastructure, which will take years to build and would also require billions of dollars,” he said.

In war with India, Pakistan reasserts itself through controlled display of sophisticated force, say experts

“As for the weaponisation of water, or the water bomb, a concept when the upper riparian state blocks the flow of water and then suddenly releases a significant amount of water without notifying the lower riparian state, you have a big flood. Here in the case of Pakistan and India, Pakistan is the lower riparian state and India the upper riparian state. But in the case of China and India, China is the upper riparian state and India the lower riparian state, especially in Brahmaputra. China can also block India’s water,” he pointed out.
 
 

Research assistant Syeda Maliha Sehar read a paper on the theme of ‘Political and Military Interests’. “We saw a maturity of new capabilities developed through the Pakistan-China military partnership,” she said.
“By deploying Chinese-origin systems designed to destruct Indian surveillance and communications, Pakistan directly challenged the technological dominance of both Indian and Western-aligned platforms. Pakistan’s response served to dismantle long-standing perceptions of asymmetry, re-framing Pakistan, not as a reactive or inferior actor, but as one capable of leading with precision, restraint and strategic innovation. In doing so, Pakistan reasserted itself in the region’s power dynamics not through escalation but through controlled exhibition of a sophisticated force,” Maliha added.
Another young researcher Safa Rehmat spoke about ‘Cyber Warfare and Digital Espionage’. “Cyber warfare in this conflict involves hacking, data breaches and misinformation campaigns. Both the Indian Research and Analysis Wing [RAW] and the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI], as well as the people of both countries, have developed sophisticated cyber capabilities,” she said.
Speaking about the ‘War of Narratives’, Research Assistant Syed Shahryar Shah said that perceptions came to be just as important as the conflict. “The actual conflict lasted a few days but we are carrying on with the narratives,” he said. “What matters now is not what happened but what people believe happened,” he added.
 
 

Another Research Assistant, Asif Ali, spoke of ‘The Kashmir Flashpoint’. “The Indian authorities have already begun a crackdown in Kashmir. Following the Pahalgam incident around 2,800 Kashmiris have either been questioned or detained by the Indian authorities and this is something that is likely to continue,” he pointed out.
Another paper was presented on ‘Media, Misinformation and Public Opinion’ where Safa Rehmat, again, spoke of the things reported wrongly in the media on both sides such as India attacking the Karachi port while showing old pictures of Philadelphia and also reporting that Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff had been captured. Pakistan also chipped in by reporting the capture of Indian female air force pilot Shivani Singh and the raising of white flags of truce from the Indian side.
Saad Asad Brohi spoke of ‘Regional and Global Responses’.
 
 

The discussion, which followed included a comment about it being easy to blame someone else for one’s own internal problems, which is what India did after the Pahalgam attack.
Someone also pointed out that war was not one-dimensional. There are also dimensions such as economy, diplomacy, politics, etc, to think about. It was also mentioned that the armed forces of Pakistan certainly deserve accolades, but there was also a need for good governance in this country.
One person in the audience then got up to thank Indian PM Narendra Modi for providing an opportunity for unity in Pakistan.
