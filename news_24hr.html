“Players with Rawalpindi domicile will be included in the team purely on the basis of merit, and this team will not only participate in the PSL but will also be developed as a world-class team,” he said while addressing a press conference at his residence.
Accompanied by Lahore Qalandars Chief Executive Officer Atif Rana, the railways minister said the trials would be held on February 14 and 15. “Any youngster appearing in the trials will be selected on merit,” he added.
He said the Lahore Qalandars CEO would guide the initiative. He further stated that only youth with Rawalpindi domicile would be included in the Rawalpindi Tigers and that the team would participate in the Pakistan Super League (PSL).
Thanking the Lahore Qalandars CEO for visiting Rawalpindi, Mr Abbasi said the franchise had played an important role in promoting cricket among the youth. “Pakistanis have a romance with cricket. We are announcing the formation of the Rawalpindi Tigers team, which will be developed as a world-class team,” he said.
He said he had been a fan of Lahore Qalandars from the beginning. “We have provided sports facilities to the youth of Rawalpindi in colleges and schools. We are providing a major platform to the youth purely on merit,” he said, adding that the trials would be sponsored by Capital Smart City.
On the occasion, Lahore Qalandars CEO Atif Rana said he had a long-standing relationship with Hanif Abbasi, who had provided great support during Lahore Qalandars trials in the past. He also praised the cleanliness system in Rawalpindi.
He said Lahore Qalandars deserved credit for the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, under which trials were conducted for 300,000 children. He added that Hanif Abbasi was providing facilities to the youth while serving the public.
“We will conduct trials in Rawalpindi before the PSL auction. We have teams in every area and school of Rawalpindi,” he said, adding that all trials would be conducted on merit and talent would be introduced to the world.
He said a development squad would be called from outside to train the players. “Initially, a Rawalpindi Tigers club will be formed, and 20 players will be selected in the first phase,” he added.

“The government has taken notice of misleading claims in circulation regarding alleged ‘depopulation’ from Tirah Valley on the orders of the army.
“These assertions are baseless, malicious, and driven by ulterior motives aimed at creating alarm among the public. No directive has been issued for the depopulation of Tirah by the federal government and the armed forces,” a post on the ministry’s X account said on Sunday.







The ministry further maintained in its statement that law enforcement agencies had been routinely conducting “targeted, intelligence-based operations, strictly against terrorist elements, with full care to avoid disruption to civilian life, for which no migration is needed or being undertaken”.
“It may be noted that the local population is increasingly concerned over the presence of khawarij (a term that the state uses for terrorists) and desire peace and stability in Tirah,” the ministry said.

“The plan is almost finalised following approval accorded by the highest office of the Punjab government. Hopefully, the two new districts will be created after Basant,” a senior official in the Lahore administration confirmed while talking to Dawn on Saturday.
The official, who requested anonymity, said the administration had already provided the related data comprising the number of existing 10 tehsils, population, offices, issues etc to the Punjab government. “But I don’t know on which basis – number of tehsils or population, the government decides to bifurcate the city district into two districts. However, the names of the new districts – Lahore North and Lahore South are almost finalised,” he maintained.
Previously, efforts were made to split Lahore into districts, but these proposals did not mature due to administrative, financial, bureaucratic and political issues. In January 2023, the government deferred various plans to divide Lahore into various districts.
However, in August 2024, instead of splitting Lahore into districts, the government increased the number of tehsils from five to 10, including the Nishtar, Wagah, Iqbal Town, Ravi and Saddar tehsils along with the five existing tehsils: Raiwind, Model Town, Lahore Cantt, Lahore City, and Shalimar.

Official says Lahore North to comprise Wagah, Ravi, Saddar, Shalimar, City and Cantt tehsils, whereas the South will consist of Iqbal Town, Model Town, Raiwind and Nishtar tehsils

The initial plan had been introduced in 2017 under which Lahore was to be divided into four districts. The plan was devised after a massive increase in the city district’s population that, at that time, had reached around 10.1m. Initially a committee, headed by the then Lahore commissioner, was formed and it had reached consensus to go ahead with the plan.
A ccording to the committee members, Lahore had become difficult to manage with the existing administrative and functional structure due to increasing population with massive horizontal growth of the city. With the lapse of time, uncertain political situations started developing in 2017 and the proposal was dropped.
However, in 2019, the proposal was revived with a suggestion to reduce the number of districts from four to three. In 2020, another proposal, apparently more viable, was floated. According to this proposal, Lahore was to be divided into two districts.
This proposal was finally declared as viable in a meeting on Dec 3, 2020. It suggested bifurcation of Lahore into City and Saddar districts with creation of five new tehsils — Ferozewala, Thokar Niaz Baig, Kahna, Kot Abdul Malik and Harbanspura — in the two proposed districts. The then Lahore DC had also asked to expedite the preparation of a PC-II for carrying out impact assessment study for geographic and social & cultural cohesion by hiring consultancy services under the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules with a direction to retain the historical character of the city during the division. A lot of work was done on the proposal of 2020, but later it slowed down due to a lack of political will and other administrative and functional issues.
When Parvez Elahi became the chief minister, he had also ordered the authorities to revive the proposal with a direction to divide Lahore into three districts, as per the proposal of 2019.
He finally announced to divide Lahore into three districts. However, there was no suggestion as to what would be the third district. That proposal was also deferred at a later stage.
“All previous proposals have become obsolete now, as the current proposal is being worked very seriously to improve local governance, resolve growing civic issues related to traffic, parking, pollution & smog, encroachment etc. With the bifurcation of Lahore, such issues can be resolved with effective governance as this is not possible with one deputy commissioner in the second largest city of Pakistan having a total population of around 25 million people,” the officer argued.
To a question, he said a suggestion had also been given to the government to increase the number of tehsils from 10 to 12. “This suggestion seems from the bureaucracy that, perhaps, does not want Lahore to be split into two districts,” he maintained.
To another question, the official said, the Lahore North is likely to have Wagah, Ravi, Saddar, Shalimar, City and Cantt tehsils, whereas the Lahore South district may comprise of Iqbal Town, Model Town, Raiwind and Nishtar tehsils.

As per details, the department seized 20 lions from a breeding farm in the Lahore division and arrested Fayaz alias Faizi and three others for violating the instructions that every lion pair should have at least 22 marlas of space for captivity.
While another 23 big cats, including 14 tigers, four lions and five ligers were seized from a facility in CITI housing, Jhelum and one Muhammad Aamir was arrested.

 

In Multan, a private wildlife breeding farm near the Askari Bypass in Cantonment area was also sealed for non-compliance of SOPs.
As many as nine lions and a monkey were seized from the facility and an FIR was registered against one Waqas Ayub.
Similarly in Gujranwala division, one person was arrested for possessing three lions in violation of the department’s guidelines at the Canal View Housing Society.
Two lions were retrieved from a home in Luther village in Sialkot district and one arrest was made. Meanwhile, another two lions being kept at the Imam Jalvi Darbar in Faisalabad were also seized.
Additional Chief Wildlife Ranger Mudassar Hassan told Dawn that the department had been issuing notices on the print and social media platforms that farms that failed to fulfill the standards for keeping wild animals would be sealed.
He said that the facilities that had not followed the guidelines had been sealed and the department would take care of the lions.
Sources claimed that the fate of the lions would be decided later.

As mercury dives to single digits, the government’s refusal to treat the biting cold as a climate emergency is claiming lives.
In Chitral, at least nine members of a family were killed when an avalanche consumed their house. Intense snowfall and landslides have crippled routine life in KP, Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Kashmir. Households grapple with unannounced power and gas cuts; commuters contend with blocked roads and highways. Power outages, suspended water supply, and extremely low gas pressure turned homes into dark freezers in Balochistan where temperatures were as low as minus 13°C.
This month, nearly 50 people have reportedly died of the cold in Karachi alone — a city that usually experiences mild winters witnessed temperatures below 7°C. This weather system is expected to bring more rain and snowfall to the country but only Punjab seems prepared for it.
Cold snaps often take an unsparing toll on the human body. Medical experts say that as the cold forces the heart to work overtime, heart attacks, strokes, and kidney complications become more common, particularly among people suffering from heart disease, poor immunity and diabetes. Heat loss in the body causes chilblains, frostbite and hypothermia — treatable conditions that turn lethal due to the lack of knowledge about them.

 

A warm hearth in winter can help. But the scores that languish on cold, hard footpaths wrapped in rags or plastic die uncounted.
Welfare-centric policies and mechanisms that ensure uninterrupted gas and electricity and road safety in extreme weather events are crucial. The state’s inability to expand free shelter and meal programmes, such as panahgahs, must be tackled with the adoption of international models involving pavement shelters and drop-in facilities. For immediate relief, parts of public spaces should serve as refuge.
The antidote to widespread indignity is compassion.

The Pakistani parliamentary opposition makes a valid case that the matter should have been laid before the House for discussion and approval prior to any decision; but its view that joining the Board was not a prudent move is open to question. “It was the least worst [bad] option,” was the crisp comment of former ambassador Imran Ali Chaudhry, who had recently retired when the digital platform Naya Daur sought his opinion. There are a number of reasons why I tend to agree with him.
People around the world have been up in arms at the apartheid State of Israel’s genocide in Gaza starting after the Hamas attack of Oct 7, 2023. Calls from around the world fell on deaf ears as the West, led by the US, unconditionally supported, armed and facilitated the Zionist state’s assault on the Strip. Some 70,000 Gaza Palestinians were slaughtered, including about 20,000 children and a large number of women, elderly and the infirm, ie, non-combatants. But it remained business as usual as far as the genocidal apartheid state was concerned.
Whether in the hope of winning laurels or heeding his Gulf friends’ counsel, it was Trump who finally stopped the genocide. At the beginning, he was talking in terms of relocating the Gaza population and developing the Strip as the Middle East’s Riviera. Then, possibly the continuing street protests in the West, the US included, and the constant unhappiness of his well-resourced Gulf friends made him stay his hand and he made clear his plan did not envisage or include anyone being displaced from Gaza.

Pakistan has wisely sought safety in numbers and has joined the Board as part of an OIC bloc.

His announcements thus far have fallen way short of suggesting any pathway to Palestinian statehood. This is a major negative. Especially at a time when the apartheid state has accelerated evictions of Palestinians and the expansion of settlements in the West Bank.
But, despite some 450 murders of Gaza Palestinians since last October’s ceasefire by Israel, the mass killing that continued unabated for two years and claimed at the very least 70,000 lives has stopped. If joining the Board means that the magnitude of killing has stopped and many more lives saved, then perhaps it is worth it.
Pakistan has wisely sought safety in numbers and has joined the Board as part of an OIC bloc. This makes it easier in relative terms to have its voice heard. Perhaps, collectively, they can counter and dilute the apartheid state’s influence with Trump. And if the going gets too frustrating, then they can exit en bloc without one state having to face the seemingly unstable US leader’s wrath.
Let’s not forget, the US is Pakistan’s largest export market valued at between $5 billion and $6bn a year. Pakistan is also currently in an IMF programme — an institution with huge American influence, which has brought in badly needed foreign exchange injections. Coupled with meeting some of Pakistan’s military spares/upgrade needs such as the $640 million upgrade of PAF F-16 aircraft which extends their operational age to 2040, all these factors make Pakistan’s decision understandable.
In addition, Pakistan military’s performance during last May’s clash with India seems to have boosted the country’s standing in the region as well, with Trump constantly endorsing the PAF’s verified kill claims against its arch-rival, the IAF.
This element, along with effective diplomacy by the hybrid leadership, has opened up opportunities. While I wouldn’t go as far as to repeat what some analysts are saying about Pakistan being now the net security provider in the region, the defence pact with Saudi Arabia is a significant milestone.
The one interesting fact about this Board is that apart from the US, not a single UN Security Council member has joined it. Russia, China, Britain and France have so far not joined and don’t appear to be doing so either. The impact of this will become clear over time.
Many pragmatic decisions taken to safeguard the national interest may not pass the principled position test. My first and foremost concern is that the issues affecting the lives of the Palestinians in Gaza, and then the West Bank, are to be decided by an apex body that does not have a single Palestinian on it.
It will be left to other Muslim states’ representatives to carry the Palestinian mantle. Their past record of standing up for the rights of the Palestinians is not very inspiring, but the Gaza genocide seems to have shaken the most docile into sitting up and saying enough is enough. Let’s hope this isn’t wishful thinking.
As much as I want to, I don’t see this Board, with chairman Trump armed with the solitary veto and a large number of committed Zionist supporters of the apartheid state including Benjamin Netanyahu himself on it, making progress on Palestinian statehood.
But if it stops the genocide, and leads to some relief for the Gaza population and sets things on the path to reconstruction and rehabilitation it will be worthwhile. This is how powerless we are to see justice prevail in the world.
Since this Board is unlikely to last a day after Trump’s term ends, one can safely say it may not achieve much more except give the US leader another opportunity to blow his own trumpet and make largely unfounded claims of success and impact.
For Pakistan coming out unscathed at the end and more tightly aligned with Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Egypt, Jordan, the UAE, Qatar and Indonesia would be a diplomatic and strategic win, particularly because the nation’s perennial ally China is reportedly fine with the decision.

Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-25 04:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968958/american-armada' target='_blank'><strong>American ‘armada’</strong></a><br><p>ALTHOUGH it seemed that US President Donald Trump had reconsidered his plans to stage an attack on Iran last week, an American military build-up in the region points to the fact that the danger of a conflagration has yet to pass.
Mr Trump has said that an “armada” of American ships is headed to the Gulf “just in case”, while adding that he did not want to “see anything happen” vis-à-vis Iran. There are also reports that the US has deployed more fighter jets to its bases in some regional states, while the Turkish foreign minister has said that Israel is “looking for an opportunity” to strike Iran. Senior Iranian officials, on the other hand, have indicated they will hit back hard if attacked.

 

The Trumpian threats could well be mere sabre-rattling designed to bring Tehran to the table on America’s terms. However, the problem with such brinkmanship is that it can very quickly spiral out of control, and have devastating real-world consequences.
It is also a fact that the US, Israel and many of their Western allies keep shifting the goalposts where Iran is concerned. At times they claim to be acting out of sympathy for the Iranian people and the alleged mistreatment they suffer at the hands of their rulers. But this sympathy is nowhere to be seen when the US and Israel lob missiles at Iran, killing innocent civilians.
At other times they have issues with Iran’s nuclear programme, its stockpile of missiles, and its support for ‘proxies’ such as Hezbollah, Hamas etc. The ultimate aim of the US-led bloc, though, seems to be to punish and bring down a regime that has been a geopolitical adversary for nearly five decades.
Assuming that Mr Trump is not bluffing, and his plans to attack Iran are still on the table, those states, including Pakistan and Turkiye, that have joined his Board of Peace need to talk him out of this disastrous plan.

 

Mr Trump fashions himself a peacemaker, yet his conduct against Venezuela and Iran is that of a warmonger. There is also some media commentary that the US president backed off from an attack on Iran in mid-January not out of any humanitarian compulsions, but because the US and its allies were then not militarily and logistically prepared for aggression against Tehran.
The latest military build-up may be to rectify that situation.
Saner minds in the world community that have Mr Trump’s ear must insist that plans for a Zionist-neocon war against Iran must be jettisoned. If the US and other Western states are serious about resolving their differences with Iran, they must treat it with respect, and refrain from violating its sovereignty. Above all, no one can afford a disastrous new war.

This decision reflects Pakistan’s usual realpolitik approach to the Middle East. However, in Pakistan, realpolitik is often seen as a national weakness.
Since the Kuwait invasion, the US invasion of Iraq, the deployment of forces in Yemen, and most recently, attempts to stop the Israel-Palestine conflict, Pakistan has chosen a pragmatic foreign policy. These decisions are justified by geo-economic needs and the desire to stay relevant in the West and Middle East. The key question is: if Pakistan had a strong economy and stable political and social systems, would it make the same choices?
This question is significant because, in such instances, the establishment often makes decisions that contradict prevailing public sentiments, sentiments shaped by opinion-makers and religious clergy who promote a moral narrative anchored in a narrow worldview. In contrast, the establishment tends to adopt a more grounded, interest-based approach.

 

Pragmatism exacts a price. Those who advocate a moral-politics narrative continue to delegitimise political and military decision-makers, widening the gap between public opinion and state policy. It is worth examining whether a stronger economy and greater political stability would compel Pakistan’s leadership to weigh public sentiment more heavily, or whether strategic interests would still dominate policy choices.

If Pakistan had a strong economy and stable systems, would it make the same choices?

Most countries that have joined Trump’s BoP so far tend to have weak democratic credentials and are predominantly Muslim states that do not prioritise public opinion in foreign policy; their ruling elites often hold worldviews distinct from those of their populations. In contrast, democracies with some degree of pluralism, such as Indonesia or Turkiye, may consider public sentiment more directly, yet ultimately align their decisions with international norms and their political and strategic interests.
Pakistan’s hybrid political system behaves at times like a quasi-monarchy, with critical foreign policy decisions taken outside a broad parliamentary consensus. This dynamic harms the credibility of ruling elites and enables the clergy to reinforce the narrative that the country’s leadership is a ‘puppet of Western imperialism’, asserting that under a truly Islamic system, the decisions would be different. The establishment does not like such equations and continues struggling to produce a counter-narrative.
It is understandable why building consensus on sensitive issues, such as joining President Donald Trump’s BoP or participating in a stabilisation force in Gaza, is difficult in parliament; only a few brave legislators are willing to counter dominant popular perceptions. Political elites also prefer that the establishment manage consensus-building in such affairs, an expectation the institution is not equipped to meet without paying a domestic legitimacy cost.
No doubt, public opinion is not very supportive of joining the BoP, but the situation in the country this time is different. Those who traditionally exploit such sentiments lack the strength to mobilise the masses or bring them into the streets. The Friday protests called by religious parties, and the occasional large demonstrations organised by the Jamaat-i-Islami, JUI-F, or a Shia party, may provide a degree of catharsis for public sentiment, but they are unlikely to generate sustained momentum. Nor are they capable of creating the kind of impression that would worry Pakistan’s partners in the Gulf or the US.0
Apart from the decision to join the BoP, which is justified from several regional and global perspectives, the hybrid regime has weakened the street power of political and religious parties, setting examples through its handling of the PTI and TLP. Although the two cases are not directly comparable — the PTI’s mass protests were rooted in demands for political rights, while TLP was promoting an extremist agenda — the state security institutions dealt with both through a fully muscular approach. As a result, the TLP is now in complete disarray, while the PTI is struggling to mobilise the masses, mainly in Punjab and the federal capital.
This approach reflects the mentality of a hybrid regime that seeks to shape Pakistan into a more authoritarian state. The message is clear for all domestic actors. However, the durability of this model remains uncertain. Much depends on whether this approach can deliver economic improvements, ease public hardship and enhance economic indicators, a challenge that remains considerable.
The realpolitik behind joining the BoP is evident; Pakistan seeks to remain relevant in regional affairs while enhancing defence and economic cooperation with Gulf and African nations. Another angle is that Pakistan has effectively joined the club of Trump’s allies, while India is in the opposite camp, deepening economic and defence collaboration with the EU and its member states, many of which have been at odds with Trump’s policies recently. In this context, Pakistan had limited options to remain neutral.
Although association with Trump may not be popular in domestic or international public opinion, it has provided the architects and operators of the hybrid regime with an opportunity to gain legitimacy and consolidate their control over the political system, something they have sought for decades.
As for the argument that Pakistan should not have joined the BoP because it is a parallel structure to the UN, this reasoning is flawed. The international body has long struggled to provide an effective dispute-resolution mechanism. Who knows this better than Pakistan, given what happened to its Kashmir resolutions in the Security Council? The UN has a history of siding with the powerful and with those on whom it depends on for funding. Whatever Trump wants, he can achieve through the UN as well; after all, it was the UNSC that first passed Resolution 2803, which effectively endorsed Trump’s peace plan for Gaza.
If viewed closely, President Trump and the architects of Pakistan’s hybrid regime share a similar worldview; the only difference is that Trump has an entire world to play with.

An Islamabad lawyer couple, often seen standing beside citizens challenging human rights violations, has been condemned by a sessions court to serve time for statements deemed too controversial to be posted on social media platform X.
Imaan Zainab-Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, are both promising human rights lawyers and activists known for fighting high-profile cases involving enforced disappearances, blasphemy accusations, and judicial independence. They have often pleaded in court on behalf of citizens with no means to pay for legal counsel or the privilege to navigate a broken justice system on their own.

 

Many believe their insistence on representing victims of state excesses, outspokenness on issues like free speech and rule of law, and criticism of state institutions are what prompted the recent witch-hunt against them. In the past few weeks, the two found themselves in the crosshairs of an unrelenting campaign of lawfare, which included a previously undisclosed case that ‘magically’ resurfaced when their detention was sought. The ordeal culminated in a dramatic arrest on Jan 23, followed by a conviction the very next day.
The National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority, the complainant in this case, had accused Ms Mazari last July of “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”.
Her husband was deemed complicit for reposting those posts. A court order authored by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka now holds the two guilty of ‘glorification of an offence’, ‘cyberterrorism’ and ‘false and fake information’.

 

Their punishment: rigorous imprisonment for five years and a fine of Rs5m each for the first charge; 10 years and Rs30m each for the second; and two years and Rs1m each for the third. One does not need the content of the offending tweets to guess what they likely said, just as one does not need legal reasoning to understand this verdict.
Our legal community has historically played a central role in resisting despotism and defending constitutional norms. This conviction raises the question of whether that tradition is being deliberately weakened through harsh punishment. If such convictions stand, the message to lawyers, journalists and citizens alike is unmistakable: dissent will not merely be discouraged, it will be criminalised.

Rates issued by the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), based on interbank exchange rates, quoted the one-tola silver (24kt) rate at Rs10,801, up Rs526, while the 10-gram rate rose Rs451 to Rs9,260. This follows an increase in the world silver price by $5.26 per ounce to $103.26.
Gold and silver continue to attract global investors, including in Pakistan, as safe-haven assets amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and expectations of further US interest rate cuts. Previously, the Ukraine-Russia war, the Gaza-Israel conflict, and US-imposed tariffs under President Donald Trump had driven gold prices to record highs.
APSGJA President Qasim Shikarpuri said the recent rise in gold prices was also influenced by Trump’s statements on imposing higher tariffs on European countries that opposed his demand to take control of Greenland, followed by retaliatory measures from those countries.
“Any settlement between European countries and the US on tariff issues may trigger a downward correction in world gold prices,” he said.
Mr Shikarpuri claimed that gold in the domestic market is being sold under cost at Rs517,000-518,000 per tola, compared to Rs524,162 announced by the association. Domestic rates are also lower by Rs25,000 per tola compared to Dubai prices.
“A sort of profit-selling is taking place, as some investors who purchased gold at Rs450,000-455,000 per tola are now selling the metal,” he said, adding that some investors are making fresh purchases in anticipation of further increases in world gold prices.
Mr Shikarpuri said the gold market appeared deserted as genuine jewellery buyers have been absent due to the meteoric rise in prices and affordability issues amid the rising cost of living. Currently, only investors are actively buying and selling gold in the market.

Consequently, the apex court overturned the decisions of the lower forum and dissolved a marriage on the grounds of “talaq” (divorce) instead of khula, since the husband had contracted a second marriage. The Supreme Court also ordered awarding the wife her full unpaid dower of Rs1.2 million through the executing family court.
“We have noted that where a wife expresses aversion, the family court dissolves the marriage on the grounds of khula and the wife is deprived of her dower,” observed Justice Musarrat Hilali in a five-page judgment on Friday.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the two-judge Supreme Court bench had taken up an appeal by Naila Javed against the June 30, 2025 Peshawar High Court (PHC) Abbottabad Bench’s maintaining of the dissolution of her marriage by the family court on the basis of khula, with a decree to forego her remaining dower as a condition of khula.

Apex court says granting khula without petitioner seeking it legally unsustainable

The Supreme Court emphasised that if the aversion was the outcome of some reasons, then dissolution should be based on those particular reasons. The courts should not, on their own motion and without the statement of the wife, convert the demand for divorce into khula.
Through her petition, Ms Javed contended that she never sought khula and that her case was rather based on the grounds pleaded under the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939 (DMMA). And, more importantly, her husband had contracted a second marriage without complying with the mandatory procedure under Section 6 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961 (MFLO). Thus, she was entitled to dissolution of marriage under Section 2(iiia) of the DMMA with full retention of her dower.
The judgement noted that the marital union was solemnised between the parties on Dec 16, 2013, but irreconcilable differences arose between them. Upon the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, the petitioner instituted a suit before the family court seeking a decree of dissolution of marriage on the grounds of cruelty, non-payment of the remaining dower, non-payment of maintenance, and that the respondent had contracted a second marriage during the pendency of the case without her permission.
The family court, however, did not rule on the merits of these pleaded grounds; instead, it concluded that the petitioner had failed to substantiate the allegations of cruelty and had expressed an unequivocal unwillingness to live with the respondent, the judgement observed.
Subsequently, the family court granted a decree of dissolution of marriage by way of khula, with a direction to the wife to relinquish her claim of outstanding dower.
During the hearing, the Supreme Court formulated a number of questions for consideration, namely whether the petitioner had discharged the burden of proof to establish her claim of cruelty, whether the court could exercise suo motu powers to convert the plaintiff’s claim for divorce into khula, and whether a wife’s averment of irreconcilable aversion towards her husband constituted a legally sufficient ground to initiate khula proceedings and relinquish dower.
The judgement said the petitioner did not plead for dissolution of marriage in her original suit. However, during the pendency of the suit, when the respondent contracted a second marriage without her permission, she sought dissolution of marriage.
Referring to the second marriage, the Supreme Court said Section 2(iiia) of the DMMA expressly provides that a woman is entitled to dissolution of marriage if the husband has contracted a second marriage in contravention of the MFLO.
Under Section 6 of the MFLO, contracting a second marriage without the written permission of the arbitration council constitutes a contravention, attracting both penal and civil consequences, including dissolution, the judgement noted.
In the present case, the respondent neither obtained the permission of the existing wife nor sought a declaration from the arbitration council. There is thus no dispute that the second marriage was contracted without obtaining the written permission of the council. This conclusively establishes a violation of the statutory ground under Section 2(iiia) of the DMMA, the judgement said.
The family court and the appellate court failed to adjudicate this ground despite its clear availability on the record, the judgement noted, adding that a lower court cannot convert a suit under the DMMA into one for khula in the absence of a clear and unequivocal statement by the wife. Thus, the concurrent judgements of the courts below granting khula without the petitioner seeking it are legally unsustainable, the Supreme Court held.

The alleged assaults took place in Cambridgeshire and Buckinghamshire between Dec 24 and 31 and were directed at two prominent supporters of the jailed former Pakistani prime minister. Counter-terrorism police took over the investigation from local forces, citing the deliberate and targeted nature of the incidents.
One of the victims, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, a former accountability adviser in Mr Khan’s cabinet, said he was brutally assaulted at his home after an attacker confirmed his identity. He told British media that he had been punched repeatedly and is now in hiding, fearing for his and his family’s safety.
On Friday, police confirmed that three British nationals had been charged. Karl Blackbird, 40, and Clark McAulay, 39, face charges of conspiracy to cause actual bodily harm in relation to separate incidents. A third man, Doneto Brammer, 21, has been charged in connection with the attack on Akbar’s home and faces additional charges, including possession of a prohibited weapon and conspiracy to commit arson.
All three appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Saturday.
Several other suspects have been arrested during coordinated raids across London, the Midlands and Essex and later released on bail. Police said the investigation remains ongoing and that detectives are keeping an open mind regarding motive and possible links between the attacks.

Police said a “clock/observation tower” near a residential home in Tangir Valley in Diamer collapsed on a house, resulting in the death of four members of a family and injuries to two other members.
Diamer Deputy Commissioner Ataur Rehman Kakar said heavy snowfall occurred in Tangir on Thursday, which might have caused the incident. According to police sources, the casualties could rise as the relief operation continued.

 

The Karakoram Highway (KKH), Baltistan Road, Ghizer–Shandur Road and other roads were opened to traffic on Saturday, while link roads in various areas of the region, including Astore, Skardu, Ghanche, Ghizer and Shigar, remained blocked.

Met office forecasts more rain, snow in parts of country

Due to the cold weather, people in Gilgit-Baltistan continued to face difficulties, which were compounded by road closures and electricity shortages. The GB government issued a travel advisory for tourists, stating that heavy snowfall had been recorded in Hunza, Nagar, Ghizer, Astore, Skardu, Shigar, Ghanche, Kharmang and Diamer.

 

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), meanwhile, predicted more rain and snowfall in various parts of the country till Tuesday. The advisory said that due to continuous snowfall, there was a risk that some roads in the upper and mountainous areas would be partially or completely closed. It asked tourists and residents to take precautions.
Zhob roof collapse
In Zhob, a child was killed and two sustained injuries in a roof-collapse incident, while more than six people were admitted to hospitals after accidents caused by slippery road conditions following snowfall.
In Quetta, the cold wave continued as Siberian winds lashed the provincial capital and other parts of northern and central Balochistan for the third day.

 

The sky was clear on Saturday, but the weather remained extremely cold amid low gas pressure, adding to people’s hardships. Business centres and roads in Quetta presented a deserted look as businesspeople and consumers preferred to stay indoors. Traffic was also thin.
LPG dealers, meanwhile, increased cylinder prices due to an increase in demand.
In order to provide relief, the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) announced the suspension of load-shedding in Quetta and the surrounding areas of the provincial capital for one week due to the severe cold weather, but people were not getting power supply in other cities of the province.
Due to the intense cold, water in pipelines froze in Quetta, Kalat, Chaman and Ziarat, leading to a shortage of drinking water in several areas. However, highways and inter-provincial roads that were blocked due to snow were opened by the local administration, but authorities asked people to check weather updates before travelling.
In many parts of the province, life had come to a standstill, particularly in Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Ziarat, Pishin, Toba Achakzai and other areas, as temperatures in the upper and Pak-Afghan border regions dropped to as low as minus 12 degrees Celsius.
The Met Office predicted that in the next 24 hours, more light and heavy rain was expected with icy winds in various districts, including Quetta, Kalat, Khuzdar, Chaman, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, Pishin, Naushki, Kharan, Sibi, Nasirabad, Kachhi, Washuk, Dalbandin and the coastal areas of Makran, while Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Pishin, Toba Kakari, Toba Achakzai and Kalat could receive snowfall.

GAZA CITY: Israeli forces on Saturday killed two Palestinian teenagers in a drone strike near Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, while another drone strike killed another Palestinian in Jabalia area, Gaza’s civil defence said.
The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue service under Hamas authority, said the drone strike killed the two teenagers near Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza.
The territory’s Al Shifa Hospital said it received the two bodies, adding they were two boys aged 13 and 15.
The Israeli military claimed the pair had posed an “immediate threat” to its soldiers.
Another fatality was also reported in a separate incident when an Israeli quadcopter struck a group of civilians in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, leaving one Palestinian dead, the civil defence agency said. It did not provide details on the person killed in that incident.
Israeli forces have killed at least 477 Palestinians in Gaza since the ceasefire took effect, according to Gaza’s health ministry.
Israeli media restrictions in Gaza and other areas mean casualty figures cannot be verified.
US envoys in Israel
Meanwhile, US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were in Israel on Saturday to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, mainly to discuss Gaza, two people briefed on the matter said.
The US on Thursday announced plans for a “New Gaza” rebuilt from scratch, to include residential towers, data centres and seaside resorts. The project forms part of President Donald Trump’s push to advance an October ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian group Hamas that has been shaken by repeated violations.
A spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister’s office confirmed that the meeting was planned but did not provide details.
US asks Italy to join Gaza force
In a related development, the US has asked Italy to join the International Stabilisation Force for Gaza as a founding member, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Triggered by heavy rainfall, it struck villages in Java’s West Bandung region in the early hours — at around 2.30am (1930 GMT Friday) — and buried residential areas.
Floods and landslides are common across the vast archipelago during the rainy season, which typically runs from October to March.
“There was a rumbling noise, like thunder,” Oyoh, a resident of Pasirlangu village who, like many Indonesians, only has one name, told AFP.
“It had been raining non-stop since the morning, and then it [the landslide] happened. I immediately felt scared.”

Triggered by heavy rainfall, it struck villages in Java’s West Bandung region

The 52-year-old had been evacuated to the village’s government office along with dozens of others, mainly women and children.
She said her house survived the landslide, but her niece, her niece’s husband and their two children were missing.
Abdul Muhari, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, confirmed that eight people were killed and 82 were unaccounted for.
West Bandung’s mayor Jeje Ritchie Ismail told reporters that the military, police and volunteers were assisting in the search.
However, he warned that the terrain was extremely difficult and the ground remained unstable.
The local search and rescue agency said it was conducting manual excavation, spraying the soil with water pumps and using drones to search for the victims.
Forest loss
The disaster comes after tropical storms and intense monsoon rains late last year triggered flooding and landslides that killed around 1,200 people and displaced more than 240,000 in Indonesia’s Sumatra island, according to official figures.
Environmentalists, experts and the government have pointed to the role forest loss played in the flooding and landslides that washed torrents of mud into villages.
Forests help absorb rainfall and stabilise the ground held by their roots, and their absence makes areas more prone to flash flooding and landslides, David Gaveau, founder of conservation start-up The TreeMap, told AFP in December.
Indonesia lost more than 240,000 hectares of primary forest in 2024, according to analysis by The TreeMap’s Nusantara Atlas project.
It is regularly among the countries with the largest annual forest loss as mining, plantations and fires have caused the clearance of large tracts of lush vegetation in recent decades, NGOs have said.
The government filed multiple lawsuits following the Sumatra floods, seeking more than $200 million in damages against six firms.
It also stripped more than two dozen permits this week from forestry, mining and hydroelectric companies in Sumatra.
This month, torrential rains battered Indonesia’s Siau island, causing a flash flood that killed at least 16 people.

• Both sides discuss cooperation in law enforcement, extradition and criminal justice
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Somalia on Saturday signed an agreement abolishing visa requirements for diplomatic passports holders of both countries.
The agreement was signed at the Presidency by Hamza Adan Haadoow, Permanent Secretary of Somalia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and Dawood Muhammad Baraech, Special Secretary at Pakistan’s Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control.
President Asif Ali Zardari witnessed the signing ceremony and later met Somalia’s Interior Minister Ali Yousuf, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening bilateral engagement. President Zardari said Africa was an important part of the world’s geopolitical landscape and that Pakistan sought to enhance its ties with African states, including Somalia.
He added that Pakistan valued its engagement with Somalia and supported closer collaboration in areas of shared interest. The president was informed that the visit by the Somali interior minister marked the first official bilateral visit from Somalia to Pakistan in 35 years.
Emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to regional and international efforts against transnational crime and narcotics trafficking, the president said broader geopolitical developments and opportunities for bilateral cooperation were also discussed during the meeting.
The Somali interior minister thanked the government of Pakistan, especially the Ministry of Interior, for the warm hospitality extended to him and his delegation. He said he was visiting Pakistan on the invitation of his Pakistani counterpart and conveyed his appreciation to the president and the people of Pakistan.
Mr Ali Yousuf also handed over a letter from the president of Somalia to President Zardari, conveying greetings and good wishes and reaffirming Somalia’s desire to further deepen bilateral ties.
He described Pakistan as a reliable partner and brotherly country since Somalia’s independence, recalling the sacrifices of Pakistani peacekeepers during UN missions in Somalia in the 1990s, where Pakistani personnel laid down their lives while serving under the United Nations flag.
During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on enhancing cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice. Discussions included the feasibility of negotiating a bilateral extradition treaty and the legal frameworks governing extradition in both countries.
The possibility of initiating talks on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters and the transfer of sentenced persons was also explored. The two sides further discussed cooperation in counter-narcotics efforts, including collaboration against drug trafficking and organised crime, information and intelligence sharing, as well as capacity building and training.
President Zardari was informed that Pakistan had offered assistance through the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), in advanced identity management, civil registration and secure documentation systems, as well as training for the Somali police force.
Federal Minister for Interior and Narcotics Control Mohsin Raza Naqvi and Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Talal Chaudhry were also present at the meeting. Other members of the Somali delegation included Sheikhnur Mohamed Hassan, Ambassador of Somalia to Pakistan, and Osman Abdullahi, Deputy Police Chief.

ISLAMABAD: The Privatisation Commission announced on Saturday that the outsourcing operation for the country’s three major airports — Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi — will move to an open bidding mode following a high level of interest from various investors.
The commission said the shift from a government-to-government (G2G) mode to open bidding aims to generate a competitive process wherein all domestic and foreign investors will have a level playing field to participate in the bidding process.
According to a commission statement, the envisaged competitive process priorities inclusivity by welcoming participation from all eligible entities, including those from partner nations, while affording equal opportunities to local and foreign investors.
This approach is designed to promote transparency and fair competition, deliver the most advantageous results for Pakistan’s economy and reinforce relationships with international partners, the commission said.
The government has been actively considering options for Islamabad International Airport, Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport and Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport through appropriate modes, including management contracts and long-term commercial concessions.
As part of this strategy, the Islamabad airport has been included in the active privatisation program, consistent with the ongoing process for the airports at Karachi and Lahore.
This follows constructive dialogue with entities from partner nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia, as well as other international stakeholders.
The commission noted that the primary objectives are to enhance efficiency, improve service delivery, maximise revenue generation, upgrade infrastructure and attract private sector investments. These efforts align with the nation’s economic vision to cultivate collaboration to modernise the aviation sector.
Roosevelt Hotel
Separately, the Privatisation Com­m­ission has invited technical and financial proposals for the appointment of a financial adviser for the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, aiming to secure a joint venture for mixed-use development of the elite Manhattan property owned by the Pakistan government.
According to the commission’s website, proposals can be submitted by Feb 16. The government intends for the transaction regarding the Roosevelt Hotel to be completed in one year.

 

The commission intends to offer the property for setting up a joint venture project through the “best suited transaction structure and mode of privatisation”.
The appointed financial adviser will be tasked with conducting market sounding to validate investor interest in the hotel.
The adviser must identify potentially interested parties and assess the level of interest in the transaction structure options covered in the transaction structure report and recommendations of the earlier financial adviser.
Additionally, the financial adviser will develop and implement an effective marketing strategy with the approval of the Privatisation Commission.
This includes developing and implementing a plan for introducing the Roosevelt’s site and projecting its image to bolster its value, “enabling expression of interest in the property from prospective investors”.
The adviser will also be required to arrange meetings with potential investors in order to develop a better understanding of investor profiles and the investment climate.
Located in midtown on Madison Avenue, the Roosevelt Hotel is the only real estate entity on the government’s privatisation program.
The 19-storey property is considered among the elite hotels in Manhattan, comprising 1,025 rooms with a covered area of over 600,000 square feet. It is wholly owned by PIA Investments Ltd (PIAIL), which is owned and managed by the Pakistan government.

The soaring deficit was mainly due to a decline in Pakistan’s overall exports to regional countries, led by a drop in shipments to China, followed by Afghanistan and Bangla­desh. Pakistan has suspended all kinds of trade, including exports, with Afghanistan since Oct 10, 2025. 
In percentage terms, exports to India increased marginally, but in value terms, it is negligible. The shipments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka registered negative growth during the period under review, according to the latest data compiled by the State Bank. 
In FY25, the trade deficit with these nine neighbouring countries widened by 29.42pc to $12.297bn, up from $9.502bn in the preceding year.
The value of exports to Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives dipped 18.56pc to $1.965bn in July-December FY26 from $2.413bn over the same period last year. Contrary to this, imports surged 24.76pc to $9.648bn in 6MFY26 from $7.733bn over the same period last year. Imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the preceding year. 
Imports from China grew by 25.61pc to $9.472bn in 6MFY26 from $7.541bn over the same period last year. The bulk of imports in the region is sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh. 
Exports to China fell by 5.59pc to $1.216bn in 6MFY26 from $1.288bn over the same period last year. Imports from India dipped by 12.73pc to $97.734m in 6MFY26 from $111.991m over the last year. In FY25, imports from India increased to $220.58m from $206.89m over the last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $2.926m in 6MFY26, up from $0.399m over the last year. 
Exports to Afghanistan dipped 56.61pc to $219.489m in 6MFY26 from $505.818m last year. Imports stood at $6.321m in 6MFY26 against $9.994m in FY25, a drop of 36.75pc. 
Exports to Bangladesh declined by 7.54pc to $358.499m in 6MFY26 from $387.772m over the last year. In FY25, exports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m from $661.19m.

“The government is promoting a cashless economy, and executive orders have made QR codes mandatory in Islamabad and provincial regions, requiring every retail outlet to provide at least one digital payment option,” the state minister said on Saturday. 
He was speaking at a policy discussion organised by the Institute for  Public Opinion Research (IPOR) to present findings from its nationwide  study titled Track and Trace Compliance in the Tobacco Industry-Volume  II. 
The minister added that all retailers and merchants have been  instructed to adopt digital payment methods. He said federal and  provincial authorities were working on legislation to support the  initiative, which aims to formalise the economy and strengthen the  “Cashless Pakistan” programme. 
The study revealed significant  regulatory gaps in compliance with the Federal Board of Revenue’s Track and Trace System (TTS). 
Speaking about the IPOR study, Mr  Kiani emphasised the government’s commitment to enforcing the TTS in the  tobacco sector during the seminar. “The government will intensify  crackdown on illegal cigarette brands and focus on enforcing regulations  in the tobacco retail market,” he added. 
The minister clarified that  action would not be taken against retailers selling legal brands, but  non-compliant brands would be brought within the legal framework, and  monitoring and enforcement in the sector would be enhanced. 
He said retail outlets fall under the jurisdiction of provincial governments, which have the authority to take action against sellers of illegal cigarettes. “Warehouses and transportation channels in the tobacco sector are also being monitored, and strengthening enforcement is expected to improve compliance with laws and increase revenue,” he said.

Karachi Port handled a record 54 million tonnes of cargo, while average vessel dwell time was reduced by 24 to 36 hours through closer coordination among port authorities, customs and other agencies, achieving an average turnaround of five days in line with regional benchmarks.  
Cost-cutting measures delivered substantial savings. Reduced overtime at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) saved about Rs70 million per month, while the abolition of 2,152 re­­d­undant posts across maritime entities lowered human resource costs by billions of rupees.  
The first bunkering facilities were also established at Karachi Port and Port Qasim, expected to save foreign exchange and attract transshipment traffic. The KPT and Port Qasim Authority reclaimed around 150 acres of encroached land, valued at roughly Rs110 billion.  
Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry said a central element of the overhaul was the finalisation of the National Maritime Policy, which brings shipping, ports, fisheries and maritime security under a single framework to guide sustainable growth.  
“The government also approved a National Shipping Policy aimed at expanding the Pakistan-flagged fleet to reduce reliance on foreign carriers, a longstanding drain on foreign exchange,” he added. He said stakeholder con­­s­ultations had been co­­mpleted on the Natio­n­­al Fisheries and Aquacul­ture Policy, which targets annual seafood exports of $2 billion and the creation of around two million jobs across coastal communities and allied industries.  
At the deep-sea port of Gwadar, 72 acres of free-zone land were handed over to operators, while bids were invited for an off-dock terminal on 100 acres to attract transit trade from Central Asia and beyond.

The man, who has not been identified, was armed with a handgun and two magazines, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.







Meanwhile, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said the man was a 37-year-old city resident who was believed to be a US citizen. He did not release the name of the man, who he said was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record.
A video circulating on social media and aired on cable news stations showed people wearing masks and tactical vests wrestling with the  man on a snow-covered street before shots are heard. In the video, the man falls to the ground, and several more shots are heard.
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called for an immediate end to the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement operations in the state.
“I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning,” Walz wrote on social media platform X.
“This is sickening. The president must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.”







Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Saturday called on US President Donald Trump to end the sweeping immigration crackdown in the northern city after the shooting.
“I just saw a video of more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents and shooting him to death,” Frey told a press conference.
“To President Trump: this is a moment to act like a leader. Put Minneapolis, put America first in this moment — let’s achieve peace. Let’s end this operation.”
Tina Smith, a Democratic US senator from Minnesota, called the shooting “catastrophic.”
Minneapolis officials urged calm as the incident is investigated. Video from the area showed immigration agents deploying tear gas on a growing crowd of onlookers.
“We ask the public to remain calm and avoid the immediate area,” a post by the City of Minneapolis read.

Bangladesh had announced on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had “formally requested” the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka, which the council had rejected. However, Bangladesh had insisted it would not travel to India for the tournament.
In the statement posted on its website on Saturday, the ICC stated that the decision was made in the absence of “any credible or verifiable security threat” to the Bangladesh national team in India.
“Scotland has been called up to take Bangladesh’s place in Group C, joining England, Italy, Nepal and the West Indies,” the ICC announced.
The ICC noted that Scotland, ranked the 14th-highest T20 team in the world, was selected since they were the next-highest ranked team after Bangladesh.
The statement further said that the governing body rejected the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) request to move their matches from India to Sri Lanka, who are co-hosts of the tournament.
“Independent security assessments were conducted from internal and external experts,” the statement read.
“The [ICC] Board made the difficult decision that it was not feasible to meet the BCB’s requests so close to the tournament,” the ICC stated.
“The decision follows an extensive process undertaken by the ICC to address concerns raised by the BCB regarding the hosting of its scheduled matches in India,” it said.
Engagement between the ICC and the BCB took place over more than three weeks, the statement outlined, adding that multiple rounds of dialogue were conducted “in a transparent and constructive manner” with meetings held both via video link and in person.
“As part of this process, the ICC reviewed the concerns cited by the BCB, commissioned and considered independent security assessments from internal and external experts, and shared detailed security and operational plans covering federal and state arrangements, as well as enhanced and escalating security protocols for the event,” the statement added.
“These assurances were reiterated at several stages, including during discussions involving the ICC Business Corporation (IBC) Board. The ICC’s assessments concluded that there was no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team, officials or supporters in India,” it stated.
Based on the findings, cricket’s governing body determined that it was “not appropriate” to amend or change the tournament’s schedule.
Furthermore, the statement added that following a meeting on Wednesday, the BCB was granted 24 hours to confirm its participation in India as scheduled.
“As no confirmation was received within the deadline, the ICC proceeded in line with its established governance and qualification processes to identify a replacement team,” it added.
Naqvi rues unfair treatment of Bangladesh
Earlier in the day, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.
Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, made the remarks while speaking to the media in Lahore.
In his media talk, Naqvi said that the PCB’s stance on the situation would be according to the government of Pakistan’s instructions.







“Bangladesh has been treated unfairly. I said the same in the board meeting of the ICC. You cannot have double standards, where one country can make whatever decision whenever and do the total opposite for another country.
“That is why we have taken the stand that Bangladesh is being treated unfairly and should be allowed to play the World Cup in any case. They are a major stakeholder and this injustice should not be done.”
Asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup, he said the government of Pakistan would make the decision. “We are waiting for the prime minister to return,” he said, adding that a final decision would be taken then.
He was also asked whether he would suggest to the ICC a hybrid model for Bangladesh, similar to the one between Pakistan and India.
“The thing is that Bangladesh is the same member as Pakistan. And our stance is that if you have done this favour with Pakistan and India, then you should do the same with Bangladesh,” he said.
“The main reason for this is that one country cannot dictate another. And if this dictation is attempted, then Pakistan definitely has its own stance,” he said.
Asked whether there was a “Plan B” for a scenario in which Pakistan would also not play the T20 World Cup, he quipped, “Let the decision come first; we have Plan A, B, C, D.”</p><small>2026-01-24 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/242227598960fb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968805/federal-cabinet-gave-the-nod-for-joining-trump-led-board-of-peace-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Federal cabinet gave the nod for joining Trump-led Board of Peace: PM</strong></a><br><p>LONDON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that the federal cabinet had approved Pakistan joining the Board of Peace, which is led by US President Donald Trump.
A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — had gathered on stage on Thursday with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, to put their names to the founding charter of the body.
Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, the Board of Peace’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts.
Speaking to the media outside the Pakistan High Commission in London on Saturday, the premier said that he had a “very good trip” to Davos.
He said that Pakistan had received an invitation from Trump to join the Board of Peace, adding that he accepted with the approval of the cabinet.
“We signed with the hope that there will be peace in Gaza, that Palestinians will receive the respect they deserve, and that Gaza will be reconstructed,” the premier said.
PM Shehbaz said the humanitarian situation in Gaza required urgent international attention and reiterated Pakistan’s long-standing position in support of Palestinian rights.
The premier also highlighted his meeting with International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Kristalina Georgieva, describing it as positive.
He did not share details of the discussion but said Pakistan would continue to engage constructively with international financial institutions as it works to stabilise its economy.
Commenting on regional security, PM Shehbaz said he had thanked Mr Trump for what he described as his role in “saving millions of lives in South Asia by ending the India-Pakistan war”, without elaborating further.
Meanwhile, the prime minister’s aide, Rana Sanaullah, also said on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ that the federal cabinet had endorsed the decision to join the Board of Peace.
“There was much discussion on this and the cabinet endorsed it. After the cabinet’s endorsement, the prime minister accepted this [invitation],” he said.
“The development happened in the past week to 10 days. Based on this, the government signed after consultations with the cabinet. I know this, I was in that consultation,” he said.



The decision to join the board was criticised, with politicians and analysts saying that the decision was “unwise” and Pakistan had “jumped the gun”.
In response, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry had defended the move in the National Assembly, saying the country joined the body meant to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding in the interest of the Palestinian people.
The issue was also raised during a joint sitting of Parliament on Friday, with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman claiming the decision was taken because of the “fear of Trump”.
The government had again defended the move, with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal saying that Pakistan being at the “centre stage” along with its brother Muslim countries to contribute towards peace in Gaza and Palestine was a “diplomatic win”.</p><small>2026-01-24 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647006-pakistan-navy-conducts-medical-evacuation-of-sri-lankan-national-on-high-seas' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy conducts medical evacuation of Sri Lankan national on high seas</strong></a><br><p>

A statement by the navy said that PNS ships Tabuk and Moawin successfully conducted the medical evacuation of a Sri Lankan national requiring “urgent medical attention” on an Indonesian-flagged merchant vessel (MV) Grey Palm.
​”The operation was initiated following a formal request from [the] Sri Lankan Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) for [the] provision of medical assistance to a Sri Lankan national crew member in critical condition onboard MV Grey Palm, positioned 800 nautical miles (approximately 1,500 kilometres) from Pakistan’s coast,” the statement said.







The Pakistan Navy dispatched its ships as first responders and evacuated the Sri Lankan crew member along with an attendant, it said. Subsequently, the patient was immediately provided with the necessary treatment aboard the navy vessel, it added.
“The Sri Lankan authorities and family of the individual thanked Pakistan for [the] prompt response and support,” the statement said.
“​The successful medical evacuation is yet another testament to operational readiness and [the] longstanding commitment of Pakistan for the safety of life at sea, irrespective of nationality.”
President Asif Ali Zardari praised the rescue operation, which took place 1,500 km off the coast of Gwadar, according to a statement from the Presidency.
Paying tribute to the two vessels and their crews for their professionalism and prompt response, President Zardari was quoted as saying, “Pakistan Navy has fulfilled its international responsibilities by transcending nationality to protect human life at sea.”</p><small>2026-01-24 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24171631cff4bcf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968788/day-after-dramatic-arrest-imaan-and-hadi-handed-jail-sentence-in-controversial-social-media-posts-case' target='_blank'><strong>Day after dramatic arrest, Imaan and Hadi handed jail sentence in controversial social media posts case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A sessions court on Saturday sentenced lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her spouse Hadi Ali Chattha to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case pertaining to social media posts.
The lawyer couple were already on judicial remand at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail after they were arrested in Islamabad in connection with a separate case on Friday.
The written order by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka stated that the “prosecution has been able to prove its case against both the accused” under sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism), 26-A (false and fake information) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
Hence, under Peca’s Section 9, Imaan and Hadi were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for five years each with a fine of Rs5 million each. If they failed to pay, the two will have to spend one more year of jail.
Under Section 10 of Peca, they were each handed 10 years of rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs30m each, with an additional two years for each for failure to pay.
Lastly, the couple were sentenced to two years’ rigorous imprisonment each under Section 26-A of Peca with a fine of Rs1m each. The failure to pay the fine will result in being jailed six months each.
The sentences will run concurrently.
The order noted that the convicts were “present in custody in some other case on video link”, adding that they be kept in jail to undergo their sentences.
The court gave both the benefit of Section 382-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which allows the period of detention to be considered as part of the sentence.
In his judgment, Judge Majoka recalled Sub-inspector Sharooz Riaz’s August 2025 complaint that Imaan “consistently disseminated highly offensive, misleading and anti-state contents on social media”, with the “active connivance” of Hadi.
“She propagated a narrative that aligned with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations and individuals. Her contents incited ethnic hatred, undermined public trust on state organisations and portrayed the armed forces are behind terrorism and forced disappearances.”
The order observed that Imaan’s tweets made between 2021 and 2025 from “portrayed the agenda” of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Judge Majoka stated: “Both the accused persons are advocates by profession and they have fully knowledge that the [sic] Pakistan is not included in the list of terrorist states but they have intentionally in their tweets mentioned the [sic] Pakistan as a terrorist state, which in fact is the agenda of BLA, TTP.”
“Both the accused persons portrayed the armed forces as being responsible for the act of terrorism in the country and alleged that the state and its institutions are working in collusion with the proscribed individuals and organisations,” the judgment read.
“I found both the accused persons have been fully involved in the commission of an offence punishable under sections 9,10,11/26-A Peca, 2016,” Judge Majoka observed.
The order further noted, “During the course of inquiry, it came to light that accused persons are involved in the propagation and dissemination of narratives aligned with the proscribed individuals/organisations.
“The content, including tweets, re-tweets, shared and uploaded by the accused persons, expressed solidarity and support for the proscribed organisations (BLA, TTP and Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement) and proscribed individuals (Mahrang Baloch, Ali Wazir and Manzoor Pashteen).”

 

The judgment referred to five prosecution witnesses produced before the court, including National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) Reporting Centre Assistant Director Imran Haider and Riaz.
While mentioning X posts made by Imaan in favour of Mahrang or the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), the order noted that several of them had been reposted by Hadi.
The court did “not agree” with the arguments of the defence counsel that the mere view of the accused about any proscribed individual was not enough to determine them guilty of committing an offence under Section 9 of Peca.
The judge stressed that glorification has been defined in Peca as including “any form of praise or celebration” of proscribed organisations or individuals or groups.
“The said tweets of the accused persons damaged public trust in state institutions, especially law-enforcement agencies and the armed forces, and blamed the state for terrorism and enforced disappearances,” the order stated.
“The matter does not rest here. Imaan Zainab Mazari accused claimed that the state runs torture cells and that dehumanisation, alienation and uncalled for crackdown/violence are the state-standard response to peaceful Baloch voice,” it further highlighted, declaring her as guilty under Section 10 of Peca.
Regarding the charge for spreading false information, the order noted: “There was no proof with the accused that the state has forcibly disappeared any person but despite that, in number of tweets they claimed that the state is responsible for it.”
Earlier on Saturday, the couple briefly appeared via video link before Majoka’s court in Islamabad. However, court proceedings were disrupted when the couple boycotted the hearing, following which the court reserved its order.
Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday prompted criticism by rights bodies, politicians, and journalists, who stressed the couple’s right to a fair trial.
Amnesty International noted the “lack of adherence to due process” and said these were “retaliatory cases aimed solely at silencing Imaan and Hadi for their human rights work and dissent”.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also condemned the arrests, terming the case a “tool to harass, intimidate and ultimately muzzle dissent”.







‘Totally illegal’
Imaan’s mother Shireen Mazari, a former human rights minister, reacted to the sentencing by terming it “totally illegal”.
“Their [transfer application] is still pending in [Islamabad High Court] so legally judge cannot pass judgment till [transfer application] is heard,” Mazari contended.







In another post, she said: “They got their pound of flesh [through] an order passed illegally but the emasculated men don’t give a damn. It was always about ‘off with their heads’.”







On the other hand, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar hailed the verdict, quipping on X: “As you sow, so shall you reap!
“The first official and final result of Peca. One should fear God,” he added.







Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, Rana Sanaullah, the prime minister’s adviser on political affairs, refuted the claims that the trial was unfair.
“They were given multiple chances for cross-examination and they insulted the court several times,” he said.
“The thing is, I respect Imaan as a lawyer and see her as a daughter or younger sister. But these opinions and this attitude … these people curse the uniform and the people who sacrifice their lives for this country. Nobody should go to these lengths, nor should they be allowed to,” he said.
Sanaullah also highlighted Imaan’s stance against the government and her criticism of constitutional amendments and “efforts to curtail judicial independence”, adding that she was free to express these views.
“If she wants to criticise or curse the government, she is free to do so. But when we are picking up the bodies of martyrs every day, then these people should at least consider the circumstances,” he stated.
When questioned about the fairness of the trial, Sanaullah replied that claims that the trial was unfair were “not facts”, adding that he personally enquired about the rights extended to the couple during the process.
Today’s hearing
At the start of the hearing on Saturday, the court sought compliance with earlier directions regarding the production of the accused for cross-examination, which the court had declared as the final opportunity in light of orders issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Citing security concerns, police submitted a report stating that it would take five to six hours to transport the accused from jail and requested permission for them to appear through a video link. The court accepted the request and directed that Imaan and Hadi be presented via video link.
However, technical issues, including internet connectivity problems at Adiala jail, delayed the proceedings. After a brief adjournment, Imaan and Hadi finally appeared before the court via video link.

 

When the judge asked whether the defence wished to begin cross-examination, Imaan questioned whether media representatives were present in the courtroom.
She then alleged that both she and her husband were being subjected to mistreatment in custody, adding that they were not being provided food or water.
Imaan addressed the judge directly, saying, “You are doing your job … everything is happening because of you.”
The incarcerated lawyer then announced that both she and her husband were boycotting the proceedings.
In response, Judge Majoka asked whether they no longer wished to participate in the trial and advised them to wait for the verdict. Despite this, both the accused left their seats before the conclusion of the hearing, effectively refusing to take part in further proceedings.
Following the boycott, the judge directed the court staff to record the entire proceedings and place them on the judicial record.
Defence counsel Ashraf Gujjar later moved a request for summoning a person relevant to the case. The judge noted that the individual had already appeared online and stated that the entire record would be reviewed.
Subsequently, Judge Majoka announced that he would pass a written order on the defence request and reserved the decision, while the trial remained pending.
The case
The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA in Islamabad.
The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the BLA and TTP.
Judge Majoka issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025.
Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.

 

Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them.
Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.
Separately, earlier this week, a case related to a protest by the BYC and dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo. The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case.
Separately, on Friday, Imaan and Hadi were arrested by the police in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025. They were then sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.</p><small>2026-01-24 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2420224151a7987.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968803/local-govts-continue-to-be-neglected-despite-crucial-role-in-strengthening-grassroots-politics-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Local govts continue to be neglected despite crucial role in strengthening grassroots politics: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday stated that despite their role in strengthening grassroots politics, local governments continued to be neglected by political parties, which had ultimately weakened civilian rule.
The defence minister made the remarks while addressing a panel session titled “Devolution for Revolution” at ThinkFest, a political and literary festival.
Also present alongside the minister were Lahore University of Management Sciences’ (LUMS) Vice Chancellor Ali Cheema, former State Bank governor Dr Ishrat Hussain and former MPA Mary James Gill.
In his remarks, Asif said that three military rulers — Ayub Khan, Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf — had remained in power longer than any civilian government largely because they introduced local government systems and drew political strength from them.
He admitted that the failure to institutionalise local bodies was “a political failure on our part”.
He noted that local government elections, whenever held, had historically been far less controversial than national polls.
“Yet we have continued to avoid them,” he regretted.







Asif recalled that local bodies were included in the Charter of Democracy signed by the PPP and the PML-N in 2006, but the provision failed to find adequate space in the 18th Constitutional Amendment even though most other agreed reforms were incorporated.
He added that the resistance to empowering the grassroots tier mainly came from the bureaucracy, which feared losing authority to elected representatives.
Expanding on the discussion, Cheema highlighted the administrative and service delivery dimensions of local governments.
While Asif focused on their political and democratic value, Cheema said their real strength lied in defining the state’s delivery system.
Citing international examples, he said the United Kingdom spent nearly 60 per cent of its development funds through local governments, while the United States allocated around 40 per cent.
“This is how they achieved the so-called municipal revolution,” he said.
Cheema said that in developed countries, local governments provided essential services such as clean water, sanitation, health facilities and civic infrastructure, while also collecting taxes and strengthening citizens’ sense of ownership.







“In Pakistan, unfortunately, this institutional infrastructure was never built,” Cheema said.
“When the system is missing, the sense of citizenship also remains weak,” he said.
The discussion then shifted to constitutional and fiscal reforms, with Dr Hussain pointing out that although the 18th Amendment clearly defined the roles of federal and provincial governments, it failed to properly outline the functions and powers of local governance.
“This ambiguity continues to create political and administrative friction,” he said, adding that the Amendment should have established a provincial finance commission to directly channel funds to underdeveloped areas within provinces.
Strong local governments, he argued, would not only improve development efficiency but could also “generate their own revenue by improving tax collection and identifying new income sources”.
Dr Hussain pointed out that if institutions such as the Lahore Development Authority, the Water and Sanitation Agency and other civic bodies were placed under the authority of an elected mayor, municipal administrations would become financially stronger and self-sustaining.
Advising political parties to embrace rather than compete with local governments, Dr Hussain said empowering the grassroots tier would ultimately strengthen democratic governance and benefit mainstream politics.
Meanwhile, Gill stated that local bodies gave identity and dignity to people at the grassroots level.
The defence minister has previously emphasised that local governments need to be empowered, stating earlier this week that the “dispersal of power actually multiplies power” and “concentration of power diminishes it”.
“Empowering local governments means taking the government to the common man’s doorstep,” he said in a post on X.
The defence minister contended that when a local government system becomes functional, “people will not be dependent on bureaucracy and will be able to elect empowered representatives and institutions through their vote”.
The remarks had come a day after he called for a “meaningful” constitutional amendment to introduce an empowered local government system in the country.</p><small>2026-01-24 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646933-parliament-passes-bill-criminalising-second-marriage-divorce-threats-against-wife' target='_blank'><strong>Parliament passes bill criminalising 'second marriage, divorce threats' against wife</strong></a><br><p>

“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.







“If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100pc Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the USA.”
Carney during a recent visit to China called the Asian superpower a “reliable and predictable partner” and in Davos encouraged European leaders to seek investment from the world’s second-largest economy.
Trump suggested that China would try to use Canada to evade US tariffs.
“If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.”
Tensions between the U.S. and its northern neighbour have grown in recent days.
Trump on Thursday withdrew an invitation for Canada to join his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts.
That about-face followed Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he openly decried powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.</p><small>2026-01-24 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/24193155f82ec67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968800/snow-heavy-rain-kill-61-in-three-days-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Snow, heavy rain kill 61 in three days in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Snow and heavy rain have killed 61 people in Afghanistan in the past three days, disaster officials said on Saturday, with a major road and power also cut in several provinces.
The deaths occurred mainly in central and northern provinces between Wednesday and Friday, according to a map released by Afghanistan’s disaster management authority (ANDMA).
The “initial figures of casualties and destruction” also include 110 injured people and 458 houses that were either partially or fully destroyed, ANDMA said on social media platform X.







A total of 360 families were affected, said a spokesman who asked people in a video message to avoid unnecessary travel on snowy roads.
The spokesman also told AFP that most of the casualties were caused by roof collapses and avalanches, while many also died from frostbite in sub-zero temperatures.
The emergency department in the southern province of Kandahar said six children were killed when the roof of their home collapsed in strong wind and heavy rain on Wednesday.
Houses were also damaged in other districts.
Major highway cut
The Salang highway, one of Afghanistan’s main roads, has been closed, authorities in Parwan province north of Kabul said. The highway is a vital connection to Afghanistan’s northern provinces.
Food supplies were also distributed to travellers stuck on a mountain pass in central Bamyan province, west of the capital.
A transmission line importing electricity from Uzbekistan was also damaged on Thursday, leaving households in almost 12 provinces without power.
“The technical teams are ready but cannot reach the area because of the blockage of Salang pass,” said Mohammad Sadiq, the spokesman for Afghanistan’s national power utility DABS.
The heavy snow and rain also destroyed shops and killed livestock in different parts of the predominantly rural country.
“Snow and rain, when managed properly, contribute positively to Afghanistan’s environment and livelihoods,” the Kabul Times daily wrote in an editorial.
“However, without sufficient preparation and timely intervention, these natural phenomena can quickly turn into sources of tragedy,” it said.
Around half of Afghanistan’s population of more than 40 million people will need humanitarian assistance this year, according to the United Nations, after a sharp drop in foreign assistance in recent years.
Natural disasters such as earthquakes and drought also often compound the daily struggle to survive.</p><small>2026-01-24 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647003-attack-on-adil-raja-shahzad-akbar-planned-in-chat-group-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Attack on Adil Raja, Shahzad Akbar planned in chat group: sources</strong></a><br><p>

The decision came during a meeting between US Charge de’ Affaires Natalie Baker and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi. According to a handout by the interior ministry, a detailed discussion was held on Pakistan–US relations and increasing cooperation in areas of mutual interest.
Talks were also held on preventing illegal immigration and the effectiveness of the pre-immigration clearance system, the statement said.
It added that an agreement was reached on increasing cooperation between law enforcement agencies, with a particular focus on police training.
“The meeting decided that joint action will be taken against false and fraudulent visa networks under comprehensive SOPs,” the handout stated.
Naqvi was quoted as saying that a zero-tolerance policy had been adopted against the “agent mafia” and welcomed cooperation with Washington in this sector.
“I am personally supervising action against fraudulent visa networks,” he stated. He said security features had been added to passports using modern technology, making the travel document “foolproof”.
The interior minister noted that illegal immigration had become a serious issue and acknowledged Washington’s full-scale crackdown against those who enter the US illegally.
“Due to the government’s effective measures, there has been a 47 per cent drop in illegal immigration,” Naqvi said.
There will be no leniency for the elements involved in fraudulent documentation networks, he said.
Meanwhile, Baker was quoted as saying that the US attached “special importance” its relationship with Pakistan.
“Our priorities are aligned and promoting mutual cooperation will further strengthen relations,” she was quoted as saying.</p><small>2026-01-24 12:12</small></div><hr>
