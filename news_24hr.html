She made the remarks while addressing a press conference alongside Finance Minister Muhammad Aurganzeb in Islamabad. At the outset of the press conference, Aurangzeb said the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) had approved the recommendations of the Spectrum Advisory Committee.
In her remarks, Khawaja said that the recommendations would now be taken to the federal cabinet.
“After that, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) will issue an information memorandum based on which consultations and negotiations will be held with stakeholders and the telecom sector,” she said.
“We are trying to ensure that the auction is completed by the end of January or early February,” she added. Explaining the significance of the development, she said that the internet quality in Pakistan was not at par with international best practices or even the quality in the region.
“The major reason for this is that the spectrum is not available in Pakistan,” she said. The IT minister said that Pakistan’s population of 240 million was operating on a spectrum of 274 MHz.
“This means we are using two lanes for traffic which requires eight, which is why there is congestion, your internet does not work and you face challenges,” she said. “For that reason, the spectrum auction is being carried out.”
She said that during auctions held in the past, around 60MHz of spectrum was acquired. She said that the government was going to auction 600 MHz, making it the largest-ever.
The IT minister said that during the auction, additional bands were being auctioned in Pakistan for the first time, which meant that for consumers, not only 3G and 4G quality would improve, but it would also ensure the rollout of 5G services.
She said the PTA would ensure that all these rollouts would be completed between four to six months of the auction so that services could “visibly” improve after this period.
She said that the government was making efforts to ensure that 5G services would roll out after six months.
The minister stressed that the internet was integral to the government’s digitisation efforts as part of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act, 2025.
“According to Connect 2030 — which the prime minister will inaugurate soon — we will ensure that over the next five years the minimum connectivity available to users should 100 Mbps.“
In November, the consultant for the 5G spectrum auction presented its report to the government, which had remained stalled due to the merger of PTCL and Telenor and litigation over the 2600MHz band.
The report, prepared by US-based consultancy firm National Economic Research Associates (NERA), noted that Pakistan was offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands: 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz and 3500MHz.
The 2600MHz band was considered the most suitable for 5G.
The report also outlined key policy recommendations, including auction design, methodology, base price, duration and other terms and conditions.</p><small>2025-12-23 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23113054bf2889c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962791/three-bids-received-for-privatisation-of-national-carrier-pia' target='_blank'><strong>Three bids received for privatisation of national carrier PIA</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Three bids have been received for the privatisation of loss-making national airline Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) — the country’s most high-profile transaction of a state-owned entity.
The sealed bids, submitted on Tuesday morning, came from pre-qualified bidders Lucky Cement, private airline Airblue and investment firm Arif Habib.
Representatives of the bidding groups walked in one by one to deposit sealed offers into a transparent box, briefly fumbling as they pushed envelopes through the slot in a public ceremony in Islamabad that was broadcast on state television.
The reference price for PIACL’s bidding will now be approved by the Privatisation Commission Board and the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation after bids have been received.







The bids will be opened in a ceremony starting at 3:30pm in the presence of the bidders. The bids and the reference prices will be announced, and the bidding will be concluded as per the agreed terms.
Adviser to the prime minister on privatisation, Muhammad Ali will also hold a press conference after the conclusion of the bidding process. The whole process will be telecast live and streamed across all TV channels as well as respective social media handles of the government, which will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the last time the airline went under the hammer.
Speaking to the media on Tuesday, Ali said, “God willing, we will get a good bid, there will be good investment and we will succeed.“
The auction is Pakistan’s second attempt at selling the once storied flag carrier after televised bidding last year collapsed when a solitary offer fell far below the government‘s reference price, derailing what would have been the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, thanked government officials and the Privatisation Commission for their role in the national carrier’s privatisation.
He stressed that the process has been made “transparent“, stating that it will be the “largest transaction” ever in Pakistan’s history.
“Today, as the bidding starts [..] the bids will come in sealed envelopes, there will be transparent boxes, there will be a live telecast. When the price is determined, the envelopes will be opened. They will compete, and whoever has the highest bid will [succeed],“ he said.
“Only God knows how high the bid will go, but the process must come back to the cabinet,” he said.
Unsuccessful bidders to be excluded from PIA management
Earlier, Ali said the two unsuccessful bidders will be excluded from any future role in the airline’s management thanks to a unique stipulation.
In recent remarks, he explained that losing bidders will have no right to join the winning bidder, and only those groups who were not party to the auction would be able to join the new management.
This means that while only one of the three consortiums currently in the running for the flag carrier will become part of its administration upon acquisition of a majority stake, Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd  retains the option to join with them subsequently, if it wishes to.
The company was previously in the race for PIA but then decided to quit the bidding process.
Ahead of Tuesday’s bidding, reports surfaced of a behind-the-scenes deal involving at least two of the parties involved — the Arif Habib and Lucky Cement groups — that reportedly fell through.
In a tweet, journalist Kamran Khan alluded to a meeting where it was proposed to split the controlling stake among three of the four interested parties. However, Khan claimed, this arrangement fell through as one of the parties — i.e. the Muhammad Ali Tabba-led Lucky Cement group — did not agree to it.







Both Tabba and a high-ranking government official privy to developments confirmed this, but clarified that this was not a government-brokered mee­ting, but rather an informal interaction.
Talking to Dawn, Tabba expressed unwavering confidence in the privatisation process, and clarified that the proposal was floated to him after a meeting in Islamabad, which he did not pursue.

Additional input from Reuters</p><small>2025-12-23 09:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23132026a271832.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962799/international-finance-corporation-announces-first-local-currency-investment-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>International Finance Corporation announces first local currency investment in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The International Finance Corporation (IFC) – the private sector arm of the World Bank Group – has announced its first local currency investment in Pakistan, which it said was aimed at strengthening the agriculture sector.
According to a press release issued by the IFC on Tuesday, its first Pakistani rupee-denominated investment via an unfunded partial credit guarantee of up to Rs33.6 billion would support long-term financing from Standard Chartered Bank Pakistan Limited to Engro Fertilisers Limited.
“The engagement marks IFC’s first local currency investment in Pakistan, thus expanding access to long-term financing solutions in both local and foreign currency, critical for economic growth, particularly in important sectors such as agriculture and micro, small, and medium enterprises,” the press release said.
It added that the financing would enable Engro Fertilisers to strengthen the agri-value chain in Pakistan by mobilising local capital.
“The investment — aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s agriculture sector and bolstering food security — also benefits from a first loss counter guarantee from the IFC-Canada’s Facility for Resilient Food Systems,“ the press release said
It further stated that by leveraging PKR-denominated financing, Engro Fertilisers “is championing the use of domestic capital to enhance operational resilience”.
“The financing will help Engro Fertilisers make capital investments in maintenance of facilities and turnarounds, enabling uninterrupted supply of urea and other fertilisers to meet national demand.
“This financing will enable Engro Fertilisers to strengthen the agri-value chain in Pakistan by mobilising local capital.“
Moreover, the press release added, the funding was also aimed at supporting farmer programmes, ensuring the continuity of initiatives that complemented Engro’s core mission of reliable production.
It highlighted that the agriculture sector in Pakistan was contributing 24pc of the country’s GDP, 70pc of its exports and 40pc of its employment, making it vital for long-term growth.
“Yet systemic challenges—inefficient supply chains, underfunded farmer programs, low literacy, and rising input costs — persist.
“This investment will help address some of these gaps,” the press release said.
It quoted Engro Fertilisers Chief Executive Officer Ali Rathore as saying: “Engro has always strived to solve Pakistan’s most pressing issues meaningfully. Using local capital to strengthen local value chains reflects our commitment to the country and to our farmers — the backbone of Pakistan’s economy — through reliable fertiliser production.
“We are grateful to our partners, IFC and Standard Chartered Bank, for enabling us to advance this mission.”
The press also included remarks by IFC’s Regional Industry Head of Manufacturing, Agribusiness and Services in the Middle East and Central Asia, Ashruf Megahed.
He was quoted as saying: “This investment reflects the strength of our partnership with Engro Fertilisers and Standard Chartered Bank and our shared commitment to providing innovative solutions to address challenges in a sustainable manner. Through this project, we are opening new pathways for local currency long-term financing that support growth and financial resilience to manage country risk in a sector vital to the country’s economy.”
Similarly, the press release quoted Standard Chartered Chief Executive Officer and Head of Coverage in Pakistan Rehan Shaikh as saying: “At Standard Chartered, we are committed to financing solutions that enable sustainable growth and long-term resilience across Pakistan’s economy.
“This partnership with IFC and Engro Fertilisers reflects our shared vision of strengthening food security and supporting one of the country’s most critical value chains. Standard Chartered is keen to continue working with IFC to replicate this successful structure across its network.”
Today’s announcement by the IFC comes around two months after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) partnered with the IFC to expand local currency financing for the private sector.
The SBP had announced on October 21 the signing of an agreement with the IFC under the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) framework, enabling the multilateral institution to invest in Pakistani rupees and better manage exchange rate risks.
Borrowing in hard currencies such as the US dollar while earning revenues in local currency exposes companies in developing economies to considerable exchange rate risks. Addressing this mismatch is essential for strengthening the financial resilience of local businesses and ensuring broader economic stability.</p><small>2025-12-23 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23123922f34193d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962796/punjab-cm-argues-against-lhcs-suspension-of-land-protection-law-says-move-will-benefit-encroachment-mafias' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM argues against LHC’s suspension of land protection law. says move will ‘benefit encroachment mafias’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed strong concern on Tuesday on the suspension of the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025 by the Lahore High Court (LHC), arguing that the move would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”.
Maryam‘s statement issued by the CM’s Office comes a day after LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum issued an interim order suspending the operation of the newly enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, which empowers dispute resolution committees led by deputy commissioners to resolve property disputes.
The ordinance was approved by the Punjab chief minister on Oct 31 and mandates the resolution of land disputes within 90 days.
The law has been challenged in the LHC, about which Maryam argued that its enactment was aimed at providing “long-awaited relief to millions of citizens suffering from prolonged land and property disputes”.
“The legislation, for the first time, fixed a 90-day time frame for the resolution of land and property cases that have historically dragged on for years and even generations,” she said, terming the law a “major step” toward protecting ordinary citizens from powerful land grabbers and mafias.
Maryam emphasised that the “democratically elected Punjab Assembly had passed the law to free the public from the grip of influential land mafias”.
The legislation, she insisted, empowered citizens to safeguard their legally owned land and properties.
The legislation was “evidence-based and comprehensive”, covering both administrative and legal dimensions to ensure justice for the oppressed, the CM said.
Maryam further maintained that the LHC‘s decision to suspend the ordinance’s operation “is not in line with the settled principles laid down by the superior judiciary”.
Its suspension would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”, and the public would perceive it as state patronage of such elements, she said.
The CM highlighted that progress in cases pertaining to land and property would often be stalled by stay orders for decades, and justice was being denied to rightful owners.
“This law was neither made for my personal benefit nor does its suspension harm me personally,” she said, adding that “real loss” from its suspension would be borne by the poor, widows, the helpless, and other marginalised citizens who were finally beginning to receive relief.
Maryam stressed that “legislation is the constitutional right of the provincial assembly and cannot be obstructed”.
Halting the new property law would “shatter the fragile hope of justice that had been rekindled among the poor and oppressed segments of society”, the CM said.
While Maryam has defended the law, LHC CJ Neelum expressed her disapproval of the law during the hearing on Monday, saying: “It appears that some people want to hold all powers”.
The judge had further observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights, and judicial supremacy.
“If it were up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Const­itution,” she had said.
Questioning the purpose of the law, CJ Neelum had asked how a revenue officer could hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.</p><small>2025-12-23 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23104102a832653.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962789/highly-respected-general-no-end-in-sight-to-trumps-praise-of-cdf-field-marshal-munir' target='_blank'><strong>‘Highly respected general’: No end in sight to Trump’s praise of CDF Field Marshal Munir</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump, who has now on several occasions in the past praised Chief of Defence Force and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has now called him a “highly respected general”.
The US president’s latest remarks came as he addressed a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. During the press conference, Trump announced a new class of heavily armed warships that will be named after himself — an honour usually reserved for leaders who have left office.
Asked about the progress of talks between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said that his administration had so far “stopped eight wars” — a claim that he has repeated in the past.
“We stopped a potential nuclear war between Pakistan and India,” Trump said.
“The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more, by getting that war [sic].”
“You know, eight planes were shot down, the war was starting to rage,” he said.

 

“We have solved many wars; the only one we have not solved yet is Russia and Ukraine,” the US president said. He noted that there was a lot of “hatred” between the two nations.
This is the latest in a series of compliments that Trump has given to CDF Field Marshal Munir since their meeting in Washington in June. On June 19, he extended an unprecedented invitation to the army chief for a historic luncheon at the White House.
The US president has since lauded Munir on several occasions, even referring to him as “my favourite field marshal”.
On October 29, Trump praised CDF Field Marshal Munir, calling him a “great fighter” while talking about the Pakistan and India conflict in May.
In his comments, he said: “I’m doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love, as you know, for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said.
“Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the field marshal — they have a field marshal. You know why he’s a field marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy, too.”
A day prior, he had lauded the role of the CDF in the ceasefire agreement following the May conflict.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”. In November, he stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.</p><small>2025-12-23 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641044-no-blackmailing-talks-with-pti-only-possible-on-legitimate-demands-says-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>'No blackmailing': Talks with PTI only possible on 'legitimate' demands, says PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

While Egypt celebrates its Olympic medals in wrestling, weightlifting and other sports, thousands of young athletes outside the capital toil away in tiny clubs like this one, 135 km from Cairo and far from any major sporting hubs.
Yet the al-Shal and Manshiya club has produced national champions in wrestling and judo, and one of its teenage stars is set to represent Egypt at the Youth Olympics.
Its achievements come despite chronic underfunding, outdated equipment, and a lack of regular government support.
While Egypt’s population grew by almost a third between 2011 and 2023, the number of sports clubs went down by more than 4 per cent, according to data from state statistics agency CAPMAS.
Most clubs are privately run, and resources remain thin.

A spokesperson for the youth and sports ministry, Mohamed al-Shazly, said Egypt gives “full and comprehensive financial and in-kind support to clubs” but it does so based on available resources and the ministry’s plans, and is routed through each game’s federation.
The federations, however, often have to channel that funding to the national teams only.
“If you have 1,000 players for example, you pick the best 10 to sponsor as they represent Egypt,” said Ibrahim Moustafa, secretary general of the Egyptian Wrestling Federation.
“The club itself has to finance equipment and training for the other players,” he added.
This is what makes clubs like al-Shal seem miraculous.
“Limited resources, immense achievements,” said coach Mahmoud al-Wafaa’i, who is unpaid and trains the girls out of self-professed love for the sport.
“The hall is only 3.5 by 3.5 metres (…) practically impossible to create one champion in. Yet we produce champions.”
Al-Shal is emblematic of broader structural problems across Egypt. CAPMAS data show that in many governorates, government-run clubs employ far more administrative staff than trainers.
Still, Al-Shal’s Rodaina Ahmed Gamal, 15, a national gold medallist who has qualified for the 2026 Dakar Youth Olympics, says she prefers training there than at other larger clubs she can access.

“There are about 20 of us in a small hall here, and you feel like we’re all looking out for each other,” Rodaina said.
Her mother, Rasha Mahmoud, said the club provides the space and the coach, but families are strained covering almost everything else.
“Rodaina might enter three championships in one month… Three registrations, three weigh-ins, three stays. I pay for that,” she said.
For older athletes like Nadia Hazem Mahmoud, 20, now in her second year at university, the barriers are also social.
People say ” ‘How can a girl play wrestling?’ I’ve taken it up as a hobby. And when I felt I was achieving things in it, I loved the sport,” she said.
The strength they gain from the sport also helps the girls protect themselves mentally and physically, Rasha said.
Wafaa’i said Rodaina’s success had helped attract younger girls, building a base of more than a dozen trainees under the age of 12, providing an outlet for them in their low-income neighborhood.
Egypt sent 148 athletes to the Paris 2024 Olympics and won three medals in pentathlon, fencing, and weightlifting. But in Mansoura, far from the Olympic ceremonies, the future of women’s sport still depends on clubs like al-Shal.
As Rodaina put it: “I started here, so I want to finish here. I want to say I brought an African medal from al-Shal club.”</p><small>2025-12-23 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23114920aabc624.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792/if-they-are-ready-govt-is-definitely-ready-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-offer-for-dialogue-with-opposition' target='_blank'><strong>‘If they are ready, govt is definitely ready’: PM Shehbaz reiterates offer for dialogue with opposition</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that he was reiterating his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
The proposition by the premier was made during a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, where he referred to news reports of the opposition PTI and its “companions talking about dialogue“.
He recalled that he had previously invited the opposition for talks on multiple occasions, including in the assembly.
“If they are ready for this, the government of Pakistan is definitely ready,” he said, adding that harmony among all political parties was necessary for the progress and prosperity of the country.
However, he continued, there should be no “blackmailing” under the guise of talks and dialogue could only move forward “in light of legitimate matters”.

 

The need for dialogue between the government and the opposition has been stressed as Pakistan continues to face political and economic crises.
On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
This call for reconciliation among political actors was made at the Khawaja Rafique Shaheed reference in Lahore.
Speaking on the occasion, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar urged a new national political charter rooted in tolerance and dialogue while PM’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah stressed that political stability could only be achieved through restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.
After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December 2024 to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024, and the release of PTI prisoners.
The Shehbaz government once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February this year as National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped.
However, a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI.
Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country.
In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA.
The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue.
More recently, Sadiq reiterated his offer on November 13 to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties.
The offer was made by the speaker at a time when the opposition members belonging to the PTI were protesting in the assembly during the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill.
He had again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on November 28 that dialogue was the way to resolve issues.
On December 6, after a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue.
Speaking in the upper house of parliament, Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock.
He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling.
Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”</p><small>2025-12-23 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/231038161f841d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962788/five-cops-martyred-as-police-vehicle-comes-under-attack-in-kps-karak' target='_blank'><strong>Five cops martyred as police vehicle comes under attack in KP’s Karak</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT: Five cops were martyred after a police mobile came under attack in Gurguri area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak on Tuesday.
The district police spokesman, Shaukat Khan, confirmed the incident and the casualties, saying that all of the martyred personnel were constables.
The martyred policemen were identified as constables Shahid Iqbal, Samiullah, Arif, Safdar and Muhammad Abrar, who was also the mobile’s driver, Khan added.
He said that a large police contingent, including the district police officer, was present at the scene and a search operation was underway.
While the exact nature of the incident is not yet clear, an image shared by the police spokesman showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the vehicle which came under attack.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the incident, expressing deep sorrow and grief over the lives lost and offering prayers for martyred officers, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office.
He extended his condolences to the bereaved families and assured them of the government’s full support during this difficult time.
The prime minister paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police force, stating that police personnel had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism and rendered “unparalleled” services to ensure peace and security in the country.
“The entire nation salutes the martyrs who laid down their lives in the line of duty,” the prime minister said, adding that their sacrifices would never be forgotten.
Reiterating the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan remained fully committed to the complete elimination of terrorism in all its forms.
This is the latest in a series of attacks targeting police personnel in the province. Last week, a police official and his brother were martyred in a gun attack in KP’s Lakki Marwat.

He was 55.
The developer and executive died on Sunday while driving his Ferrari on a scenic road north of Los Angeles, according to local broadcaster NBC4.
“For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier, and became fully engulfed,” the California Highway Patrol said in a statement, without identifying the two victims in the crash.
The CHP added that both the driver and a passenger who was ejected from the vehicle succumbed to their injuries.
Witnesses posted video of the mangled cherry-red Ferarri, engulfed in flames, on the mountain road. The cause of the crash remains under investigation.
His studios created some of the world’s best-selling video games, and Zampella was considered an innovator in first-person military shooter style games.
This year, when his “Battlefield 6” video game set a new sales record for the franchise, Zampella expressed gratitude, saying “we never take moments like this for granted” — despite a long career of success in gaming.

 

The mass-combat game has won over 100 million players in the past two decades, in its various iterations.
And yet, that number isn’t a first.
To this day, “Call of Duty” boasts more than 100 million active players, monthly.
“You have that dream of the game being popular, but I don’t think you’re ever ready for that level of success,” Zampella told gaming site IGN in a 2016 interview.
Profound, far-reaching
Zampella was best known for co-creating the “Call of Duty” franchise and founding Respawn Entertainment, the studio behind “Titanfall,” “Apex Legends,” and the “Star Wars Jedi” games.
After starting out in the 1990s as a designer on shooter games, he co-founded Infinity Ward in 2002 and helped launch “Call of Duty” in 2003.
Activision later acquired his studio.
He left Activision under contentious circumstances and established Respawn in 2010, which Electronic Arts acquired in 2017.
At EA, he eventually took charge of revitalising the “Battlefield” franchise, cementing his reputation as one of the most influential figures in modern first-person shooter games.
“This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work,” Electronic Arts said in a statement.
“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching,” the company said, adding that “his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment”.
A statement by Respawn, posted on the “Battlefield” X account, praised Zampella “for how he showed up every day, trusting his teams, encouraging bold ideas, and believing in Battlefield and the people building it”.
Zampella “championed what he believed was right for the people behind those studios and our players because it mattered”.
“It was a bold, transgressive method of storytelling, of a moment in time that was political, that was violent and that was impactful,” Washington Post video game reporter Gene Park told NBC4.
“He really knew how to create stories and create experiences, that really hit at the heart of human experience — whether it was terror, dread, heroism.
I think he was really able to kindof encapsulate that through the designs of the video games that he made,” Park said.</p><small>2025-12-23 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23095154dfb21e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962679/karachi-world-book-fair-ends-with-record-turnout' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi World Book Fair ends with ‘record turnout’</strong></a><br><p>

A large number of people throng Expo Centre on the last day of the book fair.—Dawn

KARACHI: The five-day Karachi World Book Fair (KWBF) concluded on Monday evening at Expo Centre with organisers — the Pakistan Publishers and Booksellers — claiming that it broke all previous records in terms of footfall.
According to conservative estimates, they said, more than 550,000 people including students from more than 300 schools, colleges, universities and seminaries visited the annual show in five days.
The large number of people, who turned up for the book fair, is a testimony to the fact that, contrary to some intellectuals’ grousing, the book reading culture has not dwindled. In fact, it has increased — given the hundreds of thousands of books sold at the fair in the last few years. What kind of books are being read… is a different question altogether!
Inarguably, the most heartening aspect of the whole exercise is the involvement and interest in books of the younger generation. From day one (Dec 18), long queues of schoolchildren could be seen outside the main entrance to Expo Centre where the KWBF was held. They came from all corners of Karachi — from District East to Clifton and from Malir to District Central. Their enthusiasm for the event was infectious. Yes, not all of them bought books or were helped to buy books by their parents or teachers, their presence at the venue enabled them to imbibe the atmosphere suffused with the earthy smell of books.

Over 550,000 people visited Expo Centre during five days, organisers claim

On Sunday (Dec 21), for example, two children who have not yet entered their teens, were happily moving around with their teacher around the three halls of the venue where books had been displayed. The teacher had a degree in marketing but was a lover of books. The kids, wearing school uniform even on a Sunday, had a couple of bags in their hands filled with… yes, books. When asked what were they about, they said ‘word search’.
The key word here is ‘search’. This is exactly what reading a book benefits a reader with. And this is exactly what the keynote speaker on the opening day of the fair, Ahmed Shah, had talked about. Books transport you to places that you dream about — to the world of Sufis, Socrates, Ghalib, Einstein, Sadequain and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. They fill the reader with a sense of curiosity. The curiosity to learn.
As for adults, they were seen at the fair getting their hands on publications focusing on all sorts of subjects: spiritual, literary, philosophical, self-help, management skills, etc. Also, a words-related celebrity culture is, albeit imperceptibly, catching on which is good, because it’s the writers and thinkers who need to be celebrated most. Announcements were made on Saturday through the PA system about the poet Pirzada Qasim’s presence in one of the halls where people could meet him and talk about his art and work.
More such events, please.

Two of the Trump-class ships will be built initially, but that number could grow substantially, according to the president, who said they will be “some of the most lethal surface warfare ships” and “the largest battleship in the history of our country”.
Trump made the announcement at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida alongside Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Navy Secretary John Phelan, with images of the planned high-tech vessels on stands nearby.







Asked if the planned warships are a counter to Washington’s rival Beijing, Trump declined to specify, instead saying: “It’s a counter to everybody, it’s not China. We get along great with China.”
He said the ships will weigh between 30,000 and 40,000 tons and will be armed with missiles and guns as well as weaponry still in development, such as lasers and hypersonic missiles.
They will also be capable of carrying atomic weapons in the form of the nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, Trump said.
The Trump-class ships will be substantially larger than existing US destroyers and cruisers, but the projected displacement cited by the president is somewhat smaller than the last American battleships — from the Iowa class — which were retired in the 1990s.
‘Most powerful fleet anywhere’
Trump — who has complained in the past about the appearance of US ships — said he would be involved in the design along with the Navy “because I’m a very aesthetic person”.
Trump’s announcement came just days after the Navy publicised plans for another new class of ships — frigates dubbed the FF(X) that it said will “complement the fleet’s larger, multi-mission warships”.
Phelan has said the FF(X) will be based on an existing design from shipbuilder HII that is already in use by the United States Coast Guard, and that the aim is for the first of the new frigates to be in the water by 2028.
The new frigate plans were announced after Phelan said in late November that four of six planned ships from the Constellation class of frigates would be canceled, while two that are already under construction are “under review”.
Washington has fallen significantly behind Beijing when it comes to the number of ships in its Navy, and a report to Congress earlier this year noted that US military officials and other observers are concerned by the pace of China’s shipbuilding efforts.
“We’re going to restore America as a major shipbuilding power,” Trump said on Monday, adding: “We’re going to ensure the USA has the most powerful fleet anywhere in the world, and long into the future, with battleships helping lead the way.“</p><small>2025-12-23 04:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6949fe24f20d2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962753/internal-turmoil-diplomatic-crisis-grip-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Internal turmoil, diplomatic crisis grip Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>• Dhaka suspends consular, visa services in New Delhi; Indian centre in Chattogram reciprocates• Inqilab Moncho threatens to topple interim govt, demands resignations• 17 held as govt promises speedy trial• Journalists protest amid death threats, attacks on media
After student leader Osman Hadi’s assassination, crises on both the external and internal fronts have deepened in Bangladesh, which has halted all consular and visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi, while the nation grapples with unrest stemming from arrests, journalists’ protests, and threats of a government overthrow.
“Due to unavoidable circumstances, all consular and visa services from the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi are temporarily suspended until further notice,” a notice posted by the Bangladesh mission said. “Any inconvenience caused is sincerely regretted.”
The move came two days after a demonstration by 20 to 25 people outside the diplomatic mission in New Delhi. Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain told reporters on Sunday that Bangladesh High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah received death threats from the protesters.
However, Indian Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Sunday there was no attempt to breach the mission’s security and that police dispersed the small group within minutes.
The protesters were demonstrating against the killing of a garment worker, Dipu Chandra Das, in Bangladesh and demanding protection for minorities, he said.
Tensions have been reciprocal. On Sunday, the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there. High commissioners for both countries have been summoned by their respective host governments.
The developments indicated increasing friction between the two nations, as The Daily Star noted that these developments point to diplomatic tensions escalating towards a crisis and advised that both Delhi and Dhaka should work towards reducing the tensions.
Threats to interim govt
The turmoil stems from the killing of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in a pro-democracy uprising last year that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has since taken refuge in India. Masked gunmen shot Hadi earlier this month, and he died from his injuries on Thursday.
His death ignited furious protests, with mobs setting fire to several buildings, including the offices of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, two of the country’s leading newspapers, which some protesters perceive as favourable to India.
In response, the student group Inqilab Moncho on Monday threatened a movement to remove the interim government, holding it responsible for Hadi’s death. The group demanded the immediate resignations of the home adviser, his special assistant and the law adviser for failing to provide security.
“Justice must be ensured before the election; no election will take place before that,” Abdullah Al Jaber, member secretary of the group, said at a press conference.
He warned that activists would not leave the streets until Hadi’s killers are brought to justice and would topple the government if their demands were not met.
The group also called for an international investigation by agencies like the FBI or Scotland Yard. Law Adviser Asif Nazrul responded by announcing the murder case would be tried at a speedy trial tribunal, with a verdict expected within 90 days of the police report being filed.
Journalists’ protest
Meanwhile, journalists in Dhaka held a human chain protest on Monday to condemn the arson attacks and threats against the press. Media leaders said threats have escalated from debates over free expression to concerns for their very survival.
“On social media, we have seen messages saying journalists of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo should be hunted down and killed in their homes,” said Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of The Daily Star. “This is no longer about opinions. These are murder threats.”
He made the remarks while delivering a solidarity speech at a joint protest titled “Bangladesh Under the Attack of Mob Viole­nce”, organised by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) at a hotel in Dhaka.
Nahid Islam, convener of the National Citizen Party (NCP), today said they believe the attacks involved a section of the government and had political backing. “The whole incident was planned,” he said.
AK Azad said about 28 journalists were trapped inside The Daily Star’s office during the firebombing and claimed that pleas for help were ignored until after the attack was over. He said security forces were present but did not intervene.
He also announced plans to hold a conference in Dhaka for journalists from across the country in mid-January, vowing to continue protests until those responsible for recent arson attacks on The Daily Star and Prothom Alo are brought to justice.
Nurul Kabir, editor of the New Age daily, said the attackers intended to kill. “They set newspaper offices on fire and blocked the fire service from entering,” he said. “This clearly shows they wanted to burn people alive simply because they disagreed with them.”
Arrests and violence
Separately, Police said they have arrested 17 people in connection with the newspaper attacks. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner SN Nazrul Islam said officers exercised restraint to avoid casualties among the 4,000 to 5,000 protesters.
“The fact that no human life was lost in such a major incident is what we see as our achievement,” he said, adding that social media misinformation had inflamed the situation.
Political figures from across the spectrum have voiced concern over the escalating violence as the country prepares for general elections in February.
“Today, democracy itself has been attacked,” said Mirza Fakh­rul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the opposition Bangla­desh Nationalist Party. “This is the time for all democratic people to unite.”
The broader unrest was highlighted by a separate incident where Border Guard Bangladesh intensified surveillance along the Benapole border after an NCP leader, Md Motaleb Shikdar, was shot and injured in Khulna.

During a five-hour-long hearing, the prosecution recorded statements of eight witnesses in the case registered against 11 suspects, including Ms Khan.
Aleema Khan appeared before the court along with her counsel while prosecutor Faisal Malik represented the state. The acquittal application was formally taken up by the court, which sought responses from the relevant parties.
The defence side, however, requested that further proceedings be scheduled after the winter vacation. Accepting the request, the court adjourned the hearing till Jan 2.
Earlier, Ms Khan apprised the court during the proceedings that 11 books had been submitted with a request that they be delivered to the PTI founder. The court informed her that the books had been received by the PTI founder and that a confirmation report had been received from the jail authorities. Aleema Khan thanked the court for ensuring the delivery.
The case pertains to the Nov 26 protest, in which a nu­­­mber of PTI leaders face trial before the anti-terrorism co­­urt. The witnesses inc­luded Noor Ahmed of PID, Nader Khan of Pemra, Muh­a­mmad Sabtain of NCCIA, Inspector Yaqub Shah of Ra­­walpindi police, and jail ad­­­ditional superintendent Ali Amir Shah, among others.
On the other hand, Mr Khan could not sign the papers of attorney, enabling his lawyers to file an appeal against his recent conviction in Toshakhana case.
According to Advocate Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry, the jail authorities kept him waiting for three hours and then refused his meeting with Mr Khan for taking his signature on the papers of attorney.

KARACHI: As political parties from the ruling and opposition camps propose talks to end the political confrontation, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Monday demanded fresh elections across the country to do away with the governments allegedly born out of rigging.
Positioning himself as the one political figure courted by both the government and the opposition, Maulana Fazl declared that the 2018 and 2024 polls were “rigged and did not reflect the will of the people”.
Standing alongside the government’s key ally, MQM-P’s appointed Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, Maulana Fazl questioned the legitimacy of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government while also, without naming it, casting doubt on the past record of the country’s largest opposition party, the PTI.
“Fresh elections must be held,” he responded to a question. “Neither the 2018 elections nor the 2024 polls reflected the will of the people. The governments born out of establishment-backed rigging should come to an end. From Sindh to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, these governments should be brought to an end and fresh elections must be held across the country.”
This is not the first time he has demanded snap polls; in fact, less than a week after the Feb 8 elections, his party had rejected its results and demanded fresh polls. The JUI-F chief made a similar call in September last year as his party engaged the PTI as well as the ruling coalition, apparently to make a political comeback. The JUI-F was also instrumental in the passage of the 26th Amendment.

 

Speaking at Governor’s House, where he was conferred an honorary doctorate from Sir Syed University, Maulana Fazl warned that the government’s current actions were “making the Constitution controversial and disputed”. He was referring to the 27th Amendment, which was passed despite opposition from his party.
Responding to a question, Maulana Fazl described the 27th Amendment as legislation passed through a “forced majority,” but at the same time, he defended the 26th Amendment passed last year, in which he had played a key role.
“The 26th Amendment was passed by consensus, so it is not appropriate to make it disputed,” he said. “The 27th Amendment, however, was one-sided. You did not have a majority, meaning the majority was created through force. Then, all those things from which you stepped back in the 26th Amendment were included in the 27th Amendment, which is why the Constitution is now being seen as disputed. We should avoid turning the Constitution into a subject of dispute.”
Tensions with Afghanistan
When asked to comment on recent tensions with Afghanistan, the JUI-F chief questioned the government’s policies and urged the authorities on both sides of the border not to drag people into the internal state matters because of state actions.
“Afghanistan should not be viewed only in today’s context,” he said. “We should discuss 78 years of our Afghan policy. Pakistan has never had a truly friendly government in Afghanistan. Could this be a failure of our own policy? If we build any narrative, we would definitely put the blame on the other side, but we need to take a look at ourselves as well and ask whether our Afghan policy has failed. This should be a matter of debate.”
When asked about his opinion on the proposed deployment of the armed forces in Gaza, he referred to “bitter experiences of the past” and asked the government to “refrain from this and avoid making ourselves controversial”.
“A so-called peacekeeping force is not really about peacekeeping – it becomes a war-fighting force. We should avoid making the mistake of becoming part of an international alliance and then turning our guns on Palestinians. We must refrain from this and avoid making ourselves controversial,” he said in reference to the US-proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
Later, addressing a conference of clerics, Maulana Fazl defended the role of seminaries and warned that any government action to undermine them under any regulatory cover would put the educational fate of thousands of students at risk. He also criticised “attempts to force” seminaries to obtain certificates from the education ministry and called for the independence of religious institutions.
“We announced at the all-parties conference in Lahore that the agreements reached by our senior scholars will not be reopened for discussion,” he said.
Addressing curriculum debates, the Maulana said that scholars have long strived to create a cohesive syllabus, but their recommendations were often ignored. He expressed support for modern subjects alongside religious studies.

Lockheed Martin, the US aerospace and defence company that manufactures F-16 fighter aircraft, has been named the principal contractor.—AFP/file

 
• Lockheed Martin picked as main contractor; $686m deal aims to extend fleet service life until 2040• US Congress was earlier notified of the proposed sale, didn’t raise any objections
WASHINGTON: A US military upgrade package for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter fleet, worth $686 million, has been cleared through a statutory congressional notification process.
Lockheed Martin, the US aerospace and defence company that manufactures the F-16 fighter aircraft, and has long been responsible for its design, upgrades, and sustainment programmes for international operators, has been named the principal contractor for the proposed sale.
The sale was processed under existing authorities provided by the Arms Export Control Act and annual appropriations laws.
These provisions allow the executive branch to obligate and disburse funds once Congress has been formally notified and does not object within the required time period.
The Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) approved Pakistan’s request for a $686 million Foreign Military Sale (FMS) covering F-16 hardware, software upgrades and sustainment support, and formally notified the US Congress of this decision.
Under US law, this approval does not mean the sale bypassed congressional oversight. Once the DSCA issues its notification, Congress is provided a mandatory 30-day review period during which lawmakers may object or introduce a resolution to block the transaction.
If no objection is raised within this timeframe — which is the norm — the sale is considered to have received congressional approval. A separate vote is required only if Congress chooses to intervene.
This process is built into the legal framework governing US arms transfers. The DSCA is authorised to manage such transactions through mechanisms like Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF).
These programmes typically rely on the purchasing country’s own funds, or on US loans or grants that have already been approved at the executive level by the President and the State Department — as is the case with Pakistan’s F-16 package.
Upgrade package
Published on the congressional website last week, the notification states that the proposed sale is intended to extend the service life of Pakistan’s Block-52 and midlife-upgrade F-16 aircraft through 2040, while preserving interoperability with the US and partner forces.
Major defence equipment accounts for $37m of the total value, with the remaining $649m covering sustainment, refurbishment, and modernisation services.
The package includes 92 Link-16 tactical data-link systems and six inert Mk-82 500-pound bomb bodies for integration and testing.
Other elements cover avionics upgrades, secure communications and navigation equipment, cryptographic devices, mission-planning tools, as well as software and hardware modifications.
Training systems, munitions testing and reprogramming equipment, and associated spare parts are also included.
Sensitive components include Mode-5 identification friend-or-foe systems, handheld key loaders, and reprogramming equipment for munitions built-in-test functions. Some items are classified as secret.
Pakistan first submitted its request for F-16 upgrades in 2021-22. While the DSCA consistently supported the proposal, the Biden administration chose not to act at the time, even though the notification mechanism was available. A notification was issued in December 2024, but no further action followed.
A fresh notification was sent to Congress in December 2025 under the Trump administration. Once the statutory notification window closed with no objection raised, the proposed sale was approved in accordance with US law.
US rationale
In its official statement, the DSCA said the sale would support US foreign policy and national security objectives by enabling Pakistan to retain interoperability with Washington and partner forces.
“It will strengthen cooperation in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and help prepare for future contingency operations,” the agency said.
The statement added that refurbishing and upgrading Pakistan’s F-16 fleet would address critical flight-safety concerns and improve integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force during combat operations, exercises, and training.
The DSCA said Pakistan was expected to absorb the articles and services without difficulty and stressed that the proposed sale “will not alter the basic military balance in the region”.
Implementation of the sale will not require additional US government or contractor personnel in Pakistan and will have no adverse impact on American defence readiness.
The US government said it was not aware of any offset agreement linked to the proposed sale; any such arrangement would be determined through negotiations between Pakistan and the contractor.

According to the Reuters news agency, the over $4 billion deal, one of Pakistan’s largest-ever weapons sales, will see arms sold to the Libyan National Army (LNA).
It was finalised after a meeting last week between Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir and Saddam Khalifa Haftar, deputy commander-in-chief of the LNA, in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, officials said.
Although foreign ministry, defence ministry and military did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, military officials called it “historic in terms of size and financial impact”.

JF-17s, Super Mushak aircraft on LNA’s ‘shopping list’, said to be valued over $4bn

A copy of the deal before it was finalised that was seen by Reuters listed the purchase of several JF-17 fighter jets, jointly developed by Pakistan and China, and a number of Super Mushak trainer aircraft, used for basic pilot training.

 

A Pakistani official told Reuters the deal included the sale of equipment for land, sea and air, spread over 2-1/2 years, adding it could also include the JF-17 fighter jets.
Since 2011, the United Nations has imposed an arms embargo on the fractured North African country, which means transfers of weapons and related material require UN approval.
However, senior Pakistani military officials justified the arms sale, saying that many major western and Middle Eastern states have been supplying weapons and equipment to Libya for many years despite the embargo.
Calling it a “paper embargo” which is virtually “non-existent due to multiple reasons”, the sources said the move was in line with the prime minister and army chief’s vision for “an export driven self sustained economy”.
The internationally-recognised Government of National Unity, led by Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, controls much of western Libya, while Haftar’s LNA controls the east and south, including major oilfields, and does not recognise the Unity government’s authority.
According to Reuters, any arms agreement with the LNA is likely to face scrutiny given Libya’s long-running instability following a 2011 Nato-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and split the country between rival authorities.
The LNA’s official media channel reported on Sunday that the faction had entered a defence cooperation pact with Pakistan, which included weapons sales, joint training and military manufacturing, without providing details.
“We announce the launch of a new phase of strategic military cooperation with Pakistan,” Haftar said in remarks broadcast on Sunday by Al-Hadath television.
Authorities in Benghazi also did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Pakistan has been seeking to expand defence exports, drawing on decades of counterinsurgency experience and a domestic defence industry that spans aircraft production and overhaul, armoured vehicles, munitions and naval construction.

JERUSALEM: Israeli bulldozers tore through a four-storey buil­ding in east Jerusalem on Monday, leaving scores of Palestinian residents unsure where to go after their doors were broken down in the middle of the night by authorities enforcing hasty evictions.
The building was the latest in a series of residential structures to be razed as Israeli officials target what they describe as unauthorised construction in the city’s annexed east — a campaign that local Palestinian officials characterised as a “systematic policy” to displace residents.



 
“The demolition is a tragedy for all residents,” Eid Shawar, who lives in the building, said.
Located in the Silwan neighbourhood near the Old City, the building comprised a dozen apartments housing approximately 100 people, many of them women, children, and elderly residents.

Activists accuse Israeli authorities of designating areas in Silwan to advance settlement interests

“They broke down the door while we were asleep and told us we could only change our clothes and take essential papers and documents,” said Shawar, a father of five.
With nowhere else to go, Shawar, 38, said his seven-member family would have to sleep in his car.
“They are destroying my bedroom,” lamented one woman, as she watched the heavy machines rip through the building.
Three bulldozers began tearing down the structure early on Monday as residents looked on, their clothes and belongings scattered across nearby streets, a journalist saw.
Israeli police cordoned off surrounding roads, with security forces deployed across the area and positioned on the rooftops of neighbouring houses.
By midday, a large part of the building had already been razed to the ground.
Built on privately owned Palestinian land, the structure had been slated for demolition for lacking a permit, activists said.
‘Systematic policy’
Two Israeli NGOs, Ir Amin and Bimkom, said the demolition was the largest carried out in 2025, adding in a statement that “around 100 East Jerusalem families have lost their homes”.
Palestinians face severe obstacles in obtaining building permits due to Israel’s restrictive planning policies, according to activists, an issue that has fuelled tensions in East Jerusalem and across the occupied West Bank for years.
The building’s destruction “is part of a systematic policy aimed at forcibly displacing Palestinian residents and emptying the city of its original inhabitants”, the Jeru­sa­lem governorate, affiliated with the Ramallah-based Palestin­ian Authority, said in a statement.
“Any demolition that expels residents from their homes constitutes a clear occupation plan to replace the land’s owners with settlers.” On Sunday, Israel approved the establishment of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, part of a rapid expansion, but considered illegal under international law.
Activists, however, accuse Israeli authorities of frequently designating areas in East Jerusalem as national parks or open spaces to advance Israeli settlement interests.
Silwan begins at the foot of the Old City, where hundreds of Israeli settlers live among nearly 50,000 Palestinians.
The demolition there was “carried out without prior notice, despite the fact that a meeting was scheduled” on Monday to discuss steps to legalise the structure, Ir Amin and Bimkom said in their statement.

“Meetings with Khan will remain suspended till Feb 8,” the minister said while speaking on Geo News’ show ‘Capital Talk’, in reply to a question by the show’s host about whether meetings with Imran would remain suspended.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.
Chaudhry maintained that the prison is “not the headquarters of a political party”, and criticised the PTI for “spreading venom against institutions and leaders of the institutions“.
The PML-N leader said that regular meetings were held between PTI leaders and its founder in Adiala jail in the past, and the government had no issues. However, he stated that the meetings then turned into political press conferences outside the prison, and the opposition party started to create narratives, which were then “run by Indian media”.
Responding to the minister, PTI‘s Barrister Ali Zafar said the the Constitution of the country considers solitary confinement akin to torture, adding the Chaudhry’s statement is against human rights, international and local laws.
“PTI asks party leaders and parliamentarians to gather outside Adiala prison to express solidarity with Khan, but the government uses water canons and violence against peaceful protesters.”
Last week, water cannons were used to disperse Imran‘s sisters, party leaders and PTI workers after they staged sit-ins outside the Adiala prison against the officials’ refusal to let them meet with the ex-premiere.
Zafar maintained that the PTI “will not back down till we meet with Khan”.
He elaborated that if the government considered the possibility of dialogue to break the current political impasse and was sincere about moving forward, then meetings with Imran would be part of the process.
Prison meetings with Imran used to plan PTI protests: Sanaullah
Meanwhile, Prime Minister‘s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said prison meetings with Imran had been suspended because they were being used to plan and coordinate a large protest in Islamabad to mark the anniversary of the PTI’s November 26, 2024, march to the capital.
On November 26, 2024, Islamabad witnessed pitched battles between security forces and PTI supporters as the latter inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk for the party’s ‘final call’ powershow, with intense teargas shelling used to disperse the protesters.
A late-night crackdown by the government ended in a hasty retreat of the PTI’s top leadership and supporters, following which the party abruptly suspended its protest movement.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Sanaullah said that the party founder and his sister were discussing preparations for a large protest on November 26 this year before the meetings were suspended.
“Before the meetings were stopped four or five weeks ago, they discussed that on November 26, 2025, they would arrange a programme of this sort to mark what happened on that day in 2024,” he stated.
“The preparations, messaging and strategic planning were discussed in these meetings, which is why we stopped them,”
The PM’s aide added that stopping the meetings had led to rumours about Imran’s condition while incarcerated, including reports of poor health, and clarified that the PTI founder had “every facility available to him.”
Sanaullah said that statements by Imran’s sister Aleema Khan were “not her own words” and claimed that the party founder had outlined what she should say during a meeting with another sister, Uzma Khan, several weeks earlier.
Responding to a question about the TTAP’s nationwide strike call on February 8 next year, the PM’s aide said there would be no wheel-jam strike in “any street or neighbourhood” anywhere in Pakistan.
“The PM has tried negotiations four times. I do not know whether he has presented the option again,” he added. “From the other side, based on the response we are getting, do you think they want to resolve this through talks?”
Referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s call for a march to Islamabad, Sanaullah asked, “Why would they be permitted to protest in Islamabad? Does he have a legal basis? He says he is coming to Islamabad armed and that he will either conquer the city or return in a coffin. Is this in the national interest?”
“We’ll see what kind of protests they stage and how different they are,” he added. “Sohail Afridi cannot come down from Peshawar and take over the country.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Earlier this month, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”</p><small>2025-12-23 02:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23074441d1e0d44.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962748/bipartisan-pair-drafts-contempt-resolution-against-pam-bondi-over-epstein-files' target='_blank'><strong>Bipartisan pair drafts contempt resolution against Pam Bondi over Epstein files</strong></a><br><p>• Massie, Khanna plan ‘inherent contempt’ over partial release; measure skips courts, only needs simple House majority vote• Justice Department restores Trump-Epstein photo after backlash; released trove remains heavily redacted• Officials say redactions necessary to protect active investigations, victim privacy
TWO US lawmakers from opposing parties threatened on Sunday to bring inherent inherent contempt proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing the Justice Department of defying a federal mandate to fully release its investigation files on late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, BBC News reported.
Republican Rep Thomas Massie, a leading advocate for the transparency legislation, said the department failed to meet Friday’s statutory deadline.
He argued the agency released heavily redacted material while withholding crucial internal documents regarding prosecutorial decisions, despite a law requiring full disclosure.
“The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn’t require going through the courts,” Massie told CBS.
The congressman said he is drafting the measure alongside Democrat Rep Ro Khanna, signaling a bipartisan collaboration in the dispute over the documents.
Mr Khanna, appearing on the same programme, explained that inherent contempt could allow the House of Representatives to levy fines against Bondi for every day of noncompliance.
Inherent contempt is a seldom-used congressional authority that allows either the House or Senate to try and punish executive branch officials for obstructing the legislative process.
According to the American Bar Association, the power has not been invoked in nearly a century. Unlike impeachment, Massie noted, the move would only require a simple majority vote in the House of Representatives.
“We’re building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she’s not releasing these documents,” Mr Khanna said.
The confrontation follows the Friday deadline established by a law President Donald Trump signed in November.
The legislation, born from pressure within the Republican Party and from advocates for sex abuse survivors, compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release the full trove of information amassed during its two criminal investigations into Epstein.
While the department released thousands of pages, officials acknowledged withholding certain records.
The agency said it redacted personal information of victims, content showing child or physical abuse, and records endangering ongoing investigations or national security.

 

Mr Massie expressed frustration that the release provided limited new information regarding Epstein’s crimes and omitted internal memos that would explain controversial charging decisions made by prosecutors years ago.
“It’s very troubling the posture that they have taken,” Mr Massie said. “I won’t be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied.”
Ms Bondi has previously defended her agency’s conduct, describing herself as part of “the most transparent administration in American history”. The Justice Department has said more material will be released in the coming weeks.
Photo restored
Tensions flared further over the weekend after the department temporarily removed a specific file from its website: an image showing President Trump with Epstein, first lady Melania Trump and Epstein’s convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
The removal sparked immediate backlash from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, who asked in a social media post, “What else is being covered up?” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche rejected accusations that the removal was politically motivated.
DoJ, in a post on X, said the image was taken down “out of an abundance of caution” because it was part of a batch of files containing unredacted images of women that required further review to protect victim privacy.







“It has nothing to do with President Trump,” Blanche told NBC News, calling the suggestion of political favouritism “laughable”. He noted that “there are dozens of photos of President Trump already released to the public seeing him with Mr Epstein”.
The image was reposted without alteration after officials determined no victims were depicted. The photograph captures a collection of framed pictures on a cabinet in one of Epstein’s homes. It also shows an open drawer filled with other photos.
The handling of the digital archive drew scrutiny beyond the single photo. At least 13 files mysteriously disappeared from the website by Saturday without explanation.
Observers noted inconsistencies in the redaction process within those files. While most women pictured on the wall had their faces obscured, one face was redacted in one file but visible in three others. Another face remained unredacted across all files.

In a letter to the prime minister, one of the national representative bodies of trade industry, said year 2025 once again proved to be an extreme challenging year for business and industry.
PBF President Kha­waja Mehboob-ur-Rehman said despite repeated commitments by successive governments, the fundamental demand of the business community for ease of doing business and a reduction in the cost of operations had not been addressed in a meaningful or sustainable manner.
The PBF said that persistently high input costs, soaring energy tariffs, and an increasingly uncompetitive tax regime continued to erode industrial productivity, weaken exports, and discourage both local and foreign investment. “These pressures have significantly reduced Pakistan’s ability to compete with regional economies that actively support their industries through competitive pricing and pro-growth fiscal policies,” Mr Rehman said.

Seeks PM Shehbaz’s intervention amid high input costs, artificial dollar control

The PBF’s letter for revival of business confidence coincided with a statement from Ministry of Finance saying the investor confidence was booming and the stock market had become ‘one of the best-performing markets in the world’. The ministry’s monthly report for November on the other hand, suggested 26pc drop in foreign direct investment in July-October period of current year over same period last year while portfolio investment recorded a 540m outflow and total foreign investment falling by 82.5pc.
Referring to the successful defence of the country by Pakistan’s armed forces in May, PBF said that while the nation demonstrated strength and unity on the security front, the next critical challenge was winning the economic battle. The business community, PBF emphasised, was ready to play its role, provided it was equipped with the necessary competitive tools to operate in regional and global markets.
Among these tools, the forum identified two reforms as absolutely critical — regionally competitive electricity tariffs, and regionally competitive corporate tax rates. “Without alignment on these fronts, Pakistani businesses will remain at a structural disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring countries,” it said.
The PBF expressed serious concern that current economic policymaking, particularly within the Ministry of Finance, remained largely confined to compliance with IMF programme conditions, with insufficient focus on innovative, growth-oriented, and business-friendly solutions. On the other hand, dollar was kept under control artificially on higher side in the whole year despite reserves were on lower side.
PBF argued that sustainable economic recovery could not be achieved without empowering the business community, being the backbone of employment generation, exports, and revenue creation.
PBF also raised alarm over reports suggesting that electricity tariffs may be increased further potentially up to 15 cents a dollar per unit — as a measure to address circular debt. It warned that such an increase would further burden already distressed industries and could result in widespread downsizing or closure of industrial units, deepening unemployment and economic contraction.
Additionally, the forum also expressed disappointment over the recent formation of multiple economic committees and working groups without the inclusion of elected representatives of the business community. PBF emphasised that the absence of industry voices at the policymaking table prevented the government from fully understanding ground realities and crafting effective, implementable solutions.
Looking ahead to 2026, the PBF urged the premier to provide the business community with a clear, credible, and forward-looking economic roadmap. Such clarity was essential to restore confidence, encourage investment, and enable long-term planning. 
It emphasised that if the government provided an initial push through competitive energy pricing, rationalised taxation, and genuine stakeholder engagement, the business community will respond by delivering economic growth, employment generation, and export expansion.

A special court sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case on Saturday. In protest, the PTI announced it would observe a black day on Sunday against the conviction, as per an announcement posted on Imran’s social media account.
Following the protest call, extensive security arrangements had been put in place in Rawalpindi, with over 1,300 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order. Though the day passed peacefully, as not a single activist of PTI appeared on the roads.
Police said that a group of political workers. led by PTI leader Seemabia Tahir and nine others. gathered on Adiala Road on Sunday night at about 9:15pm.
The protesters, nine of whom were identified in the first information report, gathered on Adiala Road near Nasir Bakery and blocked the road, causing traffic congestion and public disorder, despite the enforcement of Section 144, a legal provision prohibiting public gatherings of more than five people.
Constable Rizwan Nazir lodged an FIR with Morgah Police Station, claiming that he was on security duty when some political activists, led by Tahir and carrying PTI flags while riding on motorcycles and in cars, gathered on the road. The protesters, who were chanting slogans, blocked the road and caused traffic congestion.
The FIR stated that the protesters were carrying batons, despite the constable informing them that they were violating Section 144. Instead of responding, they began shouting slogans against the government, incited by the former PTI MPA.
The police registered the FIR on the charges of blocking the road, violating Section 144 and under Section 16 (dissemination of rumours) of the MPO. Those booked were also charged under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
Over the past several weeks, the PTI founder has been denied meetings in prison with his family, prompting his sisters and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to stage sit-ins near or outside the prison complex. These have sometimes been dispersed by police using water cannons and baton charges.</p><small>2025-12-22 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22170045b8982b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962630/local-bodies-polls-to-be-held-on-party-basis-punjab-govt-informs-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Local bodies polls to be held on ‘party basis’, Punjab govt informs LHC</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday told the Lahore High Court (LHC) that the local government (LG) elections in the province would be held on a “party basis”.
An assistant advocate general (AAG) shared this information about LG elections — which have been delayed for long and are not expected to be held before the second quarter of next year — during a hearing of petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)-backed lawmaker Sheikh Imtiaz and others, who have challenged the Punjab Local Government Act 2025 (PLGA).
Contrary to the AAG’s claim, the local government law enacted in October states that the elections are to be held on a non-party basis.
But, the AAG submitted a report on behalf of the local government secretary today, which said that any political party wishing to contest the LG polls “may allow its candidates to contest elections for any political office on its ticket”.
“Section 55 of the PLGA does not, in any manner, put any party at a disadvantage compared to others,” he said.
At that, LHC Justice Sultan Tanvir Ahmad asked whether the petitioners’ grievances had been addressed as the government itself was saying that the LG elections would be party-based.
In this regard, the petitioner’s lawyer said that if that was the case, “then our concern to the extent of one point stands resolved”.
He requested that the government’s reply be made part of the record.
Justice Ahmad also heard Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Director General (Law) Khurram Shahzad, who said the ECP was a constitutional body “ready to fulfil its duties”.
“The commission had written nearly 80 letters to the government over the past four years regarding holding local government elections and will conduct polls under whatever law the government enacted,” he maintained.
“The Punjab government had given a January 10 deadline for election preparations,” the ECP official added.
At one point, Justice Ahmad questioned why the Punjab advocate general’s office had not submitted a formal reply to the petitions challenging the local government law. He directed the advocate general to submit a reply by Tuesday.
“Certain provisions of the impugned act appear to be inconsistent with the Constitution,” the judge further observed.
He also commented that the matter needed to be decided “promptly”.
The PLGA 2025 was steamrolled from the Punjab Assembly in a matter of just five days, only after the ECP’s strong intervention and announcement to hold local government elections under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December.
LG elections in Punjab have been delayed for long and the matter goes back to 2019. In April that year, the then PTI-led Punjab government had dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.
This meant that LG elections in Punjab were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022, but it could not be made possible as the provincial government kept on amending the LG law from time to time.
This year, on Oct 8, the ECP ordered LG polls in December and asked Punjab to immediately start the delimitation exercise and complete the same within two months.
This order, however, was reversed in a meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Oct 21, in light of the new law, after a request by the Punjab government.
The ECP withdrew its original delimitation schedule for the elections issued under the 2022 local government law, giving the provincial government four weeks to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules.
On October 31, the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year as the commission would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year.
The prerequisites are scheduled to be in place by January 10, 2026, following which the ECP would begin the delimitation process.
For its part, the opposition PTI said the new LG law was a sheer violation of Article 140 of the Constitution and decided to challenge the law in the court.
Article 140 says, “Each province shall, by law, establish a local government system and devolve political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local governments”.</p><small>2025-12-22 14:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640894-punjab-announces-winter-vacations-for-educational-institutions' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab announces winter vacations for educational institutions</strong></a><br><p>

Opener Sameer Minhas led the way for Pakistan at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai with a breathtaking 172 to set up a massive 191-run victory for his side.
“We began a process on June 17 [this year],” recalled Shahid at a news conference in Islamabad on Monday, following the team’s arrival and a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif where a Rs10million cash award was announced.
“It was an unprecedented step … we called up 70 players, conducted trials and gave each player four matches each and then they participated in a regional One-day tournament,” he added.
“The top performers, 30 of them, then took part in a five-month long camp … that’s how the team was made.
“We wanted to play fearless but not careless cricket. We wanted a united team and the result is in front of us.”
Team mentor and manager Sarfaraz Ahmed, who led Pakistan to the Under-19 World Cup crown in 2006, hailed a “team effort”.







“We had players that had the potential to do something big,” said Sarfaraz.
“The coaches did a lot of hard work and the players responded … our job was to give them the confidence to play to their full potential. My message to them was to play their natural game, and in a way that they remember it for the rest of their lives.”
Captain Farhan Yousaf said the players had the full backing of the team management.
“We spoke about playing fearless cricket and the management backed us to play our natural game,” he said.
“We were told us that any loss will be our [management’s] concern, while any victory will be attributed to your efforts. Our morale never went down.”
Shahid pointed to the fact that the coaching staff was lucky to have been blessed with qualified players.
“In age group cricket, most of the work is on basics,” he said. “We were lucky in the sense that these players had two qualities that we only needed to polish: one that they didn’t give up and second that they were adaptable.”
Sameer’s stunning ton was naturally one of the major talking points at the news conference and the batter said that he stuck to his natural game.
“I was focused on doing well and making runs in the final and that helped me,” said Sameer.
The political rivalry between India and Pakistan, more often than not, spills onto the cricket field and Sarfaraz said he made sure his players did not make any vile gestures in response to their counterparts.
India skipped the customary handshakes; a practice they have been carrying on since the men’s Asia Cup T20 earlier this year while one of their batters, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, made a ‘shoe-pointing’ gesture after his dismissal.
