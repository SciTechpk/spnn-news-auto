Rahman, 60, an aspiring prime minister who has lived in London since he fled Bangladesh in 2008 over what he called a politically motivated persecution, is due to arrive in Dhaka on Thursday.
Acting chairman of the Bang­la­desh Nationalist Party (BNP), he is expected to take the reins from his ailing mother, 80-year-old former prime minister Khaleda Zia.
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in the February 12, 2026 elections.
But she was hospitalised soon after that pledge, and she has been in intensive care ever since.
The elections will be the first since a mass uprising last year ended the 15-year hardline rule of Sheikh Hasina, who was at odds with the BNP.
Since Hasina’s fall from power, Rahman has been acquitted of the most serious charge against him: a life sentence handed down in absentia for a 2004 grenade attack on a Hasina rally. He had denied the charges.
BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has promised Rahman will “arrive among us on the soil of Dhaka” on Dec 25, which he said will be a “fantastic day”.
Tarique Rahman, often pictured beside his mother on BNP banners, has long been groomed for leadership.
In June, he met in London with Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner leading the interim government until the February elections.
Violent politics
Rahman, known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, carries a political name that has defined his life.
Born in 1967 when the country was still East Pakistan, he was briefly detained as a child during the 1971 independence war. The BNP hails him as “one of the youngest prisoners of war”. His father, Ziaur Rahman, was an army commander.
Ziaur Rahman gained influence months after a 1975 coup in which Sheikh Hasina’s father, founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was murdered.
That fuelled lifelong tensions bet­ween the Zia and Hasina families, dubbed the “Battle of the Begums”.
Ziaur Rahman was assassinated when his son was 15. The younger Rahman grew up in his mother’s political orbit, as Zia went on to become the country’s first female prime minister, alternating her terms in power with Hasina.
Rahman briefly studied international relations at Dhaka University before entering politics at 23, joining the BNP in its fight against military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad, according to his party.
Allegations of nepotism
Still, Rahman’s career has been dogged by allegations of nepotism and mismanagement.
A 2006 US embassy cable des­cri­bed him as the BNP’s “heir apparent” who “inspires few but unnerves many”.
Other cables labelled him a “symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics” and accused him of being “phenomenally corrupt”.
Rahman was arrested on corruption charges in 2007 and claimed he was tortured in custody.
Reports suggested his release was conditional on leaving politics. Freed later that year, he flew to London in 2008 for medical treatment and never returned.
After Hasina swept to power in 2008, her government jailed tens of thousands of BNP members.
In 2018, Rahman was again sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment for allegedly orchestrating the 2004 attack on Hasina’s rally.

Sidrah Nosheen, 34, was part of an organised crime group that smuggled heroin from Pakistan into the United Kingdom and supplied it across the country, the NCA said in a statement.
Officers arrested Nosheen at her property on Woodside Road, Wyke, in June 2024. During the operation, they discovered that her back bedroom had been converted into what investigators described as a heroin processing plant.
The NCA said heroin concealed inside items of clothing including leather jackets had been delivered to Nosheen’s address. She would remove the drugs and package them into one-kilo deal bags.
During the search, officers recovered 85kg of the Class A drug in various bags, along with a wallpaper pasting table, weighing scales, buckets and other tools. Boxes containing plastic-wrapped clothing waiting to be opened were also found, as well as debris from boxes that had already been processed.
Phone evidence showed hundreds of messages between Nosheen and an accomplice in Pakistan discussing the supply of heroin to the UK. Investigators also found evidence that she distributed multi-kilogram consignments of drugs to contacts within the UK and, on one occasion, collected £250,000 for the organised crime group from a criminal in Bradford.
Nosheen was due to stand trial at Bradford Crown Court but later changed her plea, admitting conspiracy to supply heroin and conspiracy to import heroin.
She was sentenced on Tuesday.

UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has called on all sides to exercise maximum restraint and de-escalate tensions, as the United States continued to interdict vessels off the coast of Venezuela, a situation that drew sharp condemnation from China and Russia at the UN Security Council.
Pakistan’s deputy permanent representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon addressed the council during a meeting requested by Venezuela. He emphasised that the “current trajectory serves no one’s interest”.







“In a world marred by polarisation with conflicts affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions around the globe, it is all but imperative to once again underscore the centrality and inviolability of the UN Charter and its core principles,” Mr Jadoon said.
He specifically highlighted the prohibition on the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.
“We firmly believe that the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of states, as enshrined in the UN Charter, are sacrosanct,” Mr Jadoon said.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s position, he noted that while measures to counter transnational organised crime or narcotics trafficking are necessary, they must be cooperative and conform to international law. He urged engaged diplomacy to ensure the region remains a “Zone of Peace”.
The sitting laid bare deep divisions between world powers. US Ambassador Mike Waltz asserted that sanctions would be enforced to the maximum extent to deprive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of resources used to fund drug cartels.
“The United States will do everything in our considerable power to protect our hemisphere, our borders and the American people,” Waltz said, claiming oil sales enable Maduro’s “narco-terrorist activities.”
However, China and Russia slammed the US actions. Chinese envoy Sun Lei opposed “unilateralism and bullying”, demanding Washington heed the international community and uphold navigation safety.
Venezuelan Ambassador Samuel Moncada rejected the US narrative, stating the threat is not drugs or security, but a desire for Venezuela’s oil and land.
“The world knows that, if the scale of armed attacks continues, we will exercise, with all determination, our inalienable right to self-defence,” Moncada said.
UN’s Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari noted that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stands ready to support diplomatic engagement, if requested by both parties.
Council split on Iran
Meanwhile, at another UN debate, Islamabad called for diplomatic engagement to resolve the Iran nuclear issue.
“It is deeply regrettable that in recent months, divisions in the council and beyond have widened, taking us further away from the resolution of the issue,” Ambassador Jadoon told the 15-member council during a discussion on nuclear non-proliferation.







He noted the situation has been complicated by unilateral actions and differing interpretations of the “snapback” mechanism.
The council remains split over the legitimacy of holding meetings regarding the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement from which the US withdrew in 2018.
Mr Jadoon cautioned that coercive measures would not bridge the gap and often hurt ordinary citizens.
“We strongly believe that diplomacy and dialogue should be the guiding principles for the resolution of all outstanding issues concerning Iran’s nuclear program,” he said.
He emphasised that the JCPOA framework could still prove useful if parties move forward with compromise. Mr Jadoon urged the restoration of trust in diplomatic engagement and stressed the critical role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in verifying compliance.
The session marked the first meeting since France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions, citing Iran’s non-performance.
Jay Dharmadhikari, France’s deputy permanent representative, warned that Iran’s lack of implementation constitutes a “grave threat”. He added that if brought to military enrichment levels, Iran’s stockpile would be sufficient “to produce 10 nuclear explosive devices”.

Officials have confirmed that the message is false and is part of a pattern of phishing scams designed to collect sensitive personal and financial information from unsuspecting applicants.
Upon accessing the consulate’s website, the following notice was displayed.

A statement issued by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated: “The Consulate General disassociates itself from all such unauthorised individuals, agents, or entities and shall not be responsible for any loss, delay, misrepresentation, or other adverse consequences arising from engagement with them.”
The fraudulent message falsely purports to come from the consulate and directs visa applicants to submit information through links that are not authorised by the government of Pakistan.
Such scams are designed to harvest passport details, social security numbers, bank account information, and credit card data, which can later be used for identity theft, unauthorised transactions, financial fraud and other criminal activities.
The consulate strongly reiterated that Pakistani visa applications must be submitted only through the official government online portal: https://visa.nadra.gov.pk.
Visa applicants were urged to avoid intermediaries, agents, or unauthorised websites, regardless of claims of faster processing or special access.
They were also advised to be cautious when sharing personal or financial information online, with the consulate adding that requests for social security numbers, bank details, or other identity-related data in relation to visa applications should be treated as red flags.
The public was urged by the consulate to verify all information directly through official channels and to report any suspicious messages or websites to the relevant authorities.
“This advisory is being issued in the public interest to protect applicants from scams that can have devastating financial and personal consequences,” officials said.
Applicants looking for updated guidance and official visa information were instructed to visit the consulate’s website at https://pakconsulatela.org/visa-services.
The warning comes amid a sharp rise in online fraud globally. According to the US Federal Trade Commission, consumers in the United States reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a sharp increase over previous years, as scammers increasingly exploit phishing, identity theft, and impersonation tactics online.
Data also show a significant rise in credit card fraud and identity theft, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported in 2025 alone, highlighting how criminals misuse personal and financial information once it is obtained.
Cybersecurity researchers have documented an 18 per cent increase in phishing attacks in Pakistan during 2024, as criminals increasingly target individuals with deceptive links and spoofed communication.
Courts in the United States and other countries have sentenced individuals involved in multi-million-dollar phishing and fraud schemes, where victims — often targeted through impersonation and phishing — were defrauded of large sums.
Officials noted that victims of similar scams have, in some cases, lost their entire life savings, as stolen data is used to gain access to bank accounts, obtain fraudulent loans, or conduct unauthorised transfers.</p><small>2025-12-25 02:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2507273806b6d39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963123/fauji-fertiliser-company-joins-winning-consortium-after-pia-auction' target='_blank'><strong>Fauji Fertiliser Company joins winning consortium after PIA auction</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC) on Wednesday decided to join a consortium led by the Arif Habib Corporation Limited, which emerged as the winning bidder for the acquisition of a 75 per cent stake in Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Tuesday.
Confirming the development, Arif Habib told Dawn that FFC had joined his consortium and that discussions were under way to finalise the terms and conditions of the partnership.
FFC was one of the four bidders for the acquisition of a 75pc stake in PIA, but it withdrew from the bidding process ahead of the submission and opening of bids.
Under the conditions, a bidder that withdraws has the right to join the winning consortium, subject to meeting the criteria set by the Privatisation Commission.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muha­mmad Ali welcomed the move, saying it would strengthen the consortium both financially and in terms of management depth, expertise and global linkages.
“PIA will require a financially and operationally sound consortium if we want to make it a global leader in aviation.
“The participation of Fauji Fertiliser will help in achieving this ambition and is an encouraging development,” he said.
Earlier, during a press conference, Mr Ali described Fauji Fertiliser as a sound and strong group with management expertise and presence.
“If they join, the buyer group will be further strengthened,” he said.

ISLAMABAD: A day after PM Shehbaz Sharif reiterated the government’s willingness to engage in a political dialogue, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) exp­ressed its willingness to engage in such a process, albeit conditionally.
At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
But if the spokesperson for the country’s main opposition party is to be believed, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is not interested in sitting across the table from the government.
A meeting of opposition leaders was held on Wednesday, chaired by PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and attended by Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Sajid Tareen, Asad Qaiser, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, and Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai, among others.







Talking to Dawn, TTAP deputy chief Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that Wednesday’s huddle had resolved to hold talks with the government.
Participants also agreed on the need for a new charter to address the country’s political and financial issues and the spiralling law and order situation, in order to give hope to the despondent masses.
However, it was made clear that the dialogue process must have some clear goals.
“The dialogue will be held for holding the transparent elections in future, appointment of chief elections commissioner with consensus, supremacy of the parliament, rule of law, assurance of human rights, and democratic and constitutional norms,” Mr Khokhar said.

 

He said that Mr Achakzai has also held a meeting with Aleema Khan, Imran Khan’s sister, to discuss the proposal with her.
It is worth mentioning that Mr Achakzai had previously assured National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq that all political parties would agree to restore the 1973 Constitution, he would be responsible for making sure that Imran Khan would sign on to the initiative.
PTI stands firm
But taking a diametrically opposite view, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram claimed that the party would steer clear of any negotiations with the federal government on the orders of Imran Khan himself.
Speaking to ARY News a day earlier, Mr Akram – when asked if the PTI wants to negotiate with the government – categorically said that the party was “not interested”.
“I met Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and he said that Imran instructed the party not to engage with the government in any way,“ he explained.
However, in the same breath, he clarified that Mr Achakzai or Allama Raja Nasir have the authority to decide whether or not they want to talk.
Mr Akram said that the two opposition alliance leaders would decide how to respond to the government’s invitation. He added that, while speaking with the TTAP, he noted that other “friends” within the alliance are in favour of talks.
The party spokesperson also claimed that the same two men would also decide whether to call for a protest, or not.
“Since Imran Khan instructed the PTI against starting talks, under the directions of Salman Akram Raja, we rejected the offer,” he said.

ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: The controversy surrounding the recently enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025 intensified on Wednesday as various lawyers’ associations — irrespective of their political affiliation — endorsed the Lahore High Court’s intervention to suspend its implementation.
Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warraich strongly condemned the statement made by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in which she reportedly sought to justify the law empowering deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes.
The Punjab chief minister had argued that the law was enacted to provide long-awaited relief to millions of citizens suffering from prolonged land and property disputes.
On Dec 22, LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspended the operation of the law and announced that a full bench would be constituted to hear and decide the matter.
The PBC vice chairman stated that the enactment of the law questioned the jurisdiction of patwaris and “unlawfully” empowered assistant commissioners beyond their mandate.
He commended the LHC’s interim order, stating that the new law would dismantle the civil justice system, undermine civil rights and erode judicial supremacy, as it allowed a revenue officer to hand over possession of property in a matter pending before a civil court.
Mr Warraich said the judiciary had the exclusive mandate to interpret laws, and the LHC chief justice was fully competent to pass such an interim order. He added that the legal fraternity stood with the chief justice and the judiciary in support of the ruling against the legislation.
PBC member Ahsan Bhoon, who also heads the Independent Group, urged the chief minister to withdraw her statement regarding the suspension of the law.
Speaking to the media at the Lahore High Court, he said those who drafted the law and provided flawed advice were responsible for the situation.
Mr Bhoon termed the chief minister’s remarks about the chief justice ‘inappropriate’ and warned that lawyers would take to the streets if the government continued with its actions.
SCBA
Similarly, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Haroonur Rashid, Secretary Malik Zahid Aslam Awan and the 28th cabinet of the association maintained that the legislation was not only “unconstitutional and unlawful” but also in “conflict” with the Civil Procedure Code, Criminal Procedure Code, Evidence Act and other relevant laws, rendering them ineffective.
The SCBA cabinet appreciated the high court’s interim order suspending the enforcement of the legislation and noted that the LHC chief justice had recognised that it compromised settled legal principles concerning property matters.
“It has established a parallel jurisprudence whereby property disputes are to be resolved by deputy commissioners, district police officers, revenue officers, and other relevant government officials, rather than through judicial proceedings, which by no means is lawful,” the statement read.
The SCBA also expressed grave concern regarding the Punjab government and its chief minister, who allegedly appeared to be surrounded by aides “protecting the interests of land mafia and land grabbers”.
It said it fully endorsed the high court’s decision and extended complete support to the LHC chief justice, adding that criticism of the interim order was unfounded and unnecessary.
The association urged the provincial government to refrain from “implementing the unlawful aspirations of land mafias”.
LHCBA
The Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) also welcomed the chief justice’s decision against the property ownership law.
LHCBA President Asif Nissoana, who belongs to the Hamid Khan-led professional group, asked the government to refrain from appeasing land mafias.
‘Full bench’
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi Bench referred a constitutional challenge to the property protection legislation to the LHC chief justice for the constitution of a full bench, observing that identical questions of law were already pending before the court.
Justice Jawad Hassan passed the order while hearing a petition filed by Tariq Mehmood against the Punjab government and others, in which the vires of proceedings initiated by the district administration under the newly enacted law were called into question.
The court was informed that the LHC CJ had already referred an identical matter for adjudication by a full bench.
Consequently, invoking Chapter 3, Part-B, Rule 4-A of the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders (Volume V), Justice Hassan referred the present petition to the LHC chief justice for appropriate orders.
During the hearing, the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner and assistant commissioner defended the initiation of proceedings under the law, maintaining that its preamble aimed to protect lawful ownership of immovable property and to provide expeditious remedies against illegal dispossession.
They added that action was being taken under Sections 7, 9, and 10 of the law, including the referral of disputes to a deputy commissioner-led dispute resolution committee and the adoption of preventive measures such as taking surety or sealing property.
However, the counsels for the petitioner argued that the tribunal envisaged under the law had neither been notified nor made functional, rendering all proceedings unlawful.
They also contended that Sections 8(4) and 8(5), which conferred civil court-like powers on dispute resolution committees, were ultra vires the Constitution.
An objection was also raised to the vaguely defined “preventive measures” under Section 9, for which, they said, no proper procedure or remedy had been provided.

ISLAMABAD: The government has approved a pilot electricity auction that will allow power to be bought and sold through competition, while also end­o­r­sing steps towards integrated energy planning a­cross the country to end fragmented decision-making.
In this regard, the Cabinet Committee on Energy on Wednesday approved framework guidelines for a “wheeling” auction of 800-megawatt of electricity under the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Model (CTBCM).

 

Wheeling refers to the use of the national electricity grid to deliver power from a generator to a buyer. Big factories or companies may buy electricity directly from a producer, but they still need the grid wires to get it. The fee they pay for using those wires is called wheeling and grid charges.
The meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also decided to end future procurement of power generation capacity in the public sector and constituted an 18-member steering committee of federal and provincial bureaucrats to lead integrated energy planning (IEP) — a push to bring electricity, oil, gas and other energy planning under a single coordinated national approach.
Under the framework guidelines, 800MW of generation capacity would be sold through a competitive auction for five years. The quantum would gradually increase after the initial trial, subject to government approval.
The auction is being developed under CTBCM, a system in which power producers and buyers deal directly with each other, rather than the government acting as the main middleman. In plain words, electricity is bought and sold like a market, not fully controlled by the government.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) would determine the wheeling and grid charges for bulk power consumers upon a uniform petition to be filed by the distribution companies under the guidance of the power division.
An indicative wheeling charge of about Rs12.55 per unit may come into force, although industrial consumers are contesting it as too high and rendering their products uncompetitive.
The guidelines require the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO) — a new entity created under the Power Division — to issue the auction process with Nepra’s approval.
ISMO will issue an auction calendar and detailed procedures. The framework does not allow a minimum or maximum limit on bid prices (no “cap” or “floor”), and the bid price is to remain fixed for one year.
The guidelines also delineate the roles and responsibilities for the implementing agencies, including Nepra, ISMO and auction participants, and govern the entire structure of the CTBCM.
Under the timelines agreed with the IMF, approval of these guidelines for auction was targeted for December and approval of uniform wheeling charges by Nepra in January 2026.
An official statement said the resident committee of the top civil-military forum — the Special Investment Facilitation Council — had decided to have an integrated energy plan through federal and provincial coordination under the umbrella of the Power Division of the Ministry of Energy.
“A consequential determination has been reached regarding electricity wheeling within the country, thereby laying the foundation for the inception and advancement of a competitive energy market,” an official statement said, adding that approvals had been extended to the competitive bidding process, participant engagement and other pertinent aspects.
This encompasses auth­or­isation for the CTBCM framework pertaining to electricity auctions, it said, adding that “consistent with the government’s pledges, no further electricity procurement agreements shall be entered into”, formally disengaging the government from electricity procurement activities.
The clearance for IEP governance by the Cabinet Committee on Energy on Wednesday would be followed by the notification of an IEP steering committee before the close of the current month.
Next, the cabinet committee will approve IEP’s high-level design by February 2026, to be followed by its model workshops across the country by October 2026, leading to formal approval of the National Integrated Energy Plan (NIEP) by the committee by April 2027.
The IEP steering committee, led by the power minister and co-chaired by the petroleum minister, would comprise about nine federal secretaries, four provincial chief secretaries and the chairpersons of Nepra, Ogra and Wapda.
The committee would ensure wide participation of relevant stakeholders for IEP and facilitate its implementation through the resolution of inter-sectoral, federal and provincial departmental issues and align it with national development priorities, including net-zero transitions.
The Cabinet Committee on Energy also directed the development and institutionalisation of the Energy Information System by the Power Division through its Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) to provide data-based decision-making support to the government, including the “IEP Ecosystem”.
The EIS will cover capacity building, governance improvements, monitoring, policy formulation, integration of plans and policies, modelling and scenario-based planning. It added that planning activities would be executed in a unified manner through a single entity, PPMC.
The NIEP is expected to adopt a cross-sector approach, covering oil, gas, coal, water and hydropower, minerals, natural resources and renewables on the supply side, and residential, commercial, industrial, transport and agriculture needs on the demand side.
The plan is also expected to gradually incorporate an artificial intellgence-based decision-support system to create a “single source of truth” and avoid conflicting figures across institutions.

Docks police, in a statement, said that the male victim was gunned down while his wife was shot and injured by her father inside a home near Ayesha Masjid in Machar Colony.
The body and the injured woman were shifted to Civil Hospital Karachi, and further investigation is underway, the statement added. However, the woman passed away during treatment, said Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
South-DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the couple had married of their own free will and had a four-month-old daughter. They had been living in a rented house in Machar Colony for the last five months.
During the initial probe, it emerged that the deceased woman had phoned her father three days ago, Raza said. The father was living with her.
The couple was asleep when the suspect gunned down his son-in-law and injured his daughter and then fled the scene.
The police collected four spent bullet casings from the crime scene, the DIG said.
Earlier in December, a woman and her teenage daughter were stabbed to death over “honour” in the Gizri area of Karachi.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-12-24 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24200445b55f7f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962998/punjab-assembly-passes-kite-flying-regulation-bill' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly passes kite flying regulation bill</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly on Thursday passed the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025, with a majority vote, introducing a comprehensive legal framework to regulate kite flying across the province to protect human life and property.
The bill, which cleared the assembly’s Standing Committee on Home Affairs on December 15, proposed a near-total ban on kite-flying, except on specific days and designated locations across the province, with strict penalties to curb fatal accidents and property damage.
The bill will now be sent to the governor for his signature to make it an act of the provincial assembly.
Under the new regulations, the use of metallic wire, nylon string, and chemically or glass-coated kite strings has been completely banned. It prescribes strict punishments for flying, manufacturing, storing, or selling kites without permission.
According to the bill, violating the restrictions on kite flying may result in imprisonment ranging from three to five years, a fine of up to Rs2 million, or both.
Manufacturing or selling kites and prohibited strings carries even harsher penalties, including five to seven years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs5m.
In cases where children are found violating the law, action will be taken under the Juvenile Justice System Act 2018. If fines imposed on minors are not paid, authorities will be empowered to recover the amount from parents or legal guardians as arrears.
The offences under the law have been declared non-bailable and cognizable.
Deputy commissioners have been authorised to grant conditional permission for kite flying on specified days and at designated locations. During permitted kite flying, mandatory safety measures for motorcyclists will be enforced.
It further makes registration compulsory for the manufacturing and sale of approved kites and strings. Selling kites or permitted equipment without registration may result in imprisonment from one to five years, a fine, or both.
Police have also been empowered to make arrests without a warrant in such cases. Officers with the rank of sub-inspector or above have been authorised to conduct searches and seize prohibited material.
The bill added that the provincial government may also grant arrest and search powers to other agencies and a formal mechanism has been introduced for the registration and cancellation of kite flying associations, with deputy commissioners empowered to revoke registrations in case of violations.
It also provides a multi-tier right of appeal at the magistrate, deputy commissioner, and commissioner levels. It includes a provision for rewarding informers with up to Rs5,000 for reporting violations.
The new legislation repeals the Punjab Prohibition of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2001 and grants the government full authority to frame rules, regulations, and guidelines for the effective implementation of the law.
As per the rules, which were notified last Sunday, kite manufacturers, traders or sellers of authorised kite flying material must apply to the DC and provide specified documents.
Kite flying associations can also register themselves with the DCs concerned through an online application by the association president or general secretary.
The DCs must verify the contents of applications and documents within 10 days of receiving them. Upon verification, the DC shall decide the application and issue a certificate of registration having a one-year validity.
Specifications for permitted kites were also shared. A ‘patang’ shall not exceed 35 inches in width and 30 inches in length, while a ‘gudda’ cannot exceed 40 inches in width and 34 inches in length.
‘Dor’ (string) must be made of cotton with not more than nine threads and no less than 28 counts. The string must be wound in the shape of a ball, since spools are prohibited.
The Punjab government lifted a ban on the Basant festival after 18 years, with the festival slated to be celebrated in February next year. It was banned in 2007 because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp kite strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders.</p><small>2025-12-24 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24184832e235916.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962993/pcb-receives-12-bids-for-two-new-psl-franchises' target='_blank'><strong>PCB receives 12 bids for two new PSL franchises</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday announced that it has received an “exceptional and encouraging” response to its tender for the sale of two new franchises of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), with 12 parties submitting bids within the stipulated deadline.
This comes after the bidding deadline was extended multiple times — initially from December 15 to December 22, and further to December 24 — amid growing interest from investors in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and beyond, following promotional roadshows in London and New York.
The development marks a significant step in the league’s expansion to eight teams from the 2026 season — its first major restructuring since the addition of Multan Sultans in 2018 brought the total to six franchises.
According to the PCB, the bidders hail from five countries — the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan — underscoring the league’s growing global footprint and commercial appeal.
Pakistan-based solar power company Inverex Power Solution, a long-time sponsor of the PSL, also confirmed on Wednesday that it will be bidding for one of the two new franchises.
Reports suggest other interested parties include telecom companies, real estate groups, and consortia involving US-based Pakistani businessmen.
The PCB said the outcome of the initial phase of the bidding process will be announced on December 27. In the next stage, bidders who meet the technical requirements will be invited to take part in an open competition bidding process for the acquisition of the two new teams.
This phase is scheduled to be held on January 8 at the Islamabad Convention Centre.
The PCB reiterated its commitment to conducting the entire process in a transparent and competitive manner, in line with international standards, with the aim of ensuring the sustained expansion and long-term growth of the PSL.
The expansion follows the conclusion of the original 10-year franchise agreements after the 2025 edition, during which five of the existing six teams — Islamabad United, Karachi Kings, Lahore Qalandars, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators — renewed their rights under revised valuations conducted by Ernst & Young.
The status of Multan Sultans remains unresolved amid ongoing disputes.
The successful bidders for the new teams will select from a shortlist of cities including Hyderabad, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Gilgit, Muzaffarabad and Sialkot.
The 11th edition of the PSL is scheduled to run from March 26 to May 3, 2026, overlapping with the Indian Premier League, in the April-May window aimed at improving overseas player availability.
The tournament will feature a revised format to accommodate the eight teams within a 39-day period, with matches potentially spread across additional venues including Faisalabad.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641327-pti-rejects-pm-shehbazs-offer-for-negotiations' target='_blank'><strong>'Doors of negotiations should never be closed': Opposition seeks 'serious' talks with govt</strong></a><br><p>

The incident occurred when an exchange of fire erupted between the two sides during a confrontation, claiming the life of Constable Islamuddin Wazir, who was deployed on law-and-order duty in the local market.
“He sustained critical injuries and succumbed on the spot,“ said police.
“Constable Islamuddin Wazir was performing his official duties to maintain peace and public safety when he was hit by bullets during the crossfire,” said police officials.
Following the incident, panic spread in the marketplace, prompting police to immediately cordon off the area and bring the situation under control.
City Police Station Wana SHO Razaullah Wazir confirmed that two suspects involved in the firing had been arrested and taken to the station, where an FIR has been registered at the CTD South Waziristan police station.
DSP Wana Imranullah stated, “Under the directives of the DPO, raids were underway to arrest other suspects and bring all those responsible to justice.”
The funeral prayers of the martyred constable were offered with full state honours at Police Lines, Wana, attended by senior government and police officials, family members, and a large number of local elders.
After the funeral prayers, the body of Constable Islamuddin Wazir was transported to his native village, Sanga in Tehsil Shakai, where he was laid to rest.
Police in Lower South Waziristan paid tribute to the sacrifice of the martyred constable and reiterated their resolve that “the sacrifices of martyrs would not go in vain.”
“Efforts to protect the lives and property of citizens and maintain peace in the district will continue with full commitment,” they stated.
Meanwhile, local political and social circles expressed deep sorrow over the incident and called for a “strict ban” on the display and use of weapons in Rustam Bazaar and other markets to prevent similar incidents in the future.
A few months ago, the residents had voiced their concerns against the open display of firearms and the free movement of armed men in the Rustam Bazaar area, an important commercial hub of Lower South Waziristan.
They accused police and other law enforcement agencies of being mere spectators while influential and armed individuals enjoyed complete impunity. They said this environment had created a growing sense of insecurity and fear among the public.
A shutter-down strike had also been observed in May, with hundreds of people taking to the streets in Wana against the deteriorating law and order situation, rising incidents of abductions for ransom, extortion, and bomb blasts.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24181831a95bcb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962995/in-pictures-the-world-prepares-for-holiday-festivities-on-christmas-eve' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: The world prepares for holiday festivities on Christmas Eve</strong></a><br><p>As Christmas approaches, people around the globe have been preparing for the holiday season by buying decorations and food, praying, and presenting gifts to one another.

Ever since Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to go into space in 1961, Russia has prided itself as a leading power in space exploration, but in recent decades it has fallen behind the United States and, increasingly, China.
Russia’s ambitions suffered a massive blow in August 2023 when its unmanned Luna-25 mission smashed into the surface of the moon while attempting to land, and Elon Musk has revolutionised the launch of space vehicles - once a Russian speciality.
Is that a nuclear reactor on the moon?
Russia’s state space corporation, Roscosmos, said in a statement that it planned to build a lunar power plant by 2036 and signed a contract with the Lavochkin Association aerospace company to do it.
Roscosmos did not say explicitly that the plant would be nuclear but it said the participants included Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom and the Kurchatov Institute, Russia’s leading nuclear research institute.
Roscosmos said the purpose of the plant was to power Russia’s lunar programme, including rovers, an observatory and the infrastructure of the joint Russian-Chinese International Lunar Research Station.
“The project is an important step towards the creation of a permanently functioning scientific lunar station and the transition from one-time missions to a long-term lunar exploration programme,” Roscosmos said.
The head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Bakanov, said in June that one of the corporation’s aims was to put a nuclear power plant on the moon and to explore Venus, known as earth’s “sister” planet.
The moon, which is 384,400 km (238,855 miles) from our planet, moderates the earth’s wobble on its axis, which ensures a more stable climate. It also causes tides in the world’s oceans.
US also plans a reactor on the moon
Russia is not the only one with such plans. NASA in August declared its intent to put a nuclear reactor on the moon by the first quarter of fiscal year 2030.
“We’re in a race to the moon, in a race with China to the moon. And to have a base on the moon, we need energy,” US Transport Secretary Sean Duffy said in August, when asked about the plans.
He added that the United States was currently behind in the race to the moon. He said energy was essential to allow life to be sustained on the moon and thence for humans to get to Mars.
International rules ban putting nuclear weapons in space but there are no bans on putting nuclear energy sources into space - as long as they comply with certain rules.
Some space analysts have predicted a lunar gold rush: NASA says there are estimates of a million tonnes of Helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on earth, on the moon.
Rare earth metals - used in smartphones, computers and advanced technologies - are also present on the moon, including scandium, yttrium and the 15 lanthanides, according to research by Boeing.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24180136968d173.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962988/4-children-injured-in-quadcopter-attack-in-kps-kurram' target='_blank'><strong>4 children injured in quadcopter attack in KP’s Kurram</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: At least four children were injured in the Gondalabad area of Kurram district on Wednesday after a quadcopter attack, said official sources.
For months, militants in the region have used quadcopters to drop explosives on security forces and the current year has seen an increase in such attacks.
In today’s attack, a quadcopter released its explosive payload over a residential area. As a result, three boys and a girl sustained injuries, confirmed official sources.
The injured minors were shifted to a nearby medical facility for medical treatment.
Security sources condemned the attack, calling it “an act of violence against innocent civilians and children”.
“Such incidents reflect a deliberate targeting of non-combatants and have nothing to do with religion or humanitarian values,” they added.
An investigation into the incident is underway, while security in the area has been tightened following the attack.
Last week, two women and two teenagers were injured in a quadcopter attack in the Janikhel area of Bannu district. A week before the Bannu attack, another attack in the same area injured four people, including two children.
Earlier in the month, three boys were killed, and another was injured when a quadcopter crashed in a residential area of Mamand Khel in Bannu.
Also in December, at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground in Lakki Marwat.</p><small>2025-12-24 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2419173588af668.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962990/military-top-brass-says-no-malicious-interest-political-or-otherwise-will-be-tolerated' target='_blank'><strong>Military top brass says no malicious interest, political or otherwise, will be tolerated</strong></a><br><p>The military’s top brass on Wednesday vowed that no malicious interest, political or otherwise, aimed at undermining national unity would be tolerated, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
These remarks were made at the 273rd Corps Commanders’ Conference, which was convened at General Headquarters (GHQ) Rawalpindi and chaired by Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“The forum categorically rejected the nexus between terrorism, crime, and vested political interests,” the ISPR’s statement read.
“It resolved that no malicious interest, political or otherwise, aimed at undermining national unity, security and stability would be tolerated, nor would anyone be allowed to create divisions between the Armed Forces and the people of Pakistan.”
Paying tribute to security personnel martyred in counter-terrorism operations and civilians who “laid down their lives in recent terrorist incidents”, the forum noted that Pakistan’s gradual progress towards stability, greater opportunities and respect was the product of a joint effort by the government, the military and law enforcement agencies (LEAs).

The army high command also conducted a comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment, with particular emphasis on evolving threats and operational preparedness.
“The participants reaffirmed that all terrorists under the tutelage of Indian sponsors, along with their facilitators and abettors, would be dealt with decisively and without exception,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, the participants also appreciated the Balochistan Special Development Initiatives, which the ISPR said in the statement are “directed towards local empowerment and social engagements to address challenges of terrorism related to governance”.
“The participants noted the need for similar public-centric initiatives elsewhere, also in line with [the] National Action Plan, to ensure enduring peace and stability,” the statement read.
The ISPR further said that the forum reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to Kashmiri and Palestinian self-determination, additionally calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, uninterrupted humanitarian access and a clear path to Palestinian statehood.
“In his concluding remarks, the COAS and CDF directed commanders to maintain the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, training, physical fitness, technological innovations and battlefield adaptability,” the statement read.
“He expressed full confidence in Pakistan Army’s capability to effectively counter [the] complete spectrum of threats, ranging from conventional and sub-conventional to hybrid and asymmetric challenges, while steadfastly safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><small>2025-12-24 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2418271362c77d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962989/un-expert-decries-bushra-bibis-detention-urges-communication-with-lawyers-family' target='_blank'><strong>UN expert decries Bushra Bibi’s detention; urges communication with lawyers, family</strong></a><br><p>A United Nations (UN) expert on Wednesday warned that Bushra Bibi, the wife of former prime minister Imran Khan, is being “detained in circumstances that could pose a serious risk to her physical and mental integrity”.
Bushra is serving a seven-year sentence in the £190 million corruption case. She was recently sen­tenced to 17 years’ imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case, which revolved around the purchase of an expensive jewelry set gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during his May 2021 visit.
“The state has an obligation to protect Mrs. Khan’s health and ensure conditions of detention compatible with human dignity,” Alice Jills Edwards, the UN Special Rapporteur, said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
Earlier in May, the Adiala prison administration submitted a detailed report to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), stating that Bushra was receiving a range of special facilities at the prison, with accommodation provided to her under the Pakistan Prison Rules 1978, including medical care, private lodging, and access to entertainment and legal resources.
According to the report, Bushra had been afforded amenities aimed at ensuring her “health, comfort, and legal rights”.
Bushra has access to a dedicated woman medical officer who conducts twice-daily health checks. She has also been provided with a private, spacious room equipped with a cot, mattress, furniture, and climate-control measures such as ceiling fans and an air cooler during summer, the report added.
The UN special rapporteur added that the “conditions and locations of detention must take into account the age, sex and health circumstances of detainees”.
UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself.
Edwards claimed that Bushra was “frequently placed in near-total isolation for more than 22 hours a day, sometimes for periods exceeding ten days, without access to exercise, reading material, legal counsel, family visits, or her personal physicians.”
The UN expert further urged the authorities to ensure that the former first lady could “communicate with her lawyers, receive visits from family members, and have meaningful human contact throughout her detention.”
Earlier this month, the same UN special rapporteur warned that Imran was being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.</p><small>2025-12-24 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24193644cce0dbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962996/post-pregnancy-yoga-tips-every-new-mother-should-know' target='_blank'><strong>Post-pregnancy yoga tips every new mother should know</strong></a><br><p>Motherhood begins with immense joy, but soon, physical and mental exhaustion step in. The body feels unfamiliar, and the mind rides an emotional roller coaster. In the middle of sleepless nights and feeding schedules, self-care quietly fades away. The “baby blues” often step in, leaving many mothers feeling fragile and overwhelmed. Yet, recovery is not a luxury but a necessity. And that’s where post-pregnancy yoga steps in. It serves as a gentle bridge between healing the body and calming the mind.
From hormonal fluctuations to weakened core and pelvic muscles, after childbirth, a woman’s body undergoes dramatic changes. Back pain, fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings are common complaints. In today’s fast-paced world, many mothers feel pressured to “get back in shape” quickly, but healing takes time, and the body deserves patience.
Yoga offers far more than physical exercise, as it is a complete system of self-recovery. Gentle asanas strengthen the pelvic floor, back, and abdominal muscles. Breathing practices calm the mind and uplift mood, while relaxation improves sleep and restores energy.
Many new mothers regain calm and confidence within weeks of consistent practice. Even ten mindful minutes a day can bring grounding amid the beautiful chaos of motherhood.
Every woman’s recovery timeline is different. For those who had a normal delivery, gentle yoga may begin after one month. After a Caesarean birth, yoga is suggested after 4 months, with medical clearance. Begin with breath-work and restorative poses before slowly moving to core-strengthening practices.

Gentle postnatal poses for every mother
Setu Bandhasana (bridge pose)
This gentle backbend strengthens the lower back, glutes, and pelvic floor while opening the chest and shoulders.
How to do it: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet hip-width apart, press through your feet to lift the hips, hold for a few breaths, and then slowly lower down.
Bhujangasana (cobra pose)
The cobra pose tones the spine, opens the chest, and improves posture, often strained by breastfeeding and baby care.
How to do it: Lie face down, place palms beside the chest, inhale to lift the chest off the floor while keeping the elbows slightly bent, hold briefly, and exhale to release.
Phalakasana (plank pose)
Plank pose strengthens the core, shoulders, and arms while improving posture and endurance during postpartum recovery.
How to do it: Begin on hands and knees, extend your legs back into a straight line from head to heels, engage your core, hold for 30–60 seconds, then release. Keep your knees down at the beginning.
Navasana (boat pose)
It’s a beneficial posture for postpartum recovery as it helps engage and strengthen the core muscles. Focus on gentle tightening of the belly rather than pushing too hard. If you have had a Caesarean or are healing from abdominal separation, check with your doctor before trying the full pose.
How to do it: Sit with knees bent and feet flat, lean back slightly, lift your feet off the floor, and balance on your sitting bones. Hold for a few breaths, then relax. Start slowly with bent knees or hand support. Always consult your doctor before attempting the full pose.

Kegel exercise: The invisible strength builder
Kegel exercises are a simple yet powerful way to restore pelvic strength after childbirth. They help improve bladder control, posture, and even enhance overall confidence.
How to do it: Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Gently tighten the muscles you’d use to stop urination mid-way, hold for five seconds, then relax. Repeat about twenty times a day.
A few minutes of this invisible workout can make a remarkable difference — strengthening from within and supporting a mother’s recovery journey with grace.
Postpartum yoga is not about achieving the perfect pose or pre-pregnancy shape; it’s about finding balance, breath, and grace in your new rhythm of life.

Disclaimer: Always consult your doctor before starting yoga after childbirth. Practice under the guidance of a qualified yoga expert.

A consortium headed by the Arif Habib Corporation emerged as the top bidder in a live-televised auction for a 75 per cent stake in PIA on Tuesday, marking a breakthrough for the government’s long-delayed privatisation of the carrier.
The Arif Habib consortium offered Rs135 billion, surpassing a government reserve price of Rs100bn, in a sharp turnaround from last year’s failed sale attempt.
Muhammad Ali, the privatisation adviser to the prime minister, told Reuters in an online interview that the state expects a new owner to be running the airline by April, subject to approvals.
The process now moves to final approvals by the Privatisation Commission board and the cabinet, expected within days, with contract signing likely within two weeks and financial close after a 90-day period to meet regulatory and legal conditions.
Ali said the government would receive about Rs10bn in cash upfront and retain a 25pc stake valued at around Rs45billion.
The deal was structured to inject fresh capital into the airline rather than simply transfer ownership, he said.
“We did not want a situation where the government sells the airline, takes its money and the company still collapses,” Ali said.
The winning consortium also comprises fertiliser maker Fatima, private school network City Schools and real estate firm Lake City Holdings Limited.
Ali said Fauji Fertiliser Company did not bid but could still join the winning consortium as a partner, noting the buyer can add up to two partners including a consortium partner or a foreign airline if they meet the qualifying criteria.
Allowing partners adds financial strength and could bring global aviation expertise, he said.
Fauji Fertliser was initially in the race to acquire PIA shares but it later opted out of the bidding process.
IMF pressure
Ali said safeguards, including retained earnest money and an additional payment on signing, would allow the government to move to the second-highest bidder if the deal fails to close.
On labour, Ali said the buyer must retain all employees for 12 months after the transaction, with contracts unchanged, adding that the PIA workforce has already shrunk in recent years.
The sale is closely watched by the International Monetary Fund, which has pressed Pakistan to halt losses at state-owned enterprises.
Ali said the privatisation was a key test of Pakistan’s reform credibility with the IMF, adding that failure to offload loss-making state firms risked renewed pressure on public finances.
He said closing the deal would signal momentum on reforms and privatisations, adding that the government was working through a pipeline of future transactions once PIA closes.
‘Haven’t lost our pride’
Separately, Ali also addressed a press briefing in Islamabad, where he said the process for the “strategic sale” of PIA was initiated 20 years ago. An attempt to sell the airline had also been made last year, which unfortunately had not been successful, he recalled.
The latest attempt, which resulted in the airline’s sale, was a result of six months of persistent efforts, hard work, due diligence and cooperation of all stakeholders, he said, adding that the process was completed with the guidance of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He recalled that there was a time, around 50 years ago, when PIA was operating around 50 aircraft. The number should have increased to 100-115 by now, but the airline was presently operating just 18 planes, he added.
“We reached this stage because several mistakes have been committed in the past, over the years,” Ali said, adding that the private sector was best-suited to run such businesses. “It‘s not the government’s job to run businesses.”
He further stated that now private entities would invest in the airline, more planes would be added to its fleet, aircraft would be revamped and service quality would improve.
Ali once again lauded PM Shehbaz for his guidance and support, adding that CDF Munir also played an “important role” and there was “total commitment from his side. He also guided us”.
He also acknowledged the support from Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and other members of the cabinet.
Ali also addressed the criticism on the transaction, adding that it was being said that the government was to receive just Rs10bn from the total bidding amount.
Under the transaction arrangement for PIA’s privatisation, the government is to get 7.5pc of the total bidding amount, which adds up to around Rs10bn, and the rest 92.5pc is to be injected back into the airline.
But, Ali contended that the government was getting a “value of Rs55bn”.
He explained: “The most difficult task in this transaction was to ensure that while selling PIA, we ensure that the new buyer invests money back into the company. So, we had to achieve both objectives.
“So our structuring was such that we get Rs10bn in cash and the value of our equities is Rs45bn. So the government will get a value of Rs55bn in total, and Rs125bn will flow back into PIA.
“In total, the valuation of PIA is Rs180bn.”
During a detailed presentation about the history of PIA, Ali pointed out that from 2015 to 2024, the airline incurred losses of Rs500bn over a period of 10 years.
In this connection, he said the government was being criticised for removing liabilities.
But, “who would buy this (PIA) with all those losses?” Ali questioned..
Defending the airline‘s privatisation and identifying areas where it had been lagging, he remarked, “We haven‘t lost our pride. There is no pride in owning airlines. But, pride is lost when our airline’s [aircraft] don‘t fly. Who knows, after a year or two the airline maybe wouldn’t have been able to [carry out] flights.”
The airline, he asserted, was privatised at the right time.
Referring to Arif Habib Corporation’s statement that they were planning to expand the PIA fleet up to 65 aircraft in four years, he said, “We can see how the thinking is changing.“
He also maintained that the impression that there were no liabilities in PIA was incorrect. “We are transferring RS180bn liabilities to the new buyer,” the PM’s adviser said.
He explained that the government had only removed the long-term debt otherwise, nobody would have invested in buying the airline.
Now, following PIA‘s sale, the government would initially get two-thirds of the total payment from the buyer and later the rest of the amount. Until one-third of the payment was made in the second installment, the buyer’s shares would remain pledged with the government.
“We have also taken standby letters of credit and a demand promissory note. So we have ensured that the government is protected,” he detailed, further stating that some privileges were offered to the buyers that “are necessary to run a business in a profitable manner”.
The buyer was exempted from general sales tax payment, and no other taxes, levies or surchage would be imposed on airline operations, Ali said, adding that companies part of the winning consortium would also establish a special purpose vehicle to avoid double taxation.
Moreover, the successful bidder had access to a large captive market, he said.</p><small>2025-12-24 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641298-uae-president-to-pay-first-official-visit-to-pakistan-on-dec-26' target='_blank'><strong>UAE president to pay first official visit to Pakistan on Dec 26</strong></a><br><p>

This will be the second time the Emirati president will visit Pakistan this year, having met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Rahim Yar Khan in January. However, Friday’s trip, according to the FO, will be his first official visit as president.
According to the statement, President Al-Nahyan will review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations with PM Shehbaz and the pair will “exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interest”.
“The visit will provide an important opportunity to further strengthen the longstanding brotherly relations between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates,” the FO said.
The FO added that the visit reflects the depth of bilateral relations between both nations and their shared commitment to bolster collaboration in key areas, including trade, investment, energy, development and regional stability.







Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties, strengthened by historical connections and a large Pakistani expatriate community in the Emirates.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and a key source of remittances, with thousands of Pakistanis working in various sectors. Both countries collaborate on defence, energy, and investment projects, with the UAE frequently providing financial aid and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.
In April this year, Pakistan and the UAE signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen bonds between the people of both nations.
Two of the MoUs were for cooperation in the field of culture and the establishment of a joint committee for consular affairs, according to the report.
The third MoU was signed between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.</p><small>2025-12-24 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641288-pakistan-taught-india-unforgettable-lesson-in-may-war-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan taught India unforgettable lesson in May war: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

He made the remarks while addressing a press briefing at his office, where he gave a detailed breakdown of the overall law and order situation in the district and operations carried out against terrorist elements.
According to the DIG, Bannu police conducted comprehensive, well-organised and result-oriented operations against militants.
He said the data showed that during 2025, a total of 134 terrorist attacks targeted police stations, police posts, checkpoints, police mobiles and police parties.
In these attacks, 27 police personnel were martyred, while 79 sustained injuries. In retaliatory action by police, 53 terrorists were killed and 163 were injured, he said.
The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists and the elimination of 65 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said.
He further stated that police and security forces jointly conducted successful operations in the areas of Miryan, Haved, Daud Shah, Mamand Khel and Domel. During these joint operations, one police constable was martyred while 11 police personnel and five civilians were injured, he said.
As a result of these operations, 22 terrorists were killed and four were arrested, and several terrorist hideouts and houses were also demolished.
He also said that terrorists had carried out 20 drone attacks targeting police installations and civilian populations, in which 19 police personnel were injured. Further, nine civilians were martyred and 33 were injured, he said.
However, following the installation of an anti-drone system on July 18, a significant improvement was observed, with over 300 drone attacks thwarted and four drones neutralised.

 

DIG Khan said that despite limited resources, various security measures were implemented to protect police installations, including the installation of barriers, bunkers, double boundary walls, bullet-proof gates and CCTV cameras.
He said that work had also begun on the Safe City Project to further enhance the safety of both police personnel and the general public.
He added that for coordinated action against terrorists, jirgas were held with local elders in different areas, yielding positive results, and peace committees were formed.
With public cooperation, militant attacks on several police stations and checkposts were successfully thwarted, while effective operations were carried out in Kakki, Bharath, Khojri, Bargantu, Sheikh Landak, and other areas, he said.
According to the DIG, in order to align Bannu police with modern requirements, the force had been equipped with drones, anti-drone guns, sniper rifles, armoured personnel carriers (APCs), thermal imaging systems, tactical helmets and bullet-proof vehicles.
He reaffirmed his commitment that Bannu police would continue its struggle to maintain law and order in the district, efforts to eliminate terrorism, and ensure the protection of the lives and property of the public.</p><small>2025-12-24 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24111943dcb0a9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962969/asif-says-govt-satisfied-with-pia-sale-sees-it-having-great-symbolic-value' target='_blank'><strong>Asif says govt satisfied with PIA sale, sees it having great ‘symbolic value’</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday said that the government was satisfied with the sale of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), adding that it had great “symbolic value”.
He expressed these views on Geo News programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ when asked whether the government was satisfied with the process.







“Yes, the government is satisfied. This is the first biggest transaction of our privatisation process. This transaction has a great symbolic value,“ he said, recalling that previously First Women Bank had also been privatised but that transaction was not as big.
A consortium led by the Arif Habib group won the auction for a controlling stake in Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) on Tuesday with a bid of Rs135 billion after a competitive, televised process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
The sale is a central plank of the government’s plan to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises and a key condition under Pakistan’s $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout programme.
Speaking about the matter on ‘Geo Pakistan’, Asif said the PIA sale had “symbolic value because of the history of this transaction“.
Four years ago, he said, the country’s entire aviation sector had suffered following a statement by a then-minister from the PTI.
He was apparently referring to former aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement in June 2020 during a parliamentary session. Khan had said investigations revealed that more than 262 of the country’s 860 active pilots either held fake licences or had cheated in their exams.
Following the then-minister’s statement, European and UK authorities had ban­ned PIA from their territories, which were the airline’s most profitable routes. A number of foreign airlines had also grounded Pak­istani-origin pilots over concerns about their licences.
The developments followed the crash of a PIA flight from Lahore near Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­national Airport in 2020, killing around 100 people.
Asif said these events had led to PIA going “almost bankrupt”, adding that the government then restructured the company. “The government itself owned a big portion of its liability and only nominal liability remained,“ he said. “Against this backdrop, yesterday’s transaction is a very successful one.”
He also credited the civil aviation department for its considerable contribution in the matter and seeing the transaction through. “We went through a painstaking process,” he said, adding that PIA was now operating flights to Manchester.
The minister further stated that the airline now also had permission to operate flights to Birmingham and London, but it did not have aircraft for those flights. Similarly, he continued, PIA now also had permission to operate flights to New York and around 14-15 destinations in Europe.
The defence minister also appeared to be defending the arrangement under which the government is to receive just 7.5 per cent — around Rs10bn — of the amount from the PIA sale, saying that investing a “bigger portion” back into the airline increased its value.
He said the government still held 25pc of PIA’s shares and 92.5 of the amount from the sale being invested back into the airline was actually an investment into a national asset.
“We did not give a handout to anyone,” he asserted, adding that the country had borne losses for 50-55 years following nationalisation of businesses.
He also blamed the bureaucracy for state-owned enterprises’ losses, adding that politicians likely shared some responsibility for these losses as well.
“We have to construct such transactions [as that of PIA‘s sale] to rid [the national exchequer] of these losses. We don’t have a choice. We are beggars, not the choosers,” Asif said, adding that several other transactions were to be carried out in the future.
In this connection, he also mentioned that two power distribution companies in Sindh and one each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were facing severe losses.
When the anchorperson pointed out that Asif had held Khan responsible for losses in the aviation sector in recent years and asked whether action would be taken over such matters, Asif said action would be taken.
“There is no other option. These people should be held answerable,” he said.
He said often retired bureaucrats would become part of boards of state-owned enterprises and earn in millions.
“This is an orgy of loot and plunder of the public sector that has been going on in our country for the past 55 years,” he commented. “The existence of a sick public sector is actually supported or pushed by the bureaucracy […] The government is largely responsible for it, and they [bureaucrats] are the major beneficiaries of this loot and plunder.”
Asked about over-staffing in PIA, he said even if a little more had to be paid to the employees than the actual payable amount to “get rid of them”, then it should be paid.
“Because the purpose should be to stop the continuous bleeding.”
Asked about the possibility of talks between the government and opposition, he said issues on which dialogue was to be held should be decided first.</p><small>2025-12-24 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24112922cba1800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962970/finance-minister-says-pakistans-economy-shifting-toward-export-led-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister says Pakistan’s economy shifting toward export-led growth</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that Pakistan had reached a critical turning point, with macroeconomic stability, sustained reforms, and policy continuity restoring confidence and steering the economy toward export-led, long-term growth.
In an interview with USA Today, the minister said this was opening new horizons for domestic and global investors, and positioning the country for sustainable, long-term economic growth.
He said this transition was enabled by macroeconomic stabilisation, easing inflation and improved external balances, with the government driving export-led, productivity-based growth through structural reforms, sustaining reform momentum despite challenges, and actively encouraging global investment in emerging opportunities across agriculture, minerals, technology and climate resilience.

 

He noted that, for the first time in several years, Pakistan had achieved both a primary fiscal surplus and a current account surplus, signalling a decisive shift away from the cycle of recurring deficits.
He said that strong remittance inflows had played a critical role in supporting this turnaround, while inflation had fallen sharply from a peak of 38 per cent to single-digit levels.
He also noted that foreign exchange reserves had risen to over $14.5 billion, providing import cover of approximately two-and-a-half months, while the exchange rate had remained stable, helping to restore investor confidence.
Aurangzeb emphasised that while macroeconomic stabilisation was an essential foundation, sustainable growth remained the central challenge.
He pointed out that the economic growth of 2.7pc in the previous fiscal year, though positive, was insufficient to absorb the needs of a rapidly growing population.
He underlined that Pakistan was consciously moving away from a consumption and debt-driven growth model toward an export-led strategy.
The current budget, he explained, reflected this shift through structural reforms in taxation, energy pricing, and state-owned enterprises, alongside far-reaching tariff reforms aimed at dismantling decades of protectionism and enhancing global competitiveness.
He highlighted that Pakistan was aligning its economic strategy with changing global demand patterns, identifying information technology services, textiles, and agricultural exports as key areas with strong potential.
He said efforts were also underway to simplify the tax regime for exporters and reduce bureaucratic hurdles in order to foster long-term productivity and competitiveness.
Addressing the broader reform agenda, Aurangzeb said that the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, tariff liberalisation, and restructuring of the energy sector were designed to address deep-rooted inefficiencies that had historically strained public finances.
He said that these reforms were part of a long-term vision, echoing the World Bank’s (WB) assessment of Pakistan’s potential “East Asia moment”.
He referred to the ten-year Country Partnership Framework with the WB, the first of its kind, which placed an emphasis on economic reform alongside climate resilience and population management.
The minister stressed that Pakistan’s future hinged on addressing existential challenges beyond fiscal indicators.
Population growth, climate change, child stunting, learning poverty and the exclusion of girls from education were identified as critical issues that must be tackled to safeguard the country’s long-term productive capacity, he said.
Aurangzeb stressed that increasing women’s participation in education and the workforce was both a social imperative and an economic necessity.
On climate resilience, he highlighted Pakistan’s engagement with multilateral partners to strengthen preparedness against frequent floods and droughts.
Acknowledging the risks that remain, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to staying the course of reforms despite geopolitical and domestic challenges. He emphasised that discipline, consistency, and international cooperation remained central to safeguarding recent gains.
Highlighting opportunities for investors, the minister pointed to agriculture, minerals and mining, and the emerging digital economy as priority sectors.
He drew attention to Pakistan’s agricultural potential, the strategic importance of the Tethyan Copper Belt in Balochistan amid rising global demand for critical minerals, and the growing focus on data centres, artificial intelligence, and digital services.
He noted that regulatory frameworks were being updated to support innovation and encourage foreign investment, particularly from the United States, describing technological change as a major game-changer for Pakistan.
In conclusion, Aurangzeb invited global investors and partners to engage with Pakistan through trade, investment, and collaboration.
Emphasising the country’s reform momentum, economic potential, and natural beauty, he reiterated that Pakistan was transitioning from a narrative of crisis management to one of opportunity and transformation, offering promising prospects for those willing to engage with a market on the cusp of sustainable growth.</p><small>2025-12-24 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2411535069d6b48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962971/daytime-movement-of-heavy-vehicles-banned-in-karachi-for-2-months' target='_blank'><strong>Daytime movement of heavy vehicles banned in Karachi for 2 months</strong></a><br><p>The daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles has been banned in Karachi for two months, it emerged on Wednesday.
The development comes as the city has recently witnessed a steep increase in traffic accidents, with many resulting from collisions with heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
A notification issued on Tuesday by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said that the deputy inspector general of the Karachi Traffic Police had requested the imposition of a ban on the movement of heavy vehicles during the daytime “in order to resolve traffic congestion issues due to the influx of heavy vehicular traffic and to prevent road traffic accidents”.
The notification added that in the interest of protecting human lives and ensuring the smooth flow of traffic, there were sufficient grounds to proceed under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to regulate the movement of heavy traffic within the city.
As a result, the Karachi commissioner imposed a complete ban on dumper trucks carrying construction materials in all parts of the city, except between the hours of 10pm and 6am.
He also imposed a ban on the movement of heavy traffic within the city, except between 10pm and 6am. However, this excluded those carrying “essential commodities”, including water, edible oil, liquid nitrogen, meat, skin and medical gases classed as life-saving drugs.
A complete ban was also imposed on the movement of heavy traffic on Jinnah Avenue from Super Highway (M-9 Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway) near Saima Pari Classic and Rufi Global City up to Malir Halt, Sharea Faisal.
Three routes were also designated for heavy traffic, excluding dumper trucks carrying construction materials. These included the Super Highway (to New Karachi Industrial area via Slip Road) and the National Highway (to Godown Chowrangi, Younas Chowrangi, Dawood Chowrangi). The third route was the Northern Bypass, through which vehicles can access Gulbai and Mauripur en route to Karachi Port.
An alternate route was also specified from Link Road Kathore to Sassi Toll Plaza.
“The movement of dumpers equipped with approved tracking devices (trackers), whose access data has been integrated with the Karachi Traffic Police monitoring system, is exempted from the restriction timings within the industrial zones of Karachi,” the notification added.
It said the restrictions would remain in place for a period of two months, from Dec 23 to Feb 22, 2026.
This is not the first time a ban has been imposed on the movement of heavy vehicles in Karachi. In February, the provincial government placed a 60-day ban on heavy vehicle traffic in the city exempting certain nighttime hours. In April, this ban was extended for another two months.
On Dec 19, three people were killed in as many traffic accidents in Karachi involving “negligent and careless driving” of heavy vehicles. The previous week, a young motorcyclist was killed and his pillion rider injured by a trailer truck driver near Bara Board, PAF Gate, in Mauripur.</p><small>2025-12-24 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24122446dfba616.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962974/india-space-agency-launches-its-heaviest-satellite' target='_blank'><strong>India space agency launches its heaviest satellite</strong></a><br><p>India’s space agency launched its heaviest ever payload on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling the deployment “a significant stride” for the space sector.
The LVM3-M6 rocket launched the US-built AST SpaceMobile communications satellite into low-Earth orbit.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said it was the “heaviest payload to be launched from Indian soil”.
The launch is a boost for India’s ambitious low-cost space programme, with plans for an uncrewed orbital mission and human spaceflight in the coming years.
The satellite, weighing 6,100 kilogrammes (13,448 pounds), was launched on a modified version of a rocket that India plans to use for its future space missions.
India is vying for a larger slice of the booming commercial satellite business as phone, internet and other companies seek expanded and more high-end communications.
Modi said the launch marked “a proud milestone in India’s space journey”.







“It strengthens India’s heavy-lift launch capability and reinforces our growing role in the global commercial launch market,” he said in a statement.
Earlier this year, ISRO launched the CMS-03 communication satellite, which weighs about 4,410 kilogrammes.
For these heavy launches, India has deployed an upgraded version of the rocket it used to send an unmanned craft to the Moon in August 2023.
The world’s most populous nation has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade with its space programme growing considerably, and rivalling the achievements of established powers at a much cheaper price tag.
It has said it plans to launch an uncrewed orbital mission before its first human spaceflight in 2027.
Modi has also announced plans to send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.</p><small>2025-12-24 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641209-pia-privatisation-asif-blames-bureaucracy-for-public-sectors-decline-seeks-accountability' target='_blank'><strong>PIA privatisation: Asif blames bureaucracy for public sector's decline, seeks accountability</strong></a><br><p>

“This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people,” Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement.
According to the Washington DC-based Stimson Centre, Libya has effectively split into two virtual quasi-states since 2014. The west is ruled by the Government of National Unity (GNU), of which Dbeibah is the prime minister, while the east is run by Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar’s Libyan Armed Forces.
Dbeibah said the commander of Libya’s ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff’s office were also on the aircraft.
Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT.







He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district.







He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established.
The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.
Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation into the crash was under way.
The Tripoli-based GNU said in a statement that the prime minister directed the defence minister to send an official delegation to Ankara to follow up on proceedings.
Walid Ellafi, state minister of political affairs and communication for the GNU, told broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready, but that the jet was a leased Maltese aircraft.
He added that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history,” but said this would be investigated.
Turkiye’s defence ministry had announced Haddad’s visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.</p><small>2025-12-24 06:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24103222352d419.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962967/gold-tops-4500-silver-and-platinum-hit-records-in-metal-markets-frenzy' target='_blank'><strong>Gold tops $4,500, silver and platinum hit records in metal markets frenzy</strong></a><br><p>Gold surged past the $4,500-an-ounce mark for the first time on Wednesday, while silver and platinum also scaled record highs, as investors piled into precious metals on safe-haven demand and expectations that US interest rates will fall further next year.
Spot gold rose 0.1 per cent to $4,492.51 per ounce by 3:59am GMT (8:59am PKT), after touching a record high of $4,525.19 earlier in the session. US gold futures for February delivery climbed 0.3pc to a record high of $4,520.60.
Silver gained 1.2pc to $72.27 an ounce, after hitting an all-time peak of $72.70 earlier, while platinum jumped 3.3pc to $2,351.05 after rising to a historic high of $2,377.50.
Palladium climbed almost 2pc to $1,897.11, its highest level in three years.
“Precious metals have become more of a speculative narrative around the idea that, with de-globalisation, you need an asset that can act as a neutral go-between, without sovereign risk particularly as tensions between the US and China persist,” said Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive.

 

Thin year-end liquidity exaggerated recent price moves but the broader theme was likely to endure, with gold targeting $5,000 over the next six to twelve months and silver potentially pushing toward $80 as markets respond to key psychological levels, Spivak added.
Gold has surged more than 70pc this year, its biggest annual gain since 1979, driven by safe-haven demand, expectations of US rate cuts, robust central-bank buying, de-dollarisation trends and ETF inflows, with traders pricing in two rate cuts next year.
Silver has jumped more than 150pc over the same period, outpacing gold on strong investment demand, its inclusion on the US critical minerals list and momentum buying.
Gold and silver have “been hitting the accelerator pedal this week” with fresh record highs, reflecting their appeal as stores of value amid expectations of lower US rates and lingering global debt, said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.
Platinum and palladium, primarily used in automotive catalytic converters to reduce emissions, have surged this year on tight mine supply, tariff uncertainty, and a rotation from gold investment demand, with platinum up about 160pc and palladium gaining more than 100pc year to date.
“What we’re seeing in platinum and palladium is largely catch-up,” Spivak said adding that the thin nature of those markets leave them vulnerable to sharp swings, even as they broadly track gold, once liquidity returns.</p><small>2025-12-24 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641194-former-pti-leaders-seek-parole-for-jailed-party-stalwarts' target='_blank'><strong>Former PTI leaders seek parole for jailed party stalwarts</strong></a><br><p>
