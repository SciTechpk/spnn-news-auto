• Major crops down 13.5pc amid water crisis, restricting agriculture and overall GDP growth
• Industry, services underperform; large-scale manufacturing struggles for third straight year
• Inflation drops to 4.6pc, a 60-year low, amid declining interest rates
• Finance czar calls it ‘a gradual recovery’, promises ‘turnaround’ next year
• GDP growth reaches 2.68pc, missing 3.56pc target
ISLAMABAD: “Next year will be a turnaround story,” Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb promised on Monday as he unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 (PES) document, which highlighted widespread slippages across major sectors of the economy in the outgoing fiscal year.
Reviewing the economy report card, the finance minister suggested that Pakistan’s performance should be evaluated in a global context rather than a historical one.
He stated that while global economic growth has been on a declining trend, expanding 3.5pc in 2023, 3.3pc in 2024, and 2.8pc in 2025, Pakistan had progressed from a contraction of 0.2pc in 2023 to 2.5pc growth in 2024, with a further rise to almost 2.7pc this year.
“This is gradual recovery, and the right way to ensure sustainable growth,” he insisted, adding that no one wanted a return to the boom-and-bust cycles of the past.
The current year’s GDP growth will clock in at 2.68pc; well short of the 3.56pc target, although slightly improved from last year’s 2.5pc. It is below the five-year average of around 3.3pc, and well below Pakistan’s long-term average of over 4.5pc.
Mr Aurangzeb noted that global inflation stood at 2.6pc in 2023, rose to 2.7pc in 2024, and is projected to reach 3.1pc in 2025. In contrast, inflation in Pakistan had fallen from 29pc in 2023 to 23pc in 2024, and now to a six-decade low of 4.6pc.
“So, this too has moved in the right direction,” Mr Aurangzeb remarked, noting that the benchmark interest rate had been reduced by a cumulative 1,100 basis points during the current year to 11pc, down from a peak of 22pc. Resultantly, the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 68pc last year to 65pc, aided by the government’s buyback of approximately Rs1 trillion in debt, which created additional fiscal space, the minister said.
Missed targets
The Economic Survey data reveals that almost all major components of the economy missed targets. The finance minister singled out a 13.5pc contraction in major crops, which was estimated to have restricted the overall GDP growth rate by 0.6pc. The overall agriculture sector, which accounts for nearly 24pc of GDP, posted modest growth of 0.6pc this year, falling well short of the 2pc target and significantly below last year’s announced growth of 6.4pc. Major crops such as wheat, cotton, and maize contracted by 13.5pc, a sharper decline than an estimated 4.5pc.
This was primarily due to initial estimates of a 35pc water shortage, which were later revised down to 11-12pc. As a result, cotton ginning saw a 19pc decline, compared to last year’s growth of 0.1pc, and well below a targeted contraction limit of 2.3pc.
Meanwhile, the industrial sector was announced to have shown 4.8pc growth, surpassing the 4.4pc target. This triggered some pointed questions, however. A journalist commented that it seemed likely the industry’s performance would later be revised downward, given that an almost 1pc contraction had been reported for the first nine months of the current year.
Within industries, mining and quarrying contracted by 3.4pc against a growth target of 5pc, shrinking for the third consecutive year. Likewise, Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), which contributes nearly 8pc to GDP, contracted by 1.5pc, falling far short of the growth target of 3.5pc.
This also marked the third consecutive year of struggles for LSM, which saw a 10pc contraction in fiscal ’23, followed by less than 1pc growth in fiscal ’24 (that too, owing to a low base effect), and followed by an additional 1.5pc contraction this year.
The services sector, which makes up nearly 59pc of GDP, was said to have posted growth of 2.9pc, well short of the 4.1pc target. Within the services sector, wholesale and retail trade, transport and storage, financial and insurance services, and private services all missed targets, whereas government services, education and similar sectors that outperformed expectations.
Separately, the investment-to-GDP ratio improved to 13.8pc in fiscal ’25, up from 13.1pc in fiscal ’24, although falling short of the 14.2pc target. Private investment grew by 9.1pc, slightly below the 9.7pc target. National savings also saw an improvement, rising to 14.1pc of GDP, surpassing the 13.3pc target.
Indian meddling
Mr Aurangzeb said structural reforms aimed at transforming the foundations of Pakistan’s economy would have remained elusive without the ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme. The programme, he noted, had supported taxation reforms that raised the tax-to-GDP ratio to a five-year high and contributed to a reduction in power sector losses.
The minister described the recent release of a $1bn tranche by the IMF as a major success, achieved “against all odds.” For the first time publicly, it was revealed that India had actively opposed the move.
“Just as our armed forces fought for a victory, a similar battle was being fought on the economic front,” he said, claiming that the Indian executive director at the IMF had made every effort to keep Pakistan’s case off the board’s agenda, or, if it was included, to block both the second instalment of the EFF as well as a new $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility, which is crucial for Pakistan’s climate adaptation financing needs.
But Pakistan’s bilateral allies and multilateral partners stood by the country and offered their support, Mr Aurangzeb said, while also acknowledging that this outcome would not have been possible without the strength of Pakistan’s economic performance.
Reform-centric budget
Mr Aurangzeb also stated that reforms in public finance, including pension reforms, rightsizing of government, and privatisation of public sector entities, would be pushed through, and this would be evident in the budget to be presented on Tuesday (today).
The minister avoided multiple questions regarding the quality of data, and the use of May-June projections to calculate growth numbers instead of relying on actual data. However, he affirmed his support for the published data, stating that, as finance minister, he stood behind it.
He also expressed his support for the inclusion of members from the private sector on the board of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, which is responsible for the Economic Survey report.
Published in Dawn, June 10th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-10 03:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/100754534f18c02.jpg?r=075512' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916156/after-expanding-the-net-new-budget-will-focus-on-increasing-tax-rates' target='_blank'><strong>After expanding the net, new budget will focus on increasing tax rates</strong></a><br><p>• Many goods, services will now be taxed at higher rates
• Lower rates for digital payments versus cash transactions set to replace distinction between filers, non-filers
•  Some relief expected for salaried persons earning around Rs100,000 per month
ISLAMABAD: Facing limited room for fresh tax measures, the Shehbaz Sharif-led coalition government has resorted to rebranding taxation — shifting from “broadening the tax base” to pursuing “equity” — in an effort to justify higher taxes on lower-income segments. This transition comes as the government eyes a record revenue target of nearly Rs14 trillion for FY26, a 22 per cent increase over projections for the outgoing fiscal year.
Tied to its commitments under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, the government estimates autonomous revenue collection at Rs12.845tr, based on 4.2pc GDP growth and 7.5pc inflation.
To meet the ambitious target, the government will need an additional Rs655 billion in new tax measures and another Rs400bn through enforcement — figures expected to be finalised in Tuesday’s cabinet meeting ahead of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s budget speech.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faces significant challenges in meeting its tax collection targets, as doubts persist over its ability to enforce existing tax laws effectively.
Despite concerns about sluggish field operations, no substantial measures have been introduced to bolster enforcement in recent years. An initiative to provide operational vehicles to field officers was also withdrawn following backlash.
 
 

Meanwhile, Ministry of Finance officials continue to present optimistic projections, seemingly hoping for a tax windfall without acknowledging economic headwinds. Large-scale ind­us­tries remain in decline, while sectors like real estate and consumption goods bear the brunt of excessive taxation, further dampening economic activity.
With key industries contracting and consumer confidence fading, the feasibility of achieving ambitious revenue targets remains highly questionable in the next fiscal year.
The government’s proposed tax-to-GDP ratio target for FY26 is 12.3pc, comprising FBR’s share (10.6pc of GDP), provincial collections and the petroleum development levy (PDL).
Moreover, revenue collection could face further setbacks due to a lower-than-expected allocation for the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), which includes fewer new projects. The federal PSDP also remains notably smaller than those of Punjab and Sindh.
Compounding the issue, the federal government is now seeking financial contributions from Punjab and Sindh to fund dam construction, an unusual move that underscores fiscal limitations at the Centre. These factors create added pressure, as the federal government struggles to balance tax collection efforts with a constrained development budget.
From broadening to equity
Officials involved in tax policy formulation indicate that the government is now moving from tax broadening measures to a new approach centred on equity. This shift means lower tax rates on a wide range of goods and services will be raised, a move the FBR anticipates will generate maximum revenue.
Under the earlier broadening strategy, exemptions were systematically withdrawn, even on essential products like food, stationery items and books, to expand the tax base.
 
 

Now, in the second phase, the FBR is introducing “equity” as a justification for increasing lower tax rates across various sectors. This approach will result in a series of hikes in withholding tax rates, targeting dividends, stock markets and other financial transactions.
It is also proposed to levy taxes at the Thresher Unit Level, which would require the use of larger machines to improve the quality of tobacco processing — an effort aimed at increasing revenue collection from the tobacco sector.
At the same time, the FBR intends to implement a new concept of transactions using banking instruments, applying lower tax rates to digital transactions and higher rates to cash-based ones.
This concept will replace the current distinction between filers and non-filers.
However, the real test lies ahead — whether these increased tax rates will bolster revenue collection or further stifle economic activity, particularly as key industries and investment sectors struggle under mounting financial pressures. As part of its proposed new tax measures, the FBR is preparing to introduce a new tax on solar panels, processed food items and a carbon tax, signalling an effort to expand revenue streams amid fiscal constraints.
The tax measures are likely to spark concerns among consumers and businesses, particularly in the renewable energy sector. A tax on solar panels could dampen incentives for clean energy adoption at a time when Pakistan faces mounting electricity costs and energy shortages. Similarly, additional taxation on processed foods may lead to higher consumer prices, affecting household budgets.
However, in a move to provide temporary relief to the agricultural sector, the government has secured an exemption from the IMF on fertilisers and pesticides.
This exemption, extended for another year, will alleviate cost pressures on farmers struggling with rising input prices and uncertain market conditions.
While the government tightens fiscal measures in other sectors, some relief is expected for the salaried class in lower tax slabs. Officials indicate that the exemption limit may be further raised, alongside a lower tax rate for individuals earning around Rs100,000 per month.
Fiscal challenges
While this move aims to stimulate domestic manufacturing and enhance production capacity, it comes at a cost to government revenue. The reduction in import duties will significantly lower tax collection at the import stage, creating further fiscal challenges for an already strained revenue system.
The government is also considering extending the tax measures to former Fata and Pata members, who are exempt until June 30, 2025. This will be another area where the government plans to include tax measures in the budget. However, the Sindh government has asked the federal government to avoid all taxes, including the agriculture income tax on farm products.
Former FBR chairman Dr Irshad Ahmed criticised the government’s persistent reliance on policy measures, arguing that new tax measures alone would not resolve systemic revenue challenges. According to him, such additional revenue merely increases the burden on existing taxpayers while failing to expand the tax base effectively.
Dr Ahmed stressed that the core issue lies in enforcement, which requires a complete overhaul of the FBR’s field formations. He pointed out that officers remain confined to their offices with little access to potential taxpayers, rendering tax collection efforts ineffective.
He also recalled a previous attempt to establish strong tax offices at the district level, an initiative that was ultimately blocked by bureaucratic resistance.
Despite possessing ext­en­sive taxpayer data, FBR lacks the capacity to analyse it effectively and identify tax evaders. Add­ressing these gaps requires significant investment in capacity-building, infrastructure and operational enhancements — elements currently missing from the government’s strategy.
Without a robust enforcement framework, new revenue measures will provide only a temporary financial boost, while those outside the tax net continue to evade their dues.

However, energy experts in both the public and private sectors remain optimistic that this capacity payment burden — estimated at Rs12 to Rs15 per unit and passed on to consumers — will gradually decline, as the government has halted new power projects and terminated power purchase agreements (PPAs) with several independent power producers (IPPs).
“The issue of capacity payments is not considered very painful during summer, but it becomes more significant in winter when our total electricity demand drops to just 12,000-13,000 MW,” a senior official at the Ministry of Energy told Dawn on Monday.
According to the Economic Survey, the country’s total installed electricity generation capacity reached 46,605MW, with the energy mix comprising hydel (24.4 per cent), thermal (55.7pc), nuclear (7.8pc) and renewables (12.5pc).
 
 


Economic Survey puts total installed power generation capacity at 46,605MW

During July-March FY25, total electricity generation stood at 90,145GWh — hydel (30.4pc), thermal (46.3pc), nuclear (19.1pc), and renewables (4.2pc). Electricity consumption during the same period was 80,111GWh, with households accounting for 49.6pc, industrial users 26.3pc, agriculture 5.7pc, and commercial consumers 8.6pc.
According to the survey, six nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 3,530MW supplied 17,174 million units of electricity during July-March FY25.
The 46,605MW installed capacity includes an addition of over 2,800MW through solar net metering, reflecting a 1.6pc increase compared to the 45,888MW recorded in the corresponding period of FY24.
While thermal power still makes up the largest portion of the electricity supply at 55.7pc, its share has declined in recent years, indicating a shift towards more indigenous and sustainable sources. Hydel, nuclear and renewable sources now collectively account for 53.7pc of total electricity generation.
“If we examine the total installed capacity, almost 50pc comes from IPPs, including around 5,000MW from four RLNG plants owned by the Punjab and federal governments. Excluding these, the share of IPPs is around 16,000-17,000MW. Of this, 4,000-5,000MW worth of plants remain under annual maintenance. Meanwhile, the generation capacity of old government-owned plants at Guddu (Gencos) has also reduced to almost half or so. So, the generation from IPPs usually stays around 10,000MW during summer,” explained an official, on condition of anonymity.
According to him, total generation from IPPs, hydel, nuclear and other non-IPP sources ranges between 33,000MW and 34,000MW, while demand reaches around 32,000MW. “Thus, we roughly pay capacity charges for 1,000-2,000MW in summer and 3,000-5,000MW in winter, when hydel generation declines due to reduced water availability,” he said, adding that terminating PPAs with idle IPPs and halting new power projects would help reduce the overall tariffs.
Dr Fayyaz A. Chaudhry, chairman of the Board of Directors of National Grid Company of Pakistan (formerly NTDC), said the system’s firm capacity — the amount that can be dispatched to the power grid at any time — is around 40,000MW.
He noted that solar power generation, including 4,000-5,000MW from net-metered systems and additional non-net-metered capacity, is not considered firm capacity because it’s unavailable in the evening.

LOS ANGELES: Los Angeles was on edge Monday after violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces over immigration raids, with the Californian governor vowing to sue President Donald Trump for deploying National Guard soldiers and the United Nations warning “against further militarisation of unrest”.
Police stood watch after ordering people not to gather in the city’s downtown where cars were torched over the weekend, and security forces fired tear gas at protesters.
“This is exactly what Donald Trump wanted,” Governor Gavin Newsom said on social media. “He flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalize the National Guard.” “We’re suing him.”
The White House also ratcheted up the standoff between the hard-charging Republican president and California’s Democrat-led authorities.
“Gavin Newsom did nothing as violent riots erupted in Los Angeles for days,” Trump’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on Monday. “President Trump has stepped in to maintain law and order.” She added, “America must reverse the invasion unleashed by (former president) Joe Biden of millions of unvetted illegal aliens into our country.”
The protests in Los Angeles, home to a large Latino population, were triggered by raids and dozens of arrests of what authorities say are illegal migrants and gang members.
Critics say Trump, who has made clamping down on illegal migration a key pillar of his second term, deliberately stoked tensions by sending in California’s National Guard, a stand-by military usually controlled by the state governor.
“You have the National Guard with loaded magazines and large guns standing around trying to intimidate Americans,” protester Thomas Henning told AFP on the scene.
On Monday morning, a heavy police presence patrolled mostly deserted streets. A few protesters remained overnight, with some lobbing projectiles and fireworks, according to TV coverage.
Trump called the protesters “insurrectionists”, and demanded authorities arrest people in face masks.
“BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.
At least three self-driving Waymo cars were torched Sunday, and local law enforcement deployed tear gas and smoke grenades to disperse protesters. An Australian reporter was hit in the leg with a rubber bullet fired by a police officer on live television. Her employer later said she was unharmed.
LA police officers set up containment lines to keep demonstrators separated from armed National Guardsmen from the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in helmets and camouflage gear. At least 56 people were arrested over two days and three officers suffered minor injuries, they said.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said he requested the Trump administration withdraw its order to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles County, calling it unlawful.
Newsom accused Trump of trying to manufacture a crisis and violating California’s state sovereignty. “These are the acts of a dictator, not a President,” he wrote in a post on X.
The White House disputed Newsom’s characterisation, saying in a statement that “everyone saw the chaos, violence and lawlessness”.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has warned that the Pentagon is prepared to mobilise active-duty troops “if violence continues” in Los Angeles, saying the Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton are “on high alert”. US Northern Command said about 500 Marines were prepared to deploy if ordered.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the Trump administration for inciting tensions by sending in the National Guard, but also condemned protesters who became violent.
Meanwhile, China’s consulate told its citizens in the area to strengthen personal security measures, stay away from gatherings, crowded areas, or places with poor public security, and avoid going out at night or travelling alone. They should also “closely monitor official announcements” and “raise their safety awareness”, it added.
On the other hand, UN spokesman Farhan Haq said, “We do not want to see any further militarization of this situation, and we encourage the parties at the local, state and federal levels to work to do that.”

“Today the government of Israel doesn’t represent the vast majority of Israelis,” said Golan, chairman of the Democrats party and a former deputy army chief, days before a planned parliament vote which the opposition hopes would trigger a general election.
He told journalists in a briefing that after more than 20 months of fighting that Israel “should end the war as soon as possible”.
Golan’s party, a conglomeration of left-wing factions, has only four seats in Israel’s 120-member legislature. But in a country where coalition building is essential to achieving a political majority, even relatively small parties can wield considerable power.
Golan said that the current government — one of the most right-wing in Israel’s history — was a threat to democracy.
He said that the vast majority of Israelis wanted to see an immediate end to the war in Gaza, the return of all prisoners held by the Palestinians in a single exchange deal, and the establishment of a national commission of inquiry into Hamas’s 2023 attack, arguing that the Netanyahu government was opposed to these objectives.
He expressed the hope that a deal on the release of prisoners could be reached in a matter of days. “The vast majority wants new elections as soon as possible,” he said.

The tone and content of the presentations at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) focused more on incremental developments, including live translations for phone calls, that improve everyday life rather than the sweeping ambitions for AI that Apple’s rivals are marketing.
Apple software chief Craig Federighi said the company is opening up the foundational AI model that it uses for some of its features to third-party developers.
“This work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,” Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, said of the delays of some features, such as improvements to the Siri virtual assistant.
 






In an early demonstration of how partners could improve Apple apps, the company added image generation from OpenAI’s ChatGPT to its Image Playground app, saying that user data would not be shared with OpenAI without a user’s permission.
 
 

Apple is facing an unprecedented set of technical and regulatory challenges as some of its key executives kicked off the company’s annual software developer conference on Monday.
Shares of Apple, which were flat before the conference, slipped 1.5 per cent after executives took the stage in Cupertino, California.
Federighi also said Apple plans a design overhaul of all of its operating systems.
Apple’s redesign of its operating systems centred on a design it calls “liquid glass”, where icons and menus are partially transparent, a step Apple executives said was possible because of the more powerful custom chips in Apple devices versus a decade ago.
Federighi said the new design will span operating systems for iPhones, Macs and other Apple products.
He also said Apple’s operating systems will be given year names instead of sequential numbers for each version.
That will unify naming conventions that have become confusing because Apple’s core operating systems for phones, watches and other devices kicked off at different times, resulting in a smattering of differently numbered operating systems for different products.
In other new features, Apple introduced “Call Screening”, where iPhones will automatically answer calls from an unknown number and ask the caller the purpose of their call. Once the caller states their purpose, the iPhone will show a transcription of the reason for the call, and ring for the owner.
Apple also said it will add live translation to phone calls, as well as allow developers to integrate its live translation technology into their apps.
Apple said the caller on the other end of the phone call will not need to have an iPhone for the live translation feature to work.
Apple’s Visual Intelligence app, which can help users find a pair of shoes similar to ones at which they have pointed an iPhone camera, will be extended to analysing items on the iPhone’s screen and linked together with apps.
Apple gave an example of seeing a jacket online and using the feature to find a similar one for sale on an app already installed in the user’s iPhone.</p><small>2025-06-09 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0918022897d3af5.jpg?r=180240' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916082/5-dead-at-least-25-injured-as-high-speed-passenger-bus-overturns-in-punjabs-layyah' target='_blank'><strong>5 dead, at least 25 injured as high-speed passenger bus overturns in Punjab’s Layyah</strong></a><br><p>Five people were killed and at least 25 were injured as a high-speed passenger bus overturned near Nawan Kot in Layyah on Sunday, following which a case was registered against the highway road contractor as the accident occurred due to concrete being laid on the road.
Layyah District Police Officer Ali Waseem confirmed to Dawn.com the deaths of five people in the accident.
According to a statement by Rescue 1122, the passenger bus was carrying devotees of Bibi Pak Daman in Lahore to Karor Lal Eesan Tehsil. At least 33 people were injured, the statement said, adding that six of the injured were in critical condition.
The statement also said that a rescue operation was underway which was being supervised by District Emergency Officer Sajjad Ahmed.
The Chobara police registered the case against the contractor upon the complaint of the grandson of a deceased passenger under Sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 322 (causing death by rash or negligent driving), 337-G (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent driving), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 422 (dishonestly or fraudulently preventing debt being available for creditors) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The first information report (FIR) said five people, including the bus driver, died while 25 others were injured in the accident after the bus overturned in the Nawan Kot area.
“The contractor was charged with blocking the road by piling gravel and not installing signboards,” the FIR said.
The deceased and the injured were moved to Tehsil Hospital Fatehpur while six critically injured passengers were referred to Nishtar Hospital Multan for treatment.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif shared her sorrow over the incident, directing Layyah Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amira Baidar to provide the best facilities to patients and excellent treatment.
The DC visited the hospital and met the injured passengers.</p><small>2025-06-09 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09221150e25b164.jpg?r=221227' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916108/sana-mir-makes-history-as-first-pakistani-woman-cricketer-to-make-icc-hall-of-fame' target='_blank'><strong>Sana Mir makes history as first Pakistani woman cricketer to make ICC Hall of Fame</strong></a><br><p>Former Pakistan women’s captain Sana Mir became the first female cricketer from the country to be inducted into the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) Hall of Fame on Monday.
She took the top spot in women’s one-day international rankings in 2018 and helmed the team that took home gold from the 2010 and 2014 Asian Games. Her rise dovetailed with the growth in sporting opportunities for Pakistani women, who were not allowed to play in open fields until the early 2000s.
Sana played 226 international matches since her 2005 debut. She is one of only nine women cricketers to have taken 100 wickets and scored 1,000 runs in ODI matches. She also led Pakistan to two World Cups and five T20 World Cups.
She was among seven notable cricketers added by the ICC today, the others being India’s MS Dhoni, Australia’s Matthew Hayden, New Zealand’s Daniel Vettori, England’s Sarah Taylor and South Africa’s Hashim Amla and Graeme Smith.
 






The ICC said that with over 200 international wickets against the white-ball, Sana was renowned for her work on and off the field.
It added she was also well known for her strong stance on body shaming, prioritising mental health and helping people affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. It said she “fulfils a childhood dream by joining the ICC Hall of Fame”.
“From dreaming as a little girl that one day there would even be a women’s team in our country to now standing here, inducted among the very legends I idolised long before I ever held a bat or a ball — this is a moment I couldn’t have dared to imagine,” she was quoted as saying by the ICC.
“I am incredibly grateful for this honour and hope to give back to the sport in any way I can. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my teammates, coaches and family for all their support over the years.”
 






ICC Chairman Jay Shah welcomed the new members to the Hall of Fame at a gala event at Abbey Road Studios in London.
“Through the ICC Hall of Fame, we pay tribute to the finest players the game has seen, individuals whose remarkable careers have shaped cricket’s legacy and inspired generations,” Shah said.
“This year, we are privileged to induct seven truly outstanding individuals into this prestigious group. On behalf of the ICC, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to each of them and hope they cherish this well-deserved recognition as a defining moment in their cricketing journey.”
Hayden’s ‘outstanding numbers’, ‘top class’ Amla, ‘inspirational’ Dhoni
Of Hayden, the ICC said that with a “whopping 30 Test centuries and Test average greater than 50, Hayden’s outstanding numbers in the longest format speak for themselves”.
“Each of these players gave something to the game in their own way. It is incredible to be recognised along with them,” he said.
 






The ICC said about Dhoni that there was so much more to the “inspirational skipper”.
Describing his prowess, the ICC said: “Dhoni was ahead of his time with the way he kept wickets in all formats, but perhaps excelled most against the white-ball when he was well renowned for his ability to time a run chase to perfection in the dying overs.
“The Indian great remains the only captain to win all three ICC white-ball tournaments, having led India to success at the inaugural ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2007, the 50-over World Cup in 2011 and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.”
 






Amla’s overall record was hailed as being “top class” in Test cricket and “perhaps even more outstanding in the 50-over format as the underrated right-hander scored bulk runs against every opposition and in all conditions”.
“The Hall of Fame includes some of the most celebrated players in the history of cricket, all of whom have big achievements. Such recognition feels surreal, and I am really thankful,” he was quoted as saying by the ICC.
 






“A superb opening batter and arguably an even better captain,” the ICC described Smith while praising Vettori as a dependable and adept all-rounder and stellar leader.
 






 






Meanwhile, Taylor was called “one of the most talented female players in recent times”.

Yesterday, a search operation was launched after two girls fell from a makeshift bridge over the Gwaldai River in the Shahi Banda area of KP’s Upper Dir district and went missing, police said.
Zaman Shah, a sub-divisional police officer, told Dawn.com that two young girls — namely 15-year-old Samira Bibi and 12-year-old Javeria Bibi — were crossing the Gwaldai river when they fell into it and were feared to have drowned.
The official said the incident occurred within the limits of Shahi Doba’s Patrak police station, adding that the flow of water had increased recently due to glaciers melting.
Last Saturday, a gas cylinder explosion killed six people and injured two others in Mardan, according to police and rescue officials.
Mardan District Police Officer Zahoor Babar Afridi confirmed the casualties and told Dawn.com, “The explosion was caused by a gas cylinder.”
Faizi said that a cylinder explosion in Mardan’s Aram Colony caused the roof of a two-story house to collapse.

The National Accounts Committee showed Pakistan’s GDP growth at 1.37pc for the first quarter of FY25, 1.53pc for the second, and 2.4 for the third. This implies that the economy would need to post a growth rate of 5.5pc in the three months of April-June to get to the 2.7pc figure announced by the finance minister.
The GDP growth figure, however, is still lower than 3.6pc, marking the third successive year of the government missing its targeted figure.

Highlights from PES 2024-25

Growth targets missed with only industrial sector slightly above target
Per capita income increases to $1,824 from $1,662
Current account balance notches surplus of $1.9bn from July to April compared to $1.3bn deficit last year
Inflation drops to 4.7pc from targeted 12pc and last year’s 23.4pc


When asked by a reporter about the ambitious figure, Aurangzeb justified the projection by saying that these were official estimates.
“The data provided is by the government,” he said. “Therefore, we will stick to what the government has said and provided. I am going to stay with this.”
The survey is a pre-budget document that contains details of major socio-economic achievements during the outgoing fiscal year. It serves as a vital document ahead of the annual federal budget, which will be presented tomorrow (Tuesday), offering detailed insights into the country’s socio-economic performance over the outgoing fiscal year.
The finance minister, during a press conference in Islamabad, talked about the global economic outlook, noting that global GDP growth was estimated to decline to 2.8pc in 2025 from 3.5pc two years ago.
“Our recovery needs to be looked at in a global context,” he said.

Aurangzeb said Pakistan’s GDP growth in 2023 was negative 0.2pc, which rose to 2.5pc in 2024. “This year, we announced a 2.7pc growth for 2025. This is a gradual recovery and the right way to go about it is to focus on sustainable growth.
“The last thing we want is to go through another round of boom and bust cycles,” Aurangzeb stressed.
According to the survey, the agriculture sector played an “essential and sustainable role” in ensuring food security, supporting rural livelihoods, and fostering national economic resilience, accounting for 23.54pc of the GDP in FY25 and employing over 37pc of the labour force.
“Despite challenging climatic conditions, the agricultural sector demonstrated a positive growth rate of 0.56pc, highlighting its inherent resilience and adherence to historical trends,” the survey said.

It added that livestock emerged as the primary contributor, achieving an expansion of 4.72pc, reinforcing its significant role in agricultural value addition.
Similarly, the fisheries and forestry sub-sectors exhibited steady growth rates of 1.42pc and 3.03pc, respectively, bolstered by “favourable policy measures and prevailing market dynamics”.
The crops sub-sector also experienced a contraction of 6.82pc, primarily driven by a 13.49pc decline in key crops and a 19.03pc decrease in cotton ginning.
The survey said these downturns could be attributed to adverse weather conditions and reduced sowing areas. “Nevertheless, a growth of 4.78pc in other crops indicates the potential for crop diversification and demonstrates resilience in the face of challenging circumstances,” it added.
Industrial growth for FY2024-25 was 4.8pc, compared to negative 1.4pc the previous year, the finance chief said.

“In addition to electricity, gas and water, construction went up by 6.6pc,” he stated.
Aurangzeb observed that while small-scale manufacturing had grown by 1.3pc, large-scale manufacturing had contracted, adding that it was still less than the previous fiscal year.
The minister also stressed the need to “do a deep dive” into the sectors that have declined, which he said included chemicals, iron and steel.
“Autos went up by 40pc, wearable apparel rose by 8pc, textiles went up by 2pc, petroleum products increased by 4.5pc,” the minister said, referring to the gains witnessed by each of these sectors during FY25.
“The devil is always in the details. I will mention why I’m very confident in saying that this fiscal year will be a turnaround story,” he underscored.
The services sector grew by 2.9pc against 2.2pc the previous fiscal year, while the information and communications sector expanded by 6.5pc, according to the minister.

“Construction and real estate grew by 3.8pc, food services by 4.1pc,” he said, adding that the transport sector had grown due to higher activity at ports, shipping lines and airlines.
Inflation, he said, had been a fantastic story for Pakistan: 6.8pc global inflation in 2023, 5.7pc in 2024 and the estimate for 2025 is 4.3pc in terms of CPI inflation.

Aurangzeb noted that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had crossed 29pc in 2023 but now had plunged to just 4.6pc. “So, I think we’ve moved in the right direction in terms of the global figures.”
According to the survey, GDP per capita reached $1,824, up from $1,662 in the previous year, showing a 9.7 per cent increase that was supported by improved economic activity and a stable exchange rate.

Addressing the country’s monetary policy, the finance minister recalled that the interest rate was at a record 22pc in 2023, following which “steps were taken” to reduce it, and now the key policy rate stood at 1,100 basis points, he said.
Talking about macroeconomic indicators, Aurangzeb said, “Public debt and debt-to-GDP ratio was 68pc, which is now 65pc.

“Forex reserves as of June 30, 2024, were $9.4bn, which was a huge and remarkable recovery from where we were back in 2023, where we were down to two weeks of import cover. The recovery after [June] 30 continued and we consolidated it in 2024-25.”
Talking about the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, Aurangzeb asserted, “Our credibility and trust was re-established under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership.”
Noting that the premier had signed the Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) before the caretaker administration took over, the minister also praised the efforts of caretaker finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar as her “discipline allowed us to continue”.
Aurangzeb then highlighted two reasons for Pakistan desiring an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF, with the first one aiming to “bring permanence to macroeconomic stability” and remove fragility.
The second reason, he added, was to continue with structural reforms. “We needed to fundamentally change the economy’s DNA, and for that, we needed structural reforms which are elusive in this country. We needed to proceed with a structured programme,” he said.
On the topic of revenue, Aurangzeb said, “Our tax-to-GDP has hit a five-year high and the prime minister is leading this personally. This whole transformation is around people, processes, and technology.
“Tech played a big role — digital invoicing, production tracking, AI audits, faceless customs regime,” he added, terming the progress in FY25 great.
“Any transformation takes two to three years, and I think we have done a good job in terms of where we wanted to take things,” the minister said, adding that recoveries in the power sector had been “remarkable”.
Aurangzeb then highlighted that industrial and household energy tariffs had been slashed, while private sector and professional boards were introduced for power distribution companies.
“Distribution losses will be reduced going forward,” he added, noting that the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) distributing to three companies was an important step toward reducing the bottleneck in transmission.
The finance minister said that resolving the Rs1.275tr circular debt would “play an important role”.
“SOEs (state-owned enterprises) have been talked about at length, and Rs800bn has been spent, if you add up equities and guarantees, this goes into the trillions. Those trillions are better spent elsewhere,” he underscored.
Speaking about the government’s decision to privatise 24 SOEs, Aurangzeb affirmed that it would be “completed with renewed vigour and energy next year under adviser to the PM, Mohammad Ali”.
“Debt servicing is the single-largest expense for the federation. In the past year, the policy rate fell and saved us Rs800bn in debt servicing costs,” the finance minister said, adding that he would address it in detail tomorrow.
On pension reforms, the minister stated that contributions must be defined for new government colleagues joining from July 2024.
“Our biggest step is to stop bleeding and then solve legacy issues. But if we don’t stop leakages, it will become very difficult for us to start tackling legacy issues,” he emphasised.
Shedding light on the ongoing rightsizing efforts by the government, Aurangzeb said that “forty-three ministries and 400 attached departments” were to face reduction.
 
 

“It’s not [about] the what and why the federal government has to be rightsized. The question is how,” he said, adding that they will “continue with five ministries at a time”.
The finance minister then invited ministries and the heads of their attached departments to give their input on the matter, including “why a department is so critical to the running of the government”.
Speaking about Pakistan’s current account deficit, Aurangzeb observed there was a surplus of $1.9bn from July 2024 to April 2025 compared to a $1.3bn deficit last year.

“This entire year will be completed on a surplus,” he stated.
The minister termed the 7pc increase in exports, especially in the IT sector as a “big jump”, adding that money earned by freelancers was close to $400m.
He also noted that imports had increased by 12pc, with non-oil imports almost at the same level as back in 2022, which he said was the “time before the country’s economic crisis”.
The survey said the trade deficit in goods and services was “contained”, supported by “prudent import management and relatively stable global commodity prices”, which helped to moderate the overall external imbalance at 4.6pc of GDP, compared to 6pc from last year.

While the minister said machinery and transport imports had risen by 16.5pc and 24pc, respectively, he asserted that these would help the agricultural sector, where cotton was being imported.
“Remittances, like inflation, have been an outstanding story,” Aurangzeb remarked. “You can see a 31pc increase year-on-year from $31bn and a record $4.1bn in March. When we close June, we expect our overall remittances to be $37-38bn,” he added, noting that the figure was $10bn less two years ago.

“It is very critical that we mention the momentum of the Roshan Digital Account (RDA) because that is investment and lifestyle-led,” the finance head noted.
The minister called RDAs a “different segment of our diaspora”, with inflows from it crossing $10bn and 814,000 accounts opening.
“When we talk about remittances, sometimes we forget about RDA, which is playing a very important role in terms of how we take our diaspora and their commitment to Pakistan,” he stressed.
The minister noted there was a 26pc increase in terms of revenue collection, “on the back of 30pc growth in revenue last fiscal year”.
“There has been a deepening and expanding of the tax base,” Aurangzeb stated.
“Individual filers doubled to 3.7m filers. High-value filers also increased by 178pc,” he said, recalling there were 74pc additional retail registrations in the last fiscal year.
Speaking about debt management, Aurangzeb pointed out that the government had “brought back Rs1tr in local debt due to two reasons”.
“We reduced the prices and money going into markups,” he highlighted, adding that the second reason was to give a signal to the banking system that the government was “not a desperate borrower anymore”.
“We will borrow, but at our terms. It is about time you start lending to the private sector. This was an important message for the banks and they can see the increase,” the minister said.
Aurangzeb further highlighted the banking sector’s shift to Islamic banking. “Average time to maturity has been increased by 66pc so that the refinancing risk is reduced as much as it can be and to prevent bunching around maturities. We want to keep this at 65pc,” he said.
“If the policy rate is falling along with the debt servicing rate, we need to create an alpha. We need liability management trades and strengthening the debt management offices for this purpose.”
“My focus for this fiscal year is restructuring our debt management office around global standards,” Aurangzeb added.
The minister further remarked that the money saved in debt servicing could be diverted to the social or development sectors.
The recent Pakistan-India conflict also came up during the speech: “The way our military helped our nation get a real, real win against India, so, we too have been fighting a war on the economic front.
“The Indian executive director left no room for us, he didn’t want the IMF meeting to happen. If it did, he didn’t want certain items on the agenda, such as receiving the second tranche of the EFF,” the minister said, referring to New Delhi approaching the Fund over Pakistan’s loan.
“Financial institutions and our bilateral partners are standing with us on the economic front as well because economic security is absolutely critical as we move forward,” Aurangzeb said.
“It is a very critical component of national security,” the minister stressed.
He also referred to surveys carried out by various bodies, including one by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce & Industry (OICCI), which stated that foreign investors’ confidence had gone up by 16pc. Similarly, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) had said optimism among companies’ chief executive officers had surged by 83pc, he noted.
“If CEOs are optimistic, then they can take the firms forward that ‘please invest in this country’. Foreign investors can come only if local investors come,” Aurangzeb remarked.
“This survey is extremely important. I keep talking to various CEOs myself so it is very positive,” he stressed.
The minister also mentioned a survey by Gallup, which said household financial institution affordability has gone up by 27.5pc in one quarter, as well as an Ipsos survey that indicated that national optimism was at a six-year high.
“Now we have to take this forward. SIFC — focused on energy, IT, agriculture and mining — is going to be a real game changer for Pakistan’s future investments,” the minister asserted.
On the Benazir Income Support Programme, part of the social sector, Aurangzeb said Rs593bn were disbursed, supporting around 10m families.
The minister also mentioned that Pakistan rolled out its National Climate Finance Strategy at the COP29 conference in Baku last year, as well as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and emission reduction.
“Although for us, the biggest challenge is adaptation, not necessarily emissions,” Aurangzeb underscored.
 
 

Noting his discussions with global lenders on Green Sukuk, the minister stated the country should “depend on our local resources as we go forward, rather than going around asking help from others”.
“Next year, we have to operationalise the funding we have received with projects that help in decarbonisation and climate resilience,” he announced.
Fiscal deficit
The survey noted that the fiscal deficit was recorded at a “significantly low” 2.6pc of the GDP during the first nine months of the current fiscal year, compared to 3.7pc recorded last year in the same period.
This was achieved by “actively improving public finances by implementing reforms and initiatives related to revenue and spending”.

This was largely because of an “improving trajectory for the last three years” and due to The ongoing efforts towards fiscal consolidation that continued to reinforce fiscal discipline throughout the current fiscal year.
The survey said the above was also underpinned by a “substantial increase” in revenues attributed to various tax policy and administrative measures and effective expenditure management.
Tax collection
Federal Board of Revenue tax collection grew 26.3pc to Rs9,300.2 billion from July to April against Rs7,361.9 billion in the year-ago period. The collection target for the 12-month period set by the government was Rs12,970bn.

KSE-100 performance
The survey said that during July-March FY25, the Pakistan Stock Exchange’s benchmark KSE-100 index performed “remarkably well” and registered a significant growth of 50.2pc from 78,445 to 117,807 points.
It added that during the period under review, the index closed at its highest level of 118,770 points on March 20 while the lowest level was observed at 77,084 points on August 5.

“The unprecedented performance of the KSE-100 index can be associated with the robust corporate earnings, declining policy rate and inflation, successful first IMF EEF (International Monetary Fund Extended Fund Facility) programme review and subsequent disbursement of the tranche, and stable macroeconomic environment, which boosted investors’ confidence.”
‘Macroeconomic stability means to an end, not an end in itself’
The finance minister then opened the floor for reporters and media representatives for questions. Responding to a query, Aurangzeb said: “We stand behind the data because it is not from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics or the planning ministry but from the government.
“We will go with what has been published. Any concerns can be shared with us. I agree that data integrity is critical.”
Responding to another query, the minister reiterated, “The data provided is the government’s. Therefore, we will stick with what the government has said and what the government has provided, so I’m going to stay with that.
“But since you (a reporter) have mentioned some specific points, you can send it to us and we will definitely see how it can be improved further. It’s about collection, aggregation, reporting.”
Aurangzeb acknowledged that “everyone has their own views on livelihood”.
“Macroeconomic stability is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. If people’s LCs (letters of credit) are opening, remittances are happening, the policy rate is down, financing 23-24pc and Kibor rate is at 11-12pc, these are not rozi (livelihood) but factual.”
On a recent report by the World Bank, which said 45pc of Pakistanis live below the poverty line, the minister talked about a threshold change across the world. “Did they change it according to the ground facts of various countries, you changed the threshold and took it to $3 [per capita income] and that went from here to there?”
The minister said he would speak tomorrow (the budget day) on providing social protection to the lower strata as we go forward.
Responding to a question on unemployment, Aurangzeb noted, “The government’s job is to provide an ecosystem. I am not in favour of announcing that one to three billion jobs are being provided.”
Terming freelancers the country’s future, he highlighted a Pakistani diaspora that gave a $15m grant to the Lahore University of Management Sciences to create blockchain technology.
“Our children who make $8-10 they get into Web 3.0 their income can go to $100 as that is the programming. But if we take them to value add, then the income is beneficial to them and the country.”
The minister affirmed he would speak with “enforcement agencies” about ensuring the Rs37,000 minimum wage. “We have enough laws and legislation,” he said.
About structural reforms in the energy and taxation sectors, Aurangzeb said: “We cannot leave this. We have to stay the course. This is not an and/or discussion. I refuse to buy that climate change has no relation here. These are all interconnected.”
Noting that financing was available, he said the challenge now was how to channel it. Detailing the IMF’s $1.3bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), Aurangzeb noted it had 13 reform measures, including decarbonisation and carbon resiliency.
“These have to be implemented with all ministries working together. […] $600-700m are available each year. We have financing available, we have to move towards execution, which is a critical aspect,” he said, referring to climate funds secured from various bodies.

The finance chief further recalled that as per PM Shehbaz, a meeting on the National Finance Commission will be held in August.
He also expressed concern about the population growth rate and said: “We have to bring incentivisation. You are asking if it will reach 2.7pc in the next quarter or not. How will the country sustain this? We have 24bn population today.”
Responding to a query about development schemes, he echoed Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal’s statements that the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) would be focused on strategic projects that “deal with the economic lifeline of the country”.
Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal noted that the difference between revenues and expenditures was “not so big”.
“Our fiscal deficits are close to 8pc and are ultimately coming to a stage where the federal fiscal deficit is relatively low. As this goes lower, revenues increase. Expenditures where cuts are needed will be done. You will have greater space for PSDP,” Bosal said.
At one point, Aurangzeb said: “If local investors are looking and talking positively about macroeconomic stability, there are three discussions [to be held] with them: financing, taxation, and energy.”
He also expressed the hope for the crop sector to rebound, noting 60pc of the agricultural sector comprised dairy and livestock.
Replying to a query on the country’s expenditures, Bosal said: “We cannot cut our spending any more.”
“Fourteen per cent is our target. We need to reduce expenditures but our neighbour, whom we just fought in a war, is on 18pc,” the finance secretary added.
Responding to a question on allocating 2,000MW for bitcoin mining and AI despite ongoing power outages, Aurangzeb said, “As far as load-shedding goes, [Power Minister Awais Leghari] has given plenty of press conferences on this, but in areas with electricity theft, there will be load-shedding.”
Fiscal findings
According to the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), whose recommendations were endorsed by the National Economic Council (NEC), Pakistan’s GDP growth rate for FY 2024–25 has been recorded at 2.7pc while the target for GDP growth in the next fiscal year has been set at 4.2pc.
The NEC also noted that remittances witnessed a strong increase of 30.9pc from July 2024 to April 2025, and for the first time, the current account balance remained in surplus during this period.
The survey also highlights improvements in fiscal indicators, including a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 2.6pc of GDP. The primary balance recorded a surplus of 3pc of GDP, reflecting a more disciplined fiscal approach.
Owing to improved economic fundamentals and proactive monetary policy measures, the policy interest rate was gradually reduced to 11pc. Meanwhile, credit to the private sector grew significantly, with loans amounting to Rs681bn disbursed between July 2024 and May 2025.
The survey highlights trends, achievements, and challenges across major sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, industry, services, energy, information technology and telecommunications, capital markets, health, education, transport, and communication.
Additionally, it sheds light on developments in social protection programmes, environmental sustainability, and infrastructure.
 
 

The document also presents updated data on critical economic indicators such as inflation, trade and balance of payments, public debt, population growth, employment levels, and climate change impacts. By offering a consolidated view of these indicators, the survey aims to inform public debate and policy planning in the lead-up to the new fiscal year.
Meanwhile, the NEC emphasised that recent signs of “economic stabilisation” were the result of coordinated efforts by the federal and provincial governments.
It stated that the country has now moved onto a path of economic recovery and growth, with the agriculture sector playing a particularly important role in strengthening national reserves and supporting economic expansion.
“A comprehensive strategy is currently being formulated to ensure a steady and sustainable increase in agricultural productivity in the coming years,” it said.
In terms of development spending, a total outlay of Rs3,483bn has been approved for the Annual National Development Programme (ANDP) for 2024–25. Of this amount, Rs1,100bn was allocated for federal development initiatives, while Rs2,383bn was utilised by provincial governments for their respective projects.</p><small>2025-06-09 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/092028295e38d53.png?r=202919' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916097/pakistan-agreed-to-ceasefire-despite-having-upper-hand-on-condition-of-more-talks-with-india-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan agreed to ceasefire despite having ‘upper hand’ on condition of more talks with India: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for “intervention” from global powers in resolving key issues with India amid ongoing tensions, members of a high-level delegation presenting Islamabad’s stance said on Sunday after landing in London.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, the team has visited the United States, is currently in London, and will also head to Brussels.
The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
“We had the upper hand [during the conflict]. Despite that upper hand, we agreed to the ceasefire on the condition that there would be further dialogue in the future on all friction points at a neutral location,” Bilawal told reporters in London.
Asked whether he thought that the Kashmir dispute would soon be resolved after the US mediated the ceasefire, Bilawal expressed the hope that “moving forward, Trump or his government will keep its promise” as Pakistan’s defence position was better than India’s during the conflict.
 
 

“We hope that on an international level, whether it’s the United States or the United Kingdom, they all would play their role and convince India to resolve our issues through talks,” the MNA said.
The former foreign minister asserted that Pakistan had asserted its “strength” by taking down six Indian jets and now, peace needed to be established. He said those six jets were the “same as those that dropped their payload”, resulting in civilians’ deaths.
He further said that throughout the conflict, the country was seen as a “rational and responsible state”.
Meanwhile, the delegation led by Bilawal, which had arrived in London a day ago, also engaged with eminent members of a British think tank, academia, and policymaking community at Chatham House today.
During the closed-door discussion, the team conveyed Pakistan’s perspective on the recent escalation while “expressing serious concern about India’s unprovoked military aggression that resulted in civilian casualties and posed a significant threat to regional stability”, said a statement by the Pakistan High Commission in London.
 






It stressed that India’s actions constituted a clear violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty, international law and the United Nations Charter.
The delegation highlighted that the pending resolution of the Kashmir dispute remained the “principal stumbling block to lasting peace and stability in the region” and reiterated the call for global action to support meaningful dialogue and respect for international commitments.
Denouncing India’s move to unilaterally and illegally hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance, Bilawal warned that the “weaponisation of water undermines international norms and sets a perilous precedent”.
He urged the international community to take notice of the “alarming development and hold India to account for its actions”, according to the statement.
The delegation asserted that Pakistan’s response to India demonstrated the country’s resolve to defend its sovereignty and thwart “India’s ambitions to set any new so-called ‘normal’ in the region”.
 
 

Besides the delegation, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to the UK, Dr Mohammad Faisal, was also present during the round table conference.
The delegation also met with UK’s Middle East minister Hamish Falconer and his team at the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), Faisal said on X.
Bilawal also attended a discussion with members of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, attended by its associate fellow for South and Central Asia, Desmond Bowen, according to a post by Faisal.
In the UK, the team is set to hold meetings with the senior leadership of the UK Parliament, including the All Parties Parliamentary Groups on Pakistan and Kashmir, a press release had stated.
 






Diplomatic contest
On June 4, the Bilawal-led delegation concluded its two-day visit to New York, where it met with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, along with elected and permanent members of the UN Security Council.
It then met with several US Congress members in Washington — including the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — as well as think tanks.
Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, visited Moscow from June 2 to June 4. It met with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and a senior aide to President Vladimir Putin.
On its part, India had also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, as well as meet members of the UNSC, to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
On June 5, the Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance, taking advantage of his links to India.
Both delegations lobbied for their countries on Capitol Hill, meeting senior US lawmakers and chairs of various Congress committees.
 
 

The Indian delegation met members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, including senators Dave McCormick, Jacky Rosen, Jim Risch, Mark Warner, John Cornyn, and Elissa Slotkin.
The Indian delegation is led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and includes Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G.M. Harish Balayogi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, and Bhubaneswar Kalita (all from the BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), former Indian ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora.</p><small>2025-06-09 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09074534e2c84d0.jpg?r=101751' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916048/amnesty-calls-for-madleen-activists-release-as-sweden-distances-itself-from-gaza-bound-aid-journey' target='_blank'><strong>Amnesty calls for Madleen activists’ release as Sweden distances itself from Gaza-bound aid journey</strong></a><br><p>Sweden on Monday appeared to distance itself from Gaza-bound aid ship Madleen, carrying Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, as Amnesty International called for the release of the vessel’s activists from Israeli custody.
The British-flagged yacht Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, had departed from Sicily on June 1 and had hoped to reach Gaza later on Sunday, when the interception occurred, the group said on its Telegram account.
Among those on board the boat are Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament. The yacht is carrying a small shipment of humanitarian aid, including rice and baby formula.

Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard addressed the status of the 12 activists illegally taken into Israeli custody, emphasising that Sweden’s government long advised against travel to Gaza and the activists bore “clear personal responsibility”.
“The government’s current assessment is that the activists are not in danger and there is no need for consular support,” she was quoted as saying in comments carried by Swedish media.
Meanwhile, Amnesty International called for the release and protection of activists who were onboard the Gaza-bound aid ship Madleen seized by the Israeli military.
In a statement posted on X, Amnesty said, “By forcibly intercepting and blocking the Madleen, Israel has once again ignored its legal obligations towards civilians in the occupied Gaza Strip.”
“The crew were unarmed activists and human rights defenders on a humanitarian mission,” the statement said, adding, “They must be released immediately and unconditionally. They must also be protected from torture and other ill-treatment.”
Amnesty further stated, “As the occupying power, Israel has an international obligation to ensure civilians in Gaza have sufficient and safe access to food, medicine, and other supplies indispensable to their survival.
“Instead, and as part of its calculated effort to inflict on Palestinians in Gaza conditions of life designed to bring about their physical destruction, it has consistently and deliberately impeded the provision of impartial humanitarian assistance for civilians in desperate need.”
 
 

The statement also said that Madleen’s mission was “a powerful symbol of solidarity with besieged, starved and suffering Palestinians amid persistent international inaction” and also “an indictment of the international community’s failure to put an end to Israel’s inhumane blockade”.
The activists would not have risked their lives if Israel’s allies had “translated their rhetoric into forceful action to allow aid into Gaza”, it added.
“States must act now or risk complicity in Israel’s grave violations of Palestinians’ rights,” the statement added.
 






Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai said the flotilla was carrying baby food and aid. “The Israeli government is starving children by day while bombing their homes by night. The stoppage and detention of activists on the Madleen is an act of cowardice by Israel. Preventing food and medical supplies from reaching people in need is a violation of international law,” she said in a post on X.
She demanded that Israel must release all the activists and allow aid to Gaza immediately, commit to a permanent ceasefire and let Palestinians live in dignity and peace.
 






Earlier today, the Israeli military had seized the Madleen, towing it to Israel, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on X, adding that the activists will be deported to their countries.
The ministry said that the vessel “is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries”.
It said earlier that “the maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to unauthorised vessels under a legal naval blockade, consistent with international law”.
“Humanitarian aid is delivered regularly and effectively via different channels and routes and is transferred through established distribution mechanisms,” it added.
The FFC said earlier on Monday that Israeli soldiers had kidnapped the activists who were on the Madleen.
Israeli forces boarded the charity vessel attempting to reach the Gaza Strip in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade, the FFC had said earlier in the day.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment.
The United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has supported the FFC operation and urged other boats to challenge the Gaza blockade.
“Madleen’s journey may have ended, but the mission isn’t over. Every Mediterranean port must send boats with aid & solidarity to Gaza,” she wrote on X.
“As the Madleen was reportedly intercepted and seized by Israeli forces in int’l waters, the UK gov must urgently seek full clarification and secure the immediate release of the vessel & its crew,” she said in a separate post.
 






The Gaza Freedom Flotilla had also said that quadcopters surrounded the Madleen and were “spraying it with a white paint-like substance”, Al Jazeera reported.
Huwaida Arraf, the co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement, which is supporting the FFC, told Al Jazeera that some people on board reported that their “eyes were burning” after the white substance was dropped on the aid boat.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing the Israeli Navy communicating with the Madleen over a loudspeaker, urging it to change course, shortly before the FFC confirmed that Israeli forces had boarded the Gaza-bound aid ship.
“The maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to naval traffic as part of a legal naval blockade,” a soldier said. “If you wish to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, you are able to do so through the (Israeli) port of Ashdod.”
Mouin Rabbani, a non-resident fellow at the Qatar-based Centre for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies, told Al Jazeera that the “absolute silence” from the Madleen crew members’ governments reflects Israeli impunity.
“If any other state had sent its military forces to seize a small civilian boat carrying 12 unarmed civilians to deliver food, baby formula and crutches to a besieged population, it would immediately be recognised for the act of state piracy that it indisputably is,” Rabbani said.
“But for Israel, there’s always an exception.”
“This is not only an act of state piracy. It’s in direct violation of the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ),” Rabbani added, noting that the court has emphasised “the need for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian supplies to the besieged population of the Gaza Strip.”
‘Until the last minute’
The organisers of the Madleen’s voyage said on Saturday that they had reached Egyptian waters and were nearing Gaza, where the Israeli invasion of Gaza entered its 21st month.
“Israel will not allow anyone to break the naval blockade of Gaza, which is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching Hamas — a murderous terrorist group holding our hostages and committing war crimes,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said a day earlier.
“Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or support terror groups — by sea, air or land,” he added.
The coalition responded in a statement on X, saying it expected “interception and an attack from Israel at any moment” and calling for the governments of those on board to protect them.
The post added that the Madleen is 160 nautical miles from Gaza and that jamming “briefly disrupted our location, but our tracker is functioning again”.
 






Meanwhile, activists aboard the vessel have said they will continue their journey “until the last minute”.
“We’ll stay mobilised until the last minute — until Israel cuts the internet and networks,” European parliament member Rima Hassan told AFP from the boat. “There are twelve of us civilians on board. We are not armed. There is only humanitarian aid.”
Hassan voiced concern over the lack of official response from countries whose citizens are part of the crew.
“No state has responded. The message being sent is that Israel is being allowed to act with impunity, without any guarantee of protection for us,” she added.
In a post on X, Hassan said that the activists have “less than 24 hours” before they are detained by Israeli authorities.
“When we are no longer able to communicate with you, I’m counting on you to continue the mobilisation that has been so valuable to us throughout this journey,” she wrote.
 






Nationals of Germany, France, Brazil, Turkey, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands are on the boat.
“We’re not scared of them,” said German human rights activist Yasemin Acar, also on board. “The message they have been sending us, that we cannot come closer, is not making us step back.”
On Sunday, French Minister for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad Laurent Saint-Martin said that France was obliged to ensure “consular protection” for its nationals aboard the Madleen.
“The six French citizens on this boat are entitled to consular protection,” he told a state TV channel.
On May 27, Israel began implementing a controversial plan to distribute aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, bypassing UN oversight. Palestinians have denounced the move as a coercive tactic to force displacement from northern to southern Gaza.
Gaza’s Government Media Office said the death toll from the American-Israeli aid distribution sites had risen to 125, with 736 wounded and nine missing since May 27.
According to the office, 13 people were killed and 153 injured on Sunday alone in two separate incidents near those locations.
On Sunday, the health ministry in Gaza said that the overall toll for the Gaza invasion had reached 54,880, the majority being civilians. The UN considers these figures reliable.
The conflict was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.</p><small>2025-06-09 15:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09200523a977c63.jpg?r=200713' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916065/los-angeles-police-order-immigration-protesters-downtown-to-go-home' target='_blank'><strong>Los Angeles police order immigration protesters downtown to go home</strong></a><br><p>Police declared all of downtown Los Angeles to be an unlawful assembly area and ordered protesters to go home on Sunday night after a third day of demonstrations against President Donald Trump’s immigration policy that sometimes included burning cars and hurling bottles at officers.
National Guard troops, deployed by Trump over the weekend to help quell the protests in a move that California Governor Gavin Newsom called unlawful, guarded federal government buildings on Sunday.
The unrest in Los Angeles has become a flashpoint in Trump’s signature effort to clamp down on illegal immigration.
The Republican president has pledged to deport record numbers of people who are in the country illegally and to lock down the US-Mexico border, setting the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) border agency a daily goal of arresting at least 3,000 migrants.
California state and local officials, mainly Democrats, accuse Trump of inflaming initially small-scale protests by mounting a federal response. He calls the protesters insurrectionists.
Several self-driving cars from Alphabet’s Waymo were set ablaze on a downtown street on Sunday evening.
Los Angeles police said some protesters had thrown concrete projectiles, bottles and other items at police. Police declared several rallies to be unlawful assemblies and later extended that to include the whole downtown area.
Police on horseback tried to control the crowds. Some officers used flash-bang grenades and tear gas, CNN reported.
Demonstrators shouted “Shame on you!” at police and some appeared to throw objects, video images showed. One group blocked the 101 Freeway, a downtown thoroughfare.
City Police Chief Jim McDonnell told a media briefing on Sunday evening that people had a right to protest peacefully, but the violence he had seen by some was “disgusting” and the protests were getting out of control.
Police said they had arrested 10 people on Sunday and 29 the previous night, adding that arrests were continuing.
Newsom blames Trump
Newsom, a Democrat, said he requested the Trump administration withdraw its order to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles County, calling it unlawful.
Newsom said in a post on X on Monday that he planned to sue the administration over the deployment.
“This is exactly what Donald Trump wanted. He flamed the fires and illegally acted to federalise the National Guard. The order he signed doesn’t just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into any state and do the same thing,” Newsom said, using California’s abbreviation. “We’re suing him.”
 






In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X that “Newsom did nothing as violent riots erupted in Los Angeles for days.”
 






Asked if the National Guard was needed, the police chief, McDonnell, said police would not “go to that right away,” but added, “Looking at the violence tonight, I think we’ve got to make a reassessment.”
In a social media post, Trump called on McDonnell to do so. “He should, right now!!!” Trump added. “Don’t let these thugs get away with this. Make America great again!!!”
 


The White House disputed Newsom’s characterisation, saying in a statement, “Everyone saw the chaos, violence and lawlessness.”
Earlier on Sunday, about a dozen National Guard members, along with Department of Homeland Security personnel, pushed back a group of demonstrators outside a federal building in downtown Los Angeles, video showed.
The US Northern Command said 300 members of the California National Guard had been deployed to three spots in the Los Angeles area.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CBS programme ‘Face the Nation’ that the National Guard would provide safety around buildings to people engaged in peaceful protest and to law enforcement.
 


‘All action necessary’
The Trump administration’s immigration enforcement measures have also included residents who are in the country legally, some with permanent residence, spurring legal challenges.
In a social media post on Sunday, Trump called the demonstrators “violent, insurrectionist mobs” and said he was directing his cabinet officers “to take all such action necessary” to stop what he called riots.
 


Despite Trump’s language, he has not invoked the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that empowers a president to deploy the US military to suppress events such as civil disorder. Asked on Sunday whether he was considering doing so, he said, “It depends on whether or not there’s an insurrection.”
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Saturday the Pentagon is prepared to mobilise active-duty troops “if violence continues” in Los Angeles, saying Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton were on high alert.
 






Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the Trump administration for inciting tension by sending in the National Guard. She also condemned protesters who became violent.
“I don’t want people to fall into the chaos that I believe is being created by the administration completely unnecessarily,” she told a press conference.
Vanessa Cardenas, head of the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice, accused the Trump administration of “trumping up an excuse to abuse power, and deliberately stoke and force confrontations around immigration.”</p><small>2025-06-09 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09171041192ecac.jpg?r=171116' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916080/little-substantial-achievement-analysts-weigh-in-on-economic-survey-for-fy25' target='_blank'><strong>‘Little substantial achievement’: Analysts weigh in on Economic Survey for FY25</strong></a><br><p>The government on Monday released the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, revealing key figures for the fiscal year ending June. Key among them was the economy expanding by 2.7 per cent during the outgoing year.
The government had initially targeted a GDP (gross domestic product) growth at 3.6pc, but lowered it last month. The International Monetary Fund expects real GDP to grow by 2.6pc in FY25 and for the economy to grow 3.6pc in FY26.
In his foreword to the survey — a key pre-budget document — Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said Pakistan’s economy had been globally acknowledged for achieving macroeconomic stabilisation in the outgoing fiscal year.
Pakistan is consistently advancing on an upward trajectory, built upon investment-friendly reforms, enhanced domestic savings, and increased foreign direct investment, with GDP growth projected at 5.7pc over the medium term, he said.
Dawn.com spoke to analysts regarding their take on the economic survey, particularly concerning four things: the GDP growth rate, the GDP per capita, the large-scale manufacturing deficit and Pakistan’s tax revenue to GDP.
Here is what they had to say:
Weak demand, high energy costs stalling LSMs
The 2.7pc annual growth figure reflects a sharp rebound of growth in the fourth quarter, which appears inconsistent with earlier quarterly trends, said Ali Hasanain, an associate professor of economics at LUMS. “Large-scale manufacturing has contracted, and agriculture is practically stationary, with continued concerns about the accuracy of livestock growth numbers.”
He commented that the GDP per capita number, expressed in current USD, was a poor indicator of the welfare of the average citizen at a time when the dollar has stayed in a narrow corridor since the end of 2023. “Until demand normalises and trade grows, we must remain cautious in interpreting indicators expressed in dollar terms.”
Talking about the large-scale manufacturing deficit, he said that it was struggling due to weak domestic demand, import restrictions, and high energy costs. “These are deep, structural issues. Pakistan needs to reorient manufacturing away from assembly operations, trying to ‘save’ dollars by substituting for imports, towards competitive, export-oriented industries.”
“Agriculture, retail, and real estate remain undertaxed. There has been some expression of commitment to rectify this, but the government has little substantial achievement to show in three years so far,” Hasanain added.
Pakistan needs more imports
According to economist Ammar Habib Khan, the GDP growth levels were largely aligned with the consensus. On the other hand, the GDP per capita growth was largely due to “stability of the rupee against the US dollar”.
Khan said that for large-scale manufacturing to grow, Pakistan needed more imports. “And for that, we need more dollars and more demand, which remains compressed.”
On taxes, the macroeconomist commented that the burden was largely covered by salaried taxpayers, indirect taxes and formal industries only.
Lack of engines for growth
Commenting on the statistics unveiled in the economic survey, economist Adil Nakhoda said the GDP growth rate reported is likely driven by the industry sector, which reported a growth of 4.77pc. Interestingly, this was dominated by the wearing apparel segment, which grew by 7.6pc. Apart from crops, the agricultural growth rate was quite limited, while large-scale manufacturing contracted in the fiscal year.
“Although the overall growth rate itself is not much different from the number reported in the previous year, at 2.5pc, the issue is the lack of engines for growth, as it has been limited in only a few sectors and industries. The biggest worry going into the next fiscal year is the large-scale manufacturing index. The import constraints and the lack of competitive pressure need to be reduced to revive industrial growth.”
Commenting on the GDP per capita growth, he said that it was quite surprising as it put the same at around 10pc. “Even though this is the highest since 2021-22, it has typically been higher than the calculation of the GDP growth rate. As this is adjusted for inflation, the decreasing inflation may have contributed to a higher number, as the GDP growth rate was similar.”
He noted that large-scale manufacturing had been hit by not only import constraints but also the lack of competitive pressure in the industry, as several industries in Pakistan had enjoyed protection in terms of high tariff rates and the inability to be globally competitive.
“This has particularly reduced their ability to produce goods and satisfy local demand. There needs to be a dynamic adjustment in the manufacturing sector if we are to expect any growth in it, and that has to come with an increase in competitive pressure to ensure that the manufacturing sector produces goods that can compete not only regionally but globally.”
On Pakistan’s tax revenue to GDP, Nakhoda said that the two major sectors that needed to increase their contribution to taxes were agriculture and retail and wholesale.
“The agriculture sector has always enjoyed tax exemptions that have made its contribution to tax revenue much lower than its contribution to GDP, while the retail and wholesale sector have often evaded the tax net. Their contribution needs to be increased for the burden not only to be shared equally, but the burden to be reduced on other sectors that often contribute a larger share to tax revenue than their contribution to GDP,” Nakhoda added.

The two sides are meeting in the historic Lancaster House, run by the UK Foreign Office, following a first round of talks in Geneva last month.
Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng was again heading the team in London.
Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported the start of the talks.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are leading the US delegation, President Donald Trump said on Friday.
“The meeting should go very well,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told Fox News on Sunday: “We want China and the United States to continue moving forward with the agreement that was struck in Geneva.”
 


While the UK government reiterated that it was not involved in the discussions, a spokesperson said: “We are a nation that champions free trade.” UK authorities “have always been clear that a trade war is in nobody’s interests, so we welcome these talks”, the spokesperson added.
Rare earths
The talks in London come just a few days after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping finally held their first publicly announced telephone talks since the Republican returned to the White House.
Trump said Thursday’s call reached a “very positive conclusion”.
Xi was quoted by Xinhua as saying, “Correcting the course of the big ship of
Sino-US relations requires us to steer well and set the direction.”
Tensions between the two nations have soared, with Trump accusing Beijing of violating a tariff de-escalation deal reached in Geneva in mid-May.
“We need China to comply with their side of the deal. And so that’s what the trade team will be discussing tomorrow,” Leavitt said on Sunday.
A key issue will be Beijing’s shipments of rare earths — crucial to a range of goods, including electric vehicle batteries and which have been a bone of contention for some time.
“Rare earth shipments from China to the US have slowed since President Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs in April,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading group XTB.
“The US wants these shipments to be reinstated, while China wants the US to rethink immigration curbs on students, restrictions on access to advanced technology, including microchips and to make it easier for Chinese tech providers to access US consumers,” she added.
In April, Trump introduced sweeping worldwide tariffs that targeted China most heavily.
At one point, Washington hit Beijing with additional levies of 145 per cent on its goods, triggering a tit-for-tat escalation as China’s countermeasures on US goods reached 125pc.
In Switzerland, after two days of talks, the two sides agreed to slash their staggeringly high tariffs for 90 days. But differences have persisted, including over China’s restrictions on exporting rare earth minerals.
The impact was reflected in the latest official export data released Monday in Beijing.
Exports to the United States fell 12.7pc in May from the previous month, with China shipping $28.8 billion worth of goods. This was down from $33bn in April, according to Beijing’s General Administration of Customs.
‘Green channel’
Throughout its talks with Washington, China has also launched discussions with other trading partners — including Japan and South Korea — to try to build a united front to counter Trump’s tariffs.
On Thursday, Beijing and Canada agreed to regularise their channels of communication after strained ties. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese Premier Li Qiang also discussed trade and the fentanyl crisis, Ottawa said.
Beijing has also proposed establishing a “green channel” to ease exports of rare earths to the European Union, and fast-tracking approval of some export licenses.
China is expected to host a summit with the EU in July, marking 50 years since Beijing and Brussels established diplomatic ties.</p><small>2025-06-09 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09171417bfb1e96.jpg?r=171654' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916088/russia-fires-record-479-drones-at-ukraine-overnight' target='_blank'><strong>Russia fires record 479 drones at Ukraine overnight</strong></a><br><p>Russia fired a record 479 drones at Ukraine in an overnight aerial barrage, Kyiv’s air force said on Monday, the latest massive attack as Moscow rejects calls for a ceasefire.
The attack caused damage in several Ukrainian regions, though there were no reports of people killed or mass casualties.
“Enemy air strikes were recorded in 10 spots,” the Ukrainian air force said.
The mayor of the western city of Rivne, Oleksandr Tretyak, called it “the largest attack” on the region since the start of the war.
Russia has escalated its attacks across Ukraine in recent weeks, which Kyiv says demonstrate that Moscow has no intention of halting its three-year-long invasion and is not serious about peace talks.
The barrages have raised concerns about the capacity of Ukraine’s stretched air defence systems, but the air force said that it shot down or intercepted 460 of the drones, as well as 19 out of 20 missiles fired by Russia overnight.
Ukraine also said it had launched its own overnight strike on an electronics factory that makes parts for Russian drones, with local Russian officials saying the facility had to temporarily suspend production after the attack.</p><small>2025-06-09 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608356-no-mechanism-to-resolve-pakistan-india-disputes-says-bilawal-on-uk-sojourn' target='_blank'><strong>No mechanism to resolve Pakistan-India disputes, says Bilawal on UK sojourn</strong></a><br><p>

The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
“In the exchange of fire, three Khawarij, including a key local terrorist, Commander Chhota Waseem Gundi Khankhel, were killed,” a statement by Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Shahid Marwat said.
Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Policeman Shahidullah Gundi Khankhel was seriously injured and was sent to the District Headquarters Hospital, where he was embraced martyrdom while succumbing to his injuries on the way,” the statement continued.
KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed praised the courage and bravery of the Lakki Marwat police, the statement said.
He also paid tribute to the patriotic spirit of the brave people of Lakki Marwat, who are standing by their police to cleanse their area from the Fitna al-Khawarij. He further announced cash rewards and certificates of appreciation for this successful operation.
The police received information that some terrorists were going from Gundi towards Kot Kashmir.
On the instructions of Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and District Police Officer Lakki Marwat Jawad Ishaq, the local police and peace committee chased the terrorists.
Police and local peace committees came face to face with Fitna-ul-Khawarij terrorists at Kot Kashmir, during which the latter opened fire.
During this, there was a fierce exchange of fire between the police and the terrorists, in which one terrorist was killed on the spot, while two terrorists entered a house and tried to use the women and children in the house as shields, the police said.
“However, the police surrounded the house and continued the fight with great skill, which lasted for two hours. At the same time, the police strategically took out the women and children trapped in the house and continued the fight with the terrorists there and killed them,” the statement said.
The police also recovered weapons and ammunition from the possession of the terrorists.
“One of the killed terrorists was officially confirmed as a major terrorist commander, Chhota Waseem. The slain terrorist commander was wanted by the police for terrorist operations, while the formal identity of the other two slain terrorists is being confirmed,” the statement concluded.
In April, the killing of an elderly man and the injuring of his two relatives and a neighbour by terrorists sparked a fierce gun battle between the assailants and members of a local peace committee in the Begukhel area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, according to police.
Last month, the police and CTD commandos launched a joint operation against terrorists in rural areas of the district.</p><small>2025-06-09 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/091331445feb15f.jpg?r=133456' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916067/who-is-who-aboard-the-gaza-aid-vessel-madleen' target='_blank'><strong>Who is who aboard the Gaza aid vessel Madleen?</strong></a><br><p>Aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces early on Monday morning and towed to Israel.
The Israeli foreign ministry, in a statement on X, said that the vessel “is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries”.
The British-flagged yacht Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, had departed from Sicily on June 1 and had hoped to reach Gaza later in the day, when the interception occurred, the group said on its Telegram account.
On board the Madleen — named after Palestine’s only fisherwoman — are 12 activists from around the world, who had set out in response to Israel’s total aid blockade in the besieged enclave, according to a report by Al Jazeera.

Tehran and Washington have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear accord to replace the deal with major powers that US President Donald Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
The longtime foes have been locked in a diplomatic standoff over Iran’s uranium enrichment, with Tehran defending it as a “non-negotiable” right and Washington describing it as a “red line”.
On May 31, after the fifth round talks, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying later the text contained “ambiguities”.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei criticised the US proposal as “lacking elements” reflective of the previous rounds of negotiations, without providing further details.
“We will soon submit our own proposed plan to the other side through (mediator) Oman once it is finalised,” Baqaei told a weekly press briefing.
“It is a proposal that is reasonable, logical, and balanced, and we strongly recommend that the American side value this opportunity.”
Iran’s parliament speaker has said the US proposal failed to include the lifting of sanctions — a key demand for Tehran, which has been reeling under their weight for years.
‘Strategic mistake’
Trump, who has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Iran since taking office in January, has repeatedly said it will not be allowed any uranium enrichment under a potential deal.
On Wednesday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the US offer was “100 per cent against” notions of independence and self-reliance.
He insisted that uranium enrichment was “key” to Iran’s nuclear programme and that the US “cannot have a say” on the issue.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60pc, far above the 3.67-pc limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90pc needed for a nuclear warhead.
Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes
The United Nations nuclear watchdog will convene a Board of Governors meeting from June 9-13 in Vienna to discuss Iran’s nuclear activities.
The meeting comes after the International Atomic Energy Agency released a report criticising “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by its arch foe Israel.
Britain, France and Germany, the three European countries who were party to the 2015 deal, are currently weighing whether to trigger the sanctions “snapback” mechanism in the accord.
The mechanism would reinstate UN sanctions in response to Iranian non-compliance — an option that expires in October.
On Friday, Araghchi warned European powers against backing a draft resolution at the IAEA accusing Tehran of non-compliance, calling it a “strategic mistake”.
On Monday, Baqaei said Iran has “prepared and formulated a series of steps and measures” if the resolution passed.
“Without a doubt, the response to confrontation will not be more cooperation,” he added.</p><small>2025-06-09 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09143316c75f0c6.png?r=144450' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916073/trump-travel-ban-in-effect-barring-12-nations-citizens-from-us' target='_blank'><strong>Trump travel ban in effect, barring 12 nations’ citizens from US</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new travel ban came into effect early on Monday immediately after midnight, barring citizens from a dozen nations from entering the United States and reviving a divisive measure from his first term.
The move is expected to disrupt refugee pathways and further restrict immigration as the Trump administration expands its crackdown on illegal entries.
Many of the nations covered by the restrictions have adversarial relations with the United States, such as Iran and Afghanistan, while others face severe crises, like Haiti and Libya.
In announcing his restrictions last week, Trump said the new measure was spurred by a recent “terrorist attack” on Jews in Colorado.
The group had been protesting in solidarity with hostages held in Gaza when they were assaulted by a man the White House said had overstayed his visa.
That attack, Trump said, “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted” or who overstay their visas.
The move bans all travel to the United States by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, according to the White House.
Trump also imposed a partial ban on travellers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from those countries will be allowed.
New countries could be added, Trump warned, “as threats emerge around the world”.
 


Mehria, a 23-year-old woman from Afghanistan who applied for refugee status, said the new rules have trapped her and many other Afghans in uncertainty.
“We gave up thousands of hopes and our entire lives… on a promise from America, but today we are suffering one hell after another,” she told AFP.
World Cup, Olympics, diplomats excluded
The ban will not apply to athletes competing in the 2026 World Cup, which the United States is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, or in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Trump’s order said.
Nor will it apply to diplomats from the targeted countries.
United Nations rights chief Volker Turk warned that “the broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law”.
US Democratic lawmakers and elected officials blasted the ban as draconian and unconstitutional.
“I know the pain that Trump’s cruel and xenophobic travel bans inflict because my family has felt it firsthand,” Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari, who is Iranian-American, posted on X.
“We will fight this ban with everything we have.”
 






Rumours of a new travel ban had circulated following the Colorado attack, with Trump’s administration vowing to pursue “terrorists” living in the United States on visas.
US officials said suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national according to court documents, was in the country illegally having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.
Trump’s new travel ban notably does not include Egypt.
His proclamation said Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and war-torn Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen lacked “competent” central authorities for processing passports and vetting.
Iran was included because it is a “state sponsor of terrorism”, the order said.
For the other countries, Trump’s order cited an above-average likelihood that people would overstay their visas.</p><small>2025-06-09 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09113906b29407f.jpg?r=114004' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916023/5-injured-as-blaze-in-karachis-landhi-factory-almost-under-control' target='_blank'><strong>5 injured as blaze in Karachi’s Landhi factory almost under control</strong></a><br><p>A fire that broke out at a factory in Landhi on Sunday could not be fully controlled even after more than 30 hours of firefighting efforts, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb told Dawn.com that the “fire has been brought under control to a large extent”, however, more time is required to completely control the blaze.
“There are flames burning in the affected factories. It may take more time to fully control the fire and complete the cooling process,” he said.
The spokesperson said rescue teams are still present on the third day of Eid and continuously engaged in extinguishing the fire.
The fire, which erupted in a factory in the export processing zone in Landhi, caused part of a factory building to collapse, leaving five people injured.
“The injured include 45-year-old Aslam, 30-year-old Hamza, 20-year-old Ayaz, 43-year-old Sajid Mahmood and 53-year-old Mohsin,” Haseeb said. “They have been transported to Civil Hospital.”
Earlier, Haseeb told Dawn.com that the fire broke out at 4:31am, meaning that it has been burning for over 24 hours.
Speaking to Dawn.com earlier, Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, chief operating officer at Rescue 1122 Sindh, said that the fire broke out early on Sunday morning, spreading rapidly and engulfing two other factories due to the presence of combustible material.
He said, “As soon as the information was received, the Fire and Rescue team of Rescue 1122 reached the spot.”
According to Sheikh, a total of 12 fire brigade trucks,two snorkels and two ambulances of Rescue 1122 and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) are present at the spot to provide full assistance to deal with any emergency situation.
“The rescue operation is facing difficulties due to the intensity of smoke and other difficulties, as well as the shortage of water, but Rescue 1122 is making efforts to control the fire,” he said.
Sheikh highlighted that firefighting operations were “in full swing and full efforts are being made to reduce the intensity of the fire because the intensity of the fire is very high”.
“The Rescue 1122 team is making full efforts to control this emergency situation by utilising all possible resources,” he said, adding that citizens have been requested to immediately report any emergency to 1122.
Fire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.
Thirty shops were gutted when a huge fire erupted in a commercial building in Clifton in February.
Four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation and 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.
Last year, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a fire safety audit of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.
Out of 265 buildings, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added.
Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.</p><small>2025-06-09 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09091922431a736.jpg?r=092332' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916058/no-deaths-as-plane-with-20-aboard-crashes-in-tennessee-us-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>No deaths as plane with 20 aboard crashes in Tennessee: US authorities</strong></a><br><p>No one was killed, but several people were injured and taken to hospital on Sunday when a skydiving plane carrying 20 passengers and crew crashed in the US state of Tennessee, authorities said.
A twin-engine plane used for skydiving expeditions crashed shortly after midday in Tullahoma, south of Nashville, according to local and federal officials.
“There were no casualties,” city spokesman Lyle Russell said in a statement sent to AFP.
He said a total of 20 passengers and crew were onboard the DeHaviland DH-6 Twin Otter when it crashed at the Tullahoma Regional Airport at around 12:30pm (10:30pm PKT).
“Three were sent for medical treatment via helicopter and one sent by ground transport for more serious injuries to local hospitals,” he said, adding that “other minor injuries were treated by first responders on scene”.
Russell said that “no ground facilities or airport facilities were damaged and there were no injuries reported from the ground”.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating the crash, while the Tennessee Highway Patrol said on X that its troopers were assisting police at the scene.
