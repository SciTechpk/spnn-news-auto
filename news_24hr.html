CM Maryam’s visit comes in the wake of a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days. Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in the province.
“As the chief minister of Punjab, as a Pakistani and as your sister, all services and resources of Punjab, whatever cooperation or support you need — whether in operations against khawarij here or any kind of challenges in the government — we are with you,” Maryam said.
She further assured Bugti, “Whatever kind of support you need, I am just a call away. I will be very glad if I can assist you or do something for the people of Balochistan.”







Noting that this was her first visit to another province after assuming the office of Punjab CM in February 2024, Maryam said she was glad it was to Quetta.
“You have rightly said that you do not have fitna, but you have Fitna al Khawarij, which is your own unique set of challenges that Balochistan is facing,” she further remarked, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“A lot of courage and firmness is needed for it, which you are demonstrating by governing Balochistan in such situations, so hats off to you, CM sahib,” Maryam said.
The Punjab chief minister said she visited the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the morning, where the “commitment” she saw was very “promising and encouraged” her.
She prayed that may God help “Balochistan move forward and very soon eradicate the menace of terrorism” from the province.
“May Balochistan be a cradle of peace, safety and happiness,” she added.
According to her PML-N, CM Maryam held a meeting with Bugti and Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail. She also attended an event at the FC headquarters.







Punjab gives Rs10bn for Balochistan forces
Separately, CM Bugti also lauded Rs10 billion in “assistance for security forces” from the Punjab government.
A post on X by the CM Office quoted Bugti as welcoming Maryam to Quetta, adding: “The assistance of Rs10bn for security forces is a positive and commendable step.”
Bugti further affirmed, “The Balochistan government and the opposition is united for the people’s welfare.
According to the post, the Punjab chief minister also met with members of the provincial cabinet and leaders of allied parties.
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, CM Bugti lauded the Punjab chief minister’s visit to Quetta, saying her visit was “very respectful for us, especially during a time when we are confronting a situation”.
“And helping our security forces, which required Rs10 billion […] she gave the entire Rs10bn,” he said, lauding CM Maryam’s announcement and terming it a “great justice” to Balochistan.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting at the Corps Headquarters in Peshawar to review the overall security situation in the province.
According to a handout, the meeting was attended by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the national security adviser, and Peshawar corps commander, along with senior civil and military officials.
The press release said that at the outset of the meeting, the attendees paid tribute to the civilians and security personnel martyred in terrorist attacks.







The high-level meeting decided that Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches scheduled for this year would be held in Peshawar.
According to the statement, the meeting decided to implement a provincial governance model in the Malakand Division under the supervision of the police and other provincial institutions.
It added that the model would then be implemented in “phases in the affected districts, particularly Khyber, Orakzai, and Kurram”.
The press release said that to ensure the effective “monitoring of development projects and review of any security operations” in these districts, a special sub-committee would be formed under the leadership of CM Afridi. It was decided that the committee will hold monthly meetings.
The statement added that the special sub-committee would also include elected public representatives, the Peshawar corps commander, the KP chief secretary, the inspector general, provincial officials, and representatives from federal institutions.
The special sub-committee would also be responsible for “creating opportunities for alternative employment, ensuring a steady income for the locals” and arrangements to address the issues of temporarily displaced persons, the statement said.
During the meeting, it was decided that “effective communication between the Centre and the KP govt, complete coordination, and a united stance will be ensured on key policy matters to address issues such as terrorism”.
It was also decided to promote sustainable employment opportunities to prevent the youth from developing extremist ideas. The meeting also decided that strict action against illegal SIM cards, explosive material, and extortion will be taken, the meeting decided.
“Additionally, attention will be paid to the phased profiling of non-custom paid vehicles,” the statement said.
Last week, in an apex committee meeting, “consultation, cooperation and coordination” with the federal government and all political parties were termed “essential” for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy.
The panel discussed the “general rise in terrorism incidents in KP and an action plan to eradicate the menace of Fitna al Khawarij and establish complete peace and stability”.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.</p><small>2026-02-10 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972273/underdogs-strike-associate-teams-are-setting-the-t20-stage-on-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Underdogs strike: Associate teams are setting the T20 stage on fire</strong></a><br><p>After Sri Lanka’s win against Ireland on Sunday night in Colombo, Ramiz Raja declared that a win is a win, whether it is against “minnows”, or the “big boys”.
The term “minnow”, in the cricketing context especially, refers to a smaller, ‘less serious’ opposition. Despite being a test-playing nation, Ireland tends to often be categorised under this moniker. However, the term is also heavily used to refer to associate cricketing nations – those teams that do not yet have permanent ICC membership or test-playing status.
While one could argue that Ramiz Raja meant well, his choice of words came across as patronising and dismissive of the effort associate nations put into cricket. The opening weekend of the ongoing T20 World Cup offered ample evidence to the contrary.
T20 opens with edge-of-seat contests
The opening days of the tournament featured games across venues in India and Sri Lanka. Notably, many of these games were closely contested — especially the opening weekend fixtures — with the matches ebbing and flowing, and rarely was one team distinctly ahead in the contest than the other.
The closest of these to home was of course the opening fixture between Pakistan and the Netherlands. While Pakistan was relatively comfortable in the chase, a spectacular middle-order collapse left the team reeling, requiring 29 runs off the final two overs. It was a penultimate-over cameo by Faheem Ashraf, complemented by a fortuitous dropped catch that got Pakistan over the line.
For all intents and purposes, the match should have been an easier one to win for Pakistan, with the team being just 2 wickets down when they needed 50 to win off the same number of balls.
However, Netherlands’ performance established a trend that developed in the games to follow: associate nations showing up as exceptionally competent, competitive sides, making the contests much different than the one-sided affairs the uninitiated might have expected.
It should also be noted that the Netherlands are hardly strangers to success at ICC tournaments. In 2022, they defeated South Africa (to the considerable benefit of Pakistan’s qualification scenarios) in a spectacular upset, and followed it up by an even more impressive win against the same opponent in the 2023 ODI World Cup.
Later in the day, the USA put India under pressure in the powerplay, reducing them to 46 for four. A solid captain’s knock by Suryakumar Yadav ensured India ended up with a close-to-par score that the bowlers defended convincingly — but USA had done enough to prove that they are a side to be taken seriously in theT20 World Cup.
Perhaps the most convincing of these associate performances came when evening. The atmosphere at the Wankhede was electric, with tNepal took on England on Sunday he stands filled with hundreds of Nepal fans cheering their team as they came agonisingly close to chasing down England’s score of 183. In the end, Nepal fell just four runs short, with England barely escaping jail — and only after being tested to the absolute limit.
On Monday morning, Italy faced Scotland in a historic first World Cup appearance for the European nation, having qualified for the tournament by finishing second in the 2025 Europe Qualifiers.
T20: Cricket’s great equaliser
While the scheduling of the T20 World Cups attracts its fair share of criticism — for being held every two years instead of four and for over-saturating the sport’s calendar — it is undeniable that the 20-team format is the closest cricket has come to a truly global tournament.
T20 cricket itself is often criticised for diluting the essence of the game: for being too fast-paced, for driving over-commercialisation, and for indirectly undermining international formats due to the financial pull of franchise leagues.
What is often overlooked, however, is that the brevity and volatility of the shortest format enable something the longer formats do not: they narrow the gap created by disparities in skill, resources, and financial strength between associate nations and established teams.
At times, Test and ODI cricket serve more as displays of endurance than of outright skill. Teams operating with limited financial and administrative resources often face corresponding limitations in infrastructure: inadequate cricketing grounds and wickets, insufficient equipment, and sparse training facilities. As a result, even associate cricketing nations with abundant talent may struggle to develop players into durable all-format cricketers.
Furthermore, the current ICC calendar is heavily oriented around full-member nations playing each other, with associate nations rarely getting the opportunity to face stronger opponents in bilateral series that could strengthen their game. The lack of consistent match practice and training resources can lead to the raw talent of these players diminishing over the extended durations of Tests or one-day matches.
T20 cricket, however, presents a different scenario. Played over just four hours, it allows associate nations to compete within a timeframe that lets them showcase their full strength, even against much stronger teams.
T20 cricket is also the most accessible format. Permanent Test and ODI status is reserved for full-member nations, and temporary ODI status is often contingent on performance and other criteria. For many associate nations, T20 cricket remains the primary format in which they can consistently participate.
As the T20 game has evolved, so too has the arsenal of format-specific skills available to players. This allows teams to concentrate their development on this particular format, fostering a clear understanding of player roles, management strategies, and tactical approaches tailored specifically to T20 cricket.
In the games played so far, the craft of associate spinners has been particularly noteworthy, with standout performances by Nepal’s Dipendra Singh Airee and the Netherlands’ Aryan Dutt against England and Pakistan serving as proof.
Add to this the increasingly fast-paced (and therefore precarious and volatile) nature of T20 cricket, and the possibilities multiply. While teams with greater time and structural investment naturally maintain an advantage, it is not as decisive as it would be in the longer formats.
This is also why many “upsets” in cricket occur during T20 matches. A shorter game allows unlikely winners to emerge by sustaining moments of brilliance and consistency long enough to tip the balance. Notable examples from recent years include the Netherlands defeating South Africa in 2022, the USA beating Pakistan in 2024, Namibia overcoming Sri Lanka in 2022, and Nepal winning 2-1 against the West Indies in a three-match series in 2025.
Cricket still has a long way to go before it becomes a truly global sport. The disparities in resources and decision-making autonomy remain stark — both within some full-member nations and, more dramatically, between them and associate nations. Some teams, like the Netherlands, have competed as associate nations for many years across multiple tournaments, often attracting criticism for stagnation.
An opponent is an opponent
However, through T20 cricket, especially world cups, associate nations are making a mark for themselves by producing powerful performances more consistently than they did in previous years.
Problems of materials and resources aside, what also needs to change in the broader cricketing fraternity is the way associate nations are talked about and approached as sporting entities.
Words like “minnows” and “small teams” diminishes the spirit and skill that these teams show up with to compete against opponents who have an advantage of decades and millions in front of them.
On paper, fans of established teams might rightly expect their sides to win. But there needs to be a breakdown in the sense of shame created around losing, or almost losing, to associate teams. Recognising and awarding merit to their successes, viewing them as genuine victories rather than mere “upsets,” would be a crucial step toward granting associate nations the legitimacy they deserve as serious competitors rather than formalities.
An opponent is an opponent is an opponent. An cricket is so close to understanding why.</p><small>2026-02-10 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650134-pti-founders-health-is-fine-says-barrister-salman-safdar-after-adiala-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>PTI founder's health is fine, says Barrister Salman Safdar after Adiala meeting</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, came after the Supreme Court earlier in the day allowed Safdar to meet Imran.
Speaking to reporters outside the jail, Safdar said that Imran was fine and was looking healthy. However, he did not share further details about the meeting, saying that he had to submit a report to the court.
He said once the report was submitted to the court, he would be able to share the details.
SC allows lawyer to meet Imran
Earlier in the day, the SC had allowed Safdar to meet Imran, declaring him amicus curiae. The development came a day after a request for an ‘urgent’ meeting — submitted by senior PTI leader Latif Khosa — was rejected by a two-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
The bench observed that such an order could not be passed without hearing the other side. Hence, a notice was then issued to the government for Tuesday.
The two-member bench resumed the hearing, during which CJP Afridi appointed Safdar as “friend of the court”, with the court directing him to visit Adiala jail today and submit a written report regarding Imran’s living conditions by tomorrow.
PTI counsel Latif Khosa and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan also appeared before the court.
At the outset of the hearing, CJP Afridi barred Khosa from speaking, while AGP Awan said that he had “submitted a written response to the chamber in light of the order of August 24, 2023”.
In 2023, SC had directed the AGP to submit a report on Imran’s “living conditions in jail”.
He informed the court that the PTI founder was in Attock jail at the time of the order.
“We had submitted a written report to the chamber on August 28, 2023,” the AGP said, adding that a medical report from August 5 to August 18 was also included.
In response to this, CJP Afridi said, “After the August 24, 2023 order, there has not been any order on record which was satisfactory to the SC”.
In the court order, available with Dawn, it was noted that the report submitted by the AGP pertained to the period when the former premier was imprisoned in the District jail, Attock, in 2023.
Hence, it maintained that the court “considered appropriate that a report regarding the present ‘living conditions of the petitioner in jail’ be submitted by the Superintendent, Central Prison, Rawalpindi.”
Subsequently, the court appointed Safdar as amicus curiae.
“Salman Safdar should go to Adiala as a friend of the court,” CJP Afridi said.
“We have full faith in Salman Safdar,” he further remarked.
“He should be given full access to the PTI founder so he may be able to file a written response,” he added.
Justice Afridi directed that Safdar should “not be kept waiting outside Adiala”, assuring him that in case he encounters any issues, the CJP’s personal staff will be available.
Safdar, addressing the court, asked “if the scope of the report was limited to living conditions only”, citing concerns regarding Imran’s health in light of a recent medical procedure.
“Submit a report of the living conditions only,” CJP Afridi responded.
AGP Awan also requested the court to “include in the order that a report had already been submitted”.
Towards the end of the hearing, Khosa took the rostrum again, seeking that his request to meet Imran be accepted as well. However, the request was again rejected.
The court then adjourned the hearing till February 12.
Raja terms conversation with court as ‘beneficial’
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja recalled his meeting with the chief justice last Friday, adding that Imran’s incarceration and health came under discussion.
He termed the conversation with the court as “beneficial” and stated that progress had been made as a result of it.
However, the PTI leader clarified, “We are not declaring anything as final. We are not saying everything is good [and] we have gotten everything. This is not the case.”
The PTI leader called for the “system to […] return to humanity”. “It is humanity and piousness that we are demanding right now,” he stated.







The former premier has been incarcerated since Aug 5, 2023, currently imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Central Jail.
According to a two-page memorandum filed by PTI last week to the SC registrar, the party had requested immediate jail visitation rights for Imran with his family, doctors, lawyers and friends.
In the memorandum, it was alleged that Imran’s rights as a prisoner and a human being have been consistently violated during this period.
The PTI memorandum also highlighted the reports about “Imran being subjected to some secretive medical procedure at a hospital in Islamabad and keeping his relatives in the dark in violation of jail rules”.</p><small>2026-02-10 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10173123e93bc45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972282/police-officer-suspended-for-illegally-detaining-suspect-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Police officer suspended for illegally detaining suspect in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The head of a police checkpost was suspended on Tuesday for illegally detaining a suspect in Kahna area, according to officials.
The development came as a video clip of the suspect in chains went viral on social media, prompting Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran to take notice.
The suspect, identified as Mukhtar, was reportedly being kept at the police checkpost for the last four days.
Lahore Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mohammad Tauqir told Dawn that the suspect was found in chains, and the Lakhoki checkpost In-charge subinspector Adnan Virk was found guilty of keeping him in illegal custody.
The SSP said that, as per the initial police record, no first information report had been lodged against the suspect.
However, local residents claimed that the suspect was involved in criminal activities and they had complained to the police to arrest and investigate him.
Meanwhile, DIG Kamran said that the official was not authorised to detain the suspect at the checkpost even after the registration of a case.
“The suspect can only be sent to the lock-up of the police station concerned,” he added.
He appointed the Kahna Circle assistant subinspector as the inquiry officer to further investigate the incident.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101719364373d40.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972277/only-purpose-was-to-get-respect-for-bangladesh-says-pcb-chief-naqvi-after-talks-with-icc' target='_blank'><strong>Only purpose was to get respect for Bangladesh, says PCB chief Naqvi after talks with ICC</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said in the context of his recent engagements with Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and International Cricket Council (ICC) officials that the purpose was to “get respect for Bangladesh”.
Naqvi said this while speaking to the media in Peshawar, a day after the government announced it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the group-stage match against India in the T20 World Cup, scheduled for February 15.
The development followed protracted negotiations between the ICC, the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, consultations among national leaders and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.

 

The now-withdrawn decision to boycott the match against arch-rival India was announced by the government on February 1 after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The matter was raised during Naqvi’s media talk in Peshawar on Tuesday, where he was asked about several conditions that were reportedly put forward during his meeting with the ICC and BCB officials on Sunday.
In his response, Naqvi said: “We did not discuss anything apart from Bangladesh; our only purpose was to get Bangladesh respect, to highlight the injustice done to them.
“And you saw that whatever demands Bangladesh made, they were accepted. That’s it.”
He added, “We had no personal interest in the meeting … our task was purely related to Bangladesh. The government made the decision on that [basis]. When their demands have been accepted, and it has been acknowledged that injustice was done to them, we are playing after that.”
The developments unfolded as the ongoing T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, began on February 7. It was, however, overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland.
Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka.
After mulling its stance, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.

 

In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.
It expressed the hope that the PCB would consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country. Subsequently, it was reported last week that the ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.
Sri Lanka’s cricket board had also asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.
Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.

 

On Sunday, the BCB chief and ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja landed in Lahore and held a long meeting with Naqvi.
A day later, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake also urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India.
The government then announced the withdrawal of its earlier decision to boycott the match against India while an ICC statement said “that no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on Bangladesh Cricket Board”.
The statement also said that to compensate Dhaka, it was agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2031.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650110-cybercrime-case-non-bailable-arrest-warrant-out-for-kp-cm-again' target='_blank'><strong>Cybercrime case: Non-bailable arrest warrant out for KP CM, again</strong></a><br><p>

The stated rationale behind this development — which could mean longer payback periods and lower overnight returns — is the need to address the technical, financial and equity concerns that have emerged from the mushrooming growth of solar power in Pakistan over the last couple of years. Under the changes, the buyback rate for electricity exported to the grid by solarised consumers has been reduced from the existing Rs26 per unit to Rs11 per unit. The new export rate broadly reflects the national average energy purchase price at which the government purchases electricity from power plants.
At first glance, this price reform appears overdue. Like most electricity tariff interventions, however, it is not merely a technical adjustment but carries significant long-term implications for consumers, electricity utility companies, and the power sector as a whole.
To understand these implications, we first need to have a look at Pakistan’s solarisation map. A study conducted by the Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED) shows that solar deployment in the country has now surpassed 33 gigawatts (GW). While only a smaller portion of this deployment, around 6GW, is net-metered — that is, connected to the national grid — its much larger portion, around 27GW, is off-grid or behind the meter.

 

The net-metered deployment is mostly concentrated in urban communities, among higher-income households, and among commercial users. This rapid solar adoption has provided relief to hundreds of thousands of grid-connected consumers from high electricity tariffs, giving them greater energy independence and transforming them from ‘consumers’ to ‘prosumers’.
Besides that, as more people generate and consume electricity from solar power, it has greatly reduced daytime grid electricity sales, giving rise to the well-known “duck curve” in electricity demand and supply. This, in turn, results in underutilisation of the national grid.
Net billing vs net metering
Net-billing is being introduced as a key driver to tackle two concerns: (i) increase demand for grid-provider electricity (to address the duck curve phenomenon) and encourage self-consumption by grid-connected solarised consumers; (ii) reduce the cost-shifting impact of solarisation on non-solarised consumers.
This cost-shifting phenomenon occurs when a utility company — for example, a distribution company or Discos — is unable to recover its fixed costs from solarised consumers, so these costs are ultimately borne by non-solarised consumers. Traditionally, utilities recover much of these costs through the volumetric spread of electricity consumption based on total units (kWh) consumed. As an increasing number of consumers installs its own solar power to meet or supplement their electricity needs, these fixed costs must be spread over fewer units.
This will either raise the electric tariff or create a recovery gap.
The primary reason behind this regressive cost-shifting is our existing tariff regime, which does not distinguish between different tariff types in electricity bills. For example, it does not clearly separate the energy charges (marginal cost of producing electricity or the variable cost) and capacity charges (fixed charges including costs of maintaining the grid and transmission systems).
A large part of the latter cost is recovered through flat volumetric rates. These flat rates create a mismatch between how costs are incurred and recovered. When electricity consumers reduce their consumption due to solarisation, energy efficiency, or other changes, the money collected through volumetric charges falls short of covering the utility company’s costs. To recover this shortfall, utility companies raise prices for all their customers.

 

Under net-metering, a prosumer effectively shields themselves from these charges by exporting electricity from their solar installations at a price that matches the retail price the utility charges its consumers. Non-solarised customers, on the other hand, have to bear all the resulting increase in capacity as part of their electricity bill. As a result of the ongoing solarisation, more than 90 per cent of grid-connected electricity consumers are estimated to be facing a higher tariff burden.
With net billing, solarised consumers will not receive the retail rate for the electricity they export. The buyback rate for their exported electricity will, thus, come down to Rs9-Rs11 per kwh, helping Discos to recover more revenue from these prosumers.
Seen from this perspective, net-billing appears to be a fiscally rational act.
In practice, under a net-billing regime, solarised households will do two transactions with the utility company: one for the amount of electricity they will import from the grid, and second for the amount of electricity they will export to the grid — each at a different rate. This will improve cost recovery reflectivity, which is a core principle of efficient tariff design.
Secondly, net-billing will reduce cross-subsidisation of solarised consumers by non-solarised consumers. The former will pay the same electricity price as other consumers for the electricity they import, while receiving only a fraction of this price for the electricity exported by them. Thirdly, lower payments for the electricity exported by prosumers will provide short-term financial relief to Discos by helping stabilise their revenues. It will also spread the burden of fixed costs across all types of consumers equally.
Finally, net-billing can incentivise greater self-consumption and battery storage among solarised consumers, potentially aligning household behaviour with system needs by addressing the duck curve phenomenon — at least in theory.
Broad implications
These arguments, however, offer only a partial view. They ignore the fact that the real test of their validity lies in the implementation of the changes.
For instance, the regulations impose a flat rate on exported electricity regardless of the time it is exported. This creates two major inefficiencies. Firstly, even at a discounted buyback price of Rs11 per unit, households will continue exporting large volumes of electricity at noon — precisely when system demand will be at the lowest — because the solarised power output is highest at that time.
This, according to the evidence available from other countries, will do little to mitigate midday transmission and distribution congestion, reverse power flows, or local voltage instability. Flat export pricing offers no incentive to shift consumption from the evening peak hours, when the national grid faces its greatest stress (duck-curve), to off-peak hours. Studies on time-of-use (TOU) tariffs consistently find that consumer behaviour remains misaligned with system needs without time signals.
In addition to the flat export rates, restrictions on the system size introduce another layer of complexity. They revise the permissible sizing ratio of rooftop solar systems relative to the sanctioned load from 1:1.5 to 1:1. The intent is to limit surplus electricity exports to the grid. On paper, this will reduce operational stress and cost shifting. Yet this change also has broader implications.
The strict size cap reduces the surplus that households can export and does not adequately account for likely future electrification within homes: cooking, space heating, and electric vehicle charging, etc. By locking household system size to today’s sanctioned loads, the regulation may discourage long-term planning and constrain a household’s ability to electrify end uses that could otherwise reduce reliance on imported fuels.

 

Under net-billing regulations, lower export rates will lengthen payback periods for grid-connected solarised consumers, making solar power a less attractive option from an investment perspective. In comparison, systems designed primarily for self-consumption will offer shorter payback periods. This will create a real risk that consumers may choose to maximise self-consumption, using the grid only as a backup and, thus, effectively shifting to behind-the-meter mode. Such behaviour will further reduce the demand for grid-connected electricity and deepen the challenges of network underutilisation.
A poorly designed net-billing policy can also accelerate defections from the grid. If exporting electricity yields little value, particularly during high-demand evening hours, and fixed charges continue to rise, grid-connected solarised households may choose to install oversize solar-plus-storage systems and end their reliance on the grid altogether, further shrinking the consumer base for fixed-cost recovery. Beyond its impact on grid participation, net-billing also raises important questions about who can access and benefit from rooftop solar.
Rooftop solar adoption is already shaped by access to capital and, therefore, is being pursued more vigorously by high-income groups than by low-income ones. Lower returns on solar installations and their longer payback periods, especially when combined with taxation measures on solar panels and equipment, will certainly further disincentivise the low-income groups to move towards solar adoption, thus widening the inequity gap between them and those who have the capacity to finance new solar installations even after the regulations are enforced.
In other words, the policy will slow down solar diffusion and reinforce the current pattern in which distributed solar has become a technology primarily adopted by wealthier groups.
The real challenge
Net-billing is not inherently anti-solar; done well, it can correct an inefficient valuation of exports, reduce regressive cost shifting, and improve the financial sustainability of utilities.
But a poorly designed net-billing regime — especially one with flat export pricing and restrictive sizing caps — will push consumers into greater self-consumption, accelerate behind-the-meter behaviour, and even prompt grid defections. That outcome would deepen underutilisation and make fixed-cost recovery harder, not easier.
Pakistan’s real challenge is to modernise tariff design so the grid remains financially viable, technically stable, and economically attractive for all consumers — including prosumers. Net-billing can be part of that solution, but only alongside broader reforms that introduce time signals, transparently recover fixed costs and ensure equitable access so that distributed solar benefits all households, not just the wealthier ones.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10171110205c77f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972280/pm-shehbaz-hails-pak-kuwait-ties-as-raqami-islamic-digital-bank-issued-licence' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz hails Pak-Kuwait ties as Raqami Islamic Digital Bank issued licence</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said Pakistan and Kuwait share strong brotherly relations, which were set to further strengthen through bilateral economic, investment and trade cooperation.
He made the remarks while addressing a ceremony in Islamabad in connection with the issuance of a digital licence to Raqami Islamic Digital Bank.
The prime minister congratulated Raqami Islamic Digital Bank on becoming the third licenced digital retail bank in Pakistan.







He expressed hope that the bank would not only be Sharia-compliant but would also offer features that would significantly support and promote the growth of banking in the country.
“This development will go a long way in further enhancing bilateral economic relations between Pakistan and Kuwait,” the prime minister said.
He also expressed gratitude to the Kuwaiti leadership for their support to Pakistan at various times.

What started as curiosity is turning into what experts describe as a form of AI addiction — not in the clinical sense yet, but as a pattern of reliance that can interfere with daily life.
This isn’t just about teenagers preferring technology over face-to-face interaction. It’s about the way AI is being used to fill emotional gaps.

Teens are spending hours chatting with AI programmes, not just for help with homework but for emotional support, encouragement, and social interaction. Some report talking to AI more than they talk to real friends.

The appeal is understandable. AI doesn’t judge, doesn’t interrupt, and is always available. For teens who feel misunderstood, lonely, or socially anxious, a chatbot can feel like a safe space. 
Providers of these technologies design them to be responsive, engaging, and empathetic, which only strengthens the habit. A conversation that begins with a homework question can easily turn into an emotional outlet.

But that convenience comes with a cost. A 2024 survey linked to trends in AI use shows that when children lean on technology instead of people, it can affect emotional development, school performance, and real-world relationships. 
Because chatbots can mimic empathy without actually experiencing it, they give teens a sense of connection that isn’t grounded in mutual understanding. That can make real relationships feel harder or less rewarding.
Experts point out that habitual overuse of any technology — in this case AI — starts to look like more than just a habit. Patterns include prioritising chatbot interaction over friendships, hiding usage from loved ones, and becoming distressed when access is restricted. These behaviours mirror what psychologists recognise as problematic tech use, similar to excessive gaming or social media addiction.
Parents can play a crucial role in recognising this early. Signs include sudden mood shifts when screen time is limited, declining interest in offline activities, and frequently using AI late at night.
Conversations about technology often focus on safety and screen time limits, but with AI, the discussion needs to include how and why teens are using it. 
Opening a dialogue without judgment helps teens reflect on their own habits. Rather than banning AI outright, what matters more is helping them find balance and understanding the difference between supportive use and dependency.

Setting clear limits and routines can help. Experts suggest designated tech-free hours, encouraging in-person interaction, and promoting hobbies unrelated to screens.
Some families choose to check in daily about how technology made a teen feel — not just how long they used it. That shift from quantity to quality of use aligns technological tools with healthy emotional development.

There’s no simple fix. AI is here to stay, and for many, it will be a useful resource. But when reliance on AI begins to replace real human connection or interferes with daily life, parents and caregivers need to pay attention.

Helping teens navigate this new terrain is as much about emotional guidance as it is about digital rules.
AI doesn’t have to be the problem. Without awareness and limits, it can become a substitute for the support and connection that only real human relationships can provide.

A day earlier, it emerged that the provincial government had decided to release nearly 300 PTI workers. Government sources told Dawn that the “documentary process” had already begun.
“So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening, we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source.
Following the withdrawal of MPO orders by the provincial government, the additional advocate general of Sindh appeared before the court and informed that the MPO notification had been withdrawn.
The notification was presented in court, following which the court disposed of over 100 petitions filed challenging the detention of PTI workers.
Earlier today, the SHC directed the Sindh government to withdraw the MPO orders, warning that “if the orders are not withdrawn, the court will issue orders against the authorities”.
The defence counsel, Barrister Ali Tahir, informed the court that “over 187 families were being affected by illegal detention orders”.
He alleged that the “police had illegally raided the homes of party workers”, and added that the orders went “against SHC’s decisions and principles”.
Subsequently, the provincial home department, in a notification dated February 10 and available with Dawn, withdrew the detention orders.
“The government of Sindh is pleased to withdraw all detention orders issued by the Home Department, Sindh, under section 3(1) of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO), 1960, during the period from Feb 1 to Feb 9, with immediate effect,” the notification read.
“Senior superintendents of central prison & correctional facilities, Karachi, and district prison & CF, Malir, Karachi, are hereby directed to release the persons detained under the MPO, 1960, forthwith, if they are not required in any other case,” the notification said.
As per a statement issued via PTI spokesperson, Barrister Tahir had expressed hope that the detention orders would be suspended today.
More than 400 workers detained, claims PTI Sindh
In a post on X, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh welcomed the decision, stating, “Finally, the fake government of Sindh had to withdraw its unconstitutional and illegal detainment of our innocent workers and peaceful citizens”.







According to a PTI press release, Sheikh, while speaking to the media earlier, alleged that “more than 400 party workers were unlawfully abducted between Feb 1 and Feb 9”.
The PTI leader said the arrests were made on the instructions of the Sindh government.
“First, they abducted the PTI workers, then formally arrested them and later sent them to jail under MPO,” he said.
Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance.
On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating the public to block roads, highways, and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”.
The party challenged the alleged detentions in the SHC the very next day.
On Friday, the SHC directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650107-sindh-announces-photography-ban-in-girls-colleges' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh announces photography ban in girls' colleges</strong></a><br><p>

“Cumulatively, with an inflow of US$23.2 billion, workers’ remittances increased by 11.3 per cent during Jul-Jan FY26 compared to US$20.9 billion received during the same period last year,” said SBP.
“In terms of growth, remittances increased by 15.4pc on a year-to-year basis,” the central bank said.
It elaborated that the remittances in January were “mainly sourced” from Saudi Arabia ($739.6 million), the United Arab Emirates ($694.2m), the United Kingdom ($572.1m) and the United States of America ($294.7m).







Remittances in December rose to the highest level of FY26, reaching $3.6bn, largely driven by continued incentives for sending money through formal channels and relative stability in the exchange rate.
Currency experts believe remittance growth this year is weaker than in FY25. They cite concerns over a “managed” exchange rate, suggesting some inflows may be diverted away from official banking channels.
Pakistan is among the top countries receiving large foreign exchange inflows through remittances. While a growing number of jobseekers leaving the country is termed by some economists as brain drain, the government considers it beneficial for the external balance.
Last year’s record inflows of $38bn helped partially repay external debt, boost SBP reserves, stabilise the exch­ange rate and post a current account surplus after more than a decade.</p><small>2026-02-10 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10144652bd68186.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972267/president-zardari-welcomes-uzbek-presidents-invitation-to-visit-emphasises-strengthening-ties' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari welcomes Uzbek president’s invitation to visit, emphasises strengthening ties</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s invitation to visit the country and emphasised strengthening ties between Islamabad and Tashkent, the president’s media wing said on Tuesday.
According to a press release by the President’s Secretariat, the president met with Uzbek Ambassador Alisher Tukhtaev, who called on him at Aiwan-e-Sadr and handed over a letter from the Uzbek president, who had visited Pakistan for two days last week.
In his letter, Mirziyoyev thanked President Zardari, the government and the people of Pakistan for the extraordinary hospitality and warm welcome extended to him during his visit. He also expressed gratitude for being conferred the Nishan-e-Pakistan, Pakistan’s highest civil award, as well as the honorary professorship and doctorate, according to the statement.
“President Mirziyoyev reiterated his invitation to President Zardari, earlier conveyed during their tête-à-tête,” it added, referring to the Uzbek president’s invitation to President Zardari to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”.
“President Zardari accepted the invitation and directed the concerned authorities from the Pakistani side to coordinate with their Uzbek counterparts to finalise the visit later this year.”
The president said that Pakistan attached great significance to its close brotherly relations with Uzbekistan, while underscoring the importance of effective follow-up on the outcomes of Mirziyoyev’s recent “historic and result-oriented” state visit to Pakistan, the statement said.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation with Uzbekistan in “key sectors including food and agriculture, mining, information technology, tourism, health and banking”.
The president also welcomed Uzbekistan’s interest in importing halal meat, fruits and potatoes from Pakistan as a positive step towards enhancing bilateral trade, it added.
“President Zardari also conveyed his gratitude to Mirziyoyev for his message of solidarity and support following the recent terrorist attack in Islamabad,” the statement said.
Zardari reaffirmed the shared resolve of Pakistan and Uzbekistan to “continue their joint journey of peace, stability and development”.
During Mirziyoyev’s two-day visit to Pakistan, the two sides signed a protocol for enhancing bilateral trade between the two countries to $2 billion within the next five years.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his delight that the Uzbek president and his delegation visited Islamabad, his “second home”, for the second time in four years. Meanwhile, Mirziyoyev declared that Pakistan was Uzbekistan’s “time-tested, reliable partner and closest friend” in South Asia.</p><small>2026-02-10 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10143136bb9c197.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972266/iran-warns-of-destructive-influence-on-diplomacy-ahead-of-netanyahus-us-trip' target='_blank'><strong>Iran warns of ‘destructive’ influence on diplomacy ahead of Netanyahu’s US trip</strong></a><br><p>Iran on Tuesday warned of “destructive” influence on diplomacy ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington for talks expected to focus on US negotiations with Tehran.
“Our negotiating party is America. It is up to America to decide to act independently of the pressures and destructive influences that are detrimental to the region,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei in a weekly press briefing.
“The Zionist regime has repeatedly, as a saboteur, shown that it opposes any diplomatic process in our region that leads to peace.”
Tehran and Washington resumed talks in Muscat on Friday, months after earlier negotiations collapsed following Israel’s unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June, which triggered a 12-day war.
During the conflict, Israel targeted senior Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists and nuclear sites, as well as residential areas.
The United States later joined the campaign, launching its own strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities.
Iran responded with drone and missile attacks on Israel and by targeting the largest US military base in the Middle East, located in Qatar.
“The June experience was a very bad experience. Therefore, taking these experiences into account, we are determined to secure Iran’s national interests through diplomacy,” Baqaei said.
He insisted that Iran’s focus would remain strictly on the nuclear file in return for sanctions relief.
Tehran has repeatedly said it rejects any negotiations that extend beyond that issue.
On Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the Israeli premier “believes any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and a halting of the support for the Iranian axis”.
The talks followed threats from Washington and the deployment of a US aircraft carrier group to the region after Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.
Iranian authorities said the protests, which erupted in late December over the rising cost of living, began as peaceful demonstrations before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, which they said were inflamed by the United States and Israel.</p><small>2026-02-10 10:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1013164662c7d7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-from-exile-to-edge-of-power' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman: From exile to edge of power</strong></a><br><p>Less than two months after returning from nearly two decades of self-imposed exile in London, Tarique Rahman could win one of Bangladesh’s most pivotal elections and become prime minister, leading the country as his parents once did.
If opinion polls hold, Thursday’s election would mark a remarkable reversal of fortune for the soft-spoken 60-year-old, who left the country in 2008, saying he needed medical treatment after his release from detention under a military-backed caretaker administration. He had been held after a crackdown on corruption.

He returned home to a hero’s welcome last Christmas after a youth-driven uprising uprooted his Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s arch-enemy, long-time premier Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, in August 2024.
Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, long dominated Bangladeshi politics, while Rahman’s father was a leading Bangladesh independence figure who ruled the country from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.
Rahman has pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh’s international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi.
Rahman has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two-term, 10-year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies.

Events have unfolded so quickly since Rahman landed in Dhaka with his cardiologist wife and barrister daughter that he said he has scarcely had time to reflect.
“I don’t know how we have passed every minute since we landed,” Rahman said on the sidelines of an interview with Reuters in his party office, flanked by his daughter Zaima, who has been trying to drum up support for her father.

Image makeover
The bespectacled Rahman was born on November 20, 1965, in Dhaka to Khaleda and former president Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in textiles and agricultural products.
Since his return, Rahman has tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties under Hasina. Gone is the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister. Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies.
“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”

Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many.
He has always denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.
From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappearing, and offices shuttered.

Since returning, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring people’s ownership of the state and rebuilding institutions — a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a fresh start.
Further helping to soften his image, the family’s fluffy Siberian cat, Jebu, has gone viral on social media.
“She’s 7. She’s half Siberian. We adopted her,” Rahman’s daughter Zaima told Reuters.
Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders say he is directly overseeing candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed remotely.
He may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority.
“Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”</p><small>2026-02-10 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10143304e28c977.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972257/dar-indonesian-minister-reaffirm-trade-investment-as-key-pillars-of-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Dar, Indonesian minister reaffirm trade, investment as key pillars of bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Indonesia’s investment minister Rosan Roeslani on Tuesday reaffirmed trade and investment as key pillars of bilateral cooperation.
Roeslani, who is also the chief executive officer of Indonesia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Danantara), arrived in Islamabad on Monday evening, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
On Tuesday, Dar and Roeslani met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where their discussions focused on strengthening Pakistan-Indonesia economic and investment ties, the FO said in a post on X.
Both leaders also reviewed “potential collaboration opportunities and mutually beneficial projects, including exchange of views on sovereign wealth fund models, and reaffirmed trade and investment as a key pillar of bilateral cooperation”.







The two sides also held delegation-level talks, wherein they reviewed potential cooperation avenues and projects, including the “exchange of best practices and cooperation in priority sectors such as health”.
Presentations were provided by the finance ministry, Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and Board of Investment (BoI), the FO noted.
The presentations outlined Pakistan’s “investment landscape, priority sectors and facilitation mechanisms, while also seeking Indonesia’s experience and expertise, including in sovereign wealth fund structures and downstream investment”.
Dar reaffirmed the “shared commitment to longstanding bilateral relations based on mutual respect and cooperation, with mutual investment being a catalyst of Pakistan-Indonesia partnership”, the statement added.
The meeting was attended by SIFC National Coordinator Lt Gen Sarfraz Ahmed, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, the BoI chairman, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, the acting foreign secretary, and other senior officials.







Upon his arrival in the capital on Monday evening, Roeslani was welcomed by the foreign ministry’s East Asia Pacific region director general and the Indonesian ambassador.
“During the visit, he will have comprehensive talks with the DPM/FM on the prospects of enhancing Pakistan-Indonesia partnership in the domain of trade and investment,” the FO had said.







Recent months have seen robust exchanges between Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur, with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto also making a two-day official visit to Pakistan in December 2025.
He had held meetings with President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif, wherein the two sides agreed to enhance bilateral trade and cooperation in various sectors.
Indonesian Vice Minister of Trade Dyah Roro Esty Widya Put­­ri also visited Pakistan in January.

 

She and Commerce Minis­ter Jam Kamal Khan had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish an Indonesia-Pakistan Joint Trade Committee (JTC) to strengthen dialogue, facilitate cooperation and address opportunities and challenges in bilateral trade.
The same month, Indonesian Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin had also made a visit to Pakistan, where he met with the army chief and the air chief.
He had expressed Kuala Lumpur’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad across multiple domains, the military’s media affairs wing had said.</p><small>2026-02-10 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10133215f63348e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.
“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”

 


The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.
The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge JF-17 Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.
“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.

 

“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.
“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”
According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.
The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.
Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.
Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024.

It’s hoped a longer holiday (last year’s break was eight days long) might prompt Chinese consumers to boost consumption by spending more on travel, meals and more this festival period.
China expects a record 9.50 billion passenger trips to be made during the 40-day spring festival holiday travel period, higher than the 9.02 billion domestic trips last year, a state planning official said on Thursday.
Here are some glimpses of Lunar New Year celebrations across China.

While the government had issued a notification appointing Justice Agha Faisal — who was nominated by the Sindh High Court (SHC) — as the judge for the task on February 4, the notification was officially published in the provincial Gazette today.
“The Commission of Inquiry will complete the inquiry within eight (08) weeks,” read the notification seen by Dawn.
The office of Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi would provide secretariat support to the commission, it added.
It should be mentioned that the Sindh government had decided to seek a judicial inquiry into the fire, which claimed at least 73 lives, took nearly two days to be fully extinguished and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
The move came after a cabinet subcommittee of the PPP-led Sindh government reviewed a report submitted by a two-member team. They discussed the circumstances surrounding the fire incident at Gul Plaza and agreed that an independent judicial probe was necessary.
Though the decision followed Sindh’s major opposition parties’ unanimous rejection of the preliminary findings, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon refuted that it was due to “pressure” from the political opponents.
After conducting its own probe, the Sindh government had said multiple officials were suspended and some would face departmental action.
Terms of reference
As outlined in the Home Department’s notification earlier, the commission’s terms of reference (TORs) include ascertaining “the causes and circumstances leading to the fire incident at Gul Plaza Shopping Centre”.
It would also “examine and evaluate rescue operations for adequacy and swiftness”.

The commission was also mandated to “fix responsibility for any acts of commission or omission committed prior to and subsequent to the incident”.
Furthermore, it would assess whether Gul Plaza’s construction was “in violation of the approved building plan, leading to difficulty in evacuation of people”.
The SHC judge was also expected to examine whether building approvals and lease extensions from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), its predecessor organisations and the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) were granted in accordance with the applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Further, the commission would also have to assess the “arrangements in place at Gul Plaza building for fire prevention, detection and fire-fighting by building management as required under applicable laws and safety regulations”.
It would also determine if the building management or any government department/agency had carried out fire safety audits and whether the recommendations were implemented by the building management.</p><small>2026-02-10 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101240240ad867c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.
According to an ISPR statement, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.
Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.







Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.
“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.
ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.
The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.
“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.
It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.
This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.
Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.
The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.
“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.
Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.
He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10124939ce0509e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972250/pakistans-ranking-in-global-corruption-perceptions-index-edges-up-score-rises-to-28' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s ranking in global corruption perceptions index edges up; score rises to 28</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s ranking in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) 2025 improved by one point, moving from 135 out of 180 countries in 2024 to 136 out of 182 countries in 2025.
At the same time, the country’s CPI score increased by one point, from 27 in 2024 to 28 in 2025, according to Transparency International’s report published on Tuesday.
While Pakistan is undertaking commendable efforts in governance and institutional reforms, it is imperative that the recommendations of the IMF Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment are implemented effectively. This is essential to sustain Pakistan’s upward momentum in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in the coming years, said the Chair of Transparency International Pakistan, Justice Zia Perwez.
The Berlin-based Transparency International (TI) notes that corruption is worsening globally, with even established democracies experiencing rising corruption amid a decline in leadership.
The 2025 index shows that the number of countries scoring above 80 has shrunk from 12 a decade ago to just five this year.

 

The score has changed since 2012: 31 countries improved, 50 countries declined, while 100 countries stayed the same.
This year’s CPI ranks 182 countries and territories according to the levels of public-sector corruption perceived by experts and business people.
Chair of Transparency International, Francois Velerian, said: “Corruption is not inevitable. Our research and experience as a global movement fighting corruption show there is a clear blueprint for how to hold power to account for the common good, from democratic processes and independent oversight to a free and open civil society.”
“At a time when we’re seeing a dangerous disregard for international norms from some states, we’re calling on governments and leaders to act with integrity and live up to their responsibilities to provide a better future for people around the world.”
The highest-ranked nation was Denmark, for the eighth time in a row, with a score of 89. Only a small group of 15 countries, mainly in Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific, managed to get scores above 75. Of these, just five reached scores above 80.
Meanwhile, over two-thirds of countries (68 per cent) fell below 50, indicating serious corruption problems in most parts of the planet.
At the bottom of the index, the countries scoring below 25 are mostly conflict-affected and highly repressive countries, such as Venezuela, and the lowest scorers, Somalia and South Sudan, which both scored nine.
Data show that democracies, typically stronger on anti-corruption than autocracies or flawed democracies, are experiencing a worrying decline in performance. This trend spans countries such as the United States (64), Canada (75) and New Zealand (81), to various parts of Europe, such as the United Kingdom (70), France (66) and Sweden (80).
Another concerning pattern is increasing restrictions by many states on freedoms of expression, association and assembly. Since 2012, 36 of the 50 countries with significant declines in CPI scores have also experienced a reduction in civic space, TI says.
The CPI shows the stark contrast in controlling corruption between nations with strong, independent institutions, free and fair elections, and open civic space, and those ruled by repressive authoritarian regimes.
Full democracies have a CPI average of 71, while flawed democracies average 47 and authoritarian regimes just 32. Although a very small number of non-democratic countries score relatively well compared to their regional peers, and are perceived as managing a limited range of corruption types successfully, they remain exceptions.
Similarly, countries where civic space is guaranteed and protected tend to control corruption better. Those where the freedoms of expression, assembly and association are duly safeguarded are generally more resilient against corruption and score better on the CPI.
However, countries where these freedoms are lacking are more likely to lose control of corruption: 36 of the 50 countries where the CPI scores have significantly declined have also seen a reduction in civic space.
TI is calling on governments and leaders across the world to take action to strengthen justice systems, ensure independent oversight of decision-making and public spending, guarantee transparency about how political parties and election campaigns are funded, and protect civic space, democracy and media freedom.
This year, governments that fail to address their citizens’ concerns may find themselves toppled by popular protest movements. By choosing to act for the public interest, not private gain, governments and leaders can live up to their responsibilities to shape and nurture safe, fair and healthy societies where everyone can thrive, TI says.
TI CEO Maira Martini commented that at a time of climate crisis, instability and polarisation, “the world needs accountable leaders and independent institutions to protect the public interest more than ever – yet, too often, they are falling short.”
Some powerful nations have an indirect impact on corruption levels that extends well beyond their borders.
The Russian state has been accused of interfering in other countries’ elections by spreading disinformation and buying votes with the intention of influencing voters and driving instability, democratic backsliding and the narrowing of civic space.
The US government’s decision to temporarily freeze and then degrade enforcement of its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act – a key anti-corruption law that prohibits corporate bribery of foreign officials – sends a dangerous signal that bribery and other corrupt practices are acceptable.
At the same time, US aid cuts to funding for overseas civil society groups that scrutinise their governments have undermined anti-corruption efforts around the world. Political leaders in various countries have also taken this as a cue to further target and restrict independent voices, such as NGOs and journalists.
The report recommended that, in order to function properly, deter potential offenders and protect people who speak out against corruption, countries’ justice systems must be shielded from interference by political or economic interests.
This includes protecting appointments and promotions from external pressure. These systems also need to be properly resourced, prosecutorial decisions must be reasoned and reviewable, and courts should publish decisions and data.
Fundamental freedoms – including a free press and the right to information – enable the active engagement of individuals and groups to promote transparency and integrity in government and business activities. Decision-makers must fully protect civil society groups and people reporting corruption, such as whistle-blowers.
They should also create a regulatory framework that enables, rather than restricts, the work of civil society organisations – including giving them access to both domestic and international funding. This will strengthen the fight against corruption by allowing civic actors to expose abuse, assist victims, foster public participation and build accountability.
When journalists are attacked or killed for investigating corruption, power cannot be held to account effectively and corruption tends to worsen.
Since 2012, in non-conflict zones worldwide, 829 journalists have been murdered. 150 were killed while covering corruption-related stories, five of them in 2025. Over 90 per cent of these killings happened in countries with a CPI score lower than 50, including Brazil, India, Mexico, Pakistan and Iraq, which are particularly dangerous for journalists reporting on corruption.

 

Citizens deserve to know who funds political parties and candidates, or who influences decisions. It is important that political finance, conflicts of interest and lobbying are regulated, documented and subject to public scrutiny to ensure that democracy is protected against potential corruption.
Transparency and limits on political donations stop rich and well-connected industry groups from being able to unfairly influence policies, budgets and public institutions to suit their own goals, rather than the public interest.
The report recommended that robust checks and balances at home, together with strong national and international prevention and detection measures, are essential to block and uncover large-scale, high-level corruption and major cross-border money laundering.To deter and punish these serious crimes, more effective enforcement systems are essential.
Overcoming pervasive and deep-rooted state corruption will require strong national coalitions to rebuild democracy and the rule of law. International enforcement in states with effective justice systems can also play a vital role by prosecuting wrongdoers and seizing stolen assets hidden abroad, to cut off their ability to operate.</p><small>2026-02-10 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650051-corruption-perception-index-pakistans-ranking-improves-overall-score-increases-to-28' target='_blank'><strong>Corruption Perception Index: Pakistan's ranking improves, overall score rises to 28</strong></a><br><p>

Maxwell, 64, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, was subpoenaed by the House Oversight Committee to discuss her relations with Epstein.
Rather than answer the committee’s questions, however, the former British socialite invoked her Fifth Amendment right to not incriminate herself.
A recording of the deposition released by the committee showed Maxwell speaking via video link, her eyes cast down at the table she was seated in a Texas prison.
She was asked about her and Epstein’s co-conspirators, whether they surrounded themselves with the rich and famous in order to “curry favor” and avoid scrutiny, and whether Trump ever engaged “in sexual activity with an individual introduced to him by you or Jeffrey Epstein.” Wearing a drab, beige uniform, Maxwell repeated the phrase “I invoke my Fifth Amendment right to silence” until the committee gave up and called off their questioning early.

 


Maxwell’s attorney, David Markus, said she would be prepared to speak publicly if granted clemency by Trump.
“If this Committee and the American public truly want to hear the unfiltered truth about what happened, there is a straightforward path,” Markus said in a statement.
Markus also said that Trump and former president Bill Clinton — both of whom were once friendly with Epstein — are “innocent of any wrongdoing.”
“Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation,” he said.
Maxwell is the only person convicted of a crime in connection with Epstein, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.
She was convicted in 2021 of supplying underage girls to Epstein, who had ties to powerful business executives, politicians, celebrities and academics.

 

Her deposition comes amid the recent release by the Justice Department of millions of documents related to the government’s investigation into Epstein, many of which have been heavily redacted.
The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) passed by Congress in November compelled the Justice Department to release all of the records in its possession related to Epstein.
It required the redaction of the names or personal identifying information about Epstein’s victims, who numbered more than 1,000 according to the FBI.
But the EFTA said no records could be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”
Congressional access to unredacted files
Members of Congress were given access to unredacted versions of the files Monday, though only under strict, in-person visits at secure Justice Department viewing locations.
“I saw the names of lots of people who were redacted for mysterious or baffling or inscrutable reasons,” Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat, told reporters, including “people who were enablers and cooperators.” The Justice Department has said no new prosecutions are expected.
Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, said he discovered the names of six men whose identities have been redacted from the publicly released documents and who “are likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files.”
Massie declined to provide their identities but said one “is pretty high up in a foreign government.” He also posted on X a sordid 2009 email exchange between Epstein and a redacted sender discussing a “torture video.”







Massie said the email exchange appeared to be with “a Sultan” and that the Department of Justice should make his identity public.
Later, on CNN, Massie said prominent businessman Les Wexner was listed as a “co-conspirator” in a 2019 child sex trafficking case, in a file that had been improperly redacted. Wexner is the billionaire behind women’s retailers and lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret.
The House Oversight Committee has also summoned Clinton and his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, to testify about their interactions with Epstein.
The Clintons have called for their depositions to be held publicly to prevent Republicans from politicizing their testimony.
Trump was once a close friend of Epstein but has not been called to testify by the Republican-controlled committee.</p><small>2026-02-10 06:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650039-pm-shehbaz-to-attend-trumps-board-of-peace-meeting-on-feb-19' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz 'to attend' Trump's Board of Peace meeting on Feb 19</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.
The inaugural meeting will focus on Gaza’s post-war reconstruction. The official invitation underlines the expected presence of “heads of state, heads of government, and international figures”.
The summit is also expected to formalise the board’s mandate and structure.
Eight Muslim-majority countries are expected to participate in the meeting. They include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Qatar, and the UAE. Muslim participants are expected to adopt a unified position on Gaza-related issues.
These include halting Israeli ceasefire violations and securing durable peace guarantees. Such guarantees are seen as essential for reconstruction efforts to proceed. The meeting may also address mechanisms to support long-term stability.
All 22 invitees have already joined the Board of Peace. Pakistan joined the board in late January, and it signed the founding charter during the World Economic Forum in Davos.
The charter was signed on January 22 alongside representatives from two dozen countries.
Pakistan’s participation reflects its diplomatic engagement on Gaza as Islamabad continues to support Palestinian rights and international law. Officials stress that this position remains unchanged.
The Feb 19 meeting is described as organisational and financial in nature and is also expected to function as a fundraising conference. Discussions will define the board’s structure, mandate, and secretariat.
Operational direction is also expected to be clarified. Diplomatic sources said troop contributions may be discussed and any decision would follow completion of the board’s framework.
President Trump launched the Board of Peace late last month. It is part of his broader Gaza peace and transition plan. Trump will chair the meeting in Washington. He has framed the initiative as a vehicle for reconstruction and cooperation.
Analysts have welcomed the stated objectives of the board, while others have raised concerns about its wider implications. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due to meet President Trump on February 18, is expected to attend the talks; however, his participation has not yet been officially confirmed.
The moot will focus on the implementation of the ceasefire and Gaza’s future governance.
The Board of Peace was first proposed in September 2025. It formed part of a 20-point Gaza peace plan. The plan followed a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier that year.
The board’s establishment was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution.
Resolution 2803, adopted in November, authorised international cooperation for Gaza’s reconstruction. The board’s charter includes humanitarian and reconstruction responsibilities. It also allows for broader conflict resolution roles.
This expansive mandate has drawn mixed global reactions. Several Western allies have expressed reservations. Concerns focus on structure, financing, and long-term authority.
Some countries have chosen not to participate. Islamabad has adopted a cautious approach to engagement. Officials stress Pakistan’s participation is not unconditional.
Pakistan aims to advocate Palestinian self-determination.
Diplomats say Islamabad seeks alignment with UN resolutions, and international law remains central to its position.
Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi earlier outlined Pakistan’s stance, stressing a lasting ceasefire, humanitarian access, and reconstruction.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán confirmed his attendance, along with Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto, who has also indicated that he will attend. So have half a dozen other Muslim states.
Some countries, including India, are expected to skip the meeting.</p><small>2026-02-10 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1010142190a8231.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972246/massive-fire-at-textile-factory-in-rawalpindis-rawat-area-extinguished-after-16-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Massive fire at textile factory in Rawalpindi’s Rawat area extinguished after 16 hours</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: A massive blaze at a textile factory in Rawalpindi’s Rawat industrial estate was extinguished on Tuesday after a 16-hour effort, according to a statement from Rescue 1122.
The fire broke out on Monday evening. No loss of life was reported in the incident.
More than 80 personnel and 21 emergency vehicles were engaged in the overnight firefighting efforts, said the statement.
It added that more than 200,000 litres of water were used, along with foam, to control the blaze. Fire tenders and firefighters from neighbouring districts were also summoned.
Firefighters, after extinguishing the blaze, continued cooling efforts. The statement added that cracks have developed in the structure and there is a risk of collapse.
The cause of the fire had yet to be established, as it was too early to determine; however, fire investigators and rescuers were present at the scene.
A day earlier, the fire, which was initially declared a second-degree blaze, caused extensive property damage and sparked panic in the area.
Up to 45 firefighters, along with 13 emergency vehicles, struggled to control the fire.
Fire services from Bahria Town and Islamabad, along with Wasa Rawalpindi, were also called in to assist the firefighting operation.
Huge plumes of thick black smoke billowed over the industrial area and could be seen from miles away.
Earlier this month, it had emerged that all high-rise buildings in the garrison city had been served notices to adopt fire safety measures within 30 days.</p><small>2026-02-10 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650021-junaid-akbar-announces-plan-to-quit-na-seat-amid-pti-rift' target='_blank'><strong>Junaid Akbar announces plan to quit NA seat amid PTI rift</strong></a><br><p>

ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday strongly condemned the recent suicide attack in Tarlai, demanding a thorough, transparent and time-bound investigation to bring the perpetrators and sponsors of terrorism to justice.
Through a unanimously adopted resolution moved by PPP Senator Syed Wa­­qar Mehdi, the House urged the strengthening of intelligence coordination and security arrangements, especially in the federal capital and at sensitive locations.
The resolution condemned the suicide attack on civilians, stating it violates Islamic values, humanity, and Constitution. It expressed deep condolences to the victims’ families and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured.
The House paid tribute to law-enforcement agencies, emergency responders, and medical personnel for their prompt professional response. It also suspended its routine to discuss the tragedy, affirming national unity amidst a blackout on TV and the Senate’s YouTube stream.
However, the debate turned heated as opposition criticised Lahore’s Basant celebrations following major terror attacks in Balochistan and Islamabad.
With incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan facing accusations re­­garding the resettlement of the Taliban in Pakistan, Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas called for a joint session of parliament. He demanded that the former military and spying age­ncy chiefs be summoned to explain who brought the Taliban back to the country.
Senator Abbas regretted the dances performed as part of Basant celebrations in Lahore while dozens of families mou­rned. “This cold-heartedness would only benefit the terrorists,” Abbas remarked.
He claimed timely hospital transfers could have saved lives. He argued that a collective funeral attended by the prime minister would have sent a necessary message of national unity.
PTI’s parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the Tarlai tragedy had brought tears to the eyes of every citizen, reminding the House that the time for politics and excuses had already passed.
“This is the time for a decisive action,” he asserted, adding that Pakistan comes first.
Barrister Zafar emphasised that unity needs public trust, which the government undermines by opposing Imran Khan. He urged dismantling terrorist net­­works completely, not just isolated arrests.
“If Daesh or any other terrorist organisation is operating within the country, it must be dealt with immediately and decisively,” he said.
Senator Sherry Rehman criticised federal ministers’ absence during the debate and praised the armed forces’ sacrifices, while condemning the opposition for setting conditions during a national crisis.
“What our army has done against terrorists, no other army in the world has done,” she said. Ms Rehman criticised Imran Khan for alleged sympathies with the Taliban, noting there was a reason many referred to him as “Taliban Khan”.
Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar took strong exception to criticism directed at the armed forces.
“All of us politicians and parties have made mistakes. Our security agencies are fighting a war against terrorism. We have to stand firmly with our institutions,” the law minister said.
However, JUI-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman argued the nation could not be satisfied by simply blaming a neighbouring country. “We trained the youth under an institution and today we are calling them wrong,” he regretted. He contended that a policy distinction persisted where those who commit terrorism on institutional orders are considered “good Taliban”, while those who do not are labelled “bad Taliban”.
Framing of cultural event
Rejecting criticism of the cultural festival, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid framed the event as an act of defiance. “The terrorists want to make us mourn all the time but we will give a message to the terrorists, we will celebrate and destroy you,” he said.
However, the session ended in pandemonium when PML-N’s Abid Sher Ali chided the PTI over the May 9 incidents, leading to intense verbal clashes.
Lawmakers from both sides blamed one another for the ongoing menace of terrorism.

ISLAMABAD: In a rapid move, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
The contractual changes were introduced through a predetermined set of regulations that had been published as draft for public opinion but were notified without any change after a public hearing. The notification effectively terminates the existing net-metering regime and replaces it with net-billing for all.
As a result, earlier public pronouncements by officials and ministers that the terms of contracts with existing prosumers would remain unchanged until completion of their seven-year terms have proven incorrect. Under the new regulations, the existing registered prosumers will be shifted immediately to net-billing instead of net-metering, and their export units will be credited for one month only instead of the current three months. All other existing terms will remain unchanged until expiry of their seven-year contracts.
New prosumers will be granted only five-year contracts, and their export units will be accepted at Rs11 per unit compared to Rs26 under the existing contracts. Consumers’ import units from distribution companies (Discos) will now be billed separately at Rs37-55 per unit, depending on the relevant slab, excluding taxes, surcharges and duties.
Surplus generation exported to Discos will be calculated separately — at Rs26 per unit for existing and around Rs10 per unit for future prosumers. The net difference will be billed to consumers, unlike the existing system of unit-for-unit exchange in import and export.

 

Nepra held a marathon public hearing on Friday evening but restricted dozens of relevant consumers, independent think tanks and business representatives from suggesting alternative solutions. By the afternoon of the first working day, the regulator notified the same draft without changing a single clause, indicating a predetermined conclusion.
Earlier, the Power Division had proposed similar changes multiple times but withdrew after public criticism over unilateral changes to consumer-financed contracts under a properly announced renewable policy in 2015.
Both the government side and the regulator have blamed prosumers with higher-than-approved solar capacity and non-metered solar homeowners for grid challenges and higher capacity charges. However, the new regulations appear silent on both counts.
The Power Division claimed on-grid (metered) solar capacity had reached 7,000MW and off-grid exceeded 13,000MW. The power minister said millions of consumers had installed hybrid systems without meters to remain in subsidised categories, pushing capacity beyond 19,000MW outside metering. The new rules target only metered solar consumers.
Under the regulations, at the end of each billing cycle following the interconnection of a distributed generation facility, Discos will raise bills after accounting for electricity generated and consumed by the prosumer “under a net-billing arrangement”. Units supplied by Discos to prosumers will be billed at the applicable tariff (Rs37-55 per unit excluding taxes), while units supplied by prosumers to Discos will be billed at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
Net-billing means electricity generated by a prosumer’s distributed facility is purchased by Disco, and a bill is raised on consumption at Rs37-55 per unit after credit for electricity supplied by the prosumer at NAEPP. “In case the billed amount of the units supplied by prosumers exceeds the billed amount of units supplied by Disco, the net billed amount shall be credited against the prosumer’s next billing cycle or shall be paid by the licensee to the prosumer quarterly,” Nepra stated. Discos, however, have not made such payments in the past.
Under the new regulations, prosumers will not be allowed to install solar systems for net-metering beyond their original sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Existing prosumers’ contracts will remain valid until expiry of their current seven-year term, after which they may request a five-year extension, subject to Discos’ willingness. The new regulations apply to systems ranging from one kilowatt to one megawatt (1kW to 1MW) under Nepra’s direct regulatory and licensing domain.
At present, consumers below 25kW are licensed directly by Discos.
The solar regulation changes have been notified despite Nepra itself repeatedly blaming power companies for unaffordable and inefficient supplies.
“Compounded by heavy taxes, levies and surcharges, particularly the Debt Servicing Surcharge, these factors collectively inflate electricity costs for consumers. The result is a shifting of consumers towards decentralised or off-grid solutions, further weakening demand for grid-based electricity,” Nepra said recently.
The regulator stated that the new prosumer regulations provide clearer procedures, stricter technical requirements and a shift in billing methodology, aiming to better integrate small-scale generation into the national grid while safeguarding system stability.
Another restriction is a capacity cap at the transformer level. Discos are barred from entertaining new applications if the cumulative distributed generation capacity connected to a particular distribution transformer reaches 80pc of its rated capacity, to avoid overloading and technical instability in local distribution networks.

The decision to play the match comes after a delegation from the ICC arrived in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India. It also came hours after Sri Lanka urged Pakistan to play India.
In a post on X, the government said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was formally briefed by PCB Chairman Naqvi regarding the outcomes of high-level deliberations held between the PCB, representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).
“The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges,” it said.







“The government further noted the statement by BCB President Aminul Islam. The profound gratitude expressed by our brotherly nation is received with great warmth. Pakistan reaffirms that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh,” it said.
It noted that PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier in the day.
“During their warm and friendly conversation, they recalled that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had always stood shoulder to shoulder, especially during challenging times. The Sri Lankan president requested the prime minister to accord serious consideration to amicably resolve the current impasse,” the government said.
“In view of the outcomes achieved in multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan national cricket team to take the field on February 15, 2026, for its scheduled fixture in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.
“Moreover, this decision has been taken with the aim of protecting the spirit of cricket, and to support the continuity of this global sport in all participating nations,” the government said.
“The prime minister and the people of Pakistan extend their best wishes to the Men in Green. We remain confident that our team will carry the spirit of sportsmanship and national pride onto the field as they compete for global glory,” the government said.
Reacting to the post, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said, “Game on hai (the game is on)!”
“The whole nation stands behind the men in green. Great decision by the PM Shehbaz and great diplomacy by PCB chairman,” he said.







Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz earlier in the day, thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.
“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said.







“As co-host of the tournament, Sri Lanka thanks the ICC and all concerned for their efforts. Sri Lanka hasn’t forgotten the solidarity shown by both India and Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup, when they played in Colombo at a time when others refrained due to security concerns,” he said.
Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to play match
Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake had urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.
“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.







The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.
“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not cancelling the tour of Pakistan,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.
Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India. In the statement shared by state-run PTV on X, the BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”.
He particularly thanked the PCB, its chairman and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.
“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.







Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.
“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.
No penalty on Bangladesh for opting out of World Cup: ICC
Meanwhile, the ICC said that it would not impose any penalty on the BCB for opting out of the T20 World Cup and also agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the 2031 tournament.
In a statement, the ICC said that it had concluded an “open, constructive and congenial dialogue” with PCB and BCB officials, saying that the meeting was not limited to the tournament in India, but the “broader outlook for cricket in South Asia”.
“While reflecting on the Bangladesh cricket team’s unfortunate absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the global governing body for cricket reaffirmed BCB’s position as a valued full member, with a proud cricketing history and a vital role in the growth of the global game,” it said.







The statement reiterated the ICC’s continued facilitation of growth in one of cricket’s “most vibrant” markets, with more than 200 million passionate fans, to ensure that Bangladesh’s non-participation in the tournament did not have any long-term effects on cricket in the country.
Sharing the highlights of the dialogue with BCB and PCB officials, the statement said that it reflected “a forward-looking alignment reached in good faith” and was “intended to provide clarity on the current position of the stakeholders”.
It further mentioned that these outcomes did not “alter, qualify or detract from the ICC’s constitutional autonomy, governance framework or established decision-making processes”, all of which remained fully applicable.
The governing body added that it was agreed that “no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on [the] BCB” in relation to the current matter.
“It is acknowledged that BCB retains the right to approach the dispute resolution committee should it choose to do so. This right exists under current ICC regulations and remains intact,” it stated.
The statement noted that the ICC’s approach was guided by its principles of neutrality and fairness and reflected the shared objective of facilitative support rather than punishment.
Moreover, all the parties reached an agreement that Bangladesh would host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031, “subject to the usual ICC hosting processes, timelines and operational requirements”.
“This reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s capability as a host and reinforces the ICC’s commitment to providing meaningful hosting opportunities across its membership to develop cricket in the country,” the statement read.
It added that the governing body, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi boards and other members remained committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport.
“All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity,” the statement read
ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta was quoted as saying, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable but it does not alter the ICC’s enduring commitment to Bangladesh as a core cricketing nation.
“Our focus continues to be on working closely with key stakeholders, including BCB, to ensure the sport grows sustainably in the country and that future opportunities for its players and fans are strengthened,” Gupta said.
He further added that Bangladesh remained a priority cricket ecosystem deserving of long-term investment in its development, competitiveness and global integration, and was not defined by short-term disruptions.
Earlier this month, the government had given the cricket team the nod to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.
The decision had come after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.</p><small>2026-02-09 20:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649989-defence-minister-calls-for-unity-as-na-unanimously-adopts-resolution-against-tarlai-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif calls for unity as NA unanimously adopts resolution against Islamabad attack</strong></a><br><p>
