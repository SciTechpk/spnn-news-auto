The Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States, said the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different dhow sailing boats within 48 hours last week. It was working in “direct support of Saudi-led Combined Task Force (CTF) 150” of the CMF during focused operation Al Masmak, which began on October 16.
“The crew boarded the first dhow and seized over two tons of crystal methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $822,400,000 [on] October 18. Less than 48 hours later, the crew boarded a second dhow and seized 350 kilogrammes of [crystal meth] worth $140,000,000 and 50kg of cocaine worth $10,000,000,” the CMF statement said.
The narcotics were transported back to the ship for testing to confirm the contents and subsequently disposed of, the statement added.
The intercepted vessels were “identified as having no nationality”, it said without indicating where they had originated.
It was “one of the most successful narcotics seizures for CMF,” Royal Saudi Naval Forces Commodore Fahad Aljoiad, commander of the CMF taskforce carrying out the operation, was quoted as saying.
“The success of this focused operation highlights the importance of the multi-national collaboration,” he further stated.
The US Central Command in a post on X congratulated the CMF, which includes 47 countries’ navies and patrols more than three million square miles of sea, including some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, to disrupt the smuggling of drugs and weapons.
 






The commissioning ceremony for Pakistan Navy Ship (PNS) Yarmook was held in Romania in February 2020 and it was inducted into the Pakistan Navy fleet in December 2020.
PNS Yarmook is an electronic warfare, anti-ship and anti-air platform with cutting edge self-protection and terminal defence systems. The ship is capable of performing a variety of maritime operations and unmanned aerial vehicle operations simultaneously.
In March last year, the vessel was employed in a rescue operation after a distress call from a boat, carrying eight Iranian fishermen, that had caught fire.
In July 2024, it was also deployed in the Indian Ocean with an embarked helicopter for the safety and security of merchant ships bound to and coming from the country’s ports.</p><small>2025-10-22 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/220815415ff8871.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950541/imperial-college-london-refutes-punjab-govts-claims-of-campus-in-lahore-says-has-no-such-plans' target='_blank'><strong>Imperial College London refutes Punjab govt’s claims of campus in Lahore, says has no such plans</strong></a><br><p>Imperial College London has refuted the Punjab government’s claims that it is opening a campus at the Nawaz Sharif IT City in Lahore, saying that all of its campuses are based in the United Kingdom (UK).
On October 18, the PML-N had posted on its official X account about a meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. The post said that a campus of Imperial College London would open at the Nawaz Sharif IT City, adding that the foundation stone would be laid in November.
“A modern 300-bed hospital will also be built within the college campus,” it said.
 






In a separate post on X, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb had also made a similar statement about the meeting chaired by the chief minister.
“A campus of Imperial College London will be established in the Nawaz Sharif IT City which will also include a state-of-the-art 300-bed hospital and its foundation stone will be laid in November,” she had said. The post has since been deleted.

The official X account for the Punjab government had also reiterated the same.
 






However, the educational institute refuted these claims, terming them “incorrect”.
“Reports that Imperial College London plans to open a campus overseas are incorrect,” the college said in a post on its official website on Monday.
“There have been erroneous reports in the media and online that Imperial is opening a campus at Nawaz Sharif IT City in Lahore, Pakistan. Imperial has no such plans, with all the university’s campuses based in the UK,” it said.
It further directed those interested in the college’s global activity to its International Relations Office webpage.
Meanwhile, former chairman of the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), Javed Hassan, said that as an alumnus of Imperial College London, he was “briefly bemused by the bold claim of a campus in Nawaz Sharif IT City”.
“Turns out Imperial College is less adventurous — its campus plans remain firmly UK-bound. Verification, it seems, is still a novel concept,” he said.
 






Punjab CM Maryam had officially inaugurated the Nawaz Sharif IT City project commercially in May last year. During the ceremony, the chief minister had stated that several international tech giants were showing interest, with 10 companies already planning to establish their offices there. The IT city spans 853 acres and is designated as tax-free for 10 years.</p><small>2025-10-22 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/22110217afc20b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950550/north-korea-fires-ballistic-missiles-as-trump-prepares-for-east-asia-trip' target='_blank'><strong>North Korea fires ballistic missiles as Trump prepares for East Asia trip</strong></a><br><p>North Korea fired what appeared to be multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday, South Korea’s military said, a week before a key Asia-Pacific leaders’ meeting in South Korea.
It was the first launch of ballistic missiles since May by Pyongyang, which has defied a United Nations Security Council ban on the weapons.
It was also the first such launch since Lee Jae Myung was elected president in South Korea, with a platform of engagement with North Korea.
Lee and United States President Donald Trump are expected to meet in South Korea next week at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Trump is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.
South Korea detected several projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles fired from an area near North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, in a northeasterly direction early on Wednesday, its Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.
Trump to visit South Korea
Lee and Trump have discussed the idea of trying to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when the American president visits the South, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the idea.
US officials considered, but never confirmed, a trip to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
 
 

South Korea has suspended tours of the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom until early November, but has not confirmed any plans for a meeting with Kim.
Trump and Kim held three summits during Trump’s 2017 to 2021 first term and exchanged a number of letters that Trump called “beautiful“, before the unprecedented diplomatic effort broke down over US demands that Kim give up his nuclear weapons.
In September, Kim expressed “fond memories” of Trump saying there was no reason to avoid talks with the US if Washington stopped insisting his country give up nuclear weapons, but he would never abandon the nuclear arsenal to end sanctions.
 
 

“It is not at all inconceivable that Donald Trump could here in Washington, DC, say ‘Denuclearisation, that’s our goal, that’s our policy’ and then go up to Panmunjom and say, ‘Oh, you know, Kim Jong Un is a nuclear power’,” said Victor Cha, with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
“Even if it’s a short meeting, in the broader scheme of things, with all that the United States has to deal with these days, it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing.”
Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said while a Trump-Kim meeting was not impossible, the US president’s known schedule and timing might make it unlikely.
“Trump’s only there for one night, two days, and because of the Xi-Trump meeting, that’s probably taking up all the bandwidth or resources of the US government,” he said.
Multiple missiles launched
Nuclear-armed North Korea has steadily upgraded its missile capabilities over the past decade, defying multiple United Nations sanctions, having test-launched long-range ballistic missiles with potential ranges to strike the US mainland if fired at a trajectory calibrated for that purpose.
South Korea’s military said it had detected movements ahead of the launch, then tracked the projectiles after they were fired and flew about 350 km (217 miles), the military said.
 
 

The missiles appeared to have fallen inland, a military official separately said.
Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said there was no impact on Japan’s security from the North Korean missile launch and Tokyo was sharing real-time information with the US.
North Korea last launched ballistic missiles on May 8 when it fired multiple short-range missiles from its east coast.

From heatwaves and droughts to devastating floods that threaten lives and livelihoods each year, the economic and human toll of climate change is rapidly escalating. According to initial estimates from the brokerage house Arif Habib Ltd, the economic cost of the 2025 floods on the agriculture sector exceeds Rs302 billion.
Agricultural insurance can play a pivotal role in mitigating risks for farmers in Pakistan, enabling them to recover from losses and sustain their livelihoods. However, traditional insurance mechanisms in Pakistan have struggled to meet this need. Agricultural insurance coverage remains extremely low, with only 9.5 per cent of farmers in the country insured as of 2023.
Studies indicate multiple barriers: products are often poorly tailored to the needs of smallholder farmers, premiums remain unaffordable for many, and claim processes can be cumbersome. Religious concerns around interest-based products discourage many Muslim farmers from purchasing conventional insurance, while low awareness of Islamic (takaful) insurance products limits uptake. Together, these factors have rendered insurance products too limited and inaccessible for most rural households, underscoring the need for innovative solutions, such as parametric insurance.
 
 

Parametric insurance is a financial risk transfer tool that provides payouts based on the occurrence of a pre-defined event, rather than the assessment of actual losses. Instead of sending inspectors to measure damage, payouts are automatically triggered when certain measurable conditions are met. The automatic payouts can be linked to climate thresholds, such as rainfall falling below a critical level, extreme heat persisting for multiple days, or floodwaters exceeding a set depth.
This model differs from traditional insurance in both speed and simplicity. Because payouts are based on objective data, disbursements can occur within days, helping disaster-affected communities recover faster. The approach has already proven successful in countries such as Malawi, Indonesia, and Fiji, where farmers and low-income households have used parametric insurance to protect against storms and drought. These experiences demonstrate how parametric insurance can complement existing disaster management systems while reducing uncertainty for both the insurers and beneficiaries.
When a climate event occurs, those most financially insecure bear the brunt of the cost of the damage and repair, as they cannot wait for national or international aid to support their basic housing and nutritional needs. Each major disaster brings a cycle of emergency relief, donor dependence, and fiscal strain while people remain trapped in a vicious debt cycle.

Agricultural insurance can play a pivotal role in mitigating risks for farmers in Pakistan.

By linking payouts directly to climate indicators, parametric insurance ensures early disbursement, reduces bureaucratic delays, and enhances transparency. Households benefit from timely access to funds for recovery. The government benefits from reduced post-disaster expenditure and greater budget stability.
Parametric insurance can be easily integrated into existing social protection and financial platforms such as the Benazir Income Support Programme, microfinance products, and agriculture loan programmes. When financial institutions embed parametric insurance into their loan products, it serves as an income protection tool, enabling clients to continue obligations, avoid default, and stabilise their livelihoods.
 
 

Parametric insurance is a resilience-building tool that enables communities to prepare for and recover from disasters more effectively. Quick and transparent payouts prevent negative coping strategies such as selling assets or taking high-interest loans. By reaching underserved groups, parametric products can also advance financial inclusion, offering protection to smallholder farmers, women, and low-income households that are excluded from conventional insurance systems. On a macro level, it helps reduce fiscal pressure on the government by transferring part of the disaster risk to insurers.
Moreover, parametric instruments can attract donor and private investment, aligning Pakistan’s risk financing with global climate adaptation goals. Integrated within the country’s National Adaptation Plan and Sustainable Development Goals commitments, such tools can help the country transition from reactive disaster relief to proactive resilience planning.
However, designing effective parametric insurance schemes requires addressing several structural challenges. Accurate and reliable high-resolution climate data is essential for setting appropriate thresholds and avoiding ‘basis risk’ (when payouts do not match the actual losses) but Pakistan’s weather monitoring infrastructure remains sparse, especially in the rural regions.
Lack of awareness and trust can also impede the uptake of novel insurance instruments as many potential users are unfamiliar with the concept of insurance or may have religious objections, with many Muslims viewing conventional insurance as ‘forbidden’ due to its involvement with interest and excessive uncertainty as prohibited by religious law. Affordability poses another challenge, particularly for small-scale farmers. Finally, the regulatory framework must evolve to accommodate index-based products while ensuring consumer protection and transparency. Without institutional and regulatory readiness, scaling up parametric insurance will remain difficult despite its strong potential. A supportive policy environment is therefore critical for parametric insurance to take root.
Pilot projects that combine public, private, and donor financing can help test parametric insurance models in climate-prone areas and build local capacity for uptake. With the right data, institutional support, and community engagement, parametric insurance can become a game-changer, enabling Pakistan to move from reactive crisis management to proactive, climate-smart resilience planning.

Lahore was ranked the second most-polluted city in the world on Tuesday with its Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching 218, after Delhi, India, that topped the list with its AQI at 247, while Kolkata, India, standing third with 209 AQI.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who also heads the environment department, has stated that comprehensive measures are being taken across the province to combat smog and protect public health.
She says that wearing face masks has been declared mandatory for the traffic police officers and “Suthra Punjab” field teams.

Lahore ranked second most-polluted city in the world

Senior traffic police officers have been directed to strictly enforce the direction among their subordinates, who are constantly exposed to vehicular emissions and air pollution.
Similarly, all “Suthra Punjab” field workers have been instructed to wear masks during their duty hours to safeguard their health against the harmful effects of smog.
The government says that due to the Diwali fireworks and large-scale stubble burning in Indian Punjab, air pollution levels in Lahore and Kasur have risen to dangerous levels.
According to Punjab environment department, polluted winds moving at a speed of five kilometre per hour are blowing from Indian cities, including Amritsar, Ferozepur, Patiala, Gurdaspur, Sangrur, Bathinda, Moga, Barnala, Mansa and Faridkot into Lahore and other parts of Pakistan.
Approximately, rice crop cultivated over three million hectares is harvested in Indian Punjab during September and October, followed by widespread stubble burning.
According to the Punjab Pollution Control Board (India), 663 villages have been identified as major stubble-burning hot spots, significantly contributing to cross-border pollution.
Anti-smog operations are underway in Lahore and other major cities. The Lahore Development Authority (LDA), the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) and the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) are jointly engaged in water sprinkling on city roads to reduce dust and pollutants in the air.
The recently-introduced ‘anti-smog guns’ are also operating in the highly-polluted city areas, while construction sites are being regularly sprayed with water to check dust.
As per environment department, 24-hour monitoring is being carried out to check emissions from brick kilns, industries and vehicles. At Lahore’s entry points, vehicle inspections and monitoring have also been increased.
Punjab’s first modern ‘Smog Monitoring and Control Centre’ is now fully operational, collecting real-time data from across the province to enable immediate action, the department says.
According to the centre, wind speeds between 3 and 6km/h will gradually help reduce pollution levels.
As per the centre, on Wednesday (today) Lahore’s average AQI is expected to remain between 210 and 240. Winds from Indian cities including Dharamshala, Ludhiana, Haryana, and Sri Ganganagar are likely to affect the air quality of Gujranwala, Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Burewala, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Multan, it adds.
The Punjab government has advised people to wear masks during smog conditions, avoid unnecessary travel and limit outdoor exposure for children, elderly individuals and respiratory patients. Residents are also encouraged to increase indoor and outdoor greenery to help absorb pollutants.
Ms Aurangzeb says that Punjab government’s machinery is fully mobilised to mitigate smog and protect public health. “We are taking every possible step to safeguard our people from the harmful effects of smog,” she emphasises.

• Evades question about ban on TLP, says action against those carrying weapons is ‘non-negotiable’
KARACHI: In a strong message, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi made it clear on Tuesday that the federal government would take decisive action against any armed group operating in the country, regardless of its location or affiliation.
He also issued a firm rebuttal to the growing perception on social media, clarifying that the federal government was not targeting any specific religious sect.
The interior minister held a meeting with leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan at the Sindh Governor House.
Governor Kamran Khan  Tessori, MQM-P Chairman Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and senior leaders Dr Farooq Sattar and Aminul Haque lauded Mr Naqvi’s recent role in handling the law and order  situation and in upholding the writ of the state across the four  provinces.
Later, accompanied by the MQM-P leaders the interior minister told reporters at the Governor House that the ongoing actions were solely against armed groups, not peaceful religious communities.
“No one carrying weapons or operating in the form of armed jathas [groups] will be allowed to function under any circumstances,” he said when asked about the possibility of a ban on Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), without directly addressing the question. “Wherever an armed group is found — in any province — there will be action. That is non-negotiable.”
Mr Naqvi expressed “immense respect” for religious leaders, scholars and clerics, emphasising that the government’s actions were not aimed at any particular sect or group but only at those challenging the writ of the state.
“There was a perception being built on social media that the federal government is targeting a particular religious sect,” he said. “Such claims are completely false. We respect all our ulema, and this government has always stood by them. Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam, and our support for religious scholars and clerics remains firm. But anyone who comes armed will, under no circumstances, be allowed to operate.”
Naqvi meets religious scholars, clerics to address reservations
Before arriving at the Governor’s House, Mr Naqvi, accompanied by Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, met prominent scholars and clerics at the residence of Mufti Muneebur Rehman.
Both sides agreed to convene a comprehensive meeting in Islamabad in the coming days to address key concerns raised by religious leaders. The scholars and clerics were assured that all legitimate and genuine issues presented by them would be addressed on a priority basis. A statement issued after the meeting said that a detailed discussion took place regarding “recent developments”, and the scholars expressed their viewpoints on various issues.
Mr Naqvi reiterated that the government remained committed to non-interference in the affairs of religious seminaries (madaris) and mosques.
 






“The government will not interfere in the affairs of madaris and mosques,” the statement quoted him as saying.
To ensure continued engagement, it was also agreed that a dedicated focal person would be appointed to maintain constant communication and coordination between the government and religious leadership, the statement added.
Other participants of the meeting included Allama Syed Muzaffar Shah, Mufti Abid Mubarak, Allama Liaqat Hussain Azhari, Allama Rehan Azhar Naumani, Mufti Rafiur Rehman Noorani, Allama Ashraf Gormani and Allama Ahmed Rabbani.

The Afghan Taliban leaders continue to insist that the border between the two countries, also known as the Durand Line is “imaginary”, and question its legitimacy.
Addressing an online press conference soon after signing the ceasefire agreement with Pakistan in Doha, the Afghan Taliban defence minister emphasised that the “hypothetical” border was not discussed in any part of the accord. It may be so, but the very tenor of his statement is seen as a provocation.
True, no Afghan government since the creation of Pakistan has recognised the Durand Line as a legitimate border between the two countries, but the current Taliban administration has raised the issue far more aggressively. There has been a marked intensity in their stance on the Durand Line, particularly over the past few months as tensions with Pakistan escalated.
 
 

The conservative Islamic regime in Afghanistan, which is yet to be recognised by any country other than Russia, seems to have taken up the cause of Afghan nationalism to divert international scrutiny from its patronage of transnational militant groups operating from their soil. Mullah Yakub’s statement following the Doha meeting indicates that Kabul is still not willing to show any moderation.

The current Taliban administration has raised the Durand Line issue far more aggressively.

It gives an ironic twist to the widespread international perception that the Afghan Taliban were a proxy of Pakistan. The very fact that much of the current Afghan Taliban leadership led their resistance against American occupation from inside Pakistan had reinforced that view. What was overlooked was the fact that it was largely an alliance of expediency. Relations between the Afghan Taliban and Pakistan during that period were, however, not very smooth. Yet no one expected this level of hostility.
Even the first Afghan Taliban government of Mullah Omar, which was very dependent on Pakistan’s support, refused to recognise the Durand Line as a legitimate border, although it never made an issue of it. But some Taliban leaders at that time too were quite vocal on the matter, calling the divide an artificial line that needed to be eliminated.
Established in 1893 by the British and the Afghan king Abdur Rehman Khan, the 2,300-kilometre Durand Line, which cuts across KP and Balochistan, was supposed to demarcate the frontier between British India and Afghanistan. When Pakistan became independent, it inherited the agreement as one defining the country’s western frontier. It is recognised as a legitimate border under international law. But Afghanistan has refused to accept the divide. The Durand Line dispute was the main reason why Afghanistan delayed its recognition of Pakistan as an independent state.
 
 

Although over the years there has been de facto recognition of the Durand Line as a border by successive governments in Kabul, tensions have often resulted in border clashes and blockades. Yet the fierce fighting last week, which reportedly also involved Pakistani air force jets bombing Kabul and other Afghan cities, has not been witnessed before.
Pakistan asserts that its actions were in retaliation to the constant armed provocation from across the border and have been in accordance with international law. There has been an unprecedented rise in militant attacks in KP and Balochistan since the return of the Taliban government in Kabul more than four years ago. This year has been the bloodiest in the last one decade and has left hundreds of Pakistani security personnel dead. The reported air strikes were a message to the Taliban administration that the cost of patronising militant groups would be high.
Although the Taliban administration has agreed to a ceasefire, there’s no indication yet that it would still be willing to take action against the TTP that it considers their jihadi brethren. According to some Pakistani officials who’ve been involved in negotiations with the Kabul government, there is also the question of the regime’s capacity to take action against well-armed groups with close ties to the local Afghan Taliban commanders.
Then there is a fear of TTP fighters joining the Islamic State, which remains active in parts of Afghanistan. Most alarming are the reports of some other transnational groups reorganising in the border regions. It’s not only extremely dangerous for the security of regional states but for Afghanistan itself. In this situation, the Taliban’s provocative stance on the legitimacy of the existing border with Pakistan appears highly dangerous.
One plausible explanation for the Afghan Taliban raising the question of the legitimacy of the Durand Line is to mobilise public support particularly in the Pakhtun belt under the banner of nationalism as the country continues to face serious socioeconomic challenges. The country is still facing international sanctions because of its retrogressive policy of barring women from work and restricting their right to education.
It seems that some of the punitive actions taken by the Pakistan government, including the move to expel hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees, has worsened Islamabad’s differences with the Taliban government. It was certainly a very unwise move by Pakistan and violates human rights. Such policies have fuelled public anger.
Indeed, one can understand why Pakistan is losing patience with the cross-border terrorist attacks on its security forces. Nevertheless, Islamabad should exercise prudence. It is not in the interest of a country facing internal and external challenges to escalate the situation. It was certainly a wise decision to agree to a ceasefire and sit at the negotiating table. The conflict has affected the lives of millions of people on both sides of the border.
While the Doha meeting has produced a ceasefire, one hopes that the next round of talks, to be held in Istanbul soon, will help remove many more hurdles in the way of peace in the region. The involvement of regional countries in bringing down tensions has been most positive. It is in the interest of both countries to settle all their differences through negotiations.

The move was announced by former speaker Asad Qaiser, Chief Whip Malik Amir Dogar, Prince Nawaz Khan Allai and Shahram Tarakai at a joint press conference.
Mr Qaiser said the post has been vacant since the disqualification of Omar Ayub Khan and expressed hope the speaker would issue the notification “without delay” upon his return to the country.
“Mehmood Khan Achak­zai is a senior and respected politician. We expect that no undemocratic means will be used in this process. The opposition leader’s seat should not remain vacant,” Mr Qaiser said.

PTI hints at ‘small cabinet’ in KP as CM-Imran meeting remains pending

Mr Dogar said the nomination carried the signatures of 74 MNAs. “Meh­mood Khan Achakzai’s name carries significance for the survival and stability of democracy. The decision reflects our leadership’s consensus, and all members have endorsed it,” he said, adding that Mr Achakzai also remains PTI’s presidential nominee.
Commenting on Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, Mr Qaiser said both countries should exercise patience and reopen trade routes, including onward access to Central Asia.
He also criticised the federal government for providing “non-functional” vehicles to the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa police.
“Even a federal minister acknowledged this issue, but I do not wish to name him,” he added.
He also lamented that the province had yet to rec­eive its three per cent share of the national divisible pool under the NFC Award.
Small cabinet in KP
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the party may form a small cabinet in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa if the chief minister is not permitted to meet the PTI founder.
Speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail, he said a full cabinet would be announced after a meeting between the chief minister and Imran Khan.
Replying to a question, he said that Afghan refugees should be repatriated with dignity.

On Monday night, the trigger-happy PCB under Mohsin Naqvi finally made it official: Shaheen Shah Afridi was to replace Mohammad Rizwan as ODI captain.
The decision came on the heels of the first day of the second Test against South Africa, in which both players are taking part. Shaheen’s first assignment will be next month’s three-match ODI series against South Africa in Faisalabad; his ascension coming in as abrupt a manner as his sacking as T20 captain in the early days of Mr Naqvi’s chairmanship last year.
 
 

Shaheen had been named T20 captain by Mr Naqvi’s predecessor, but was removed after just one series to reinstate Babar Azam ahead of the 2024 T20 World Cup. It was the start of a game of musical chairs. Babar resigned after Pakistan’s dismal World Cup campaign, with Rizwan handed the reins of both the ODI and T20 teams. He led Pakistan to historic series wins in Australia and South Africa, but Pakistan had another dismal campaign at this year’s Champions Trophy and the T20 team had a new leader in Salman Ali Agha.
Shaheen will now lead the ODI side. But, in its announcement, the PCB did not mention for how long it desires to continue with Shaheen. There was also, surprisingly, no mention of Rizwan, who seems to be falling out of favour, and it is unclear if he will find a spot in the ODI squad.
Pace spearhead Shaheen, meanwhile, has rediscovered his old form, bowling with verve. Burdening him with the captaincy may not be the right move. The South Africa series will tell whether the PCB has made the right choice. One hopes that this time the PCB, having burned several bright talents by handing them the captaincy, has exercised caution.

• Notices issued to Islamabad and Punjab officials, jail administration
ISLAMABAD: To resolve controversies surrounding visitation to incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, a larger bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) will take up all 11 petitions filed by PTI leaders — including one by newly elected Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — on Thursday (tomorrow).
The IHC registrar’s office has issued notices to the advocates general of Islamabad and Punjab, the Punjab prosecutor general, the Punjab inspector general of police, and the inspector general of prisons. The court has also summoned the Women Medical Officer and Superintendent of Adiala Jail for the same date.
The bench is expected to address not only the issues surrounding visitation rights for the PTI founder but also the question of jurisdiction over Adiala Jail — a longstanding point of contention between the Islamabad and Punjab administrations.
 
 

On Monday, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir of the IHC overruled objections raised by the registrar’s office on Chief Minister Afridi’s petition seeking permission to meet Imran Khan in jail. Advocate Ali Bukhari appeared on behalf of the petitioner, while the plea was filed through Advocate General Shah Faisal.
The petition requested the court’s intervention to allow a meeting between the provincial chief executive and the PTI founder to discuss governance matters and cabinet formation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The registrar’s office had earlier objected, noting that similar petitions had already been decided and that a prescribed procedure existed for such visits. However, Advocate Bukhari argued that “fresh legal grounds” existed, since the cabinet had not yet been constituted and consultation with Mr Khan was essential for administrative functioning.
Justice Tahir, after hearing the arguments, dismissed the objections and issued notices to the interior secretary, inspector general of police, and Superintendent Adiala Jail, directing them to submit their replies by October 23.
Earlier, on March 25, a three-judge larger bench of the IHC — comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan — had reinstated the twice-a-week visitation schedule for Imran Khan, while barring visitors from issuing media statements after meetings.
The bench had ruled that only individuals approved by Mr Khan’s coordinator, Salman Akram Raja, could meet him on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and advised the PTI founder to approach the trial court for permission to speak to his children via telephone.
The IHC administration has now fixed the matter before the same bench to consolidate and hear all petitions concerning Mr Khan’s visitation rights and jail conditions.

• Lack of decision on Tomahawks makes Russia less keen on diplomacy, says Zelensky
• European leaders call on Washington to hold firm in demanding immediate ceasefire in Ukraine
WASHINGTON/KYIV: A planned summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin was put on hold on Tuesday, as Moscow’s rejection of an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine cast a cloud over attempts at negotiations.
Trump has no immediate plans to meet Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, a US official said on Tuesday, days after the American president said they would meet within two weeks in Budapest.
Trump had announced last week that he and Putin would meet soon in Hungary to try to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. But Putin has been unwilling to consider concessions. Moscow has long demanded that Ukraine agree to cede more territory before any ceasefire.
Trump, who last week spoke by pho­­ne to Putin and met Ukrainian Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky, had hoped for another high-profile session with the Russian leader after their August summit in Alaska failed to advance negotiations.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke by telephone on Monday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, after Trump said that the two top diplomats would be meeting this week to arrange a Budapest summit.
“An additional in-person meeting between the secretary and foreign minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,” a Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity. The official nonetheless termed the call between Rubio and Lavrov “productive”.
‘No clear date’
The Kremlin said there was no clear date and that “serious preparation” for a summit was needed and that may take time. “Listen, we have an understanding of the presidents, but we cannot postpone what has not been finalised,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
“Neither President Trump nor Pre­sident Putin gave exact dates.” Asked if Moscow had an understanding of a possible date for the summit, Peskov said: “No, there is no understanding.”
Putin spoke by telephone on Thursday with Trump, who met the following day with the Ukrainian president to discuss providing US-made Tomahawk missiles that could penetrate deep into Russia.
Trump hailed the call as progress and quickly posted on social media that he would meet within two weeks with Putin in Budapest.
It marked the latest abrupt shift by Trump, who in August welcomed Put­in to Alaska — his first time on Wes­tern soil since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
‘Lack of decision on Tomahawks’
The Ukrainian president, in his ni­­ghtly address, said Russia “almost au­­tomatically became less interested in diplomacy” due to the postponement of a decision by the US administration on Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine.
Zelensky said he and  had agreed that a starting point for talks would be with the two sides at their current positions on the battlefield.
“Instead, Russia is once again doing everything it can to abandon diplomacy,” Zelensky said.
“The greater the Ukrainian long-range capability, the greater the Russian willingness to end the war. These past few weeks have confirmed this once again,” Zelensky said.
The Tomahawks, he said, had become “a strong investment in diplomacy” and Ukraine would hold further discussions on long-range weapons with its European and US allies.
European leaders called on Washington on Tuesday to hold firm in demanding an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, with present battle lines to serve as the basis for any future talks.
In a statement, the leaders of Bri­tain, France, Germany and the EU said they “strongly support Presi­d­e­nt’s position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the curre­­nt line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations”.

The prime minister said the initiative, to be known as INSPIRE, was “a milestone in Pakistan’s transition to a knowledge-based digital economy” and signalled its entry into the $600 billion global semiconductor ecosystem.
Under the programme, 7,200 professionals would be trained in semiconductor design and research.
Shehbaz Sharif kicked off the “initiative to nurture semiconductor professionals for industry, research & education” (INSPIRE) to mark Pakistan’s transformative step toward technological self-reliance and global competitiveness.

PM unveils ‘INSPIRE’ to train 7,200 professionals, aiming for a share in the $600bn global market

In his address, the prime minister said the launch of INSPIRE was a milestone in the country’s transition toward a knowledge-based digital economy, where innovation, research, and human capital drive sustainable growth. “Our vision is to prepare Pakistan’s youth for the industries of tomorrow… Through this initiative, we are building the foundations of a new economic frontier — one where Pakistan contributes talent, technology, and innovation to the world,” he remarked.
Assuring stakeholders of the government’s full support for this programme, the prime minister directed the execution of work at a fast pace to achieve targets.
“The planning ministry, under its Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), had allocated Rs 4.5 billion for this programme, which is just a drop in the ocean,” he said.  “Funding is no issue for this programme.”
Cashless economy
The prime minister said the government had undertaken a plan for digitisation and established the Pakistan Digital Authority as a first step.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is being completely digitised. “The government is also working to usher in a cashless economy,” Shehbaz Sharif said.
He praised the IT ministry and the PSEB for their efforts to develop a skilled workforce aligned with global industry demands. The prime minister also acknowledged the Special Investment Facilitation Council’s (SIFC) role in enabling strong public-private collaboration and facilitating investments that underpin national technology initiatives.
In her remarks, Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja reaffirmed the government’s commitment to developing a digitally empowered Pakistan.
Dr Naveed Sherwani, chairman of the National Semiconductor Task Force, briefed the audience on the strategic roadmap and underlined Pakistan’s opportunity to build a world-class semiconductor ecosystem.
Abu Bakar of PSEB said it was a matter of pride to have executed the semiconductor programme, which will train thousands of professionals and link academia, research, and industry to develop a sustainable national semiconductor ecosystem.
Training and research
INSPIRE aims to train 7,200 professionals over five years in semiconductor design, verification, and research. It will be engaging nine public-sector universities across Pakistan’s northern, central, and southern regions and establishing six integrated circuit (IC) labs.
As the first phase of the country’s broader National Semiconductor Develop­ment Roadmap, INSPIRE will lay the foundation for Outsourced Assembly & Testing (OSAT) and fabrication capabilities, enabling Pakistan to take part in the global semiconductor supply chain.
With the launch of INSPIRE, Pakistan has entered a new chapter of digital transformation — one defined by innovation, opportunity, and resilience.
The initiative embodies a national vision to harness youth potential, strengthen international partnerships, and position Pakistan as a credible contributor to the trillion-dollar global semiconductor industry.
Restructuring Smeda
Earlier, PM Shehbaz presided over a meeting on a restructuring plan for the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority.  He directed the authorities concerned to encourage the registration of small and medium enterprises to enable them to avail of business loans and stimulate industrial growth.
He said the country’s industrial growth was linked with the development of cottage SMEs. He expressed satisfaction over the efforts made by the Ministry of Industries and Production for Smeda’s restructuring.

The increase in deficit is mainly the outcome of a decline in Pakistan’s overall exports to regional countries, except China, where Pakistan’s exports showed signs of recovery in the first three months of the current fiscal year.
A marginal increase was also recorded in exports to Sri Lanka, while shipments to Bangladesh and Afghanis­tan registered negative growth during the period under review, according to the latest data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
In FY25, Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine neighbouring countries expanded by 29.42pc to $12.297bn compared to $9.502bn recorded during the same period last year.

Gap widens to $3.93bn in July-September

The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — dipped 5.07pc to $1.011 billion in July-September FY26 from $1.065bn over the same period last year.
In FY25, Pakistan’s exports to nine countries rose 1.49pc to $4.401bn in July-June FY25 from $4.336bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 23.95pc to $4.941bn in 3MFY26 from $3.986bn over the same months of the previous fiscal year. In FY25, imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China increased by 24.92pc to $4.861bn in 3MFY26 from $3.891bn over the same period last year. In FY25, imports from China totalled $16.312bn, up by 20.79pc from $13.504bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region is sourced from China, with partial contributions from India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China slightly increased by 0.59pc to $562.39m in 3MFY26 from $559.07m over the same months in the preceding fiscal year. In FY25, Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 8.6pc to $2.476bn from $2.709bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.
Imports from India dipped by 36.41pc to $36.55m in 3MFY26 from $57.48m over the last year. In FY25, imports from India increased to $220.58m from $206.89m over the last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $1.95m in 3MFY26. Exports to India totalled $3.669m in FY24 compared to $0.329m in the same period the previous year.
Exports to Afghanistan dipped 19.83pc to $161.83m in 3MFY26 from $201.88m last year. Imports stood at $4.52m in 3MFY26 against $6.38m in FY25. Last year, Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan included sugar.
Exports to Bangladesh declined by 4.93pc to $180.15m in 3MFY26 from $189.50m over the last year.
Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 8.32pc to $102.56m in 3MFY26 from $111.86m over the last year. The imports rose by 19.68pc $17.33m in 3MFY26 from $14.48m.
No data is available as most trade with Iran is conducted via informal channels. Very little trade was recorded between Pakistan, the Maldives, and Nepal during the review period.

Indeed, verbal attacks from both sides had stopped after a couple of meetings held at the PM Office, and the PPP’s subsequent CEC meeting over the weekend, where the party decided to adopt a wait-and-see approach on whether its demands would be catered to.
The PPP, which had earlier raised reservations over Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s unwillingness to providing relief to flood victims through BISP, seems to have been convinced to some extent that the programme she has announced will be adequate enough to help those who are in need.
Although PM Shehbaz Sharif had agreed to try and prevail upon the provincial government to accede to the PPP’s demand in toto, he was assured by CM Maryam in a subsequent meeting that the comprehensive provincial package for flood rehabilitation package would be adequate for the purpose. The premier, thereafter, seemed content that if things work out as planned, there would be no need to activate BISP in Punjab for this purpose.
Talking to Dawn, senior PPP leader Syed Nayyar Hussain Bokhari, who was present in the meeting between the Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari-led delegation and PM Shehbaz, said that if the provincial government was providing a comprehensive rehabilitation package to the people, his party will have “no objections”.
However, he wondered why the Punjab government had refused to provide funds through the BISP, when it had taken a share from the loans that the federal government received from donors and international lenders.
When contacted, Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who had also attended the PM-Bilawal meeting, told Dawn that the premier had made a promise to Mr Bhutto-Zardari regarding assistance to flood victims in Punjab.
However, he added that on the very next day, another important meeting was held at PM House, which was attended by the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan.
“In that meeting, the Punjab CM assured the PM that she was going to launch a major programme for flood victims in the province and after that there will be no need to get additional funds from the BISP,” he elaborated.
“Following this, the premier was convinced that if Punjab is providing adequate funds from its own kitty, then why should the federal government, which has limited funds, spend its money for the same cause.”
Another senior PPP leader, who did not wish to be named, said his party had no objection if the BISP was not being used for flood programmes in Punjab, provided that the rehabilitation package recently launched by CM Maryam would fully compensate the flood-hit people, especially farmers.
The leader said the recent protests by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Paki­stan was one of the reasons that the party had stopped its confrontation with the PML-N as the country was passing through a critical situation in which all ruling allies needed to stand together to foil any attempt to disrupt peace in the country.

On Oct 8, the ECP ordered LG polls in December and asked Punjab to immediately start the delimitation exercise and complete the same within two months.
“Thereafter, the election programme should be announced, and the election should be held in the last week of December 2025. The office is expected to follow the timelines strictly,” the Oct 8 order said.
This order, however, was reversed in a meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Tuesday, in light of the new law, after a request by the Punjab government.

Commission asks province to finalise delimitation rules in four weeks after new law; warns of ‘appropriate decision’ in case of delay

During the meeting, the ECP secretary said that the Punjab Assembly had passed the Punjab Local Government Act 2025, which has also been approved by the governor.
“With the passage of the new act, the Punjab Local Government Act 2022 has been repealed, and the notifications issued under the 2022 Act regarding delimitations should be withdrawn,” the ECP said in a statement, while halting the delimitation exercise and dropping the plan to hold LG polls in the province this year. The ECP said no further extension will be granted, saying if the task was not completed within the given timeframe, the matter would be reviewed at a hearing and an appropriate decision would be made.
Observers believed the fresh decision could lead to an indefinite delay in the polls, given there were no “constitutional compulsions” to establish the local government systems.
Muddassir Rizvi of Fafen believed that the local governments are “clearly not a priority of the Punjab government, nor is there any constitutional compulsion” to ensure their perpetuity.
“Article 140-A only binds the government to establish local governments but it doesn’t have any provision for the perpetuity of these governments, periodicity of elections, tenure of governments, tier of decentralisation, subjects that must be decentralised, etc,” he said.
In 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the SC and subsequently completed their term on Dec 31, 2021. That means the elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022.  Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold polls  within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.
PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, criticised the ECP for failing in “discharging its constitutional responsibility by postponing the local bodies’ elections on the flimsy pretext that it requires more time to make adjustments following amendments made by the Punjab government”.

• Khawaja Asif calls for ‘hard state’ approach to curb extremism
LAHORE: Individuals providing “financial or political support” to Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) will face terrorism charges, the Punjab government warned on Tuesday, as it pressed the federal government to proscribe the group.
“Some 3,800 TLP financiers have been identified. Their funding sources have been blocked and legal action will be initiated against them under anti-terrorism laws,” Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference in Lahore on Tuesday.
She said the Punjab cabinet had forwarded a summary to the federal government seeking a ban on the TLP and expected a decision soon. “We expect the ban on TLP to be enforced within a few days,” she added.
The minister expressed regret that riots and unrest were being justified in the name of Islam and Palestine, terming it not only misleading but also a “distortion of religious sanctity”. She said false propaganda about dead bodies was carried out during TLP protests to garner public sympathy and create chaos.
Responding to rumours about the relocation of TLP founder Khadim Hussain Rizvi’s grave, the minister called it “propaganda”, but warned against using religious sites to solicit donations or fuel violence. She also clarified that no mosque was being demolished.
Ms Bokhari further claimed that 1.92 kilograms of gold were recovered from TLP head Saad Rizvi’s house, along with 898 grams of silver, 68 rare watches and other valuables. Besides, Saad Rizvi purchased properties under benami (anonymous) ownership and turned certain areas into no-go zones, the minister alleged.
She said the management of TLP-linked mosques and madressahs had been placed under the Auqaf Department. “This is not an action against any sect or group but against extremist ideology. A total of 130 TLP mosques have been taken into government control and 223 seminaries have been geo-tagged,” she added.
She asked parents to keep their children away from TLP’s activities and warned that terrorism charges could be filed against them as well.
“Any student involved in such activities will not be granted admission or any facilities within the country,” she said, stressing that those who took the law into their hands, responsible for the killing of an SHO and injuring 110 policemen and 148 civilians, would face terrorism cases. Ms Bokhari said Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas were being traced and would be arrested soon, adding that 95 bank accounts linked to Mr Rizvi had been frozen. “We do not want pressure groups to emerge in the country,” she said.
‘Due diligence under way’
Separately, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Tuesday the government was considering a ban on TLP, confirming that the interior ministry is reviewing a reference sent by the Punjab government.
“Due diligence is under way and a final decision is yet to be taken,” he told a press conference.
Questioning the motives behind recent TLP protests, Mr Chaudhry noted the group announced a march in support of Palestine, “but none of their demands related to Palestine”. He said investigators had identified around 100 bank accounts linked to the organisation.
Accusing the TLP of double standards, he said the party publicly denounced usury while earning returns on donations deposited in these accounts. “They advise people not to use the banking system, calling it anti-Sharia, yet they themselves receive interest from the same system,” he remarked. Mr Chaudhry added that the TLP had sought a blanket boycott and ban on Israeli products, but said 69 foreign-brand watches were recovered from the residence of the group’s chief and were of “the same brands they urge others to shun”.
Warning that such “negative politics” would not be tolerated, the minister said the state had decided that extremist politics and ideology would not be allowed to take root in Pakistan. “All state institutions stand behind this decision like an iron wall,” he said.
‘Hard state’ needed
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking to Geo News, said Pakistan must act as a “hard state” to curb extremism, calling groups that resort to violence “unacceptable”.
His remarks followed Punjab’s request to the Centre to ban the TLP after deadly demonstrations. However, he declined to confirm whether a formal ban was imminent, but said the state would now function strictly under the law and the Constitution.
Acknowledging decades of patronage for such groups, he added: “Everyone knows who created them and for what purpose.” Mr Asif claimed that he was unaware of any JUI-F plan to march on Islamabad, describing Maulana Fazlur Rehman as “highly respectable” and declining further comment.
However, Talal Chaudhry earlier said the government would make arrangements for any JUI-F mobilisation, stressing that Maulana Fazlur Rehman was a political and religious figure whose input the government respected.
“The government will continue efforts to bring the Maulana on board and will not allow him to be alienated,” he stressed.
The JUI-F chief, once a close ally of the PML-N and PPP, has since become a vocal critic of the coalition and rejected the post-election set-up because of alleged irregularities.
According to media reports, the JUI-F chief last week directed his party workers to prepare for a march towards Islamabad.
The announcement came during his address at the Mufti Mehmood Conference held in Dera Ismail Khan, where he delivered a strongly-worded speech expressing concern over the prevailing political situation.

Three Culiseta annulata mosquitoes, two females and one male, were sighted around 30 kilometres (20 miles) north of the capital Reykjavik, according to Matthias Alfredsson, an entomologist at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland.
“They were all collected from wine ropes... aimed at attracting moths,” the researcher said in an email, referring to a method of adding sugar to heated wine and dipping ropes or strips of fabric into the solution, which are then hung outside to entice the sweet-toothed insects.
Along with Antarctica, Iceland has long been one of the few places on earth without a mosquito population.
“It is the first record of mosquitoes occurring in the natural environment in Iceland. A single Aedes nigripes specimen (arctic mosquito species) was collected many years ago from an airplane at Keflavik airport,” Alfredsson said, adding that  “unfortunately, that specimen is lost”.

The PMD stated that the epicentre of the quake was located in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at a depth of 234 kilometers and occurred at 11:15pm local time.
It added that the quake was felt in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Chitral, Swat, Dir and Malakand.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) registered a 5.1 magnitude quake 34km west of the Ishkashim border town in Badakhshan province at a depth of 243.9km.

Two Reuters witnesses said strong tremors were felt in Afghanistan’s capital of Kabul.
The twin cities and other northern areas were similarly jolted by tremors on Friday when a magnitude of 5.6 struck at a depth of 120km at 5:15pm in the Hindu Kush mountains.</p><small>2025-10-21 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/21224602077306b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950369/pakistan-crash-out-of-womens-world-cup-after-crushing-defeat-in-rain-affected-south-africa-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan crash out of Women’s World Cup after crushing defeat in rain-affected South Africa clash</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan were already staring at defeat before the relentless rains, stop-start in manner, in Colombo sealed their fate.
Fatima Sana’s side crashed out of the ICC Women’s World Cup on Tuesday after a crushing 150-run defeat (DLS method) to South Africa in their penultimate match of the league stage at the R. Premadasa Stadium.
Pakistan needed a victory to have any chance of staying alive in the last-four race and already-qualified South Africa, but chasing a target that was revised with every downpour, they stood little chance after the Proteas amassed 312-9 in 40 overs.
 






Speaking after the match, skipper Fatima said: “I think today is the day bowlers didn’t perform well. We have to accept it. They played very well, but we needed to be calmer in those situations.
“I think after the second over, and after the rain, it was a different situation because the conditions and the ball were wet.”
The pacer added that the bowlers tried to find rhythm, but it was very difficult to bowl in those conditions.
The first shower, which had brought upon a two-hour delay, had seen a reduction of 10 overs for each side. By the time Pakistan came out for a third time to bat, their target according to the DLS method was 234 in 20 overs.
Pakistan were already up against the wall at that point, struggling at 60-4 after 14 overs. They eventually finished at 83-7.
South Africa had been put into bat and after the early loss of opener Tazmin Brits for a duck, skipper Laura Wolvaardt led from the front for the Proteas — scoring 90 and combining with Sune Luus for a 118-run second wicket partnership.
Continuing after the break from 6-1 after two overs, the Pakistan bowlers were taken to all parts as South Africa reached their highest-ever score in the World Cup.
Fatima’s side had to rush to the dugout as soon as the match began, after having won the toss and elected to field, as the heavens opened up.
Moments before the players took cover, the Pakistan skipper continued her knack of getting early breakthroughs when she got the dangerous Brits to nick an away swinger to Natalia Parvaiz at first slip.
Once play resumed, the run-fest started for the Proteas, with the hundred coming up in just 14.2 overs.
After Wolvaardt and Luus departed for 90 and 61 respectively, Marizanne Kapp and the dangerous Nadine de Klerk stepped up to take the scoring rate even higher.
De Klerk continued her fine hitting form in the World Cup — smashing 41	of just 16 deliveries laced with three sixes to take South Africa past the 300-run mark.
 






Pakistan’s reply meandered along aimlessly as the rains made the situation even more ignominious with each passing shower.
Chasing a DLS adjusted 302 at the start of their chase, Pakistan opener Muneeba Ali fell early in just the second over to a returning Ayabonga Khaka.
Omaima Sohail was the next to follow when she fell lbw to Marizanne Kapp in a similar manner to her previous outing.
Kapp also got the scalps of veteran batters Sidra Amin and Aliya Riaz to end with figures of 3-20.
The wickets continued to tumble as the Green Shirts stumbled to 60-4 after 14 overs before rain interrupted play again.
Wicket-keeper Sidra Nawaz showed some resistance —ending 22 not out as Pakistan continued to lose wickets from the other end in a familiar fashion to end the innings at 83-7.
 
 

Rains in Colombo had seen Pakistan’s last two matches end in washouts against England and New Zealand, respectively, costing the team a chance to pick up more points in their last-four push. The Green Shirts will now face co-hosts Sri Lanka in their final group encounter on Saturday in a dead-rubber.
The washed-out New Zealand fixture on Saturday saw South Africa become the second team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament. Tuesday’s victory saw the Proteas go top of the table.</p><small>2025-10-21 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2123163801e64af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950401/situation-fully-under-control-ogra-rubbishes-reports-of-fuel-shortage' target='_blank'><strong>‘Situation fully under control’: Ogra rubbishes reports of fuel shortage</strong></a><br><p>The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Tuesday rubbished reports of a fuel shortage in the country, saying the situation is “fully under control”.
Earlier, media reports claimed that oil companies warned of a nationwide fuel shortage due to new taxation requirements by the Sindh government. They added that the new regulations added to delays in clearing fuel shipments at ports and also added costs that could not be passed on to consumers.
The Oil Marketing Association of Pakistan also approached the federal energy ministry over the matter and urged the government to intervene.
“There is no situation of fuel shortage in the country. Some clearance delays were experienced earlier with imported petroleum products; however, the situation is now fully under control,” said Ogra in a statement released today.
It added that Pakistan State Oil’s diesel vessel and a petrol vessel of Wafi Energy, the majority shareholder of Shell Pakistan Ltd (SPL), were also cleared today.
“Fuel supply operations across the country remain normal, and business continues as usual,” added the statement from the Ogra spokesperson.
The government had marginally reduced the prices of high-speed diesel (HSD) and petrol for the next fortnight last week.
The ex-depot price of HSD was reduced by Rs1.39 per litre (0.5 per cent) to Rs275.41 from Rs276.81. HSD is the main fuel for the transport sector and is considered inflationary as it is widely used in heavy vehicles, trains, and agricultural machinery such as tractors, tube-wells and threshers. It also affects the prices of vegetables and other essential goods. However, transporters rarely pass on the benefit of lower prices to consumers.
The ex-depot price of petrol was decreased by Rs5.66 to Rs263.02 per litre from Rs268.68, showing a reduction of 2.11pc. Petrol is mostly consumed by private vehicles, small cars, motorcycles, and rickshaws, directly impacting the budgets of middle and lower-middle classes.
The government is currently collecting about Rs99 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although general sales tax remains at zero on all petroleum products, the government is charging Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 on petrol and high-octane products under the petroleum levy and climate support levy. This includes Rs2.50 per litre under the climate support levy.
In addition, around Rs17-18 per litre in customs duty is being collected on both petrol and HSD, regardless of whether they are locally produced or imported. Another Rs17 per litre goes to oil companies and dealers as distribution and sales margins.
Petrol and HSD are the main revenue sources, with monthly sales of around 700,000-800,000 tonnes each, compared to only about 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.
The government collected about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy in FY2025 and expects this to increase by around 27pc to Rs1.470tr during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-10-21 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629820-53-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-islamabad-kp-ajk' target='_blank'><strong>5.3-magnitude earthquake shakes Islamabad, KP, AJK</strong></a><br><p>

Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told reporters in Karachi on Tuesday that the ACC has informed the BCCI that a formal ceremony will be held in Dubai on December 10 to present India with the trophy.
Dawn.com understands that Naqvi, as ACC chief, is keen on handing over the trophy himself following the farcical scenes that followed after last month’s final between Pakistan and India.
Defending champions India edged Pakistan by five-wickets in a last-over thriller to win the Asia Cup title at the Dubai International Stadium last month.
However, the closing ceremony descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi.
There were no customary handshakes before the match between the teams after India refused. Pakistan captain Sal­m­an Agha said India had “disrespected cricket”, whe­­­r­­eas his counterpart Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup, which has been overshadowed by ill-will on both sides.
A couple days after the incident, Naqvi posted on X saying: “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.
The Press Trust of India reported today that the cricket boards of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka backed BCCI’s correspondence to Naqvi.
“A top ACC source told PTI that Naqvi has insisted that a BCCI representative collect the trophy from him at the body’s headquarters in Dubai but the Indian board has rejected that stance,” PTI said.
“The BCCI will bring this matter up in an ICC meeting next month.”
According to the ACC source: “The BCCI secretary, BCCI’s ACC representative Rajeev Shukla and representatives of other member boards including Sri Lanka Cricket and Afghanistan had written to the ACC president last week over handing the trophy to India.”
The eight-nation Asia Cup remained under spotlight due to political strains between India and Pakistan, the nuclear-armed neighbours, who were competing in an international cricket event four months after a brief but intense military conflict in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgaam attack that killed 26 local tourists in the Indian-occupied Kashmir.
The tension between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over into the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Asia Cup staged in the UAE when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts when the arch-rivals met in their group stage match in Dubai.
Suryakumar was widely criticised for politicising the Asia Cup when he mentioned Pahalgaam incident and Indian armed forces during his post-ma­tch talk and subsequent news conference.
The Pakistan camp, on their part, had avoided media interaction on the occasion of the India match. The tense situation remained the same, rather aggravated as on-field verbal skirmishes between some players took place, when the two sides met in the Super Four stage of the event.</p><small>2025-10-21 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/212148472b9fb12.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950399/former-french-president-sarkozy-starts-5-year-prison-sentence' target='_blank'><strong>Former French president Sarkozy starts 5-year prison sentence</strong></a><br><p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy began a five-year sentence on Tuesday for conspiring to raise campaign funds from Libya, arriving at La Sante prison in Paris in a stunning downfall for a man who led the country between 2007 and 2012.
The former conservative president, 70, left his home for the car journey to the prison, walking hand in hand with his wife Carla Bruni and cheered by a crowd of supporters chanting “Nicolas, Nicolas” and singing La Marseillaise national anthem.
Sarkozy, who was convicted and sentenced last month, is the first former French leader to be jailed since Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Petain after World War Two.
Sarkozy says he is innocent
Shortly after he headed for La Sante, Sarkozy published a long message on X in which he claimed to be a victim of revenge and hatred.
“I want to tell [French people], with the unshakeable strength that is mine, that it is not a former president of the republic who is being imprisoned this morning — it is an innocent man,” he said.
 






Sarkozy’s conviction capped years of legal battles over allegations that his 2007 campaign took millions in cash from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who was later overthrown and killed during the Arab Spring uprisings.
While Sarkozy was found guilty of conspiring with close aides to orchestrate the scheme, he was acquitted of personally receiving or using the funds.
He has consistently denied wrongdoing and has called the case politically motivated.
His lawyers said they had filed a request for early release, pending his appeals trial, and that they expected this request to be reviewed in about a month. They said they hoped they could get Sarkozy freed on early release by Christmas.
Sarkozy to be held in isolation unit
Sarkozy will likely be held in La Sante’s isolation unit, where inmates are housed in single cells and kept apart during outdoor activities for security reasons.
Conditions are similar to the rest of the prison: cells measure 9 to 12 square metres and, following renovations, now include private showers.
Sarkozy will have access to a television — for a monthly fee of 14 euros ($16) — and a landline telephone.
Sarkozy told Le Figaro he would take three books for his first week behind bars, including Alexandre Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo — the story of a man who is unjustly imprisoned and who plots his revenge against those who betrayed him.
The decision to jail a former president has sparked outrage among Sarkozy’s political allies and the far right.
“Nicolas Sarkozy is not a criminal,” said Sarkozy supporter Jacqueline Fraboulet, who was among the crowd cheering him on Tuesday. “We actually feel like the justice system is taking the power, and that’s not good for France.”
Sarkozy’s children and brothers also attended the gathering. Sarkozy, looking sombre, waved at his supporters before heading into his car for the journey to La Sante.
France gets tougher on white-collar crime
The sentencing reflected a shift in France’s approach to white-collar crime. In the 1990s and 2000s, many convicted politicians avoided prison altogether.
Despite his legal troubles, Sarkozy’s political influence has proved resilient as French society has shifted to the right.
President Emmanuel Macron, who had warm relations with Sarkozy and Bruni, said on Monday he had met Sarkozy ahead of his incarceration. Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin said he would visit him in prison.
That angered left-wing politicians who said Macron and Darmanin were breaching judicial independence.
The son of a Hungarian immigrant, Sarkozy became president in 2007, pledging to shake things up with pro-business reforms that would reinvigorate France’s stagnant economy and elevate the country to the top table of global players.
Those efforts were quickly upended by the 2008-2009 economic crisis, and voters gave him little credit for raising the retirement age to 62 from 60 and loosening rules requiring a maximum 35-hour work week.</p><small>2025-10-21 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/212011092bd2f22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950395/centre-asks-punjab-to-facilitate-imran-cm-afridi-meeting-for-kp-cabinet-formation' target='_blank'><strong>Centre asks Punjab to facilitate Imran–CM Afridi meeting for KP cabinet formation</strong></a><br><p>Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Huzaifa Rehman said on Tuesday that the Centre has asked the Punjab government to arrange a meeting between KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and PTI founder Imran Khan to facilitate the formation of the provincial cabinet.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about the lack of access to the party founder and how family, friends and party leaders are hindered from meeting him.
Afridi, who was elected as the provincial chief minister last week, was denied a meeting with Imran during a visit to the prison on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, he said he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran and seeking his input.
He claimed he had officially notified the Punjab government and the federal government of his plan to visit Adiala, but received no response, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reply to his subsequent request, made during a phone call, to facilitate a meeting with Imran. He approached the Islamabad High Court on Friday, seeking permission to meet Imran.
Questioned about the matter in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Rehman said: “I hope this meeting will take place in the coming days. The federal government has asked the provincial government to arrange this so the cabinet there (in KP) can be formed.”
Asked again whether the Centre had issued a direction for the meeting to the Punjab government, Rehman clarified that while an order could not be given since the provincial governments were autonomous, the prime minister had “urged” the provincial authorities and the federal government had also requested to “do this as soon as possible”.
Rehman added that as per his information, the Punjab government was devising a mechanism and fulfilling all “cordial formalities”, adding that the meeting would be “held soon”.
Speaking during Monday’s KP Assembly session, CM Afridi said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court (IHC) for ensuring his meeting with Imran, but to no avail.
He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it.</p><small>2025-10-21 15:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/211819057d4a986.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950388/talal-terms-kp-govts-inaction-against-terrorism-ploy-for-political-point-scoring' target='_blank'><strong>Talal terms KP govt’s inaction against terrorism ploy for ‘political point scoring’</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Monday criticised newly elected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, accusing the provincial government of undermining counter-terrorism efforts for political point scoring.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which tribal people also resist as they often lead to displacements.
The remarks come a day after the KP CM blamed the federal government’s “flawed policy” for the resurgence of terrorism in KP, during his first official high-level meeting since assuming office on October 15, after the former CM Ali Amin Gandapur resigned earlier this month on the directions of party chairman Imran Khan.

He alleged that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”. He also criticised the Centre for providing KP Police “defective and old” armoured vehicles and asked that the vehicles be recalled.
Addressing the media today, the state minister took exception to the KP CM’s earlier remarks and stated, “the operation you are rejecting may serve you well politically, but it will also lead to loss of lives, for which you alone will be held responsible.”
Talal expressed disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”.
“You don’t want to fight against terrorists, you are scared, you have political motives,” said Talal, alleging that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism, “so they could use it to blackmail the government.”
Citing Article 148 of the Constitution, the minister warned that “provinces can not unilaterally make any decision which affects the rest of the country”.
“The fight against terrorism is the entire country’s fight,” maintained the state minister for interior.
On the matter of the CM’s recent appointment, Talal said that it was a deliberate decision to elect someone “who would not hesitate to prioritise political point scoring and his chairman’s narrative over matters of national interests and his responsibilities as the chief minister”.
Responding to KP CM’s comments about “defective bulletproof vehicles”, the minister maintained that “it was unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”.
“If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, stressing that the KP govt was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama.”
A day earlier, the minister had called the move “immature” and a setback in the fight against terrorism, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
“What’s unfortunate is that the police officers in KP are fighting terrorists without any equipment,” he said, adding that the provincial govt was “refusing to stand with them.”
He also claimed that there was a “different agenda” at play, stating that “changing the chief minister was never about benefiting the people”.
Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan.
Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.</p><small>2025-10-21 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/211654337d0c93f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1950389/two-sc-judges-warn-new-code-of-conduct-will-restrict-judicial-freedom-create-avenues-for-control' target='_blank'><strong>Two SC judges warn new code of conduct will restrict judicial freedom, create avenues for control</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar have said that changes recently made to the Code of Conduct for superior court judges will restrict judicial freedom and create avenues for internal and external control, it emerged on Tuesday.
On October 18, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) approved far-reaching amendments to the Code of Conduct, barring superior court judges from engaging in public controversy or media interaction, particularly on political questions, and introducing new restrictions on social and diplomatic activity.
Chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the meeting was attended virtually by Justices Shah and Akhtar. Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and her Islamabad counterpart Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar attended in person.
 
 

In the latest letter penned to the SJC chair and its members, Justices Shah and Akhtar said they had submitted their unsigned written comments at the start of the meeting in a letter dated October 17.
The duo then revised those comments to incorporate the “unfortunate and constitutionally inappropriate development” of the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC) discussing the Code of Conduct when the matter “lies solely and exclusively within the jurisdiction of the SJC”.
“These proposals, if adopted, will restrict judicial freedom, transform an open and collegial institution into a closed and hierarchical one, and create avenues for control, both internal and external,” Justices Shah and Akhtar said.
Among the various tweaks, the judges strongly objected to the amendment made to the Code of Conduct’s Article V, under which judges are prohibited from speaking, writing, debating or commenting publicly on controversial matters and on political questions, even where questions of law arise.
They also took exception to the insertion of Article XIX, which provides an “institutional response” for judges facing any “influence”, under which they will report to their respective chief justice, who will then inform the CJP.
 
 

“In the current political and institutional climate — where pressures on the judiciary are widely perceived — such a mechanism can be manipulated to suppress legitimate whistleblowing by judges who resist external interference,” the judges wrote.
On the incorporation of the 2003 SJC Resolutions/Guidelines, which includes a bar on attending social, cultural, political and diplomatic functions, the judges said it “reduces the judiciary’s visibility and connection to the community”.
Another clause treats the soliciting of conference or meeting invitations from foreign or international bodies as misconduct. The judges criticised this as well, noting that judges attend such seminars to “enhance comparative learning and professional competence-activities that strengthen judicial capacity, not diminish it”.
Justices Shah and Akhtar detailed 10 “weaknesses and risks” posed by the amendments to Article V alone, which is related to judges’ freedom of speech.
“The phrases ‘public controversy’ and ‘political questions’ are undefined and could encompass nearly every matter of constitutional or legal significance,” they pointed out.
They expressed the apprehension that the “fear of being accused of ‘public controversy’ will compel judges to remain silent on matters of constitutional importance, even outside the courtroom”.
“This self-censorship undermines intellectual growth within the judiciary and weakens the development of constitutional jurisprudence.”
On the ban on “any interaction with the media”, the judges said it “amounts to a gag order, imposing total silence and insulating the institution from public scrutiny”.
On the new rule for judges to “not cause any judicial or administrative matter to be discussed publicly”, they said it shields the judiciary from external accountability and disables judges from defending the institution publicly.
 
 

Justices Shah and Akhtar also cautioned that the provision “could be selectively invoked against outspoken judges, particularly those critical of executive
overreach or internal mismanagement”, creating a “chilling effect” and opening the door to disciplinary misuse.
The judges further said: “In Pakistan’s fragile democratic environment, such a clause can be easily weaponised by executive or establishment forces through compliant leadership to silence independent voices within the judiciary.”
“During ‘testing times’ for democracy, judicial independence requires openness, moral courage-not silence or conformity.”
Postponement sought as IHC CJ seniority, 26th Amendment under challenge
Justices Shah and Akhtar also listed multiple reservations regarding the procedure of the amendments’ approval.
The judges recalled that in a letter dated October 13,  they had “proposed that the present [SJC] meeting be postponed, or the Council be re-constituted, given that the seniority and status of Honourable Justice Sarfraz Dogar in his high court are under challenge” before the SC.
“The outcome of that case will directly determine his eligibility to serve as a member of the Supreme Judicial Council.”
Justices Shah and Akhtar also highlighted that the 26th Amendment remains under challenge before the SC.
 
 

“Until that matter is decided, the status of the chairperson and one of the members is sub judice. Constitutional propriety therefore requires that no amendments to the Code be undertaken until that issue is settled,” they said.
The earlier October 13 letter stated, “While we would obviously not wish to comment on sub judice matters, it goes without saying that there is always an inherent uncertainty involved in any litigation, no matter how sanguine one may be about the outcome.”
It added that the decision in that case could directly affect Justice Dogar’s membership of the SJC, and consequently the council’s composition. The judge had also suggested it would be appropriate “if Justice Dogar recuses himself, then the council may proceed with its meetings/proceedings”.
 
 

“The decision in those proceedings can directly affect the Hon’ble Judge’s membership of, and consequently the composition of the Council.
They noted that since “three chief justices participating today (October 18) are ex officio members of both the NJPMC and the SJC, their participation in approving the amendments at the NJPMC meant that the majority of the SJC had effectively predecided the matter before it was even placed before the Council”.</p><small>2025-10-21 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629774-lg-polls-ecp-gives-punjab-govt-four-weeks-for-delimitations-under-new-act' target='_blank'><strong>LG polls: ECP gives Punjab govt four weeks for delimitations under new Act</strong></a><br><p>

India had closed its embassy in Kabul after the Taliban seized power following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces in 2021, but opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support, and humanitarian aid.
About a dozen countries, including China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkiye have embassies operating in Kabul, although Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration.
“In keeping with the decision announced during the recent visit of the Afghan FM to India, the government is restoring the status of the technical mission of India in Kabul to that of embassy of India in Afghanistan with immediate effect,” said a press release issued today by India’s Ministry of External Affairs.
It added the decision underscored India’s resolve to deepen its bilateral engagement with the Afghan side in all spheres of mutual interest.
The MEA elaborated that the embassy will “further augment India’s contribution to Afghanistan’s comprehensive development, humanitarian assistance and capacity-building initiatives, in keeping with the priorities and aspirations of Afghan society”.
Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar had announced the embassy’s reopening earlier this month as he began talks with Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on what was the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since 2021.
New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries.</p><small>2025-10-21 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629772-private-news-channel-apologises-to-maryam-nawaz-after-uk-defamation-case' target='_blank'><strong>Private news channel apologises to Maryam Nawaz after UK defamation case</strong></a><br><p>

The army chief’s affirmation came in the wake of a border conflict with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan as long-simmering tensions over cross-border terrorism boiled over into outright fighting, along with charged statements from India’s civil-military leadership.
The military’s top brass had warned India earlier this month that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.
A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief interacted with participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters.
“The COAS reiterated that while Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing added that the army chief underscored that “Indian sponsored proxies” Fitna al-Hindustan and Fitna al-Khawarij propagated “anti-people and anti-development agendas with malicious intent to perpetrate violence”.
He reaffirmed that all necessary actions were being taken to pursue them and rid Balochistan of their menace.
 






Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
“The COAS, during his interaction with the participants, remarked that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth. He also highlighted the federal and provincial governments’ development initiatives, being undertaken to uplift the socio-economic landscape of Balochistan through a people-centric approach. He emphasised upon realisation of the immense economic potential of the province for the benefit of the people of Balochistan.”
“Acknowledging the constructive role of civil society, particularly in engaging and empowering the youth, the COAS underscored their pivotal role in sustainable development, negating vested political agendas in the interest of long-term prosperity in Balochistan,” the ISPR added.
On Saturday, the army chief had cautioned India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country.
He had also urged the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence and called on the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he had asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.</p><small>2025-10-21 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629754-pml-n-announces-split-from-ajk-govt' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N announces split from AJK govt</strong></a><br><p>

A notification issued by the commission today said the assembly’s tenure was to expire on November 24 and it was the commission’s constitutional duty to organise and conduct general elections and local government elections in GB, along with making all necessary arrangements to ensure that they were conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law, while safeguarding the process from corrupt practices.
“The general public has expressed genuine concerns about appointments, upgradations, and transfers of government officers and officials across various departments during this sensitive pre-election period. These actions have given rise to apprehensions that they may be politically motivated, potentially weakening public trust in the fairness and integrity of the election process.”
“After careful consideration of these concerns, the GB Election Commission believes that such appointments, upgradations, and posting/transfers carried out during the election period risk being viewed as attempts to gain political advantage. This perception could weaken public trust in the neutrality, impartiality, and overall integrity of the electoral process,” the election commission added.
“The commission has also observed growing public concern, regarding the diversion of development funds from approved projects to politically motivated schemes, which clearly constitutes another form of pre-poll influence and has the potential to distort the level playing field among candidates,” the notification said.
It added that it became necessary for the commission to exercise its lawful powers to maintain neutrality and fairness in governance affairs in order to uphold public confidence in the electoral process, to ensure equal opportunity for all candidates, to protect the sanctity and impartiality of the forthcoming general elections, and to prevent abuse of state resources for electoral advantage.
The GB chief election commissioner (CEC) thus ordered that all forms of recruitment or appointment in any regional department, organisation or institution were banned with immediate effect except recruitments made through the Federal Public Service Commission and cases where tests/interviews were already completed by today or where recruitment was urgently needed in the public interest.
The GB CEC further ordered that no new development scheme, community-based initiative or announcement-based project should be awarded, processed or initiated in any form until the next elections were held and a new government assumed office.
Furthermore, any diversion of funds already allocated to development projects in GB was strictly prohibited, with all diverted funds to remain frozen with immediate effect.
“No transfer or posting of government officers/officials shall be made except in cases of genuine public interest, and only after obtaining prior approval/NOC (no-objection certificate) from the GB Election Commission upon submission of a formal proposal.
“No government functionary or elected representative shall announce or inaugurate any new development scheme or project during the election period.
“All development funds relating to local government institutions in GB shall stand frozen with immediate effect until the official announcement of election results. However, in exceptional cases involving extreme urgency or matters of overriding public importance, utilisation of such funds may be permitted strictly upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission,” the notification further ordered.
It directed that funds allocated to ongoing schemes should continue to be utilised strictly in accordance with the approved Planning Manual and  Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules without any alteration or modification.
The notification further stated that no creation, alteration or announcement of new administrative units, sub-divisions or similar territorial entities should be made. during the election period under any circumstances.
Listing off more directions, the commission further ordered: “No proposal for the creation of new posts shall be submitted to the GB Finance Department. Likewise, no case of re-designation, up-gradation, concurrence or conveyance of new creation shall be processed by the GB Finance Department or the Services & General Administration Department. However, genuine cases duly justified may be considered only upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission.”
“Release of additional funds for new maintenance works is prohibited except in cases of extreme emergency in the public interest, duly justified to and only after obtaining NOC/approval from the GB Election Commission.”
“No new policy, directive, rule or regulation shall be issued or implemented after the issuance of this notification until the formation of the next provincial government.”
The notification said it would come into force with immediate effect and would remain operative until the conclusion of the forthcoming GB general elections and local government elections.</p><small>2025-10-21 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629744-coas-says-action-underway-against-indian-proxies-terrorists-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir says action underway against Indian proxies, terrorists in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

The TLP, which began a protest march in Lahore earlier this month, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. The march and sit-in, which reached Muridke, quickly turned into violent clashes between protesters and police before the protesters were dispersed, leading to a crackdown on the party and its supporters.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore today, the Punjab information minister said “false stories” were being perpetuated about the operation in Muridke.
“Three civilians were martyred in Muridke. These were people who were passing by or standing off to the side,” she said, adding that 48 civilians and 110 police officers were also injured. Eighteen out of 110 have sustained firearm injuries, she said.
The minister also said that police vans had been stolen and eight were set on fire. Referring to “exclusive” footage of the clashes that was aired at the press conference, she said, “They brought trolleys full of bricks … and the sad thing is, they did all of this in the name of religion, Palestine, and Gaza.”
She also displayed footage of valuable items recovered from the residence of the party’s leader, saying, “1.920 kilograms of gold; 898g of silver; 69 branded watches, 28 gold bracelets … in the name of charity, they bring it back home,” she said.
She urged children “who love their faith” not to be taken in by groups that use it for political or financial gain, and requested parents to not send their children to be involved in such activities.
“Don’t be used in the political agendas of others,” she said. “Stories on social media are scripted.”
“We are not moving or transferring anyone’s grave or shrine,” she said, adding, “But to use that grave to collect charity, to gather people and provoke violence — the Punjab government won’t allow that.”
Bokhari said that all the accounts of those who financed terrorist groups were frozen and that those who financed them, or supported them on social media, would be prosecuted and charged with terrorism.
“No mosque is being demolished; what Muslim can even think of that?” she said, adding that the mosques and seminaries would be turned over to “righteous religious groups”.
The provincial information minister stressed that the government was “not against any sect”, but rather against “that mindset that makes people resort to violence”.
She further said that the government had now taken over 330 mosques that were under the TLP.
“We are not against any group, but this is for the country,” she said. “The loudspeakers will be used only for azaan and the mosques only for prayers.”
She also said that 223 seminaries of the TLP had been geotagged and details of them obtained, adding that they would soon be reopened and that most had already reopened.
“Six madressahs were built on government property, that had no records,” the minister pointed out, “and no one had the right to question it, because then a fatwa-i-qatal would have been announced.”
She said that those who had taken the law into their own hands and were responsible for the injuries and deaths of civilians and police would be prosecuted under anti-terror laws.
“Both the brothers are being traced; they have not been shot or arrested,” she said, referring to Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas. “They have fled, and we will arrest them soon.”
Bokhari also said that the decision to ban the TLP is expected in the next few days.
The minister added that the time was “now or never” for Pakistan to decide if it wanted to be a democratic and progressive Islamic country.
“The government has decided, now it is on the people.”
Authorities in Punjab claimed yesterday to have traced the whereabouts of Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the crackdown in Muridke.</p><small>2025-10-21 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629726-sc-judges-warn-new-sjc-code-of-conduct-threatens-judicial-independence' target='_blank'><strong>SC judges warn new SJC code of conduct threatens 'judicial independence'</strong></a><br><p>
