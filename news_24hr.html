Israel and Hamas agreed on Thursday to the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire aimed at ending a conflict that has killed tens of thousands, razed the Palestinian territory and unleashed a major humanitarian crisis.
The deal, to be signed Thursday, includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel.

Key developments

US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line
Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners
Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday


Palestinian group Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, US President Donald Trump said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal.
Qatar said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”.
Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP Thursday.
The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said.
The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added.
 
 

The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement
“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.
“This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.”
Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”
 






He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”.
“The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview.
“This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”.
 






In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.”
“Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”.
 






Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”.
In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt.
“I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza.
 






Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory.
Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier.
An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday.
 






‘Optimism prevails’
As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air.
“We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza.
Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce.
 
 

In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday.
Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible.
The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning.
Protests, prisoners
Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return.
One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for.
High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media.
Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”.
Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state
The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration.
Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen.
There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007.
 
 

Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries.
It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza.
Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.

Under the deal, Hamas will release 20 living captives, while Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners detained since the start of its war on Gaza, according to AFP. It also entails a daily minimum of 400 trucks of aid for the besieged enclave for the first five days, to be increased in the following days.
The two sides had also reached a ceasefire in January, but it was shattered after Israel resumed massive attacks on Gaza on March 18, killing over 400 in a day. Diplomatic efforts through the United Nations had also failed to secure peace, with the US repeatedly using its veto power to block resolutions calling for a humanitarian ceasefire.
Here are some of the main reactions from around the world:
United Nations
“I welcome the announcement of an agreement to secure a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, based on the proposal put forward by President Donald J. Trump. I commend the diplomatic efforts of the United States, Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye in brokering this desperately needed breakthrough,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement posted on X.
“I urge all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement. All hostages must be released in a dignified manner. A permanent ceasefire must be secured. The fighting must stop once and for all. Immediate and unimpeded entry of humanitarian supplies and essential commercial materials into Gaza must be ensured. The suffering must end.
“The United Nations will support the full implementation of the agreement and will scale up the delivery of sustained and principled humanitarian relief, and we will advance recovery and reconstruction efforts in Gaza,“ the UN chief added.
He urged all stakeholders to “seize this momentous opportunity to establish a credible political path forward towards ending the occupation, recognising the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, and achieving a two-state solution that enables Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security”.
 






Britain
“I welcome the news that a deal has been reached on the first stage of President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza,” United Kingdom Prime Minister Starmer said in a statement.
“This is a moment of profound relief that will be felt all around the world, but particularly for the hostages, their families, and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have all endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years.
“This agreement must now be implemented in full, without delay, and accompanied by the immediate lifting of all restrictions on life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza.
“We call on all parties to meet the commitments they have made, to end the war, and to build the foundations for a just and lasting end to the conflict and a sustainable path to a long-term peace.
 






Canada
“Canada welcomes the agreement of Israel and Hamas to implement the first phase of the peace plan put forward by President Trump, and facilitated by Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye,” Global Affairs Canada, which manages the country’s diplomatic and consular relations, said.
“After two long years, hostages will finally be reunited with their families - and that Israeli troops will withdraw to behind agreed upon lines. Immediate and unimpeded humanitarian aid must be provided to the many people in dire need across Gaza.
“Canada will support all efforts to turn this positive step into lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians.”
 






India
India’s PM Narendra Modi, in a statement on X, welcomed the agreement “on the first phase of President Trump’s peace plan”.
Modi also praised his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, saying: “This is also a reflection of the strong leadership of PM Netanyahu.”
“We hope the release of hostages and enhanced humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza will bring respite to them and pave the way for lasting peace.”
 






European Union
The European Union’s Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas said the peace plan deal was a “significant breakthrough”.
“This is a major diplomatic accomplishment and a real chance to end a devastating war and release all the hostages,” Kallas said, adding: “The EU will do what it can to support its implementation”.
 






Turkiye
The foreign ministry of Turkiye, one of the mediators, expressed the hope that the ceasefire “will bring an end to the genocide that has continued for the past two years”.
“We expect the ceasefire agreement to be fully implemented,” it added.
The ministry stressed the need for humanitarian aid to be delivered to Gaza, where a “humanitarian catastrophe has been unfolding, and that efforts for the reconstruction of Gaza be launched without delay”. “Turkiye will continue to provide substantial humanitarian aid to Gaza in the period ahead,” it stated.
Turkiye also called for a just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian question and the “realisation of a two-state solution in the coming period”.
 






Italy
“The peace is near,” Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said in a post on X.
“Italy, which has always supported the US plan, is ready to do its part to consolidate the ceasefire, deliver new humanitarian aid, and participate in the reconstruction of Gaza. We are also ready to send troops if an international peacekeeping force is created to reunify Palestine.”
 


Australia
“Australia welcomes President Trump’s announcement that Israel and Hamas have signed off the first phase of the plan to bring peace to Gaza,” PM Anthony Albanese said in a joint statement with his FM Penny Wong.
“After more than two years of conflict, hostages held and a devastating loss of civilian life, this is a much-needed step towards peace. Australia has consistently been part of international calls for a ceasefire, return of the hostages, and the unimpeded flow of aid to Gaza. We urge all parties to respect the terms of the plan.”
PM Albanese voiced Australia’s strong support for the plan’s commitment to denying Hamas any role in the future governance of Gaza.
“There is a very long road to recovery in Gaza, securing long-term peace and building the Palestinian state. Together with our partners, Australia will continue to do what we can to contribute to a just and enduring two-state solution.”
 






New Zealand
“Hamas needs to release all of the hostages and Israel must withdraw their troops to the agreed-upon line,” New Zealand FM Winston Peters said in a statement.
“This is an essential first step towards achieving lasting peace. We urge Israel and Hamas to continue working towards a complete resolution.”
 






Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia also welcomed the Gaza ceasefire plan, saying it hoped for “just and comprehensive peace” in the region.
“The Kingdom stresses the need to adhere to the agreement and stop the Israeli aggression against Gaza; the complete withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from the Strip and all other Palestinian and Arab territories, and the return of the displaced persons to their homes,” the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
“The Kingdom also stresses the importance of building on this agreement to address the root causes of the conflict by enabling the Palestinian people to claim their rights, foremost among them is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.
“The Kingdom hopes that this agreement will permanently end this brutal Israeli war, which has claimed the lives of more than 45,000 people and injured more than 100,000.”
Ireland
Ireland, which has also strongly criticised Israel’s military response, said the deal, “if grasped by all, can finally end the unconscionable human suffering”.
“It can stop the dreadful bombing, silence the guns, end the famine and genocide, and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza,” deputy prime minister Simon Harris said.
 






China
Foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Beijing hoped for a “permanent and comprehensive” ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible
“China advocates adhering to the principle that ‘Palestinians should govern Palestine’,“ Jiakun said.

Sea turtles along Pakistan’s coast face many anthropogenic threats, including habitat degradation, plastic pollution, and entanglement in fishing gears such as deep-sea trawlers. Pakistan’s shrimp exports to the US have been banned since 2017 because fishermen were not using the TED in their nets, endangering turtles.
A TED is a specialised mechanism fitted into shrimp trawl nets that allows sea turtles and other large marine animals to escape while retaining shrimp, the statement said.
“Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has announced the launch of a PKR 90 million initiative aimed at protecting sea turtles during shrimp trawling operations, as part of broader efforts to sustain marine biodiversity and ensure the long-term health of ocean resources,” a statement from the ministry said.
It added that the project aimed to distribute and install TEDs at zero cost to fishermen.
“Shrimp trawling often results in the capture of large quantities of non-target marine species. When sea turtles become trapped in nets, they are unable to surface for air and can drown,” the statement quoted the maritime minister as saying.
The project will also feature “capacity-building workshops, hands-on training for trawler crews, and data collection to monitor the devices’ impact on shrimp catch efficiency and net performance,” the statement read.
The minister stressed that TEDs “would significantly reduce the accidental capture of endangered sea turtles, mitigate concerns from fishermen over shrimp loss and net damage, and pave the way for Pakistan to regain US certification —  essential for resuming shrimp exports to the American market.”
 
 

“The project aligns with Pakistan’s international commitments on marine sustainability and biodiversity conservation, ensuring compliance with global seafood traceability and sustainability standards,” Chaudhry was quoted as saying.
This initiative will showcase Pakistan’s commitment to responsible marine resource management, enhancing its reputation in the global seafood trade, Chaudhry added.
Pakistan currently sells shrimp at a comparatively low rate of about $2 per kilogram, the minister said, noting that with TED compliance and improved international certification, the price could rise to $6 per kilogram, unlocking new opportunities in lucrative markets including the US, EU, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
He urged the Karachi Fisheries Harbour Authority, Sindh Fisheries Department, and Marine Fisheries Department to ensure immediate and full TED compliance, both at sea and at dockside, the statement read.
Cautioning about risks associated with non-compliance, the minister said, “One hundred per cent TED compliance and credible enforcement will be ensured.
Meanwhile, on the economic front, Pakistan’s current shrimp exports are around $100m per year, Chaudhry said, stressing that investing in TED compliance could “potentially triple export volumes and open access to premium markets such as the European Union and Canada.”
“The project is being supported by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), Pakistan Fisheries Exporters Association (PAKFEA), Sindh Trawler Owners Fisheries Association (STOFA), Karachi Fish Harbour Authority (KFHA), Sindh Marine Fisheries Department (SFD), and Fishermen’s Cooperative Society (FCS),” the statement read.
According to a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) study from 2012, around 30,000 sea turtles were annually caught in the tuna gillnet fisheries of the country.
Entanglement in fishing nets is the most serious threat to marine turtles. It was estimated that about three per cent of entangled turtles were dying due to drowning or mishandling onboard fishing vessels.</p><small>2025-10-09 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09140300789e7f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947659/pro-palestinian-protest-threat-racks-up-tension-for-italys-world-cup-qualifier-with-israel' target='_blank'><strong>Pro-Palestinian protest threat racks up tension for Italy’s World Cup qualifier with Israel</strong></a><br><p>Italy are struggling to qualify automatically for next year’s World Cup finals and the pressure on the team is exacerbated by the tension surrounding next Tuesday’s qualifier with Israel in Udine.
Italy was the scene of some of Europe’s biggest pro-Palestinian protests last weekend, as Israeli forces continue their offensive in Gaza.
Hundreds of thousands of people gathered across Italy in anger at Israel’s actions, and calls for the country to be barred from international sport have grown louder.
The protests were in response to Israel’s military operation in Gaza, which was sparked by the attack by Hamas fighters on October 7, 2023, on Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip.
During Friday’s massive strike action in support of the Palestinians, demonstrators went to the Italian national team’s training centre in Florence to demand the match against Israel be called off.
As of Tuesday only around 4,000 tickets had been sold for the game in Udine, a small city in Italy’s far north-east, which was picked specifically to help limit the potential for disorder.
Udine was the venue when Italy — who face Estonia in Tallinn on Saturday — last hosted Israel, in the Nations League in September 2024. That match passed off largely without incident, albeit surrounded by a massive security operation which included soldiers on the roof of the stadium.
But the threat of much bigger and more disruptive protests led Udine’s mayor Alberto Felice De Toni to ask for the match to be postponed.
‘Very sad’
This week Italy’s coach Gennaro Gattuso said the situation in Gaza was “very sad” and lamented a difficult atmosphere for a match which will be key to Italy’s hopes of avoiding missing out on a third straight World Cup.
 
 

“There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside it… I would have preferred to play a home match in front of an enthusiastic crowd like we did in Bergamo (where Italy beat Estonia 5-0) a month ago,” Gattuso said.
His task was already complicated enough without the external political pressure of playing Israel, as direct qualification for the World Cup is seriously in doubt.
Only the winner of the five-team group is guaranteed an automatic spot and Italy sit second, level on nine points with Israel and six behind leaders Norway, but with a game in hand on both.
However Norway’s far superior goal difference — they have a 16-goal advantage over Italy — means Gattuso’s side can only top the group if they win all four of their remaining matches and Erling Haaland and company slip up before they travel to the San Siro next month.
That leaves second place and a spot in the play-offs as the likely route to the World Cup, a tournament in which Italy haven’t played a knockout fixture since winning it in 2006.
Italy exited at the qualification play-off stage for the last two World Cups, failing to reach the 2022 edition in Qatar despite being reigning European champions.</p><small>2025-10-09 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/03/1112180874fe9c9.jpg?r=121828' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1897220/really-suffocating-pakistan-emerges-from-record-smog-season' target='_blank'><strong>‘Really suffocating’: Pakistan emerges from record smog season</strong></a><br><p>The article was first published in March 2025 and has been replugged for DawnMedia’s upcoming air pollution conference in Lahore.

Tens of millions of Pakistanis spent at least four months breathing toxic air pollution 20 times above safe levels, in the worst winter smog season for several years, according to data analysed by AFP.
Pakistan regularly ranks among the world’s most polluted countries, with Lahore often the most polluted megacity between November and February.
AFP’s analysis of data recorded since 2018 by independent air monitoring project AQICN shows the 2024-2025 winter smog season started a month earlier in October and persisted at higher levels, including in cities normally less affected by pollution.
Lahore’s 14 million residents spent six months breathing concentrations of PM2.5 — tiny particles that can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream — at levels 20 times or more than recommended by the World Health Organisation.

Those in Karachi, Pakistan’s biggest city, and the capital Islamabad were subjected to 120 days of the same choking pollution levels.
“The smog is just getting worse every year,” admitted a factory owner in Lahore, who wished to remain anonymous after openly criticising government policies.
“If I was rich, my first decision would be to leave Pakistan for Dubai, to protect my children and raise them in a smog-free environment,” he told AFP.
Legal action
Experts say the pollution is primarily caused by factory and traffic emissions. It worsens in winter as farmers burn crop stubble and cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds trap the deadly pollutants.
This year, winter rains that typically bring relief did not arrive until late February, as climate change renders Pakistan’s weather patterns increasingly unpredictable.
The smog was so thick it could be seen from space and prompted authorities to close schools serving millions of students across the largest province Punjab, including its capital Lahore.
 
 

Young climate activist Risha Rashid said Islamabad is fast becoming “another Lahore” and has launched legal action against the government.
“It’s really suffocating,” the 21-year-old, who has asthma, told AFP.
“I cannot go out, even if I have exams. It’s not just affecting our physical health but our mental health as well.”
An Ipsos poll in November found four out of five Pakistanis said they were affected by the smog.
It can cause sore throats, stinging eyes and respiratory illnesses, while prolonged exposure can trigger strokes, heart disease and lung cancer.
Its effects are worse for children, who breathe more rapidly and have weaker immune systems.
‘At war’
This smog season, Punjab’s provincial government declared a “war on smog”, increasing public air quality monitoring devices tenfold to around 30 and offering farmers subsidised rentals of machinery to clear crop stubble and avoid burning.
It also pledged to increasingly enforce emissions regulations on tens of thousands of factories and more than 8,000 brick kilns, a major source of black carbon emissions.
But environmentalists and experts say action has been piecemeal and sometimes counterproductive, including restrictions on private air quality monitoring devices that the government claims give “misleading results that spread panic.” And anti-smog machines, including a tower in Lahore shut down two months after installation, are effectively useless, experts say.
“It is like putting an air conditioner out in the open,” said one who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Pledges for clean air
Efforts that tackle pollution’s effects, rather than its source, miss the point, said Ahmad Ali Gul at Lahore’s University of Management and Technology.
“It’s like when you have a bathtub and it’s overflowing and it’s creating a huge mess, do you first grab a towel or you first close the tap?” he said.
“First, we need to focus on reducing the emissions and then we talk about how to protect ourselves from smog.”
The government has blamed rival India, which borders Punjab province, for pollution blowing over into Lahore.
But Pakistan has limited vehicle emissions standards, and officials admit 83pc of Lahore’s carbon emissions are from transport.

“Switching to a cleaner fuel would give immediate results, we’ve seen it in other countries,” said Frank Hammes, the global CEO of the Switzerland-based AQI air quality project.
But that “needs a pretty strong central effort to push down sometimes the painful changes that need to be made in order to reduce air pollution,” he added.
Pakistan’s government wants electric vehicles (EVs) to account for a third of new sales by 2030.
Cheaper Chinese models launched in Pakistan in 2024 but currently make up just a fraction of overall car sales in a country where 40 per cent of the 240 million population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank.
 
 

Pakistan had a taste of clean air during the pandemic when a lockdown forced vehicles off the streets and factories to close in March 2020, but it was short-lived, as the economic impact was too great for many to bear.
“Air quality improved so much that we could even see the stars in Lahore in the evening,” said Omar Masud, a director of Urban Unit, which analyses pollution data for the government.
While climate change can make air pollution worse, few Pakistanis worry about global warming, explained Abdul Sattar Babar, Ipsos director for Pakistan.
“Most Pakistanis are overwhelmed by the economic challenges that they are facing,” he said.
“When you can barely survive, climate issues are obviously not your primary concern”.

Here’s how</strong></a><br><p>As the winter of 2025 approaches, the genie of smog is preparing to escape its bottle in South Asia, especially in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. This phenomenon occurs every year during the late autumn and winter months when temperature inversions cap the lower atmosphere across the Indus and Ganges plains.
With shallow mixing heights and weak winds, emissions accumulate under the skies in the region, causing severe health hazards for vulnerable populations. The principal health burden from particulate matter is often accompanied by ground-level ozone.
According to the Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR6), these pollutants are key contributors to cardiopulmonary diseases, exposing elderly people and children in particular to higher health risks.
In Pakistan, alarm bells are ringing in policy and governance circles, which have increasingly failed to provide any clear-cut vision to control the persistent issue of smog that affects major cities across the country including Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Multan, and their surrounding towns.
It’s been done before, it can be done again
Last year, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Lahore exceeded 700. In November 2024, it even reached over 1,500, making Lahore one of the most polluted cities in the world. The question now is: how do we control it with the available resources. Let’s look at two major examples, China and England, where comprehensive policies were enforced in the 1950s to control smog and emissions.
In December 1952, a stagnant weather pattern in London trapped coal smoke in the atmosphere for several days. Sunlight was blotted out, visibility plummeted, and thousands lost their lives to respiratory and cardiovascular complications. Recognising the gravity of the crisis, the British government enacted the Clean Air Act of 1956 — a landmark move that demonstrated how timely regulation can effectively curb the menace of smog.
 
 

Years later, several Chinese megacities faced similar episodes of acute smog. The government responded with stricter fuel and industrial standards, and within a few years, citizens previously exposed to dangerously high levels of PM2.5 began to experience marked improvements in air quality.
These two examples offer valuable lessons for Pakistan in formulating its own strategy to curb emissions. The country shares similar atmospheric conditions and potential policy tools, even if the sources of pollution differ.
However, while regulatory frameworks exist, Pakistan continues to grapple with severe policy implementation challenges. Effective execution demands strong governance mechanisms, a trained and committed bureaucracy, public support, and transparent enforcement — all of which remain lacking. As a result, the threats of smog and air pollution continue to loom large.
Engines of Pakistan’s smog crisis
In Pakistan, the transport sector remains the leading contributor to the smog crisis. Although national fuel standards have improved over the years, much of the existing fleet is outdated and poorly regulated.
Pre Euro and Euro-II diesel trucks and buses dominate long-haul corridors while the inspection and maintenance of all other types of vehicles are inconsistent. The use of substandard lubricants and widespread reliance on backup diesel generators further exacerbate emissions. In urban areas, two- and three-wheelers, along with small engines, release significant amounts of black carbon and nitrogen oxides which are key drivers of the winter haze and precursors of secondary particulate matter.
Furthermore, brick kilns encircling many cities in the Punjab often burn low-grade coal and in some cases, waste fuels, which significantly contribute to emissions due to continuous intensive burning and high impurities such as sulphur, moisture, and heavy metals. To reduce the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fuel requirements, a low hanging fruit is to convert fixed chimney kilns into zig zag designs.
Industrial clusters, including cement, steel re-rolling, textiles, foundries, and glass manufacturing, are major emitters of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Despite existing emission limits, continuous monitoring and third-party audits are rarely carried out.
 
 

Filtration systems and low nitrogen oxide (Nox) technologies, where installed, are often poorly maintained or inconsistently operated. During periods of temperature inversion, emissions from these clusters can push entire regions into hazardous air quality levels. Strengthening monitoring systems and ensuring transparent reporting have, therefore, emerged as key priorities in recent policy documents and reviews of air quality governance.
The agricultural sector also poses one of the biggest threats to Pakistan’s air quality. The open burning of crop residues leads to predictable pollution spikes during October and November each year. In Punjab, these fires often coincide with similar burning across the border in India’s Punjab.
Under the influence of northeasterly winds and stable, cool air, the resulting smoke blankets Lahore and much of the central plains. Satellite based analysis and sector studies highlight that residue burning worsens winter smog episodes and underscores the need for in situ management and ex situ markets for straw.
The road to cleaner air
The health consequences stemming from smog aren’t just limited to breathing issues. Fine particles penetrate deep into lungs and bloodstreams, elevating the risk of heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, lung cancer, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and various metabolic disease.
The elderly population, outdoor workers, children, and people with pre-existing cardiopulmonary conditions are especially subjected to higher risks during short durations of smog. In coastal cities such as Karachi, high humidity and heat can exacerbate health risks.
 
 

Air pollution and climate change intersect in the same chimneys and tailpipes. Several short-lived climate forcers such as black carbon, methane, and ozone precursors degrade air quality and contribute to rising atmospheric temperatures.
In such alarming circumstances, Pakistan needs to make significant changes in its transport as well as industrial, and agricultural sectors to make them environment-friendly and sustainable so as to align with sustainable development goal 13 (SDG-13), which accounts for climate action. IPCC AR6 finds that targeting these pollutants can yield rapid health improvements and climate benefits when combined with sustained carbon dioxide reductions.
In the case of transport, emphasis needs to be placed on vehicle (cars and 2/3 wheelers) inspection and maintenance, compliance to registration and toll access, and retirement of heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) that release harmful emissions. Simultaneously, fuel quality at oil refineries must be enhanced to meet emission limits as per Euro 5 and Euro 6 fuel standards. Prioritising clean buses for high-demand routes is the need of hour to maximise public health benefits.
As far as the industrial sector is concerned, Pakistan must complete transition to cleaner brick kiln designs as suggested above. Continuous and real-time emissions monitoring must be made mandatory for large industrial stacks so they can measure their emissions and take necessary action when required.
To further reinforce these actions, there is a need to establish standardised third-party audits and release compliance reports to enable regulators, communities, and investors to monitor progress of industrial zones.
 
 

Pakistan must ban crop waste burning with strict monitoring and transparent reporting. Instead, there is a need to replace open burning of crop residues with viable alternatives by scaling in situ residue management and building ex situ markets for industrial boilers, compressed biogas, and pellets. Coordinate across borders and prioritise ending waste burning because smoke does not respect administrative lines.
London showed the world how quickly air can be improved when public policy bows to science. China proved that large-scale transformation is possible when standards, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms are aligned.
Pakistan, too, can breathe easier by curbing transport emissions, modernising kilns and industries, prohibiting the open burning of crop waste, and guiding public behaviour. The science is clear; what remains clouded is resolve. Once we begin to implement the proposed changes with consistency, our grey horizons could once again turn blue.

Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
DI Khan Regional Police Officer (RPO) Ashfaq Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that a police checkpoint in DI Khan’s Khutti area was attacked by terrorists from multiple sides.
When asked to confirm if the checkpoint in charge — identified as Ahmed Nawaz — was seriously injured during the attack and later succumbed to his injuries, Anwar said, “Yes.”
Funeral prayers for the deceased were offered today at the Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
In attendance at the funeral were: RPO Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmad, SPs of CTD, investigation, city, and headquarters, officers of security forces, police officials, and the family members of the martyr, according to APP.
The attack comes on the same day a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in DI Khan, the military’s media wing said.
Last week, a soldier was martyred and another was injured when unknown assailants opened fire on them near Bannu.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies.
According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.

The six-day trip by Amir Khan Muttaqi highlights the Taliban’s efforts to spur engagement with regional powers to secure eventual diplomatic recognition.
He is set to meet Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and other officials to discuss a range of political, economic and trade matters.
“We look forward to engaging discussions with him on bilateral relations and regional issues,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X welcoming the minister.
 






Muttaqi is also expected to speak with Indian business representatives, visit the ancient monument to love, the Taj Mahal, and a historic Islamic seminary, media said.
He arrives in New Delhi after talks in Moscow with diplomats from Afghanistan’s neighbours, who appeared to unite against US President Donald Trump’s stated aim of taking over the Bagram military base near Kabul, the capital.
Russia is the only country to have yet recognised the Taliban administration, whose members are under UN sanctions including a travel ban and asset freeze, including Muttaqi, who got a temporary exemption to visit India.
Historically, India and Afghanistan have had friendly ties but New Delhi does not recognise the Taliban and shut its embassy in Kabul after the US withdrawal from the war-shattered country in 2021.
New Delhi opened a small mission a year later to ease the way for trade, medical support and humanitarian aid, while its senior officials have held two-way talks with Taliban leaders.</p><small>2025-10-09 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09112103676a392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947644/pakistan-army-officer-martyred-7-terrorists-killed-in-di-khan-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army officer martyred, 7 terrorists killed in DI Khan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
The development comes a day after the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred in an exchange of fire between the forces and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district.
According to the ISPR’s statement issued today, security forces carried out the IBO on Wednesday on the reported presence of “khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij” in the Daraban area of DI Khan.
Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP.
During the operation, the ISPR said, seven “Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell” due to effective engagement by security forces’ troops.
However, during the intense exchange of fire, 30-year-old Major Sibtain Haider, a resident of the Quetta district, embraced martyrdom. “A brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat.”
The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were found in the custody of the slain terrorists, who had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [the] killing of innocent civilians”.
A sanitisation operation was being carried out to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area”, the ISPR statement said.
It added that the “security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave sons further strengthen our resolve”.
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces’ successful operation in Daraban, DI Khan and paid rich tribute to Major Sibtain Haider for his “valour and sacrifice, saying the nation’s resolve to end terrorism remains unshakable”, a statement posted on the presidency’s X account said.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to martyred Major Sibtain Haider, according to a statement posted by his ministry on X.
 






State-run APP reported that KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also lauded security forces for the successful operation and paid them rich tribute for their “courage and professionalism in eliminating terrorists who pose a threat to peace and stability in the region”.
Expressing grief over the martyrdom of Major Sibtain Haider, he extended condolences to his family and prayed for the “elevation of his ranks in Jannah”.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Subsequently, amid rising terror attacks, the government labelled the group as Fitna al Khwarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers.
Islamabad has also raised concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks.
Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism.  In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khwarij and Fitna al Hindustan.
Last month, after 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the  “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-10-09 07:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/091133139e65318.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947647/commonwealth-says-time-taken-for-election-reports-varies-following-concerns-over-delay' target='_blank'><strong>Commonwealth says time taken for election reports ‘varies’ following concerns over delay</strong></a><br><p>Foreign observation mission Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has clarified that the time taken to write and release its reports “varies considerably” with each group and that the report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections was finalised by the end of that year.
The COG report, released to the public on September 30, had been the subject of some controversy after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had buried the report after finding the polls to be riddled with problems. According to the letter of transmittal appended to the report, it was submitted by the COG to the Commonwealth secretary general on Nov 20, 2024.
“The length of time taken to write COG reports, and similarly, the finalisation and release of the publication, varies considerably with each COG. Other factors affecting the release dates include legal challenges and disputes. In this case, a comprehensive report of over 160 pages was finalised by the end of 2024,” the Commonwealth said in a statement on Tuesday.
It added that its secretariat first shared the report earlier this year with Pakistani government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), encouraging a “domestic mechanism which convenes all electoral stakeholders to address the recommendations in the COG report”.
 
 

“Subsequently, the secretariat sought information on the status of action taken. This process was necessary for any further steps with regard to the internal process for releasing the report,” the statement added.
“It was then decided that the Pakistan COG report, along with two other outstanding reports of elections in 2024, would be released at the end of September. This timeline was made available to the media, when contacted, and the report was duly published on September 30 along with other reports,” the Commonwealth said.
On the same day the COG released its Pakistan report, it also made public the reports for Mozambique and Botswana — almost 11 months after both of them were held in October 2024.
“The Commonwealth Secretariat is guided by, and is deeply committed to, the values of the Commonwealth Charter, which are shared by all our member countries,” the statement stressed.
The body cited the 2018 Revised Commonwealth Guidelines for the Conduct of Election Observation in Member Countries, as per which the reports are “shared with the member government, Election Management Bodies (EMBs) and with other stakeholders” first and “thereafter, the report is made public”.
 
 

“We strongly encourage all stakeholders to use the report constructively, in service of the people of Pakistan. As we have stated in earlier statements, we remain ready to support any mechanism aimed at strengthening democracy in Pakistan, for the benefit of all its citizens,” the Commonwealth said.
“We will continue to partner with stakeholders to ensure that COG reports are released in a timely manner,” it added, affirming its commitment to transparency while adhering to the sequence of release as outlined in the 2018 Revised Guidelines.
The statement comes after 130 activists, lawyers and journalists wrote a letter to the Commonwealth Secretariat on October 2, expressing concern over the “extraordinary” delay in the report’s publication and noting that election reports were usually published routinely without any delay.
In its report, the COG had noted the denial of an election symbol to the PTI, the consecutive convictions of the party’s founder Imran Khan and limitations on the freedom of assembly, adding that such conditions “consistently limited one party’s ability to contest the election on a level playing field”.
 
 

It also mentioned the Forms-45 controversy, saying it reviewed documentation suggesting that Form-45s may have been altered to change the total number of votes received by candidates.
Commenting on the Commonwealth’s latest statement, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “The Commonwealth Guidelines clearly state that election reports must be issued in a ‘timely manner, initially to key national stakeholders and then made public’ and specifically identify all ‘political parties taking part in the elections’ as key stakeholders.
“This was not done,” he said.
 






At the time of the 2024 elections, a team of inter­national observers from the Commonwealth had expressed their satisfaction at the poll­ing exercise and pla­yed down suspension of mobile cellular services in the country.
COG Chairperson Dr Goodluck Jonathan, who was chairing the observer mission, shared the group’s preliminary findings days later and noted the impact of legal decisions on some candidates’ ability to run for office in the days leading up to election day.
“We call on all those with grievances to address disputes through prescribed election dispute resolution mechanisms,“ he said.</p><small>2025-10-09 07:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627720-security-beefed-up-in-rawalpindi-amid-tlps-islamabad-march-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Security beefed up in Rawalpindi amid TLP's Islamabad march plan</strong></a><br><p>

Qatar, which helped broker the deal along with Egypt, the United States and Turkiye, said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”.
“ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social network.
 






Here is what is known so far about the agreement, which is set to be signed on Thursday in Egypt:
What does it include?
Hamas will release 20 living captives at the same time as part of the first phase of the deal, a Palestinian source close to the negotiations said.
A top official within Hamas told AFP Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners: 250 among those serving life sentences and 1,700 others detained since the start of the war.
The exchange should take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the deal, which was also “agreed with Palestinian factions”, another source within Hamas said.
A daily minimum of 400 trucks of aid will enter the Gaza Strip for the first five days of the ceasefire, to be increased in following days, according to the same source.
 
 

It also provides for the “return of displaced persons from the south of the Gaza Strip to Gaza (City) and the north immediately,” they added.
The deal stipulates “scheduled withdrawals” of Israeli troops, the Hamas top official said, and includes “guarantees from President Trump and the mediators”.
Hamas called in an official statement on Trump to compel Israel to fully implement the agreement and “not allow it to evade or procrastinate in implementing what has been agreed”.
What’s next?
Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said both sides have already agreed “on all the provisions and implementation mechanisms of the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement”.
 
 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he will convene his government on Thursday to approve the agreement.
The deal will be formally signed on Thursday around midday in Egypt, a source with knowledge of the agreement told AFP on condition of anonymity.
A Hamas official said negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire would begin “immediately”.
Trump said on Wednesday he believed all the captives, including the deceased will be “coming back” on Monday.
Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza had called for a ceasefire, the release of all the hostages held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory.

“Judge of the Qazi court had been abducted by armed men after setting the court building on fire two days back,” Deputy Inspector General of Police for Rakhshan region, Abdul Hayee Amir Baloch, told Dawn. The judge was “safe and sound”, Mr Baloch added.
It was not immediately clear whether the judge had been freed by the kidnappers or recovered by authorities.
Police said a group of armed men had stormed into the Qazi Court building in the Maskan Kalat area, some 30km from Kharan city, while the judge was hearing cases. They held him and the court staff hostage, ransacked records and damaged office furniture and other items on the premises before setting them on fire. While fleeing, they had taken the judge with them at gunpoint.

An IMF mission led by Iva Petrova met with Pakistan’s economic team in Karachi and Islamabad from September 24 to October 8 to review the implementation of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). The programme’s performance as of the end of June this year — the period under review — has been mixed.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had urged the lender to take into account the recent flood damage in its review for the country.
In a statement released early on Thursday, the Fund quoted Petrova as saying, “The IMF mission and the Pakistani authorities made significant progress toward reaching a staff-level agreement on the second review under the 37-month extended arrangement under the EFF and on the first review of 28-month arrangement under the RSF”.
“Programme implementation remains strong, and broadly aligned with the authorities’ commitments,” she added.
“Significant progress was made in the discussions in several areas, including sustaining fiscal consolidation to strengthen the public finances while providing needed flood recovery support; ensuring inflation remains durably within the State Bank of Pakistan’s target range by maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy; restoring the viability of the energy sector by implementing regular tariff adjustments and cost-reducing reforms; and advancing structural reforms to reduce the footprint of the state, strengthen governance and  transparency, foster a more competitive business environment, and liberalize commodity markets,” she said.
“Productive discussions were also held on the authorities’ reform agenda to strengthen climate resilience, including the completion of reform measures under the RSF,” Petrova said.
She said that the IMF team and the authorities would continue policy discussions “with a view to settling any outstanding issues”.
She concluded by saying, “The IMF team wants to express its sympathy to those affected by the recent floods, and is grateful to the Pakistani authorities, private sector, and development partners for many fruitful discussions and their hospitality throughout this mission.”
Pakis­tan and the IMF reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July last year, giving much-needed respite to the nation. The programme aimed to enable Pakistan to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
In May this year, the IMF board approved a fresh $1 billion loan to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities and natural disasters. However, the disbursement of funds is contingent upon successful completion of reviews under the EFF, an IMF official said.
Tax hikes not on table for now
Sources told Dawn on Wednesday that another round of discussions may take place on the margins of the World Bank-IMF annual meetings in Washington in the coming days to resolve the last-mile issues.
Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb is scheduled to depart for the United States later this week with a delegation that includes the finance secretary, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman.
Officials said Islamabad would have to provide verified estimates of flood-related losses and ensure that provinces would absorb these costs from their own resources without compromising cash surplus commitments to the Centre. For the current fiscal year, Punjab is required to provide a cash surplus of Rs740bn, followed by Rs370bn by Sindh, Rs220bn by Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, and Rs185bn by Balochistan.
Sources said that, against this backdrop, the IMF mission did not hold a formal wrap-up meeting with the finance minister before leaving, although both sides met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, given his recent engagements with the IMF managing director to discuss flexibility in light of the flood damage.
A select team of the IMF mission had reportedly called on the minister on Monday, the sources said.
Official sources, however, claimed that the talks were “smooth” so far, and there was no immediate need for additional tax measures to bridge the shortfall, although the tax target might have to be revised depending on the first-quarter GDP data, due in the last week of December.
At that time, the question of fresh measures or changes in rates would become due with effect from Jan 1, 2026, to cover lapses in the first half of the fiscal year in view of the biannual nature of the review.</p><small>2025-10-09 05:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627697-gandapur-out-afridi-in-how-will-next-kp-chief-minister-be-elected' target='_blank'><strong>Gandapur out, Afridi in: How will next KP chief minister be elected?</strong></a><br><p>

For five days last week, I was part of a small group of Pakistani journalists invited by the European Union (EU) to visit Brussels and interact with their officials who deal with all manner of issues, from Pakistan to Russia to the Middle East and the US and the big tech platforms. Over the years, I have been a part of many such delegations hosted by many different countries but there was something different this time.
This was the first time in any such visit that nobody had any major complaint against Pakistan. People asked about Pakistan’s relations with China, and though there was a competitive aspect to the questioning, it wasn’t hostile. This is a sharp break from all my previous such engagements.
Over the years, it had been quite normal on such trips for one major complaint against Pakistan to dominate the agenda. For example, over a decade ago, on a similar trip to Australia, everybody we met asked about the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Reko Diq deal. In other trips, it was perceived support for terrorist groups based out of Pakistan that were the bone of contention. In at least two such trips, there was active shouting, mostly by officials from the other side.
It is easy to see that something important has changed and Pakistan’s stock in the eyes of the European capitals has risen. Given the renewed bonhomie between Pakistan’s leadership and the Trump administration, as well as the good relations Pakistan is enjoying with China and the important partnerships shaping up with Saudi Arabia and Turkiye, the sharp turnaround in Pakistan’s fortunes on the global stage is palpable. The engagements in the EU only served to underscore this reality.
Everybody laid the emphasis on GSP-Plus as the central plank of the EU’s relationship with Pakistan. The grant of this preferential trade status, through which Pakistan ran a trade surplus of almost $6 billion from the EU last year, is up for renewal and a team will be visiting in November to take stock of the progress the government has made in meeting the rights-related benchmarks set out for it. These include, but are not limited to, treatment of religious minorities, continuation of the moratorium on the death penalty along with reform of the procedure for clemency, enforced disappearances, labour rights and more.

Something important has changed and Pakistan’s stock in the eyes of the European capitals has risen.

There are a lot of specifics to discuss, but the overall sense was positive. The message from the EU side was to not take the GSP-Plus status for granted, but the sense was also there that Pakistan has been making visible progress in meeting the benchmarks for renewal so far. Room for complacency is limited, but so is room for alarm.
Pakistan’s relations with China are being seen with some concern in Brussels, but nothing that would imply a zero-sum view of the situation. What was obvious from the engagements is that the EU’s interests in Pakistan are limited by comparison to China’s. For Brussels, the agenda is dominated by Russia and the war in Ukraine, which, they underscored repeatedly, they view as a ‘war of imperialist aggression’ and they would brook no talk of it as anything other than an act of naked aggression.
Next up, their agenda is full: trying to deal with a capricious Trump administration. The challenge from America is twofold. First is the melting away of the security-related commitments under which Europe has grown up after World War II. Increasingly, they are being told to arrange for their own security, either by footing the bill for Nato, by raising their own defence expenditures, or by raising their own forces altogether.
Second, and not any less important, is the end of the era of free trade that America had long championed, along with Europe. In one frank exchange, an official agreed that the tariff wars are not some temporary aberration. Rather, they herald the rise of a new protectionism that will define the world economy from here onwards.
For Europe, this is a serious problem. They are adjusting, we were told, by diversifying their exports and engaging with regional trade blocs like Mercosur in South America or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in the Asia-Pacific (among others). According to their calculations, these arrangements can help compensate for almost 75 per cent of the loss they will suffer from being cut out of the American market, and the remaining 25pc they intend to make up from increased trade initiatives within the EU itself.
Both of these are a long shot. Fiscally, the states that make up the EU are burdened with expenditures they cannot sustain, so carrying greater defence expenditures will be a tough choice. And in trade they are getting beaten by China and dumped by the US.
At the same time, they are acutely aware of the growing danger from right-wing neo-populist parties from within, which poses a threat to the multilateral cosmopolitanism that the EU embodies. This makes the populism engulfing America, which is driving that country to retreat from its trade and security commitments, more familiar to Europeans than to their peers in Asia, because their own societies are wracked by the same phenomenon.
Our own prodding on the genocide in Gaza was usually met with a stock answer that for the EU to agree on a course of action, a large number of countries have to come to an agreement around it. They were aware that this places a question mark over the EU’s professed commitment to values as the cornerstone of its foreign policy, and in one case, they tried to point to the resolution passed by the European Parliament in September calling for a ceasefire and a resumption of humanitarian aid to Gaza. But beyond that, there was silence.

At least three police constables were reportedly injured in clashes with enraged TLP supporters, who attacked law enforcers with stones and iron rods. Police responded with tear-gas shelling, turning Multan Road into a battleground.
Videos shared on social media, which could not be immediately verified by Dawn, showed TLP activists running as police fired tear gas. Other clips showed TLP activists holding up spent bullet casings and tear gas shells.
The crackdown on TLP’s central office came after the group annou­nced plans for a massive anti-Israel demonstration outside the US emb­as­sy in the federal capital on Friday.
In anticipation of the protest, the Islamabad administration has also begun placing shipping containers at Faizabad Interchange — the historic site of several TLP sit-ins.
A statement issued by TLP in the early hours of Thursday claimed a number of their workers had been arrested, condemning raids on their supporters’ homes.
Police sources said that the group had called a large number of supporters to Lahore, who had taken up position in temporary shelters. These elements attacked police parties as they moved in to raid the TLP main office.
Armed with stones, clubs and iron rods, the enraged TLP men managed to push police back. Clashes were on­­going at the time of going to press.

Ahmad led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them.
In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan.
“In accordance with the instructions of the honorable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said.
 






The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post.
Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi.
According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home.
“He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Mushtaq was scheduled to reach Pakistan today.
On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia.
“Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said.
“Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over.
“I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention.
“During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said.
He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down.
“We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted.
He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.

Neither Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson nor Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker have been accused of criminal wrongdoing, though both have emerged as prominent opponents of Trump’s immigration crackdown and deployment of National Guard troops in Democratic-leaning cities.
Trump’s call to imprison the two elected officials comes as another high-profile political rival, former FBI director James Comey, appeared in court to face criminal charges that have been widely criticised as flimsy.
Donald Trump has frequently called for jailing his opponents since he first entered politics in 2015, but Comey is the first to face prosecution. On his social media platform, the president accused Johnson and Pritzker of failing to protect immigration officers who have been operating in Chicago.
“The Chicago mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump wrote, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel.
‘ICE free zone’
Johnson signed an executive order on Monday creating an “ICE Free Zone” that prohibits federal immigration agents from using city property in their operations.
Hundreds of Texas National Guard soldiers have gathered at an army facility outside Chicago, over the objections of Pritzker, Johnson and other Democratic leaders in the state. Trump has threatened to deploy troops to more cities, which he said last week could serve as “training grounds” for the armed forces.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found most Americans oppose the deployment of troops without an external threat.
Trump has ordered National Guard troops to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, following his earlier deployments to Los Angeles and Washington. In each case, he has defied staunch opposition from Democratic mayors and governors, who say Trump’s claims of lawlessness and violence do not reflect reality.
“My goal is very simple. STOP CRIME IN AMERICA!” he wrote on his social media platform.
Violent crime has been falling in many US cities since a Covid-era spike, and National Guard troops have so far been largely used to protect federal facilities, not fight street crime.
Protests over Trump’s immigration policies in Chicago and Portland had been largely peaceful and limited in size, far from the conditions described by Trump administration officials.
“What we have going on right now is literally domestic terrorism in Chicago,” Todd Blanche, the No. 2 Justice Department official, said on Fox News.
Pritzker has accused Trump of trying to foment violence to justify further militarisation, and his state has sued to stop the deployment. A federal judge on Monday permitted the deployment to proceed for the time being. Another federal judge has blocked the deployment to Portland. Trump has threatened to invoke an anti-insurrection law to sidestep any court orders blocking him, which was last invoked during the Los Angeles riots of 1992.

The company has approached the Engineering Development Board (EDB) for clarification on the documentation, procedures, and compliance required to initiate imports.
While continuing to focus on local completely knocked down (CKD) operations, which support employment, localisation, and value addition, IMC is prepared to explore used car imports under the new policy framework.
IMC Chief Executive Ali Asghar Jamali told Dawn on Wednesday, “We will import everything. All sorts of models as soon as possible.” On whether used car imports would cost less than local assembly, he said, “Let’s see. We will know when we start doing it.”
IMC highlighted its readiness to support used car imports through its network of 58 dealerships across the country, staffed by trained technicians and engineers.

IMC approaches EDB for procedural clarity

The company stated that this infrastructure can ensure both after-sales service and vehicle reliability.
Through its existing platform, Toyota Sure, IMC already facilitates the trade-in and sale of certified used Toyota vehicles. The programme enables customers to exchange vehicles and provides a one-stop solution for all their automotive needs.
IMC has requested the EDB’s guidance on regulatory adherence, seeking a detailed procedural roadmap to ensure compliance.
The move follows the Ministry of Commerce’s issuance of SRO 1895(I)/2025 on June 30, allowing commercial imports of used vehicles under HS Codes 8702, 8703, 8704, and 8711.
In the used car space, Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) already operates a certified used car programme offering vehicles with up to one-year warranty, without involving middlemen or commissions.
It also hosts regular Used Car Gala events featuring over 125 Suzuki vehicles at the Expo Centre.
Honda Atlas Cars Ltd (HACL), however, does not operate a certified used car platform. Officials from Chinese and Korean assemblers declined to comment clearly on their plans regarding the new import policy. One Korean assembler said, “We do not encourage or support used car imports.”
Despite the potential move into used car imports, IMC reported strong performance in its core operations. The company sold 33,757 units in FY25, marking a 56 per cent increase from the previous year. Net sales rose to Rs215.14 billion from Rs152.48bn, while net profit after tax grew to Rs23bn from Rs15.07bn.
HACL also saw growth during the three months ended June 2025, with sales rising to Rs26bn from Rs16bn in the same period of 2024. Profit increased to Rs828m from Rs202m.
Local assemblers have also been importing limited quantities of brand-new vehicles for several years to gauge consumer response before initiating local production.

Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will hold talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subra­hmanyam Jaisha­nkar and other officials on political, economic and trade issues, the Afghan foreign ministry added.
The visit comes just a day after Muttaqi attended a regional meeting in Moscow where Afgha­nistan’s neighbours including Pakistan, Iran, China and several Central Asian countries issued a joint statement opposing the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in the region. The statement was regarded as a signal of opposition to US President Donald Trump’s stated objective to retake control of the Bagram military base near Kabul.
So far, Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration.
Historically, India and Afghanistan had friendly relations but New Delhi shut its embassy in Kabul after the 2021 US withdrawal from the war-shattered country and the return to power of the Taliban.
India opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support and humanitarian aid.
New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries.
Muttaqi’s trip was made possible after the UN Security Council Com­mittee temporarily lifted a travel ban on him to allow diplomatic engagements abroad, India’s foreign ministry said last week.
Discussions during Muttaqi’s trip will centre on bilateral cooperation, trade exchanges, exports of dry fruit, facilities in the health sector, consular services and various ports, the Afghan Taliban foreign ministry said last week.
Bar on social media
On the other hand, access to several social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, have been “intentionally restricted” in Afghanistan, internet watchdog NetBlocks said on Wednesday.
Social media sites have been intermittently accessible on smartphones since Tuesday, AFP journalists reported, a week after a 48-hour nationwide internet and phone blackout was imposed by Taliban authorities.
“The restrictions are now confirmed on multiple providers, the pattern shows an intentional restri­ction,” said NetBlocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance.
The disruption is “primarily impacting mobile with some fix-lines also affected”.

• PPP calls meeting of top decision-making forum on Karsaz blast anniversary
• Political observers say tiff is ‘anything but scripted’
FOR several days, political stakeholders and observers — both inside and outside parliament — have been asking the same question: is the current animosity between ruling allies PPP and PML-N a genuine tiff or a scripted dispute?
While speculation has been rife over what actually sparked the bad blood between both parties, the events of Wednesday night clearly indicated that the disagreement had caused enough ‘trouble in paradise’ for the ruling party to dispatch its ‘A-Team’ in an attempt to win over President Asif Ali Zardari.
Sources in the capital told Dawn that a delegation was heading to Nawabshah by special plane. Later, a statement from the Presidency said that Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq called on the president on Wednesday night.
 
 

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — who was earlier summoned to Karachi by the president to help — was also present in the meeting.
The development came swiftly on the heels of an announcement by the PPP that it would convene its Central Executive Committee — the party’s top decision-making forum — on Oct 18 to discuss the political situation in the country.
That the meeting was being called on the anniversary of the Karsaz bombing that targeted the late Benazir Bhutto’s homecoming parade in 2007 was being seen as quite significant, leading many to believe that the party may arrive to some momentous decision at the gathering.
While there were no details given by either side about the emergent meeting with President Zardari, many observers believed that the decision to send a team to mend fences with the PPP leader must have been endorsed by Nawaz Sharif after his younger brother prevailed upon him to help bring down political temperatures.
Origins of dispute
Before the PML-N dispatched its top men to Nawabshah, ostensibly to negotiate a rapprochement, background discussions with PML-N and PPP leaders indicated that the tiff was quite serious, and “anything but scripted”.
The PML-N camp was of the view that the crisis was precipitated when the PPP crossed the line by targeting Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
“Maryam Nawaz is PML-N’s redline,” a party insider said, quite categorically.
However, being a prudent political party, the PML-N is always ready to go the extra mile to settle a political score, and this is what exactly happening at the moment, the PML-N leader says.
The PPP, meanwhile, blames their ally of being so “touchy” that even a “prudent suggestion” like using the Benazir Income Support Programme to provide immediate relief to the flood victims was taken as an attack.
“So much so that CM Maryam entered the fight herself … and deliberately chose to tease the PPP by reviving the thorny issue of six canals to water Cholis­tan,” a party leader said.
An escalation of ‘hostilities’ in recent days, in the words of another PPP leader, indicated the party’s belief that it was necessary to match the PML-N harsh tone.
However, party sources maintain that PPP Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zar­da­­ri has deliberately kept his distance from the unfolding situation, choosing to remain silent on the matter — though he is closely monitoring developments.
Way forward?
Amid these tensions, the PPP is said to be receiving several proposals – from all quarters — about potentially reviewing it’s support for the PML-N in the Centre. Even in Punjab too, a proposal was floated that the PPP, with around a dozen seats in the Punjab Assembly, should sit on the opposition benches.
But as things stand, there seems to be little chance of the two allies disbanding their relationship, as those who have brokered this alliance will not allow it, insiders opined.
Although PPP lawmakers would love nothing better than to sit on the opposition benches, rather than being beholden to the whims and wishes of CM Maryam, they are seemingly content to flip the script and paint the acrimony as a cover for a ‘niece-uncle jealousy’.
In the words of Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) chief Ahmad Bilal Mehboob, both parties have been bitter rivals in the past, and may yet be rivals again when the next election rolls around.
“This time, the pitch of criticism is higher and even Bilawal and Maryam have gotten involved,” he noted.
When asked to comment on what may have triggered the bad blood, Mr Mehboob said that CM Maryam’s hyper-dynamism regarding the floods may have provoked a sense of competition, and to some extent, jealousy among leaders from Sindh.
“This competition between the two largest provincial governments is healthy and should be welcomed. However, the language used on both sides sometime crosses the line, and may leave lasting scars on interprovincial relations, he said, predicted that some kind of ceasefire would be on the cards with the intervention of Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif.
However, in his view, by projecting the PPP as a genuine opposition force, the party may be trying to diminish the relevance of Imran Khan’s PTI as the main opposition.
This view is echoed by political commentator, Dr Rasul Bakhsh Raees, who sees it as an attempt to crowding out the PTI from political discourse.
The PPP thinks that it is good time for it to present itself as an opposition to the PML-N — allowing it to achieve two objectives — maintaining its political dominance while also trying to capture some of the PTI’s constituency in Punjab, he opined.

Afghanistan, however, will take to the pitch here at the Jinnah Stadium on Thursday without having held a single training session in the host country.
In terms of rest and preparation, it is advantage Pakistan but it remains to be seen how Nolberto Solano’s men make it count against a side that only landed at the Islamabad airport on Wednesday evening as they search for their first victory in qualifying for the 2027 continental showpiece on Saudi Arabia.
Afghanistan are also winless and pointless after their opening two Group ‘E’ matches and head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese will hope his players can rebound after a long wait to set foot in Pakistan due to a visa issue that till Tuesday had raised the spectre of the match being cancelled.
Till Tuesday night, the Afghan team was waiting for clearance in Dubai after the Afghanistan Football Federation had bungled the visa application process, stating that the players and officials would appear for their biometric verification at the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul.
With most Afghanistan players based abroad, the AFF was unable to ensure their presence at the Pakistan Embassy and eventually it went back and forth with Pakistan Football Federation on how its diaspora players could enter Pakistan for the game.
A breakthrough was eventually reached when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi intervened and ensured that the Afghanistan delegation will be granted visa on arrival.
 






“We are thankful to the Government of Pakistan for their support and coordination in facilitating the arrival of the Afghanistan team,” PFF president Mohsen Gilani was quoted as saying in a PFF press release.
“I would also like to acknowledge and extend my sincere appreciation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Pakistan Sports Board and the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) for their full cooperation.”
Over 10 members of the Afghanistan team, along with Italian head coach Annese, landed on Wednesday evening while another batch was due to arrive at midnight. Three players, who got their visas in Kabul, are making a road trip from Peshawar.
Those circumstances give Pakistan an edge with Solano having held a short training camp for his side ahead of the fixture, although the team could only call upon a handful of diaspora players due to the funding issue that has impacted the recently-elected PFF.
It is Solano’s first game in-charge of the senior team since he took over as head coach in August and the Peruvian was hopeful his side could get a good result against the Afghans.
“The players have been working really hard in training and we should hope for the best,” he told a news conference earlier on Wednesday. “We are well prepared and we expect a good match.”
Thursday’s fixture is the first of a double-header between the two sides with Afghanistan hosting Pakistan in the return game in Kuwait on Tuesday.
Syria and Myanmar, the two teams with maximum points in the group, will also meet each other twice in the next six days. Only the group winner will advance to the Asian Cup finals.

The prolonged closure had severely impacted the lives and livelihoods of residents on both sides of the border, particularly those living in the remote areas of Mashkel.
The reopening follows persistent efforts and demands by local leadership, including MPA Mir Zabid Ali Reki of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, and other community leaders.
A resolution urging the federal authorities to reopen the border was also passed in the Balochistan Assembly.
The inauguration ceremony was led by Inspector General of Frontier Corps (South) Balochistan, Maj Gen Bilal Sarfraz, who formally reopened the Katager Zero Point gate to public movement and trade. He was joined by MPA Reki and a large gathering of local officials, religious scholars, and residents.
The JUI-F leader said the reopening was a moment of immense relief for the people of Mashkel.
“Residents will now be able to travel to and conduct business with neighbouring Iran without difficulty,” he said.
He also highlighted the critical importance of the Guzzar border point, which remained closed, saying it played a vital role in the economic sustenance of thousands of families in Mashkel and surrounding areas.
“The continued closure of the Guzzar border has caused significant hardship,” he said.
Later, the IGFC assured the public that efforts were underway to reopen the Guzzar border this month.

Mr Gandapur, who has been in Islamabad for the past several days, is thou­ght to have been trying to meet the PTI founder.
Sources said that soon after the party’s announcement that he would be replaced, the strongman from Dera Ismail Khan tried to secure a meeting with the party founder to make a last-ditch attempt to save his seat. However, things did not pan out that way, and he had to bow out.
 
 

“I held the KP chief ministership in trust for Imran Khan, and am returning it to him after tendering my resignation,” he posted on social media on Wednesday.
PTI insiders told Dawn that Mr Gandapur has decided to go down without a fight that may create further problems for the embattled party. “He will make a smooth transition,” an insider told Dawn.
Speculation about a possible change at CM House had been rife. Although there was no official word, sources close to Sohail Afridi — the new CM-in-waiting — had left it be known that he had been tapped for the top spot.
 
 

Mr Afridi is said to be Bushra Bibi’s pick to run the province.
Those privy to matters confided that while Imran Khan’s spouse and sister rarely see eye to eye, they had a rare convergence of opinion on Mr Gandapur, with both agreeing to the need for his ouster.
Sources in the PTI said the party chief Imran Khan had made up his mind about Ali Amin’s removal after the November 26 march on the federal capital, when Mr Gandapur mysteriously disappeared from Islamabad, leaving confused workers behind.
He subsequently met Imran Khan several times in his prison cell and bought time by assuring him that he would be the one to fulfil his (Imran’s) agenda.
They said that the decision to remove Mr Gandapur was entirely Mr Khan’s decision and he had not consulted anyone in the party on the subject.
Sources said that the resignation of Mr Gandapur would certainly bring down the number of differences and groupings within the party.
President of the KP chapter of PTI Junaid Akbar, MNA Atif Khan and MNA and former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser, who are through to be in the opposing camp, congratulated the chief minister-designate Afridi and assured him of their full support.
Talking to Dawn, MNA Atif Khan said that they would fully support the new chief minister in the larger interest of the province and its people, and would help him in the implementation of Imran Khan’s vision.
Mr Afridi was appointed provincial minister for the higher education department a week ago (on October 1). Before this appointment, he was serving as special assistant to the chief minister on the works and communication department.
If installed, Mr Afridi would be the first chief minister from the former tribal regions. He has a Master’s in Economics from the University of Peshawar. During his student life, he remained a die-hard activist of the Insaf Students Federation and later became its chairman.
He has also served as the PTI’s youth wing provincial president. He won the election from PK-70 tribal district Khyber in the previous general elections held on February 8, 2024.

Ali Amin Gandapur

• MPA Sohail Afridi picked to replace Gandapur as chief minister
• Outgoing CM claims he steered KP to financial stability, countered militancy with courage
• Raja says decision based on ‘poor security situation in KP’; Gohar rules out presence of ‘forward bloc’ in the party
• PTI mulling registration of ‘two party names’ with ECP to circumvent any adverse moves
ISLAMABAD: Ali Amin Gandapur stepped down as the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Wednesday after incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan ordered him to resign, apparently due to the deteriorating law and order in the province.
PTI MPA from Khyber Sohail Afridi will replace Mr Gandapur as the chief executive of the restive province, confirmed party leader Salman Akram Raja in a media interaction.
The removal of the KP CM comes amid a growing rift within the KP’s ruling party, which has pitted Mr Gandapur against Imran’s sister Aleema Khan — as both sides recently having gone public with their reservations against each other.
In the resignation letter released to the media on Wednesday evening, Mr Gandapur said it was his ‘honour’ to resign in compliance with the orders of his leader, Imran Khan.
“When I took over as [the] chief minister, the province was faced with a dual challenge of financial ruin and menace of terrorism. Over the last one and a half years…we steered the province to financial stability and countered the threat of militancy with resolute courage and unwavering decision-making. We initiated mega projects of nation-building in a province that was militarily categorised as a war zone.”
 

Sohail Afridi

“I thank all my cabinet colleagues, members of the assembly — both from PTI as well as opposition — and all KP bureaucrats who helped me face extraordinary challenges of governance in KP. I may not be able to claim with certainty that I did well on all these challenges, but one thing that I can say with utmost certainty is that I served the people of KP with absolute sincerity and always acted in the best interests of Pakistan,” he wrote.
Earlier in the day, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja told reporters that the decision to remove Mr Gandapur had been made by the jailed party chief.
Speaking to the media in Rawalpindi, Mr Raja announced that as per the directions of the founding chairman, Mr Gandapur would be replaced by MPA Sohail Afridi.
Replying to questions, he claimed that Imran Khan had informed him about the background of the decision and instructed him to brief the media.
He said terrorism was badly affecting KP and a record number of incidents were being reported. He said that Mr Khan was very perturbed by the situation, especially the recent incident in the Orakzai district, and he had no choice but to change the CM.
Mr Raja also said that the PTI founder had been continuously saying that the policies of the federal government were ‘wrong’ and the KP government should distance itself from them.
‘No forward bloc’
Dawn.com quoted PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar as saying that the decision regarding the replacement of the KP CM would not lead to any forward blocs in the party.
“Khan’s instructions will be acted on. Ali Amin Gandapur will depart for Peshawar in half an hour and send his resignation via summary to the governor tomorrow. Everyone will support the PTI government that will be formed as per Khan’s instructions,” he said earlier in the day.
The interim PTI chairman said he wanted to make it ‘clear’ that there was ‘no forward bloc’ in the party. Mr Gohar said the party would maintain its two-thirds majority in KP with 91 MPAs.
Mr Gohar added that Mr Gandapur had clearly said that he was the chief minister only as long as Imran’s trust was reposed in him.
PTI to register more parties
Separately, the PTI has also been deliberating a decision to register one or two political parties to circumvent any adverse situation like the one it had encountered during the Feb 8 elections.
Sources told Dawn it was being considered to register one or two political parties to avoid any untoward situation in the future. The names which are being considered are ‘Tehreek-i-Insaf Pakistan’ and ‘Insaf Pakistan’ etc.
According to sources, the new party or parties will have separate chairmen so that in case of the disqualification of one party’s chairman, the other party would be available to contest elections. PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser confirmed to Dawn that the idea was under consideration and that they were working on different names.

In a post on X following today’s surprise developments, Gandapur said: “In respectful compliance of the orders of my leader … Imran Khan, it is my honour to tender my resignation.”
 


He also attached a copy of his resignation sent to KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
“When I took over as chief minister, the province was faced with a dual challenge of financial ruin and menace of terrorism. Over the last one and a half year, with the support of my cabinet, our party members and workers, my team of bureaucracy and above all, guidance of Imran Khan, we steered the province to financial stability and countered the menace of militancy with resolute courage and unwavering decision-making. We initiated mega projects of nation-building in a province that was militarily categorised as a warzone,” the letter said.
Gandapur thanked his cabinet colleagues, assembly members of both the PTI and the opposition and all officers of the KP bureaucracy, who he said helped him face “extraordinary challenges of governance” in the province.
 
 

“I may not be able to claim with certainty that I did well on all those challenges but one thing that I can say with utmost certainty is that I served with absolute sincerity to the people of KP and always acted in the best interest of Pakistan.”
An earlier post on Gandapur’s official Facebook account, later deleted, quoted him as saying: “The role of the chief minister was Imran Khan sahib’s amaanat (entrustment) and as per his order, I am returning his amaanat and submitting my resignation.”
 


PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram also shared the same statement on X, attributed to Gandapur.
 


Earlier, PTI also confirmed the development on its official X account: “Ali Amin Gandapur has resigned as per Imran Khan’s directive.”
 


A short while before Gandapur’s statement, PTI Secretary General Raja said “this is correct” when asked by a reporter in Rawalpindi if MPA Afridi had been decided as the next chief minister.
 






Addressing a media briefing later, Raja stated that the decision was made by Imran, who he said told him about the “background of this in detail and also ordered me to put this before you”.
The PTI leader said there will be no vote of no-confidence against Gandapur as Imran had ordered him to resign. He pointed out that the PTI had a “clear majority” in the KP Assembly through which Afridi would be elected as the next chief minister.
Asked about the possibility of Gandapur refusing to resign, Raja said, “Ali Amin  is loyal to the party. Imran Khan has expressed good sentiments for him. There is no reason that Ali Amin will not follow Khan sahib’s order.”
Raja also quoted Imran as raising concerns over the spike in terrorism in PTI-ruled KP.
He said: “There is the worst terrorism situation in KP. There have been record incidents this year […] the lives lost and martyrdoms so far, there is no example found of this.”
“Khan sahib is very sad, the incident that happened in Orakzai, Khan sahib said there is no choice for him now, but to make the change [in KP CM].”
He further quoted Imran as highlighting that for over two years, he had the stance that the federal government’s policies were “very wrong” and the KP government “should disassociate itself from it”.
 


Raja stressed that Imran “repeatedly said there are three stakeholders and until they were involved, there would not be peace in KP and Pakistan”, specifying the parties as the residents of tribal areas, the Afghan government and the Afghan people.
“The way we humiliated Afghan refugees and cast them out from Pakistan, we have sown such a hate of which there was no need, after hosting them for 40 years, […] and is unforgivable in the eyes of Imran Khan,” the PTI leader said.
He also criticised the federal government for not “maintaining contact” with the Afghan interim set-up.
 
 

Raja said Imran was “sad and angry’’ that his vision was not acted on and the KP government could not “distance itself from the policies of the federal government and agencies the way it was necessary’’.
Criticising the cycle of violence involving military action and reprisals, he said there was only one way to end the menace of terrorism and that was to “sit and look at the issue in its wider context’’.
 
 

Raja said Imran had the expectation that the new KP setup under Afridi would herald ‘‘a new beginning and there will be wise talk of mutual understanding’’. He added that jirgas and tribes would be asked for help, and a solution would be provided to the province’s issues.
“Khan has affirmed the intent of adopting better policies from now on at the federal government level and the provincial government can provide guidance on this matter. It is the expectation of Imran Khan that Sohail Afridi will guide and advise the federal government and make it understand how to establish peace in the region and act on Imran Khan’s vision.”
“There was a perception created that our provincial government was a helper of the federal government’s misplaced policies, so the expectation from Sohail Afridi is he will distance himself and clearly say we don’t support the federal government’s policies,’’ Raja added.
‘Not a result of rift with Aleema’
However, Raja refuted speculation that the decision was a result of the recent dispute between Gandapur and Imran’s sister Aleema Khan.
“Imran Khan also expressed good intentions for Ali Amin. He thinks it will also be good for Ali Amin to leave the office and become part of politics that is politics of the people of KP,” he said.
Today’s development comes about a week after the PTI found itself embroiled in another controversy after Aleema and Gandapur exchanged grave allegations, with the latter accusing Imran’s sister of provoking rifts in the party.
The argument started with Aleema claiming that Gandapur had told her imprisoned brother that she was trying to hijack the PTI with the help of the Military Intelligence (MI) and the “establishment”. She made these remarks only a day after Gandapur met the ex-premier in jail for more than two hours and left the premises without speaking to the media persons.
In a video statement in response to Aleema’s allegations, Gandapur claimed that campaigns were being carried out to declare her the PTI chairperson. He acknowledged telling Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas.
The claims made by Aleema — who came to the limelight after her brother was jailed in August 2023 and regularly meets him at Adiala jail — and Gandapur strengthened speculations about a severe rift between the PTI and Imran’s family members.
In June, the midnight passage of the KP fiscal budget also exposed deep divisions within the PTI.
Gandapur initially said his government would follow Imran’s directives on the budget and meet with him to secure the approval. However, days later on June 24, the provincial assembly bulldozed cut motions on demands for grants and greenlit the budget without Gandapur being able to meet the PTI founder.
The passage was met with surprise from key PTI leaders, including Raja and ex-KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, who said the approval could have been extended till June 27 at least.
Gandapur justified the approval, saying that any delay could have paved the way for the imposition of governor’s rule in the province.
Gohar says Imran’s orders to be acted on
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar said, while talking to the media in Islamabad, that once Imran’s instructions were delivered, no other party body could contradict them but had to act on them.
“Khan’s instructions will be acted on. Ali Amin Gandapur will depart for Peshawar in half an hour and send his resignation via summary to the governor tomorrow. Everyone will support the PTI government that will be formed as per Khan’s instructions.’’
He said he wanted to make it “clear’’ that there was ‘‘no forward bloc’’ in the party. Gohar said the party would maintain its two-third majority in KP with 91 MPAs.
Gohar added that Gandapur had clearly said that he was the chief minister only as long as Imran’s trust was reposed in him. He also praised him for his performance in the top provincial office, saying he had worked day and night for the party, government and people.

The statement from the army brass, released after the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) held at General Headquarters (GHQ), comes in the wake of last week’s provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership.
Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. He had said that Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
The Pakistan military had issued a strong response to the remarks and wanred that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. It had said that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”.
A statement from the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued today said that the military brass also took notice of the remarks in today’s CCC.
“The forum pledged to counter any Indian aggression with a swift and decisive response, shattering any perceived notion of India’s relative safety accruing from geography. Any imaginary new normal will be met with a new normal of swift retributive response,” the ISPR said.
 






It added that the military leadership expressed grave concerns about the recent “irresponsible and unwarranted provocative statements” by the Indian civil and military leadership.
“Such rhetoric conforms to the well-known Indian propensity of whipping up war hysteria for political benefits. The participants agreed that unwarranted warmongering is likely to lead to heightened tensions and will endanger regional peace and security,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing said the meeting commenced with prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks “orchestrated by Indian terror proxies”.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “commended the spirit, resolve and determination of the Pakistan armed forces in war against foreign-sponsored terror proxies and during extensive relief and rescue operations in the aftermath of recent floods, in conjunction with civil administration and other law enforcement agencies”, the statement said.
It further added that the forum undertook a “comprehensive review’’ of ongoing counter-terrorism operations, emerging threat paradigms and operational readiness and reaffirmed that the military remained ready to “thwart inimical designs of Pakistan’s adversaries across all domains”.
The ISPR also said that the CCC members affirmed that the “existing nexus between terror and crime with vested political patronage, which is gravely hurting the interests of the state and security of its people, will not be allowed to continue anymore, come what may”.
The military’s media wing further said that the participants expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
The participants also acknowledged the significance of Pakistan’s recent high-level diplomatic engagements and reaffirmed their commitment to global and regional peace. In particular, the military welcomed the landmark mutual defence deal between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and said it underscored “shared values, mutual respect, and a joint vision” for peace and security in the Middle Eastern and South Asian regions.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh in September.
“The forum reiterated Pakistan’s uncompromising support for the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The forum also reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and hoped for early ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The forum reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on Palestine issue, voicing support for the two-state solution with an independent Palestinian state, based on pre-1967 borders and Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
“In his closing remarks, the COAS, directed the commanders to ensure the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, physical fitness, innovation and responsiveness. The COAS expressed full confidence in the operational preparedness of Pakistan Army to counter threats across the entire spectrum, from conventional and sub-conventional, to hybrid and asymmetric threats,” the military’s media wing concluded.</p><small>2025-10-08 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627604-armys-top-brass-vows-to-end-nexus-of-terror-crime-and-political-patronage' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army warns India of 'swift, destructive response' to any aggression</strong></a><br><p>
