This year’s festivities for the 12th of Rabiul Awwal — the third month of the Islamic lunar calendar — gained greater prominence due to the milestone of 15 centuries having passed since the Holy Prophet’s birth.
India, with the world’s third-largest Muslim population, also saw the day being observed in areas with Muslim residents, such as the city of Kanpur in the state of Uttar Pradesh. And it is here, where the sequence of events began that subsequently triggered “crackdowns, FIRs (first information reports), detentions, arrests, internet shutdowns, political sparring and a wave of protests” from UP, Uttarakhand, Gujarat to Maharashtra, according to Indian media outlet The Wire.
The Frontline reported that Zafar Wali Gali, a lane in Syed Nagar in Kanpur’s Rawatpur area, was decorated for Eid-i-Miladun Nabi on Sept 4 and a lightboard with the slogan, “I Love Muhammad”, was installed at the entrance to the street.
Indian media outlets reported that the installation stoked tensions between the Muslim and Hindu communities, with some people from the latter objecting to the lightboard’s installation at the entrance due to it being a “new tradition”.
Police were subsequently deployed as tensions increased and the lightboard was eventually taken down and moved elsewhere.
Police alleged that unknown youngsters tore down Hindu posters on the path of a Muslim procession on Sept 5, but the event culminated peacefully without incident.
However, “on Sept 9, acting on a complaint by Sub-Inspector Pankaj Sharma, the local police lodged FIRs against 24 individuals for allegedly disturbing communal harmony,” Frontline reported, adding that the police said the cases did not target the slogan but the alleged attempts to disturb communal peace by installing tents and banners at a non-traditional location on a route traditionally used for Ram Navami processions.
The Kanpur police claimed the case was registered only after a review of the CCTV footage “confirmed deliberate acts intended to disturb communal harmony”, The Wire reported.
One of the individuals nominated in the FIR was quoted as saying by the outlet: “Police are harassing us. Why are they not showing videos, photos, or CCTV footage of us tearing any Hindu banners? Nothing unlawful happened, and many of the named accused were not even present there in procession.
“Last year, we displayed the same message on a cloth banner, and no one raised objections. This year, we used a light board, and suddenly, people started protesting. I don’t understand why.”
Another local booked by police, a prayer leader, expressed his befuddlement to the outlet, saying he was approached by the police during the communal negotiations and he did not understand why he was nominated in the case. “This FIR is completely baseless and fake, no Hindu religious posters were torn,” he told the outlet.
Free Press Kashmir reported that the issue gained increased attention when All India Majlis-i-Ittehadul Muslimeen President and lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi chief Asaduddin Owaisi said in a post on X on Sept 15, “I love Muhammad”, adding that doing so was not a crime and tagging the Kanpur police directly.
 






“His post triggered more debate and drew national focus to the incident,” the outlet reported, adding that the slogan soon spread to other districts and states, including Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Telangana.
According to The Wire, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR) documented nationwide cases and arrests related to the row, with the association recording at least 21 FIRs naming 1,324 people and resulting in 38 arrests by Sept 23.
“Most cases were in Uttar Pradesh, including Kaiser­ganj (355 accused people), Shahjahanpur (200), Baghpat (150), Kanpur (24), Kaushambi (3), Unnao (8), Maharajganj (64), Pilibhit (9), and Varanasi (1). Other states included Godhra, Gujarat (88), Kashipur, Uttarakhand (401), and Byculla, Maharashtra (1). These figures, shared by the APCR on social media and confirmed by its office bearer, did not include cases filed in Bareilly between September 26-27,” the outlet reported.
 






With several incidents of protests or communal clashes since then, the next major flashpoint that occurred was in Uttar Pradesh’s city of Bareilly, when a public demonstration called by Ittehad-i-Millat Council (IMC) chief Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan was disrupted by violence.
The cleric had urged the Muslim community to join the campaign, professing the slogan and to gather at Islamia Ground before submitting a memorandum addressed to the president, but the call was taken back due to a lack of permission from the administrative authorities.
 






Despite this, “hundreds of people” gathered near Islamic Ground on Sept 26 after Friday prayers and began to converge at the assembly point. Clashes soon erupted as police faced off against the demonstrators, with stones being pelted, shots being fired and tear gas shelling and baton charges used to disperse the crowd. Several arrests were made, including the IMC chief.
 






The Wire reported that by Sept 27, internet services were suspended, arrests followed and a large police contingent was stationed in the town. It said the IMC chief had criticised the police action as being targeted towards Muslims, adding that the situation soon “quickly acquired a political dimension” when Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath condemned the clashes as a “well-orchestrated attempt to disrupt social harmony” at a public event the same day.
“Maulana had forgotten who is in power,“ the outlet quoted the right-wing CM as saying, adding that he asserted that the government would act firmly against those who hold the system hostage through street unrest.
 






“Whenever a Hindu festival or celebration approaches, they get overheated. To cool them down, we have to do some denting and painting … The lesson we have taught them will make future generations think twice before rioting,” he was quoted as saying by Frontline.
Meanwhile, police and officials said legal action was launched in connection with the clashes and 10 cases were registered across various police stations by Sept 27 with eight individuals sent to judicial custody and a total of 39 people detained in the crackdown.
The Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s comments and the state response generated criticism from both within party ranks and outside.
Jahanzaib Sirwal, a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from Indian-occupied Kashmir, called for an impartial investigation to hold all wrongdoers accountable and not just one community.
“What was a simple, heartfelt act of faith has been met with FIRs, detentions and inflammatory rhetoric, including Adityanath’s remarks about ‘denting-painting’ and teaching lessons to generations,” said the BJP leader.
He added that such statements were divisive and also an “affront to the constitutional right under Article 25 to freely practice and profess one’s religion”. Expressing his displeasure, Sirwal also threatened to resign from the party over Adityanath’s “unacceptable” remarks and the “vindictive” attitude of the state police against the Muslim community.
Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav criticised the government’s response soon after the crackdown. “The government’s display of power is a sign of its weakness. Governments run not through baton charges but through harmony and goodwill. Utterly condemnable!” he said on X.
 






Jamat-i-Islami Vice President Professor Salim Engineer slammed the police action in Kanpur and other instances against protesters as a “blatant attempt” to suppress the Muslim community’s voice.
“The statements by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath regarding Kanpur and its aftermath clearly indicate the ruling dispensation’s attitude. When people protested this government’s attitude and the administration’s unfair action in Kanpur, authorities attempted to suppress them. We witnessed the violence in Bareilly and the police brutality against protesters. They appear to want to send a message, to make this a lesson for Muslims,” Engineer was quoted as saying by Frontline.
Meanwhile, The Times of India reported that All India Muslim Jamaat President Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Bareilvi called the incidents “unfortunate” and urged people to uphold peace.
“The incident is unfortunate. Such incidents should not occur on either side. I appeal to everyone to uphold peace. The only way to love the messenger of Islam is to not hurt anyone, neither through words nor through actions and uphold peace. He has given a message of peace to the entire world. So, I urge all Muslims to maintain law and order, not take law into their hands and not cause conflicts with anyone —neither with the police nor with the administration… Follow what the messenger of Islam said and the path he showed. This is the biggest love,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-04 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04232936291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946578/three-held-by-nccia-in-abbottabad-for-alleged-gang-rape-blackmail-of-minor-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three held by NCCIA in Abbottabad for alleged gang-rape, blackmail of minor: police</strong></a><br><p>The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) on Saturday arrested three people suspected of gang-raping and blackmailing a minor in Abbottabad, according to a police official.
Haripur Sub-Inspector (SI) Basit Ashraf said in a statement that the suspects were part of a gang who allegedly raped a minor boy at gunpoint and filmed the assault, using the footage as blackmail.
“The NCCIA carried out an operation in Abbottabad,” he was quoted as saying. “The NCCIA registered a case against nine suspects … they assaulted the victim multiple times and blackmailed him and his family with the videos.”
SI Ashraf said that the suspects allegedly shared the videos on WhatsApp and used them to blackmail the victim’s family.
“Mobile phones and pornographic videos were recovered from the suspects during the raids,” he stated, adding that they would be used as evidence.
In July, Haripur police arrested a seminary teacher for allegedly sexually abusing a visually-impaired five-year-old child in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur area, police said.
A first information report (FIR) was filed by the victim’s uncle at Saddar police station on July 10 under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (rape) and Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection Act (CPA).
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.</p><small>2025-10-04 19:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626973-rain-likely-in-karachi-within-next-24-hours-ndma' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi likely to receive rain in next 24 hours: NDMA</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, the FO said that a high-level delegation comprising the PM, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and other federal ministers and senior government officials will depart on Sunday.
“The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” the statement read.
 






According to the FO, PM Shehbaz will hold bilateral talks with Malaysian PM Ibrahim and discuss key regional and global developments, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, the Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people ties.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of Agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
Earlier this month, Malaysian High Commissioner to Pakistan Dato’ Mohammad Azhar Mazlan said that there is a great deal of commonality and potential for bilateral exchanges between Kuala Lumpur and Islamabad.
“Malaysia takes pride in its association with Pakistan since August 31, 1957, when we gained independence. Pakistan was one of the earliest countries to recognise Malaysia as a nation. Justice Abdul Hamid of Pakistan also helped Malaysia in drafting its constitution,“ Mazlan said at an event in Karachi.</p><small>2025-10-04 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04222201347e704.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946576/pakistani-film-bags-maiden-accolade-at-jackson-wild-media-awards' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani film bags maiden accolade at Jackson Wild Media Awards</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani film Moklani: The Last Mohanas has won the country’s first-ever award at the Jackson Wild Media Awards, according to a press release from production company Jawad Sharif Films.
Formed in 1991 as the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival, the Jackson Wild Media Awards recognise achievements in wildlife filmmaking. According to the group’s website, it works to “maximise the impact of storytelling that highlights our urgent and collective responsibility to protect and restore our planet”.
According to the press release, the film — directed and produced by award-winning filmmaker Jawad Sharif — was chosen from a pool of over 500 entries and declared the winner in the Global Voices Category at the Awards Gala in Jackson, Wyoming, on October 2.
“Over 200 international judges screened more than 1,000 hours of media before selecting the film as [the] winner in the Global Voices Category,” the press release read.
“The film tells the story of the Mohanas of Manchar Lake, an indigenous fisher
folk community whose centuries-old way of life is disappearing,” the press release read. “Mohanas face shrinking waters, toxic pollution, and the erosion of their unique cultural heritage.”
Manchar Lake lies 18 kilometres west of Sehwan Sharif on the Indus Highway. It is claimed to be one of the biggest freshwater lakes in Pakistan, and the only lake that is home to fishermen living on wooden boathouses for hundreds of years.
 


The press release added that the film was produced with the support of the National Geographic Society and Climate Kahani.
“Moklani is both a visually striking and deeply human portrait of a community on the brink of cultural extinction,” the press release read. “Their struggle reflects the larger climate crisis Pakistan is experiencing.”
Sharif said that the film gave a voice to a community “the world is in danger of forgetting”.
“Their story reflects the urgent realities of climate change, cultural loss, and
the need to preserve both humanity and nature,” he was quoted as saying in the press release. “To see their story recognised on a global stage is deeply humbling. This recognition, above all, belongs to the Mohana community.”
Based in Islamabad, Jawad Sharif Films is an award-winning production house renowned for documentaries on culture, social justice, and climate change, including films such as 2015’s K2 and the Invisible Footmen, 2018’s Indus Blues and 2021’s Natari.</p><small>2025-10-04 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0421454355511cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946574/43-magnititude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-kp-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>4.3-magnititude earthquake jolts parts of KP: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 4.3-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday night, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
According to PMD, the earthquake was recorded 22 kilometres south-east of Pattan at 8:59pm, with a depth of 31km. The jolts were felt in Pattan, Shangla and Battagram
Earlier this week, a 3.2-magnititude earthquake was felt in parts of Karachi. According to PMD, the earthquake was recorded seven kilometres north west of Malir.
Earlier in September, the PMD reported that an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 was felt in areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

“The scenes that Pakistan’s ill-wishers wanted to see, the unrest, chaos and disorder in AJK, their conspiracy has failed. The federal government will fully implement the commitments it has made, and with the 15-day mechanism that has been established, I am confident that there will be no further opportunity for such grievances to arise again,” said the minister while addressing a press conference following the agreement between the two sides.
Iqbal was accompanied by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira.
The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
Iqbal added that following the successful conclusion of talks between the two sides, peace has been restored in the region. Iqbal expressed satisfaction over the dialogue process and said it was “conducted keeping in view the interests of the people of Azad Kashmir and the interests of Pakistan”.
Acknowledging administrative weaknesses, the minister said government organs should be more responsive. “The people are now more aware, the media has made them more informed and their expectations have increased greatly.”
Kaira said following the agreement, the people of AJK “breathed a sigh of relief today” and added that the mechanism established must succeed as “we have no other option other than to ensure its success”.
A high-level federal government delegation earlier today signed an agreement with JAAC to end days of unrest in AJK, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”.
A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout.
In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.”
 
 

“This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”.
Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required.
“Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days.
 






Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team.
 
 

From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry.
Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC.
On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir.
Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands.
Conspiracies now stand buried as issues resolved amicably: PM Shehbaz
Welcoming the agreement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said “all conspiracies and rumours now stand buried and issues have been resolved amicably”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
He appreciated the members of the federal government’s negotiation committee and the JAAC for signing the pact to “settle all issues”.
Terming it an achievement for Pakistan and AJK, the premier said the “restoration of peace and normalcy is a good gesture”, the report added.
 






PM Shehbaz asserted that the government “is ever ready to resolve issues of Kashmiri brethren as public interest and service are among our top priorities”.
He appealed to Kashmiris not to pay heed to rumours, affirming that the government had “always protected” their rights and will also ensure them in the future.
On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.
‘Pakistan, AJK & democracy wins’: Ahsan Iqbal
Iqbal also welcomed the development, writing on X: “Pakistan, AJK and democracy wins.”
He stressed that the people of AJK had “always stood at the frontlines of Pakistan’s national cause, and their voice carries immense weight”.
 






Noting that the nation “saw a difficult situation emerge due to legitimate public concerns”, the planning minister commended the “wisdom of local and national leadership and the spirit of dialogue that enabled us to resolve this stand-off peacefully, without violence, without division, and with mutual respect”.
He highlighted that the resolution of the issue showed that “when the government listens, and when the people engage constructively, we can find solutions together”.
“The Joint Action Committee raised voice of citizens, and the government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took these voices seriously. Instead of confrontation, we chose consultation. Instead of egos, we chose empathy. We commit to work together for good governance and development in AJK,” Iqbal added.</p><small>2025-10-04 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626969-indian-forces-kill-injure-goats-near-zero-point-in-tharparkar' target='_blank'><strong>Indian forces kill, injure goats near Zero Point in Tharparkar</strong></a><br><p>

The war of words between the two sides, that kicked off over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
In response, the PPP had lawmakers stay away from parliamentary proceedings to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad on Wednesday to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces.
However, she declared a day ago that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
In a statement issued today, the PPP leader said her remarks regarding the controversial canal project were a “violation of the CCI’s decision and an insult to the constitutional forum”.
The party demanded that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif take notice of her remarks and clarify the party’s policy. It also demanded that the Punjab government disclose the aid provided to flood victims.
 






The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“The CCI, a constitutional forum, has already rejected and buried the controversial canal project,” reiterated the PPP leader.
“Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz is not above the CCI’s constitutional forum, and Maryam Nawaz holds no standing alone against the CCI.”
He said it was the CCI’s unanimous decision that no canal project would be built until all provinces agreed, adding that Sindh would not accept the project under any circumstances.
Khuhro further said that Maryam was violating the forum’s decision and insulting it with her remarks about the project, adding that she “lacks political wisdom”, which is why she was criticising a constitutional forum.
He said Nawaz was the PML-N’s leader and should take notice of his daughter’s remarks and clarify the party’s stance on the issue.
“Sindh will not allow anyone to plunder the water of its Indus River, nor will it allow any dam to be built on the Indus River.
“Constitutionally, the province of Sindh, being at the tail end, has the first right to water, and any attack on Sindh’s water share will be considered an attack on the unity of Sindh and the country.”
He further alleged that CM Maryam was “frightened by the growing popularity” of the PPP in Punjab, which is why she was opposing the process of providing relief to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Programme.
“Punjab is not the fiefdom of any single party; the PPP, along with every political party, has the right to engage in political activities in Punjab.”
Criticising her administration’s flood relief and rescue efforts, he added her “hollow claims” about her performance are “limited to TV channels only” and stood “exposed”.
“Punjab’s flood victims are still waiting and yearning for aid and relief.”
“If the Punjab CM is providing complete relief and aid to flood victims, she should disclose it to the nation,” he said.
US commits $1m to Unicef flood response
Meanwhile, a press release from Uncief issued a day ago said the United States has committed $1 million to support the organisation’s emergency response for children and families affected by the recent floods in Pakistan.
Unicef said it would reach over 65,000 people, including pregnant women and children, with life-saving nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene support through the contribution.
It explained that it would screen 32,500 children for malnutrition, provide treatment to 2,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition and deliver multi-micronutrient supplements to 32,500 children and 32,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women and caregivers.
Furthermore, over 50,000 people would gain access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, including restoration of damaged water systems, installation of temporary toilets, and distribution of hygiene kits.
“Children are always the most vulnerable in emergencies, facing the compounded threats of malnutrition and deadly waterborne diseases.

The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) comes in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in such a case.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint.”
 






Indian media outlet NDTV reported a day ago that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed, without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”
In its statement today, the ISPR said that this time, “we shall shatter the myth of geographic immunity, hitting the farthest reaches of the Indian territory.
“As for the talk of erasing Pakistan from the map, India must know that if the situation comes, the erasure will be mutual.”
It added that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”.
The military’s media wing warned that the nation and military had the “capability and resolve to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy’s territory” in the face of unwarranted threats and reckless aggression.
The ISPR further said the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”.
It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia.
“For decades, India has benefitted from playing the victim card and painting Pakistan in negative light, while stoking violence and perpetrating terrorism in South Asia and beyond.”
The military’s media wing added that India’s narrative has been sufficiently debunked and “now the world recognises India as the true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability”.
“Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war.  However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.”
The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India.
The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army.
The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.</p><small>2025-10-04 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626960-military-warns-india-of-cataclysmic-devastation-over-provocative-jingoistic-statements' target='_blank'><strong>Military warns India of 'cataclysmic devastation' over provocative, jingoistic statements</strong></a><br><p>

Part of the multi-storey boarding school collapsed suddenly on Monday as students gathered for afternoon prayers.
Rescuers retrieved two bodies and a body part from the rubble today, bringing the death toll to 17, National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) operation director Yudhi Bramantyo said in a statement.
“The evacuation process is still ongoing. Debris removal is focused to the north side in an area not integrated with the main structure,” Yudhi said.
Local search and rescue agency head Nanang Sigit confirmed the updated toll in a separate statement.
Earlier today, authorities said they had recovered nine bodies on Friday.
Rescuers were searching for 49 people still missing, National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) chief Suharyanto said before prior to the retrieval of the latest bodies.
More victims could be found, said Suharyanto, who, like many Indonesians, only goes by one name, as rescuers brought heavy machinery to clear locations where the victims were believed to be buried underneath the rubble.
“After the last victim was found last night, we are focusing on a massive cleanup, with heavy equipment entering the collapsed areas,” he said, as reported by broadcaster Kompas TV.
The school collapse was so violent that it sent tremors across the neighbourhood, according to residents.
Investigators have been looking into the cause of the collapse, but initial signs pointed to substandard construction, experts have said.
The rescue operation was complex because vibrations in one place could affect other areas, officials said.
But the families of the missing agreed on Thursday for heavy equipment to be used, after the 72-hour “golden period” for the best chance of survival came to an end.
The rescue operation was complicated by an earthquake that struck overnight on Tuesday, briefly halting the search.</p><small>2025-10-04 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626934-maryam-lauds-field-marshal-munirs-exceptional-leadership-during-recent-conflict-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>Maryam lauds Field Marshal Munir's exceptional leadership during recent conflict with India</strong></a><br><p>

This comes a day after the Pakistan High Commission in London announced that the national carrier would resume flight operations to the UK this month as PIA received its Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and Third Country Operator approval, but no exact date was given.
PIA announced its “historic return” to British skies with a post on X today, which read: “The wait is finally over! Pakistan International Airlines proudly reconnects Manchester and Islamabad, bringing loved ones closer once again.”
 






In yesterday’s announcement, the high commission said flight operations to Manchester would be resumed during the first phase, after which Birmingham and London would follow suit.
In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people.
The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”.
The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04174114b7e118e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946557/islamabad-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-imran-riaz-khan-kp-anti-graft-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court issues arrest warrants for Imran Riaz Khan, KP anti-graft officials</strong></a><br><p>A district and sessions court in Islamabad issued bailable arrest warrants for YouTuber Imran Riaz Khan and two officials from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s anti-corruption body, it emerged on Saturday.
The arrest warrants, issued by Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah yesterday and available with Dawn.com, were issued for Khan, head of the Directorate of Anti-Corruption Sadeeq Anjam and Adviser to the KP Chief Minister on Anti-Corruption Musaddiq Abbasi, over their alleged involvement in a social media campaign against Islamabad Judge Humayun Dilawar.
Dilawar was the judge who convicted PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case in 2023 and sentenced him to three years in prison.
All three warrants were issued under Sections 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person), 24 (cyber stalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 and Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 505 (statement conducing to public mischief) and 506ii (punishment for criminal intimidation if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
There was no date given by which the three men needed to be produced before the court.
A day prior, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) dismissed a petition seeking to quash a cybercrime case registered against a petitioner accused of running the campaign.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, in a detailed judgement, ruled that the first information report (FIR) could not be quashed at this stage since a challan had already been submitted to the trial court. He further observed that partially quashing an FIR to the extent of one suspect, while others remained nominated, was a legal impossibility.
Last September, a judicial magistrate in KP’s Bannu issued arrest warrants for Judge Dilawar at the request of the Anti-Corruption Establishment, who were probing the Islamabad magistrate’s family’s alleged involvement in a graft case.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/041136337e1778c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946513/hamass-response-to-gaza-plan-creates-window-for-ceasefire-must-not-let-it-close-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas’s response to Gaza plan creates window for ceasefire, must not let it close: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that Palestinian group Hamas’s response to US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan “creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again”.
Late Friday night, Trump told Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza after Hamas agreed to release hostages and accept some other terms in a US plan to end the war, but vexing issues like disarmament appeared unresolved.
Subsequently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas’s response.
Meanwhile, the world welcomed Hamas’s positive response, with Pakistan also doing the same.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the premier said: “Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so.”
He also expressed gratitude to US President Trump, as well as the leaderships of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt and Indonesia, for their efforts during meetings on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
The eight countries, including Pakistan, and the US had met on the sidelines of the UNGA to discuss the conflict in Gaza.
“The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again,” he said, adding that Pakistan would continue to “work with all its partners and brotherly nations to [ensure] everlasting peace in Palestine”.
 






Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Hamas’s response was a “welcome step”.
“This must now result in an immediate ceasefire, end to Palestinian suffering, ensure hostages release, and allow free flow of humanitarian aid. Israel MUST immediately stop its attacks,” he said.
 






“We reaffirm Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and a sovereign, viable State of Palestine on the pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” he added.
Later in the day, Dar held a telephone conversation with Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, wherein they discussed regional developments, particularly the situation in Gaza.
According to a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO), they reviewed ongoing diplomatic efforts, including engagements and consultations among the eight Arab-Islamic countries and the United States in New York, aimed at “achieving an immediate and durable ceasefire, ensuring unhindered humanitarian assistance, and to secure lasting peace in Gaza”.
It added that Dar appreciated the Saudi foreign minister’s continued engagement and constructive role in these efforts.
 






“They also discussed recent developments, including Hamas’s response to the proposal of President Donald Trump. Both ministers reaffirmed their firm commitment to the Palestinian cause and agreed to remain closely engaged with Arab and Islamic partners, as well as the international community, to advance a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace based on the two-state solution,” it concluded.
Meanwhile, another statement issued by the FO also welcomed the Palestinian group’s response, stating: “This offers an important opportunity to secure an immediate ceasefire, end the bloodshed of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, ensure unhindered humanitarian assistance, and pave the way for a credible political process toward lasting peace. Israel must immediately cease attacks.”
In the statement, the FO appreciated the efforts of the American president for peace in Gaza and hoped it would result in a durable ceasefire and a just, comprehensive and lasting peace.
“Pakistan will continue to contribute constructively and meaningfully to this process,” it said.
 






“Pakistan reaffirms its principled support for the Palestinian cause and stands in complete solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, leading to the establishment of a sovereign, viable and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions,” the FO said.

Earlier, a statement issued on X by state broadcaster PTV News said security forces “foiled an attempt to harass peaceful people in the Zehri area” of the district and destroyed multiple terrorist hideouts during an operation while killing over 14 Fitna al-Hindustan members and injuring over 20.
 






In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Congratulating the security forces, Naqvi hailed the operation as a “major success”, saying that the nation was “proud of the professional capabilities and courage of the security forces”.
He further said: “Security forces are determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists in Balochistan. The people of Balochistan stand with the security forces. Indian-sponsored terrorists will not be allowed to hide anywhere.”
 






Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also said operational successes such as the above were “proof that the people of Balochistan and the forces are together grinding the nefarious designs of the country’s enemies into the dust. I am proud of the bravery of my youth and people. Long live Pakistan!”
 






Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakistan and Balochistan.
A day ago, security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the province’s Sherani district.
On Wednesday, four terrorists were apprehended during an IBO in Khuzdar district.</p><small>2025-10-04 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04153319ebe6c01.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946548/state-minister-says-probe-underway-into-who-operates-imran-khans-x-account' target='_blank'><strong>State minister says probe underway into who operates Imran Khan’s X account</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has said that authorities are in contact with X (formerly Twitter) over the use of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan’s account on its platform and an investigation into who has been operating it is underway.
Speaking on Dawn News TV’s programme ‘Doosra Rukh with Nadir Guramani’ on Friday, Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Investigations are underway [into who is operating PTI founder’s X account].“
 






“Evidence and further material will come forward, and that will disclose where the account’s links are and who is running it,” the state minister added.
“At this moment, all I can say is that there is definitely an [the authorities’] engagement with X. Along with this, I believe that the legal process which is being adopted in this investigation [and] its results will also be before you very soon.”
Imran was recently quizzed in prison by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials about his “anti-state” tweets, critical remarks on foreign policy and other topics, according to a post on his official X account.
Although Imran does not have access to his X account in prison, the detailed statement disclosed the five key areas of questioning and his responses.
The PTI founder has repeatedly been quizzed about his social media postings, and he has previously refused to answer any questions without his lawyers present.
That was also the first time that such an account of a questioning by law enforcement personnel was posted to his official X account.
It may be noted that Imran does not have access to the internet in jail and his X account is operated by someone else.
Last month, a petition was filed in the Islamabad High Court challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p><small>2025-10-04 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0415205517185ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946546/right-wing-sanae-takaichi-set-to-become-japans-first-female-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Right-wing Sanae Takaichi set to become Japan’s first female PM</strong></a><br><p>Japan’s ruling party picked hardline conservative Sanae Takaichi as its head on Saturday, putting her on course to become the country’s first female prime minister in a move set to jolt investors and neighbours.
The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has ruled Japan for almost all of the postwar era, elected Takaichi, 64, to regain trust from a public angered by rising prices and drawn to opposition groups promising stimulus and clampdowns on migrants.
A vote in parliament to choose a replacement for outgoing Shigeru Ishiba is expected on October 15. Takaichi is favoured as the ruling coalition has the largest number of seats.
 






Inherits party in crisis
Takaichi, the only woman among the five LDP candidates, beat a challenge from the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, who was bidding to become the youngest modern leader.
A former economic security and internal affairs minister with an expansionary fiscal agenda for the world’s fourth-largest economy, Takaichi takes over a party in crisis.
Various other parties, including the expansionist Democratic Party for the People and the anti-immigration Sanseito, have been steadily luring voters, especially younger ones, away from the LDP.
 


The LDP and its coalition partner lost their majorities in both houses under Ishiba over the past year, triggering his resignation.
“Recently, I have heard harsh voices from across the country saying we don’t know what the LDP stands for anymore,” Takaichi said in a speech before the second-round vote.
“That sense of urgency drove me. I wanted to turn people’s anxieties about their daily lives and the future into hope.”
Takaichi says her hero is Margaret Thatcher, Britain’s first female prime minister, who offers a starker vision for change than Koizumi and is potentially more disruptive.

An advocate of late premier Shinzo Abe’s “Abenomics” strategy to boost the economy with aggressive spending and easy monetary policy, she has previously criticised the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) interest rate increases.
Such a spending shift could confuse investors about one of the world’s biggest debt loads.
Naoya Hasegawa, chief bond strategist at Okasan Securities in Tokyo, said Takaichi’s election had weakened the chances of the BOJ raising rates this month, which markets had priced at around a 60 per cent chance before the vote.
Discussed redoing Trump trade deal
Takaichi has also raised the possibility of redoing an investment deal with US President Donald Trump that lowered his punishing tariffs in return for Japanese taxpayer-backed investment.
The US ambassador to Japan, George Glass, congratulated Takaichi, posting on X that he looked forward to strengthening the Japan-US partnership “on every front”.
 






But her nationalistic positions — such as her regular visits to the Yasukuni shrine to Japan’s war dead, viewed by some Asian countries as a symbol of its past militarism — may rile neighbours like South Korea and China.
South Korea will seek to “cooperate to maintain the positive momentum in South Korea-Japan relations”, President Lee Jae Myung’s office said in a statement.
Takaichi also favours revising Japan’s pacifist postwar constitution and suggested this year that Japan could form a “quasi-security alliance” with Taiwan, the democratically governed island claimed by China.
Taiwan President Lai Ching-te welcomed her election, saying she was a “steadfast friend of Taiwan”.
“It is hoped that under the leadership of the new [LDP] President Takaichi, Taiwan and Japan can deepen their partnership in areas such as economic trade, security, and technological cooperation,” he said in a statement.
 


If elected prime minister, Takaichi said she would travel overseas more regularly than her predecessor to spread the word that “Japan is Back!”.
“I have thrown away my own work-life balance, and I will work, work, work,” Takaichi said in her victory speech.
Warnings for foreigners
Some of her supporters viewed her selection as a watershed in Japan’s male-dominated politics, though opinion polls suggest her socially conservative positions are favoured more by men than women.
“The fact that a woman was chosen might be seen positively. I think it shows that Japan is truly starting to change and that message is getting across,” 30-year-old company worker Misato Kikuchi said outside Tokyo’s Shimbashi station.
Takaichi must also seek to blunt the rise of Sanseito, which broke into the political mainstream in a July election, appealing to conservative voters disillusioned with the LDP.
 
 

Echoing Sanseito’s warnings about foreigners, she kicked off her first official campaign speech with an anecdote about tourists reportedly kicking sacred deer in her hometown of Nara.
Takaichi, whose mother was a police officer, promised to clamp down on rule-breaking visitors and immigrants, who have come to Japan in record numbers in recent years.
“We hope she will … steer Japanese politics in an ‘anti-globalism’ direction to protect national interests and help the people regain prosperity and hope,” Sanseito said in a statement.</p><small>2025-10-04 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0415012081ff37a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946547/test-skipper-shubman-gill-replaces-rohit-sharma-as-india-odi-captain' target='_blank'><strong>Test skipper Shubman Gill replaces Rohit Sharma as India ODI captain</strong></a><br><p>Test skipper Shubman Gill has replaced Rohit Sharma as India’s ODI captain, the country’s cricket board said on Saturday, starting with the series in Australia.
The 38-year-old batsman Rohit and fellow stalwart Virat Kohli, 36, were both however named in the squad for the three-match series beginning on October 19.
Top-order batsman Gill, 26, is now Test and one-day skipper, and vice captain of India’s T20 side.
 






He took over the Test captaincy from Rohit starting with the series in England in the summer, earning praise for both his leadership and batting.
He led from the front, scoring 754 runs in five Tests to help India draw the keenly contested series 2-2.
Gill also leads Gujarat Titans in the Indian Premier League.
Rohit, one of India’s most successful limited-overs captains, led the side to a record third Champions Trophy title in Dubai earlier this year.
He and Kohli have both retired from T20Is and Tests.
Gill’s vice-captain for the Australia series will be Shreyas Iyer.
India currently top both the ODI and T20 team rankings of the International Cricket Council.

The department further said that sea conditions were likely to remain very rough to high, then very high over central North and the North Arabian Sea during the next 36 hours. Thereafter, very rough to high around the
system centre, it said.
“The PMD’s Cyclone Warning Centre, Karachi is monitoring the system and will issue the updates accordingly,” it added.
Zoom Earth’s radar also denoted Shakhti as a “severe cyclonic storm” with a speed of 100km/h as of 11am. According to former chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, regional cyclones are assigned names according to a list prepared by a 13-country panel.
A separate PMD alert issued for Karachi Division stated that the storm now lay south-southwest at a distance of about 390km from Karachi and was likely to move west-southwards.
“Isolated drizzle likely to occur in Karachi Division today. Hot and dry weather likely to prevail [in] most parts of the province,” it said.
The alert predicted partly cloudy and humid weather with chances of isolated drizzle for Saturday (today), partly cloudy and humid weather for Sunday and mostly sunny and humid weather on Monday.</p><small>2025-10-04 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04131826a4c87fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946512/more-rain-expected-across-punjab-till-oct-7-as-flood-survey-underway-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>More rain expected across Punjab till Oct 7 as flood survey underway: PDMA</strong></a><br><p>More rain is expected in the coming days across Punjab as surveys to assess the losses and damages from the recent floods are underway, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said on Saturday.
Since June, monsoon rains across Pakistan have killed at least 1,037 people, swelling major rivers and devastating rural communities along their banks. In Punjab only, over 4.7 million people have been affected across 4,700 villages, according to the PDMA.
Addressing a media briefing in Lahore today, DG Kathia said showers were expected to begin early tomorrow morning across Punjab, and continue till October 7 (Tuesday) in the northern parts.
The PDMA chief said the north and northeastern regions from Rawalpindi to Lahore were likely to receive 30 to 35 millimetres of rainfall on average, while the province’s southern parts could see 5 to 10mm.
He warned that the intensity of the showers would increase on October 6 and 7, with 50 to 70mm of rain anticipated in northern and northeastern Punjab, extending into central districts as well.
The shift in weather is already impacting river flows, as per DG Kathia, who detailed that the Chenab river recorded inflows of 20,000 cusecs at Head Marala.
However, citing “unofficial Indian sources”, Kathia said that in the next 48 hours, inflows could surge to 100,000 to 150,000 cusecs due to rainfall and silt flushing at the Dul Hasti hydropower project, located 210 kilometres upstream in occupied Kashmir.
 
 

The twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad yesterday morning received light to heavy rain, which created a slushy mess in the low-lying areas.
According to an alert issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department on Wednesday, a Western Disturbance (WD) was likely to intensify from October 3 (Friday) and may persist until October 7 (Tuesday).
Survey in 27 districts to be completed by end of Oct
Moreover, the PDMA DG said loss and damage assessments were being carried out in 27 flood-affected districts across Punjab after the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers breached their banks.
Around 4.7m people across 4,700 villages were impacted, with 2.63m people and 2.11m livestock evacuated to safety. The death toll has reached 134, though the final figures may be higher, as the full-scale survey was only initiated in late September.
“The survey began on September 27 and is expected to be completed within a month, covering all 27 districts and 69 tehsils of Punjab,” the PDMA DG stated.
 
 

“On the directives of Punjab’s chief minister, 11,500 survey workers across 27 districts are on the field, with 2,213 teams in total, ensuring enumeration is done transparently,” he noted.
“The joint survey teams include the Pakistan Army, the Urban Unit, the agriculture and livestock departments, and a representative from the [relevant] district administration.”
However, Kathia highlighted that the teams continued to face challenges in reaching areas still inundated with water. He asserted that all involved authorities, including Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, were monitoring the survey in real-time, with data being sent to the Provincial Emergency Operation Centre (PEOC) as soon as it was enumerated.
The PDMA chief detailed that once data was received by the joint survey teams, it was sent to a tehsil flood relief committee working under an assistant commissioner for counter-checking, where it was verified and scrutinised before being forwarded to the district flood relief committee.
On the district level, the data was then sent to the Urban Unit, which verified and forwarded it to the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB).
At PITB, the data undergoes several layers of verification, DG Kathia pointed out.
He explained that the first step involves checks by the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), including Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) authentication, expiry status and out-of-province registration. The data is then cross-matched with livestock vaccination records to ensure accuracy, with vaccination details verified before finalising livestock cases.
In parallel, the Punjab Land Record Authority (PLRA) database was consulted to identify if any non-owners had been included or if any genuine owners had been left out. The PITB also runs its own internal data cross-checks to validate the process.
 
 

Only after these checks is the verified information forwarded to the Bank of Punjab (BOP), the PDMA DG added.
BOP counters will be set up for beneficiaries, with transportation arranged to facilitate access, according to Kathia. Beneficiaries will also receive messages notifying them of the date and centre they need to visit to collect compensation.</p><small>2025-10-04 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626920-14-indian-proxy-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-khuzdar-sources' target='_blank'><strong>14 Indian proxy terrorists killed in Balochistan's Khuzdar operation: sources</strong></a><br><p>

Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said in a statement on Thursday that violations including overspeeding, driving without a license, signal violations, wrong-way driving, overloading, and reckless behaviour would now carry higher fines and demerit points.
Under the revised penalty structure, overspeeding will result in fines of Rs5,000 for motorcycles, Rs15,000 for cars, and Rs20,000 for heavy vehicles, along with eight demerit points. Driving without a license will be penalised with a fine of up to Rs50,000 and six demerit points. Reckless driving will attract a fine of Rs25,000 and eight points.
The new system also includes fines for one-wheeling, riding motorcycles without helmets, using tinted windows, driving in the wrong lane, and carrying passengers on vehicle roofs.
 






“These measures are not intended to collect revenue,” Mr Memon said. “They are aimed at saving lives and making roads safer for everyone.” He added that repeated violations could lead to license suspension or cancellation and that traffic offences such as signal breaking and overspeeding pose risks to public safety.
The minister also said the government is working to modernise traffic enforcement by introducing a digital monitoring system and increasing the capacity of the traffic police.
He noted that the demerit points system, which tracks repeat offenders, is in use in several other countries. He said public awareness campaigns would be launched to encourage compliance with traffic laws.
He appealed to citizens to support the new regulations to reduce accidents, improve traffic flow, and increase road safety.

The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco is the first to challenge a proclamation Trump issued two weeks ago announcing the fee as the Republican president moves to further restrict immigration to the United States.
Plaintiffs include the United Auto Workers union, the American Association of University Professors, a nurse recruitment agency and several religious organisations. They argued that Trump’s power to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals does not allow him to override the law that created the H-1B visa programme.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in a statement said Trump’s administration engaged in lawful actions “discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.”
The programme allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty fields, and technology companies in particular rely heavily on workers who receive H-1B visas.
Critics of H-1Bs and other work visa programmes say they are often used to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour. But business groups and major companies have said H-1Bs are a critical means to address a shortage of qualified American workers.
Employers who sponsor H-1B workers currently typically pay between $2,000 and $5,000 in fees, depending on the size of the company and other factors.
Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment. The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.
Trump in his unprecedented order invoked his power under federal immigration law to restrict the entry of certain foreign nationals that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.
He said that high numbers of lower-wage workers in the H-1B programme have undercut its integrity and that the programme threatens national security, including by discouraging Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology. He said the “large-scale replacement of American workers” through the H-1B programme threatens the country’s economic and national security.
The plaintiffs argue that Trump has no authority to alter a comprehensive statutory scheme governing the visa programme and cannot under the US Constitution unilaterally impose fees, taxes or other mechanisms to generate revenue for the United States, saying that power is reserved for Congress.
“The Proclamation transforms the H-1B programme into one where employers must either ‘pay to play’ or seek a ‘national interest’ exemption, which will be doled out at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, a system that opens the door to selective enforcement and corruption,” the lawsuit said.
The groups argue that agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security’s US Citizenship and Immigration Services and US State Department likewise adopted new policies to implement Trump’s proclamation without following necessary rulemaking processes and without considering how “extorting exorbitant fees will stifle innovation.”
The H-1B programme offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialised fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.
The visas are approved for a period of three to six years.
India was by far the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas last year, accounting for 71 per cent of approved visas, while China was a distant second at 11.7pc, according to government data.</p><small>2025-10-04 05:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/040918133ac9840.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946425/sindh-police-seek-more-details-from-british-authorities-about-range-rover-stolen-in-uk-spotted-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh police seek more details from British authorities about Range Rover stolen in UK, spotted in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sindh police have requested Interpol and the British police to share the detailed log of a tracker fitted in a high-end vehicle reported stolen from the United Kingdom and recently spotted in Karachi.
The black Range Rover Sport was stolen on Nov 11, 2022 from Harrogate, UK, and in February this year, with the help of its tracker, it was located in Karachi on Korangi Road.
Later, Interpol sent a letter to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in Islamabad, the Karachi police and the Anti-Vehicles Lifting Cell (AVLC), alerting them about the stolen vehicle.
Talking to Dawn on Friday, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon said that the Interpol’s letter was received two days ago at the office of AVLC SSP.
“We have sent an email to the UK police and asked them to send us a detailed log of the tracker fitted in the vehicle,” he said.

Interpol says the SUV was last tracked on Korangi Road in February

The IGP said that the police also sought the source of the active location of the vehicle from the tracker, as the vehicle was last spotted in Karachi on Feb 11, 2025.
According to the Interpol’s letter, the black Range Rover Sport was stolen from UK on November 11, 2022. The vehicle was fitted with a tracker, and it was last spotted in Leeds, where it was lost.
It said that the UK police requested cooperation from Pakistani authorities to trace and locate the vehicle.
Earlier in 2022, another luxury vehicle, Bentley Mulsanne, stolen from the UK was recovered from Karachi after a British intelligence agency tracked down the exact location of the car and informed Pakistani authorities.

• Pension liabilities rise to Rs1.055tr in 2024-25, driven by armed forces pensions         
ISLAMABAD: With some discretionary changes, the government announced on Friday that federal employees will contribute 10 per cent of their pensionable pay to qualify for a 12pc contribution from the public exchequer under the newly formalised contributory pension fund scheme. The total contribution rate will thus be 22pc, replacing the traditional pension system for new entrants.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) published the “Federal Government Defined Contribution (FGDC) Pension Fund Scheme Rules 2024” under the Public Finance Management Act 2019, which regulates the scheme according to the Voluntary Pension System Rules 2005 and Non-Banking Finance Companies and Notified Entities Regulations 2008. These rules supersede an earlier MoF order of August 2024, which had set the government’s contribution at 20pc.
On Aug 20, 2024, the MoF initially announced the introduction of the contributory pension scheme for new entrants to the civil government and armed forces. At that time, employees were to contribute 10pc of their basic pay, while the government was to contribute 20pc. The new scheme applies to civil employees appointed on or after July 1, 2024, including civilian defence staff, and will extend to armed forces personnel appointed from July 1, 2025, though the latter implementation is pending.
The government allocated Rs10bn for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget and Rs4.3bn in 2025-26 to support the new system.
The scheme was introduced on the advice of international lenders, notably the World Bank, to contain the rising pension liabilities, which the government has described as a growing fiscal risk. It does not apply to existing employees but aims to slow future growth in pension liabilities.
Federal pension expenditure is estimated at Rs1.055tr for 2024-25, up from Rs821bn in 2023-24 — a rise of nearly 29pc in two years. Armed forces pension liabilities account for Rs742bn in 2025-26, up from Rs563bn in 2023-24, an increase of about 32pc. Civilian pension expenditure is budgeted at Rs243bn for the current year, up 6.6pc from Rs228bn in 2023-24, reflecting some savings from reforms.
Under the new rules, only authorised Pension Fund Managers will manage the employer pension funds. The government, acting as the employer, will contribute 12pc of the employee’s pensionable salary through the Accountant General’s office, which will also ensure proper record-keeping and transfer of contributions.
The Accountant General will verify pension account details before salary payments and will collect and transfer employer contributions to the designated Employer Pension Fund. Employees will contribute their 10pc share alongside their salary deductions.
Employees cannot withdraw funds from their pension accounts before retirement. Upon retirement, they may withdraw up to 25pc of their accumulated balance, while the remaining amount must be invested as per the Voluntary Pension System Rules 2002 for at least 20 years or until age 80, whichever comes first.
Salary slips will include detailed information on employee contributions, employer contributions, and total accumulated balances.
The MoF will ensure annual budget allocations for government contributions and will enter agreements with Pension Fund Managers who support electronic transfer systems. These agreements will include mandatory insurance plans offering death and disability coverage, arranged by the Pension Fund Managers.
To oversee implementation and monitoring, the MoF plans to establish a Non-Banking Finance Company (NBFC), which will temporarily perform the NBFC’s role until it is formally created.
In cases of resignation, termination, dismissal, or voluntary retirement, employee entitlements from the pension accounts will be determined by government rules issued from time to time.The new pension fund scheme marks a significant shift from the traditional defined benefit pension system towards a defined contribution model aimed at improving fiscal sustainability while providing retirement security for future government employees.

• Says several states eyeing Saudi-style defence pacts; claims controversial ‘speechwriter’ was not part of ‘official UN team’
• Return of flotilla activists being negotiated through ‘European country’ in absence of ties with Tel Aviv
ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the United States was now “the only hope” after the United Nations, European Union and Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) had failed to secure peace in Gaza.
Making a policy statement in the National Assembly, Mr Dar again distanced the government from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza “peace plan”, saying it differed from a draft jointly prepared by eight Muslim countries and shared with Washington.
He said the prime minister’s initial statement welcoming the plan was issued while in transit, while he was “unaware of the changes”.
“Pakistan’s policy on Palestine is what was the policy of the Quaid-i-Azam. There was no change, there is no change and there will be no change in it,” he assured the House.
Reiterating the country’s consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
Mr Dar also disclosed that several Arab and non-Arab countries had exp­ressed interest in concluding security agreements with Pakistan, along the lines of the recent ‘strategic mutual defence’ pact with Saudi Arabia. He cautioned, however, that decisions on such requests would “take some time”.
 
 

He said several foreign ministers had raised the proposal with him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He likened multiple countries signing bilateral pacts with Pakistan to the formation of an “eastern Nato”, without explaining how separate arrangements could evolve into a multilateral bloc.
“It is my faith that Pakistan will one day lead the Islamic ummah,” he said. “Allah Almighty has made you a nuclear and missile power and now you are to become an economic power,” adding that this would require unity.
He said talks on the Saudi agreement had been underway for about one and a half years, beginning during the PDM government. “We are fortunate to have been included among the defenders of Haramain Sharifain,” he remarked.
He also read out the joint statement, issued alongside seven other Muslim countries following consultations in New York, which called for unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza and a credible path to a two-state peace with Gaza fully integrated with the West Bank.
He said the focus would remain on these objectives, including holding Israel accountable, and noted that the Pales­tinian Authority had accepted the plan.
Responding to opposition questions about British-Pakistani activist Shama Junejo’s presence at UN-related events in New York, Mr Dar clarified she was not part of the official government delegation. “Her involvement was confined to civil society interactions and did not reflect state policy,” he said.
Flotilla
Mr Dar also briefed the House on Pakistanis aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla seized by Israeli forces, condemning the interception as a violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles.
He said Islamabad was pursuing diplomatic channels, including through an “influential European country”, to secure their safe return.
Israel on Friday deported four Italian activists, the first of hundreds detained from the aid flotilla, shortly after the interception of the group’s final boat brought an end to its mission.
The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail last month, ferrying politicians and activists including former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg towards Gaza.
The Israeli navy began intercepting the boats on Wednesday, and an Israeli official said the following day that boats with more than 400 people on board had been prevented from reaching the Palestinian territory.
The military said on Friday that the navy had stopped all 42 of the fleet’s vessels “in an operation that lasted approximately 12 hours”, and transferred flotilla members to Israel’s Ashdod Port for processing by police.
Israel’s foreign ministry said it deported four Italian activists who were aboard the flotilla, adding that “the rest are in the process of being deported”.
Videos circulating on social media showed far-right Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunting activists from the Global Sumud Flotilla, as they were in Israeli custody.
Videos showed him pointing at the detained activists, and calling them “terrorists.”
The International Committee to Break the Siege on Gaza condemned his actions, saying that it was not surprising “for the criminals of genocide to send their minister swaggering before activists from 50 countries around the world, surrounded by his guards”.
PM asked to apologise
Earlier, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser demanded that the prime minister apologise for “hurting public sentiments” on Palestine, saying no decision would be acceptable without the will of the Palestinian people. He said Haramain Sharifain were central to Pakistanis’ beliefs and that the nation would stand united for their defence.
“If anyone dares to cast an evil eye towards the Haramain, the entire Pakistani nation will stand united in their defence,” he said.
He criticised the government for failing to take parliament into confidence on key national decisions.
The PTI leader stated that Mr Dar’s clarification regarding Shama Junejo had raised further questions. He said the foreign minister had admitted she was the prime minister’s speechwriter and therefore responsibility rested with the premier.
Commenting on the recent “Trump peace deal”, Mr Qaiser said no Muslim leader had endorsed the agreement, yet Pakistan’s prime minister, “in a display of sycophancy”, acknowledged an incomplete agreement through a tweet.
“If the deal was so good, why did the Palestinians reject it?” he asked. He noted that over 60,000 innocent Pale­stinians had been martyred in a brutal campaign of genocide, the likes of which the world had rarely witnessed.
Mr Qaiser categorically stated that Pakistan’s 250 million people would never accept recognition of Israel. “Any peace accord is incomplete without the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, with Al-Quds as its capital,” he asserted.

• FBR, Punjab and Sindh govts under critical scrutiny for missing target, failing to meet cash surplus commitments
• Power sector shows improved recovery, lower circular debt
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan appears well-placed to secure over $1 billion as the third tranche of the Enhanced Fund Facility (EFF) despite some slippages, as the authorities enter policy-level talks with a visiting review mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday.
Informed sources said technical-level discussions had been concluded, indicating that the two sides would need to agree on a couple of waivers during policy-level engagements before wrapping up the review with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb by the weekend (Oct 9-10).
While the power sector has shown unusual performance in terms of improved recovery and a reduction in circular debt — through diversion of fiscal space allocated to subsidies and fresh replacement loans — federal revenues and provincial performance, particularly in promised budget surpluses and agricultural tax collections, have emerged as weak areas.
 
 

A combination of additional measures to be worked out over the next four days, along with relaxations in view of flood-related challenges, is expected to pave the way for the conclusion of the second review. This would lead to the disbursement of the next tranche worth over $1bn by early next month, subject to IMF board approval. The global political environment remains favourable for Pakistan, with major voting members backing the country.
According to the sources, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the provincial governments of Punjab and Sindh remain under critical scrutiny. The FBR not only missed the end-June 2025 revenue target by a wide margin but also recorded a similar shortfall in the first quarter of the current fiscal year — about Rs200bn, with a monthly average of over Rs65bn — despite an expansive transformation plan that included, among other things, a large fleet of vehicles.
The key question now is whether anticipated recoveries from court cases will be enough to bridge the gap or if additional measures will be required at the start of November.
Cash surplus commitments
On the other hand, despite being part of the coalition at the Centre, the Sindh and Punjab governments failed to meet their cash surplus commitments at the close of the last fiscal year, with Sindh even announcing a deficit budget at the outset of FY26. The IMF has used the review to push for corrective measures, as these slippages have also pressured the opposition-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to increase spending for political reasons, despite having so far maintained fiscal discipline.
Given flood-related demands, the provinces are unlikely to perform better this year, although they are being pressed by the IMF to correct their course. This pressure was reflected in Punjab chief minister’s public outburst on Thursday over being held accountable by the IMF for all financial matters. Punjab is required to deliver a Rs740bn surplus to the Centre, followed by Sindh with Rs370bn, KP with Rs220bn, and Balochistan with Rs155bn.
Moreover, both the federal and provincial governments have struggled to establish a comprehensive mechanism for agricultural tax collection. Given the recent floods, they appear more inclined to seek relaxations and waivers rather than implement the laws they passed last year to meet IMF conditions. The provinces have been attempting to link their budget surpluses to the federal government’s revenue collection performance. Both KP and Punjab have reportedly assured the IMF review mission that they will meet flood-related expenses from their own resources.
Although all provinces enacted agricultural income tax laws in time, their actual implementation and collection — scheduled to begin in September-October this year — remains uncertain, particularly due to the ongoing flood situation in Punjab and Sindh. As a result, authorities remain unclear about the extent of support required for flood-affected people, sectors, and infrastructure.
The dialogue also covered the rising circular debt in the gas sector, partly due to the shifting of liabilities from the power sector. The two sides are discussing benchmarking of the gas sector going forward, focusing on definitions and reporting mechanisms.
So far, the two sides have been unable to resolve issues related to compliance with the state-owned enterprises (SOE) laws, including matters concerning blue-chip companies under the Pakistan Wealth Fund and governance challenges such as public disclosure of assets and retu­rns of government officials across all tiers and organs of the state.
Overall, the authorities’ programme performance as of end-June 2025 has been mixed, and the outlook requires enhanced efforts. The IMF has reportedly rebuffed the authorities’ push for tax-related relaxations to incentivise the upgrading of ageing refineries — putting at risk around $6bn in fresh investment — on the grounds that such relaxations would be counterproductive to the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) for climate change.
The policy to incentivise refinery upgrades had been announced two years ago in consultation with the industry, which was in the process of signing binding contracts when the authorities, under the IMF programme, committed not to grant any tax exemptions.
The Petroleum Division has argued that existing refineries produce significant environmental hazards during both refining and consumption, creating health risks and contributing negatively to climate conditions.
While the government is seeking funds under the RSF for various projects, it has been losing ground domestically due to the continued use of outdated refining technology, a situation it blames on what it describes as the IMF negotiators’ technical misunderstanding and the stance of the finance ministry and FBR.
Pakistan has largely met all quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2025 but is lagging in meeting indicative targets and structural benchmarks, which could affect future implementation. Given the biannual reviews of the $7bn EFF and the $1.4bn climate-related RSF, the two sides must agree on both past performance and future implementation prospects.
