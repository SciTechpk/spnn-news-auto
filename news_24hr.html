The case was registered on Nov 9, 2025, by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, following allegations that the KP CM made false and defamatory claims against state institutions.
This is the fourth time the court has issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the KP chief minister in this case, with two issued in January and another on February 10.
As during a previous hearing, Senior Civil Judge Muhammad Abbas Shah today ordered the immediate arrest and production of CM Afridi, noting that the latter had consistently ignored multiple summons and remained absent without any lawful justification.
The court then adjourned the hearing until March 9.
During the January 28 hearing, the court had termed Afridi’s persistent non-appearance a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process and emphasised that he had been given multiple opportunities to appear and respond to the allegations.
According to the first information report (FIR), the case stems from remarks made by CM Afridi during a media interaction outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail three days prior.
He had allegedly accused security forces of bringing dogs inside mosques in KP and tying them there — an accusation widely condemned for allegedly violating the sanctity of holy places.

 

Following an inquiry conducted on November 8, authorities concluded that CM Afridi and others had “knowingly and deliberately, with mala fide intentions and ulterior motives”, made false, misleading, and intimidating statements against state institutions.
The FIR contended that the video contained “offensive, profane, false, misleading and unfounded allegations” intended to malign and defame state institutions and harm their reputation.
Investigators had alleged that the content formed part of an organised campaign to undermine public trust in state institutions, incite unrest, promote racial hatred and destabilise national security.
The investigating team has further accused Afridi of preparing and circulating fake content on social media with the intention to incite violence, create panic and promote anti-state sentiments deemed harmful to Pakistan’s security and stability.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21154309de0ddb2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974782/ji-chief-terms-govt-participation-in-trumps-board-of-peace-meeting-on-gaza-unacceptable' target='_blank'><strong>JI chief terms govt participation in Trump’s Board of Peace meeting on Gaza ‘unacceptable’</strong></a><br><p>Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Saturday criticised the government for participating in the Boa­rd of Peace’s (BoP) first meeting over Gaza, terming it “unacceptable”.
His remarks came after the inaugural BoP meeting on Thursday in Washington, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the peacemaking efforts of United States President Donald Trump, who is heading the forum.
Addressing the media in Lahore, the JI leader said it was “unacceptable at any cost” to ignore the country’s long-established policy on the Palestine issue.
He emphasised that since the time of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan’s policy had remained clear and that any deviation from it would be intolerable.
Rehman also opposed any plan to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) envisioned under Trump’s 20-point plan.
He argued that the matter concerned Gaza’s internal affairs and should be handled only by local Palestinian police and security forces rather than foreign troops.

 

However, Pakistan was not named among the five nations that committed troops for the proposed ISF, which is tasked with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.
Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi has said Islamabad had clearly outlined its “red lines”, stating that Pakistan could consider participation in a peacekeeping mandate but would not be part of any disarmament or demilitarisation mission.
The JI chief also expressed scepticism over Trump’s statements about Hamas’s disarmament, questioning how Pakistan could reconcile participation in any such framework with its official stance.
“You will go there under whose command?” Rehman asked.
“When you do not speak openly against America or President Trump even while sitting here, how will forces placed under their command raise their voice against Israel or the United States?”
He maintained that there was no need for Pakistan to become part of the ISF planned for the Palestinian enclave.

 

In a post on X, the JI’s official account said: “The government’s decision to join the so-called Trump peace board without consulting Parliament, the cabinet, or key stakeholders is unacceptable.
“Participation in a board that includes Israel and profiteers of human suffering undermines national dignity and deviates from national policy.”
The JI stressed that Pakistan should instead advocate for the Palestinian cause at the United Nations and “expose the repeated use of veto power by the United States to shield Israel from accountability for the genocide in Gaza”.







Earlier this week, Trump pledged $10 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction and brought together representatives of several Muslim-majority countries that offered funding and troops for a proposed ISF.
According to officials at the meeting, Morocco announced it was ready to send police personnel and officers to the nascent force.
The ISF’s American commander, Major General Jasper Jeffers, said that Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Kosovo had also pledged troops.
Indonesia earlier indicated it was prepared to contribute up to 8,000 personnel — nearly half of the 20,000 troops reportedly being sought.

 

The initiative follows a ceasefire negotiated in October by the Trump administration in coordination with Qatar and Egypt, aimed at halting two years of Israeli bombardment in Gaza.
The second phase of the plan calls for the disarmament of Hamas — a proposal that has drawn mixed reactions from regional stakeholders.
While Trump expressed hope that the use of force to disarm Hamas would not be necessary, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas would be disarmed “one way or the other”.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21162629cb7c4d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974794/india-brazil-ink-critical-minerals-deal-as-modi-lula-meet-in-new-delhi' target='_blank'><strong>India, Brazil ink critical minerals deal as Modi, Lula meet in New Delhi</strong></a><br><p>India and Brazil agreed to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after talks in New Delhi with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
“The agreement on critical minerals and rare earths [is] a major step towards building resilient supply chains,” Modi said.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of critical minerals, which are used in everything from electric vehicles, solar panels and smartphones to jet engines and guided missiles.
India, seeking to cut its dependence on top exporter China, has been expanding domestic production and recycling while scouting for new suppliers.







“Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energies and critical minerals is at the core of the pioneering agreement that we have signed today,” Lula said.
The details of the deal were not immediately available.
Nine other agreements and memoranda of understanding were finalised on Saturday, the foreign ministry’s spokesman said, touching on digital cooperation, health, entrepreneurship and other fields.
“Brazil is India’s largest trade partner in Latin America. We are committed to taking our bilateral trade beyond $20 billion in the coming five years,” Modi said.
“Our trade is not just a figure, but a reflection of trust.”







Lula, who arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday for a summit on artificial intelligence, is accompanied by a delegation of more than a dozen ministers as well as business leaders.
On Saturday, he was given a ceremonial welcome and paid his tributes to India’s independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, before going into the meeting with Modi.



With China holding a near-monopoly on rare earths production, some countries are seeking alternative sources.
Rishabh Jain, an expert with the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank, said India’s growing cooperation with Brazil on critical minerals complements recent supply chain engagements with the United States, France and the European Union.
While these partnerships grant India access to advanced technologies, finance and high-end processing capabilities, “Global South alliances are critical for securing diversified, on-ground resource access and shaping emerging rules of global trade”, Jain told AFP.

‘New momentum’
India, the world’s most populous nation, is the 10th largest market for Brazilian exports, with bilateral trade topping $15 billion in 2025.
Key Brazilian exports to India include sugar, crude oil, vegetable oils, cotton and iron ore.
Demand for iron ore has been driven by rapid infrastructure expansion and industrial growth in India, which is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest economy.
India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said he was confident that Lula’s talks with Modi “will impart a new momentum to our ties”.







Modi said that “our cooperation in the defence sector is also continuously growing,” hailing a “win-win partnership”.
“When India and Brazil work together, the voice of Global South becomes stronger and more confident.”
Brazilian firms are also expanding in the country, with Embraer and Adani Group announcing plans last month to build aircraft in India.
Lula addressed the AI Impact summit in Delhi on Thursday, calling for a multilateral and inclusive global governance framework for artificial intelligence.
He will travel on to South Korea for meetings with President Lee Jae Myung and to attend a business forum.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21161650de6ed87.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974792/ctd-claims-arrest-of-suspected-female-suicide-bomber-in-di-khan-operation' target='_blank'><strong>CTD claims arrest of suspected female suicide bomber in DI Khan operation</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police claimed to have averted a major incident after arresting a suspected female suicide bomber during a raid in the Sheikh Yousaf Khema Basti area of the district, officials said on Saturday.
According to a CTD spokesperson, the Dera region received intelligence regarding the presence of a young woman allegedly linked to a banned outfit and preparing for a suicide attack. Acting on the tip-off, a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team conducted a raid at the specified location.
Officials said the suspect, identified only by the initial “Z”, was taken into custody after preliminary questioning. During interrogation, she allegedly disclosed that she had remained under the training of a militant commander, identified as Shah Wali alias Tariq Kochi, who is reportedly deceased.
The suspect further claimed that she had recently consented to carry out a suicide attack and that a suicide vest and target were to be provided by another militant commander identified as Asim, police said.
During the search, officials recovered a bag containing a pistol with ammunition, two mobile phones allegedly used for contact with members of the banned organisation, a power bank, and other items.
Police also claimed that a perfume bottle was recovered, allegedly intended to mask the smell of explosives.
The suspect has been formally arrested and shifted for further investigation.
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed commended the CTD team for the operation and announced a cash reward for the officials involved.
Further investigation is underway to verify the suspect’s claims and trace her alleged handlers.
“Across the province, indiscriminate operations will continue to crush terrorists’ evil intentions, prevent all forms of terrorism, and ensure full implementation of a zero-tolerance policy against anti-state elements,” said the CTD statement.
Last week, four police personnel, including an SHO, embraced martyrdom and two officials sustained injuries in a terrorist ambush in the district.
On January 23, five people, including a peace committee leader, were killed, while 10 others were injured in an explosion — said to be a suicide attack — during a wedding ceremony in DI Khan district.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211436253936f8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974788/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retires-as-microsoft-shakes-up-gaming-unit' target='_blank'><strong>Xbox boss Phil Spencer retires as Microsoft shakes up gaming unit</strong></a><br><p>Microsoft on Friday put out word that Xbox stalwart Phil Spencer is retiring, in a shakeup of leadership at the tech titan’s video game unit.
Former Instacart chief operating officer Asha Sharma will take over as head of Microsoft Gaming, with Matt Booty becoming executive vice president and chief content officer.
“As we celebrate Xbox’s 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive,” Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a message to employees.
“I am long on gaming and its role at the centre of our consumer ambition.”
Changes to the gaming team include Sarah Bond leaving her job as Xbox president “to begin a new chapter” away from Microsoft, according to the company. Booty was previously president of game content and studios at Microsoft, according to his LinkedIn page.
The shakeup comes as cloud computing and artificial intelligence have become priorities at Microsoft, driving revenue growth but also massive spending on infrastructure to power the technology.
“When I walked through Microsoft’s doors as an intern in June of 1988, I could never have imagined the products I’d help build, the players and customers we’d serve or the extraordinary teams I’d be lucky enough to join,” Spencer said in a message to colleagues.
“It’s been an epic ride and truly the privilege of a lifetime.”







Spencer headed the Xbox unit for 12 of his 38 years at Microsoft, nearly tripling the size of the business as video games evolved from packaged software for consoles to subscription services and digital downloads on an array of devices.
Spencer also guided the Xbox team through acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft.

 

Xbox boasts more than 500 million monthly users and a vast stable of game studios, along with a subscription gaming service.
“We are witnessing the reinvention of play,” Sharma said in a blog post announcing the leadership changes.
“To meet the moment, we will invent new business models and new ways to play by leaning into what we already have: iconic teams, characters and worlds that people love.”







Sharma said she would renew focus on the Xbox console, aiming to “recommit to our core Xbox fans and players”.
Microsoft Gaming has been grappling with tariff-induced cost pressures, strong competition and uncertain consumer spending, prompting price rises on Xbox hardware.
Last month, Microsoft reported that its gaming revenue fell around 9.5 per cent in the December quarter, and it recorded undisclosed impairment charges in the division.

 

Microsoft had closed its $69 billion deal for “Call of Duty” maker Activision Blizzard in 2023, swelling its heft in the video-gaming market after heavy regulatory scrutiny.
The company’s gaming unit contends with robust competition from Sony’s PlayStation, particularly regarding console market share and exclusive game offerings.
“Microsoft’s leadership transition is appropriate as it comes at a time when the technology underlying gaming is shifting. As AI becomes a bigger element in game development, Microsoft needs a new generation of leaders to manage through this transition,” said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211511223ad8da0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974790/us-ambassador-says-it-would-be-fine-if-israel-takes-over-large-swathes-of-middle-east' target='_blank'><strong>US ambassador says it ‘would be fine’ if Israel takes over large swathes of Middle East</strong></a><br><p>The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said that he would not be opposed to Tel Aviv taking over large swathes of the Middle East, reported Al-Jazeera.
Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is a staunch pro-Israel conservative.
In a Friday interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the envoy asserted that Israel’s borders are based on the Bible when questioned about the country’s current boundaries.
Carlson noted that the biblical verse includes the region between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile in Egypt.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year.







Carlson, clearly surprised, questioned Huckabee on whether he truly endorsed Israel’s expansion across the entire region.
“They don’t want to take it over. They’re not asking to take it over,” the ambassador replied.
The US envoy then appeared to downplay his comments, describing them as “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement,” while still allowing for the possibility of Israeli expansion according to his religious view.
“If they end up getting attacked by all these places, and they win that war, and they take that land, OK, that’s a whole other discussion,” Huckabee said further.
The ambassador is not a stranger to controversy. In June 2025, he said he does not think an independent Palestinian state remains a US foreign policy goal, prompting the State Department to say he spoke for himself, Reuters reported.
Asked whether Huckabee’s remarks represented a change in US policy, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to comment, saying policy-making was a matter for Trump and the White House.
“Unless there are some significant things that happen that change the culture, there’s no room for it,” Huckabee was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. Those probably won’t happen “in our lifetime,” he said.
Huckabee suggested a piece of land could be carved out of a Muslim country rather than asking Israel to make room. “Does it have to be in Judea and Samaria?” Huckabee said, using the biblical name the Israeli government favors for the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where some 3 million Palestinians live.
In 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must cease immediately.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21150325b5ef91b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974789/lieutenant-colonel-among-two-army-personnel-martyred-in-bannu-suicide-attack-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Lieutenant colonel among two army personnel martyred in Bannu suicide attack: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Saturday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
In a press release, the ISPR said a security forces’ convoy was “targeted by Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij” while an IBO was being conducted on the reported presence of terrorists, including a suicide bomber.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The military’s media wing added that five terrorists were also killed during the operation.
“A vehicle-borne suicide bomber was intercepted by the leading group, foiling his nefarious design to target innocent civilians/law enforcement personnel in Bannu City, averting major catastrophe,” the ISPR stated.
It added that the terrorists were located during the operation and after an “intense fire exchange, five khwarij were sent to hell by the security forces”.
The statement added: “However, in desperation, khwarij rammed the explosive-laden vehicle into one of the vehicles of the leading group.”
Resultantly, 43-year-old Lt Colonel Shahzada Gul Faraz, hailing from Mansehra, whom the ISPR described as a “brave commanding officer renowned for his daring actions, who was leading his troops from the front”, and 28-year-old Sepoy Karamat Shah from Peshawar, embraced martyrdom.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“This clearly indicates that they have no link with Islam,” the ISPR declared.

 

It also noted that the “Afghan Taliban Regime has yet again failed to stop the khwarij from use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities inside Pakistan, that too in the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan “will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
“Such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further reinforce our unwavering commitment [to] safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the military affirmed.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, strongly condemned the “cowardly terrorist attack” and expressed grief over the martyrdoms.
“The supreme sacrifice of the martyrs is the nation’s asset,” President Zardari was quoted as saying.
Conveying his condolences to the martyrs’ families, the president said: “We aim to continue the operations against Fitna al Khawarij indiscriminately and with full force. There will be no compromise on the public’s protection.”
“The terrorists violating the sanctity of the month of Ramazan have no relation with Islam,” he added.







Similarly, in his statement reported by state-run APP, PM Shehbaz stressed that the terrorist act carried out by Fitna al Khawarij during Ramazan was “proof that terrorists had no religion”.
The prime minister commended the security forces for “foiling the nefarious designs of Fitna al Khwarij” by eliminating five terrorists, acting swiftly, and “saving the city from major destruction”.
Noting the security forces were achieving “major success” under the Azm-i-Istehkam vision, the premier reaffirmed that the state was determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.
Concerns over usage of Afghan soil amid terrorism resurgence
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack, prompting targeted operations.
Islamabad has also raised concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan.

 

It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks.
Earlier this week, Pakistan issued a demarche to the Taliban regime over the use of Afghan soil for a terrorist attack on security forces in KP’s Bajaur that martyred 11 soldiers.
Pakistan had also issued a demarche to Afghanistan in late December, over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations ope­r­ating from Afghan soil, after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan.</p><small>2026-02-21 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21142553279af59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974787/islamabad-court-indicts-former-kp-cm-ali-amin-gandapur-in-audio-leaks-case' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court indicts former KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur in audio leaks case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The prolonged legal saga surrounding the audio leak case involving PTI leader and former chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, finally moved to the next stage on Saturday with an additional district and sessions judge indicting him and his co-accused.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Nasr Minallah Baloch conducted the proceedings. Gandapur, accompanied by his counsel, Advocate Raja Zahoorul Hassan, appeared before the court, along with his co-accused, Asad Farooq Khan.
At the outset of the hearing, the judge addressed the core issue that had stalled the proceedings: the repeated failure of the accused to appear. The court enquired why he had not been presenting himself before the law.
Responding to the court’s query, Gandapur cited serious security concerns and logistical hurdles for his absence.
“Due to the security situation and road closures, I could not appear,” the former chief minister explained, adding that there was a prevailing situation akin to a curfew in certain areas, which prevented his travel.
He also informed the judge that his mobile phone had been taken during raids at his premises.
Judge Nasr, while taking note of the explanation, reminded the accused that discretion regarding appearance lies with the court.
He emphasised that a conviction or punishment cannot be based merely on the prosecution’s request, and pointed out that the case had been lingering for a considerable period without a formal indictment being filed.
In a significant move, the defence counsel rose to request the formal cancellation of his client’s arrest warrants, arguing that since the accused had now appeared, the court possessed the full authority to rescind them.
The judge accepted the request, suspending the arrest warrants for Gandapur. However, he issued a clear warning: “The warrants are cancelled, but in the future, you must be careful and ensure your appearance in court.”
The judge also advised that, should similar unavoidable situations arise again, the proper legal channel would be to file an application for exemption from personal appearance beforehand.
Following the resolution of the warrant issue, the court formally terminated the proceedings initiated by publishing an advertisement for the absconding suspect.
Subsequently, the judge read out the charges and formally indicted both Ali Amin Gandapur and Asad Farooq Khan in the audio leak case.
Both accused were present in the dock as the charges were framed against them.
After the indictment, the court adjourned the hearing of the case until April 6.
Earlier on February 9, a court in Islamabad declared Gandapur a proclaimed offender due to his continued absence from court hearings in a liquor and arms recovery case.
Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024, September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025.</p><small>2026-02-21 10:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2111362379ff111.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974778/youth-abducted-released-after-filming-viral-cricket-video-of-aina-wazir-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Youth abducted, released after filming viral cricket video of Aina Wazir in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: A youth from North Waziristan who was reportedly abducted by unidentified individuals for sharing a viral video showing a young girl playing cricket in the region was released, it emerged on Saturday.
A viral video showing young cricketer Aina Wazir bowling in North Waziristan drew widespread attention on mainstream and social media. However, the abduction of the young man who filmed and shared the clip on social media triggered concern across the region.
According to local police, the man, Zafran Wazir, was allegedly abducted by unidentified individuals from the Shewa subdivision of the district.
During his captivity, a video circulated on social media in which he termed sharing the cricket clip his “mistake” and stated that he was in the custody of unknown persons.
In the same video, the abductors claimed that recording and circulating footage of a minor girl playing cricket was “against Islam and Pashtun traditions”.
Following efforts by local tribal elders through a jirga, Wazir was safely recovered and returned home. Residents welcomed him warmly, placing garlands around his neck, with videos of the reception also circulating online.
District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Hussain confirmed that the youth had safely reunited with his family and said investigations into the incident were underway.
Eight-year-old Aina Wazir’s passion for cricket had already been a subject of discussion in the region. Her viral video caught the attention of the owner of the Pakistan Super League franchise Peshawar Zalmi, Javed Afridi, who said that “talent like this deserves the right platform”.
In a post on X, Afridi said that she would be part of the upcoming Zalmi Women League — a platform for girls to “play, inspire, and express their talents”.
“We will ensure she is provided with all necessary cricket equipment and proper facilities so she gets the opportunity she truly deserves to grow and shine and become the next Saira Jabeen,” he said.







The video had also captured the attention of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who said on X, “It is truly heartening to witness such extraordinary raw talent emerging from our soil, a powerful reminder of the immense potential within our youth.”
He said he hoped to see Aina receive the encouragement, training, and institutional support she deserved so her talent “can be fully refined”.







Aina, in response, pledged to work hard to play for the women’s cricket team and expressed special gratitude to Afridi for including her in the Zalmi Women League, calling it the “biggest moment” of her life.</p><small>2026-02-21 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652132-lt-col-among-two-martyred-five-terrorists-killed-in-bannu-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Lt Col among two security personnel martyred in Bannu IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

Trump has ordered a huge build-up of forces in the Middle East and preparations for a potential multi-week air attack on Iran. But he has not laid out in detail to the American public why he might be leading the US into its most aggressive action against the Islamic Republic since its 1979 revolution.
Trump’s fixation on Iran has emerged as the starkest example yet of how foreign policy, including his expanded use of raw military force, has topped his agenda in the first 13 months of his second term, often overshadowing domestic issues like the cost of living that public opinion polls show are much higher priorities for most Americans.

 

A senior White House official said that, despite Trump’s bellicose rhetoric, there was still no “unified support” within the administration to go ahead with an attack on Iran.
Trump’s aides are also mindful of the need to avoid sending a “distracted message” to undecided voters more concerned about the economy, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the press.
White House advisers and Republican campaign officials want Trump focused on the economy, a point that was stressed as the top campaign issue at a private briefing this week with numerous cabinet secretaries, according to a person who attended. Trump was not present.

A second White House official, responding to Reuters questions for this story, said Trump’s foreign policy agenda “has directly translated into wins for the American people.”
“All of the president’s actions put America First, be it through making the entire world safer or bringing economic deliverables home to our country,” the official said.
November’s election will decide whether Trump’s Republican Party continues to control both chambers of the US Congress. Loss of one or both chambers to opposition Democrats would pose a challenge to Trump in the final years of his presidency.
Rob Godfrey, a Republican strategist, said a prolonged conflict with Iran would pose significant political peril for Trump and his fellow Republicans.
“The president has to keep in mind the political base that propelled him to the Republican nomination - three consecutive times - and that continues to stick by him is sceptical of foreign engagement and foreign entanglements because ending the era of ‘forever wars’ was an explicit campaign promise,” Godfrey said.

 

Republicans plan to campaign on individual tax cuts enacted by Congress last year, as well as programmes to lower housing and some prescription drug costs.
Tougher foe than Venezuela
Despite some dissenting voices, many in Trump’s isolationist-minded “Make America Great Again” movement supported the lightning raid that deposed Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last month. But he could face more pushback if he steers the US into war with Iran, which would be a much more formidable foe.

 

Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if it does not reach an agreement on its nuclear programme, reiterated his warning on Friday, saying Tehran “better negotiate a fair deal.”
The US targeted nuclear sites in Iran in June, and Iran has threatened to retaliate fiercely if attacked again.
Trump won re-election in 2024 on his ‘America First’ platform in large part because of his promise to reduce inflation and avoid costly foreign conflicts, but he has been struggling to convince Americans that he is making inroads in bringing down high prices, public opinion polls show.
Still, Republican strategist Lauren Cooley said Trump’s supporters could support military action against Iran if it is decisive and limited.
“The White House will need to clearly connect any action to protecting American security and economic stability at home,” she said.
Even so, with polls showing little public appetite for another foreign war and Trump struggling to stay on message to fully address voters’ economic angst, any escalation with Iran is a risky move by a president who acknowledged in a recent interview with Reuters that his party could struggle in the midterms.
Varied war reasons
Foreign policy, historically, has rarely been a decisive issue for midterm voters. But, having deployed a large force of aircraft carriers, other warships and warplanes to the Middle East, Trump may have boxed himself in to carrying out military action unless Iran makes major concessions that it has so far shown little willingness to accept. Otherwise, he may risk looking weak internationally.
The reasons Trump has given for a possible attack have been vague and varied. He initially threatened strikes in January in reaction to the Iranian government’s bloody crackdown on nationwide street protests but then backed down.

He has more recently pinned his military threats to demands that Iran end its nuclear programme and has floated the idea of “regime change,” but he and his aides have not said how air strikes could make that happen.
The second White House official insisted that Trump “has been clear that he always prefers diplomacy, and that Iran should make a deal before it is too late.”
The president, the official added, has also stressed that Iran “cannot have a nuclear weapon or the capacity to build one, and that they cannot enrich uranium.”
What many see as a lack of clarity stands in stark contrast to the extensive public case made by then-President George W. Bush for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which he said was meant to rid the country of weapons of mass destruction.
Though that mission ended up being based on bad intelligence and false claims, Bush’s stated war aims were clear at the outset.
Godfrey, the Republican strategist, said independent voters, crucial in deciding the outcomes of close elections, will be scrutinising how Trump handles Iran.
“Midterm voters and his base will be waiting for the president to make his case,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-21 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21113700253b1e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974776/45-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-twin-cities-surrounding-areas' target='_blank'><strong>4.5-magnitude earthquake shakes twin cities, surrounding areas</strong></a><br><p>A 4.5-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of northern Pakistan on Saturday, alarming residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, with tremors also felt in nearby cities, including Swabi, Haripur and Khanpur.
According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with its epicentre located north of Mardan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Residents reported that homes and office buildings swayed during the quake, prompting many people to step outside as a precaution.

The LHC’s Rawalpindi Bench gave this ruling while dismissing a petition filed by Fauji Foundation’s educational entity Foundation University. The plea challenged the deduction of Zakat from its investments in National Saving Certificates.
The bench, led by Justice Jawad Hassan, held that the university does not qualify for exemption as a charitable institution under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance 1980.
Justice Hassan ruled that the university, despite being established under the Foundation University Ordinance 2002 and sponsored by the Fauji Foundation, functions as an independent body corporate with financial autonomy, making it liable to compulsory Zakat deduction.

 

The university had approached the court through counsel Sayyid Murtaza Ali Pirzada, seeking to set aside a letter issued by the Ministry of Religious Affairs on April 24, 2018, which held the institution liable to pay Zakat on its investments.
The petitioner argued that as the university was sponsored by Fauji Foundation — a trust established under the Charitable Endowment Act 1890 — and reinvested its surplus funds to provide quality education, it should be exempt from Zakat.
Assistant Attorney General (AAG) Barrister Zain Mansoor, who appeared on the state’s behalf, opposed the petition, contending that the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance contains a comprehensive mechanism defining assets and institutions liable to Zakat.
He argued that the university’s statutory status neither exempts it from the operation of the law nor alters the character of its accounts attracting Zakat.
The court observed that Section 3(2) of the Foundation University Ordinance 2002 explicitly defines the university as a “body corporate” with perpetual succession and power to acquire, hold and dispose of property.

 

Justice Hassan noted that such attributes establish the university as an independent juristic person, separate from the federal or provincial government.
“The preamble to the statute situates the establishment of the petitioner university within the broader framework of national interest, but that alone does not confer charitable status for fiscal purposes,” the judgment stated.
The court further examined the university’s powers under its governing statute, which include the authority to enter into agreements, charge fees, create posts, appoint staff and invest funds.
“The university operates on a revenue-generating model rather than a pure charitable basis. Though chartered and sponsored by Fauji Foundation, the record of the Higher Education Commission unequivocally classifies it as a private sector university,” the judgment noted.
Referring to Section 1(2) of the Zakat Ordinance, the court held that any company, association of persons, or body of individuals — whether incorporated or not — with majority shares owned by Muslim citizens of Pakistan, is liable to Zakat.
The court further observed that the university, as a body corporate, squarely falls within the definition of “person” under the ordinance.
The judgment extensively relied on Supreme Court precedents, including Liaqat National Hospital versus Province of Sindh, which held that registration under a charitable law does not automatically confer tax exemption, and institutions charging fees while providing some charity operate with a duality of function, irreconcilable with exclusivity demanded by fiscal statutes.
The court also considered Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust versus Federation of Pakistan, which laid down a two-limbed test requiring registration as a charitable organisation and approval by revenue authorities for exemption.

 

Justice Hassan noted that despite repeated directions issued on Dec 8, 2020, Feb 17, 2022, April 4, 2024, and Nov 19, 2024, the university failed to place on record any document establishing its status as a charitable institution or pointing to any specific provision granting exemption from Zakat liability.
The court also rejected the petitioner’s reliance on Administrator General Zakat versus Pakistan Insurance Corporation, distinguishing it on facts as that case involved a statutory corporation wholly owned by the federal government, unlike Foundation University, which operates independently.
Amicus Curiae Nisar A Mujahid, appointed by the court to assist in the matter, submitted that the university does not qualify as a charitable institution under the ordinance, as educational advancement alone does not confer charitable status without fulfilment of statutory conditions.
“The petitioner university has failed to demonstrate any illegality in the impugned letter warranting interference by this court in its constitutional jurisdiction,” the judgment concluded, dismissing the petition with no order as to costs.
The verdict upholds the compulsory Zakat deduction from the university’s investments in National Saving Certificates, affirming the position taken by the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p><small>2026-02-21 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211301436822b7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974781/austria-turns-hitlers-home-into-a-police-station' target='_blank'><strong>Austria turns Hitler’s home into a police station</strong></a><br><p>Turning the house where Adolf Hitler was born into a police station has raised mixed emotions in his Austrian hometown.
“It’s a double-edged sword,” said Sibylle Treiblmaier, outside the house in the town of Braunau am Inn on the border with Germany.
While it might discourage far-right extremists from gathering at the site, it could have “been used better or differently”, the 53-year-old office assistant told AFP.
The government wants to “neutralise” the site and passed a law in 2016 to take control of the dilapidated building from its private owner.

Austria — which was annexed by Hitler’s Germany in 1938 — has repeatedly been criticised in the past for not fully acknowledging its responsibility in the Holocaust.
The far-right Freedom Party, founded by former Nazis, is ahead in the polls after getting the most votes in a national election for the first time in 2024, though it failed to form a government.
Last year, two streets in Braunau am Inn commemorating Nazis were renamed after years of complaints by activists.
‘Problematic’
The house where Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, and lived for a short period of his early life, is right in the centre of town on a narrow shop-lined street.
A memorial stone in front reads: “For Peace, Freedom and Democracy. Never Again Fascism. Millions of Dead Warn.”

When AFP visited this week, workers were putting the finishing touches to the renovated facade.
Officers are scheduled to move in during “the second quarter of 2026”, the interior ministry said.
But for author Ludwig Laher, a member of the Mauthausen Committee Austria that represents Holocaust victims, “a police station is problematic, as the police… are obliged, in every political system, to protect what the state wants”.
An earlier idea to turn the house into a place where people would come together to discuss peace-building had “received a lot of support”, he told AFP.

Jasmin Stadler, a 34-year-old shop owner and Braunau native, said it would have been interesting to put Hitler’s birth in the house in a “historic context”, explaining more about the house.
She also slammed the 20-million-euro ($24-million) cost of the rebuild.
‘Bit of calm’
But others are in favour of the redesign of the house, which many years ago was rented by the interior ministry and housed a centre for people with disabilities before it fell into disrepair.
Wolfgang Leithner, a 57-year-old electrical engineer, said turning it into a police station would “hopefully bring a bit of calm”, avoiding it becoming a shrine for far-right extremists.
“It makes sense to use the building and give it to the police, to the public authorities,” he said.
The office of Braunau’s conservative mayor declined an AFP request for comment.
Throughout Austria, debate on how to address the country’s Holocaust history has repeatedly flared.

“Syed Pir Muhammad Shah … is posted as Deputy Inspector General of Police, Traffic, Karachi, relieving Mr. Mazhar Nawaz Shaikh, an officer of PSP (BS-20) Deputy Inspector General of Police, Headquarters, Central Police Office, Sindh from the additional charge of the post,” the notification stated.

Shaikh was transferred and posted as the new traffic police chief after the government removed Shah as the chief of Karachi traffic police at the end of January.
While last month’s notification was silent about the reasons behind DIG Shah’s removal, informed sources told Dawn that Inspector General of Police (IGP) Javed Alam Odho had sought an explanation from him regarding allegations of “misuse of authority” in registration of a case in Hyderabad last year, allegedly on his instructions.</p><small>2026-02-21 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652096-peer-muhammad-shah-posted-as-karachi-traffic-police-chief-again' target='_blank'><strong>Peer Muhammad Shah posted as Karachi traffic police chief again</strong></a><br><p>

A White House official confirmed the trip on Friday, just before the highest US court dealt Trump a stinging defeat by striking down many of the tariffs he has used in a global trade war, including some against rival China.
Trump’s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on an extended visit to Beijing had been expected to revolve around extending a trade truce that kept both countries from further hiking tariffs.
Ruling raises questions for US-China relations
But the Supreme Court’s reversal created new questions for tense US-China relations that had recently stabilised after Trump trimmed tariffs on Chinese goods, in exchange for measures from Beijing, including cracking down on the illicit fentanyl trade and pausing export restrictions on critical minerals.
Twenty percent tariffs on China’s US-bound exports were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the court ruled Trump had overstepped. Those tariffs were tied to national emergencies related to fentanyl distribution and trade imbalances.
Other duties on Chinese goods, including those implemented under legislated trade authorities known as Section 301 and Section 232, remain in place.
It was not immediately clear how many of the tariffs Trump would restore, but he told a press conference that he would impose a new 10% global tariff for 150 days.
Trump’s last trip to China, in 2017, was the most recent by a US president.
“That’s going to be a wild one,” Trump told foreign leaders visiting Washington on Thursday about the upcoming China visit.
“We have to put on the biggest display you’ve ever had in the history of China.”
The Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment on the dates of the trip, which were first reported by Reuters. Beijing has not confirmed the trip.
Trump sees trade imbalance as national emergency
The Trump administration has said the global tariffs were necessary because of national emergencies related to trade imbalances that have weakened US manufacturing.
Trump had already been “playing defense” in the trade war, given the effectiveness of Beijing’s threat to cut off rare earths, said Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The tariff defeat likely “cements his weakness in their eyes,” he said.
Chinese officials “like the direction of travel of the bilateral relationship in which the US is diminished and they want to keep things from re-escalating,” Kennedy said.
Trump’s visit will be the leaders’ first in-person talks since an October meeting in South Korea, where they agreed on the trade truce.
While the October meeting largely sidestepped the sensitive issue of Taiwan, Xi raised US arms sales to the island when the two leaders spoke this month.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a position Taipei rejects. The US, bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, has formal diplomatic ties with China, but it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island’s most important arms supplier.
Washington announced its largest-ever arms sale approval with Taiwan in December, including $11.1 billion in weapons that could ostensibly be used to defend against a Chinese attack. Taiwan expects more such sales.
Xi also said during the February call that he would consider further increasing soybean purchases, according to Trump.
Struggling US farmers are a major political constituency for Trump, and China is the top soybean consumer. Analysts said on Friday that China may be less likely to follow through on another big purchase of US soybeans after the Supreme Court ruling.
Although Trump has justified hawkish policy steps from Canada to Greenland and Venezuela as necessary to thwart China, he has eased policy toward Beijing in the past several months in areas from tariffs to advanced computer chips and drones.
The global trade war Trump initiated after he began his second term as president in January 2025 has alienated other trading partners, including allies.
Critics had argued that imposing steep tariffs on countries across the board actually insulated Beijing from the tariff barrage and reduced incentives to move supply chains out of China.
Friday’s ruling could indirectly increase pressure on Beijing if the effective tariff rates on other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, fall more than those on China, said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics.
“Unlike with many other countries, there is a well-established, much more legally durable mechanism for most of the tariffs on China that make them less affected than those on other countries,” Chorzempa said.</p><small>2026-02-21 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652067-pti-cracks-deepen-over-kp-cm-afridis-release-force-plan-for-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>PTI cracks deepen over KP CM Afridi's 'release force' plan for Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>

• Speaker suspends Muttahida’s Engineer Usman over ruckus
• Area SSP, SHO summoned to record MPA’s statement; leave assembly after two sides ‘reconcile’                         
KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly was on Friday rocked by unprecedented infighting within the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan when a party lawmaker, citing threats from a fellow member inside the house, appealed for protection.
The atmosphere abruptly grew tense and dramatic when MQM-P lawmaker Shoukat Ali rose on a point of order, alleging that he had been threatened with dire consequences by his own party colleague, MPA Shariq Jamal.
“Step outside and we’ll see you,” he quoted Mr Jamal as saying to him, and demanded that the relevant police station register a case and guarantee his security, warning that otherwise he would have no choice but to resign.
Taking strong notice of the lawmaker’s allegation, Speaker Syed Awais Shah directed Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Zia Lanjar to respond to the MQM-P member’s complaint.
The law minister, who also holds the portfolio of home affairs, said that it was not appropriate to raise such matters within the assembly, urging the chair to give a ruling on the matter. 
“If we can’t even protect our own assembly member, then what would happen? This kind of complaint is shameful,” he remarked.
The speaker asked Leader of the Opposition Ali Khurshidi of the MQM-P to resolve the matter before the end of the session, or else he would suspend the membership of the member concerned.
Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that this was a matter of cracks within the MQM-P and that they should protect their members.
The situation further aggravated when another MQM-P member, Engineer Mohammad Usman, started shouting and exchanged heated words with his party members.
A visibly irked speaker announced suspension of his membership and restricted his entry into the Sindh Assembly for creating a ruckus in the house and inciting fellow members to respond.
The speaker ruled that his suspension would remain in effect until he submits a written apology.
Mr Lanjar said that he had arranged security for the member and would take action against those who threatened him. He added that he might record his statement with the police if he wanted to.
MPA Shoukat Ali also told the house that that MQM-P MNA Iqbal Mehsud had come to his office with armed men on Monday and Friday and threatened him. 
He said that this was an internal party matter and that he belonged to the Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui group, while the member threatening him belonged to the former Pak Sarzameen Party group.
However, the opposition leader said that the matter would be resolved as it was not a big issue.
The speaker also called the SSP-South and area SHO at his chamber to record the complaint of the MQM-P member against his own party member. 
However, the two members later reconciled and the police officers left the assembly.
Sharjeel slams ‘hate speeches’ at Governor House event
During the proceedings, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon expressed regret over the choice of words and ideas at a programme held at the Governor House a few days ago.
He said the speakers at this event delivered hateful and linguistically biased speeches, which he condemned in the strongest terms.
Mr Memon emphasised that Karachi had endured bitter experiences of hatred, prejudice and linguistic tension in the past, and similar speeches had previously caused severe and irreparable damage to the city. “Making such statements under these circumstances could pose a serious threat to the city’s peace,” he added.
He further noted that it was unfortunate that, in addition to hateful and biased remarks, some state institutions were criticised inappropriately. “Such discussions in a constitutional and prestigious institution like the Governor House are neither appropriate nor safe for the dignity of the institutions or civic harmony,” he added.
He said that occupying such platforms and delivering biased messages was effectively an attempt to revive an environment that Karachi had already suffered from.
He said that the event and the discussions held at Governor House were against the peace, brotherhood and social harmony of the city and “today the emergence of such a statement by an elected representative of the MQM to another representative of the MQM is a cause for further concern”.
Later, the chair adjourned the sitting to Saturday (today).

Premadasa Stadium here on Saturday.
While Babar failed to deliver in his newly-assumed number four role — barring a decent outing against the USA — during the group stage, Shaheen has emerged as one of Pakistan’s weaker links throughout the tournament so far.
The duo may well take a back seat against the BlackCaps, with the less experienced yet promising Khawaja Nafay and Salman Mirza expected to be entrusted with middle-order batting and new-ball bowling duties, respectively.
On the eve of the fixture, Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson laid bare Babar’s vulnerabilities with the bat and hinted the former skipper could contribute only in a specific role, providing context as to why he was not sent in during the last group game against Namibia.
“We think he’s a fine player through the middle, if required, in terms of if we’re in a little bit of trouble, or as we saw against the USA, once he gets himself set, he can increase his strike rate at that point,” said the coach.
“So, we brought Babar back in for a specific role post the Asia Cup. We wanted some batsmanship through the middle, and he certainly brings that for us.
“And he did in many games thro­ughout the last 10. So, the other day we got to the 12th over mark and at that point, Babar Azam is not the best person to come in.”
Instead of Babar, Nafay was promoted to bat at four. Although the right-hander did not shine on his World Cup debut, it signalled that Pakistan had made significant adjustments to their initial plans.
“We’ve got plenty of other opti­ons who can come in and perform that role towards the end,” Hesson said.
For Shaheen, who was rushed back into the side following an injury two months ago, the T20 World Cup has been unforgiving. The left-armer, who once struck fear into opening batters, has conceded 11.22 runs per over during the showpiece, having bowled only nine overs in total.
Salman, in contrast, has conceded six runs per over in the two matches he has bowled. The left-arm medium-pacer was dropped after a decent showing against the Netherlands, and missed the following two matches before replacing Shaheen in the Namibia fixture.
The former, however, is likely to be Pakistan’s first choice in the upcoming games.
“We made a call that Salman Mirza was coming in for Shaheen,” Hesson said. “He bowled incredibly well. To be fair, he was probably really unlucky not to be playing the second and third games.
“His record since he started playing for Pakistan is exceptional.”
Hesson said Pakistan would continue to back their spin-heavy strategy, at least in Colombo, even if that meant fielding a side packed with all-rounders.
“[Mohammad] Nawaz is one of the best performing spinners in the world in T20 cricket,” said the New Zealander. “Since Shadab Khan came back, his figures have been exceptional.
“Saim Ayub is already in the side and obviously has the ability to bowl the carrom ball. The fact that Usman Tariq has been able to bowl the tough overs through the middle and at the death has been a real advantage for us.”
For New Zealand, meanwhile, the Super Eight stage will test their adaptability, with the side having played all their group matches in India.
Pace, bounce and spin in Colo­mbo are likely to differ markedly from conditions in Chennai and Ahm­edabad, but batter Mark Chap­man said the players were well aware of the variations in pitches.
“I think guys understand what they need to do on slower wickets after playing in India where pitches were batting friendly,” said the middle-order player. “So, we’re pretty confident that we’ll face up to whatever conditions are in front of us.
“A lot of the guys have played a lot of cricket here before.”
Pakistan have played all four of their matches in Sri Lanka and possess a potent spin attack.
Chapman was confident New Zealand could cope with Pakistan’s spinners, including the unorthodox Usman, who pauses in his delivery stride and employs deceptive variations, including side-arm releases.
“Obviously, Tariq has a pretty unique action with the way that he stops at the crease and that’s something to factor in,” Chapman said. “But each of the Pakistan spinners poses their own threat.”

The two sides have exchanged divergent positions on the benefits of a three-year incremental package with a Rs4.04 per unit reduction for industry and the revision of the base tariff from the fiscal year cycle to the calendar year cycle, with effect from January 1, 2026.
The industrial side claims that the package was benefiting only a few industries that were not in operation. Still, larger segments could not avail themselves of the benefits, were already in the process of scaling up, or were in the larger category of B3 and B4, who contributed no loss to the grid but paid more in tariffs.
The industry also contends that even if a Rs4.04 per unit reduction was considered, higher fuel costs resulting from the calendar-year change and quarterly adjustments would nullify that reduction. They claim that Power Division was calculating the diversion of industrial captive power plants from natural gas to the power grid as success for the incremental package.

Business community claims relief lost in translation, amid fuel cost hikes

The Power Division on Friday released two-month data as an overview of the industrial relief package in December 2025 and January. It said a total of 127,686 industrial consumers benefited from the package, receiving cumulative relief of Rs12.125 billion. “This represents 46 per cent of the total 278,961 industrial consumers,” the Power Division said, adding that small and large industries alike received a benefit of Rs10.3 per unit on the consumption of surplus electricity under the package.
It said that during December-January, a total of 1,176 million units of electricity were sold to industries under the surplus package, accounting for 23.80pc of the total industrial units sold during this period. About 557m units of electricity were sold in December under the surplus package, representing 23pc of the total industrial units sold during that month, it added.
This translated into financial relief of Rs5.743 billion for industrial consumers. In December alone, 125,829 consumers benefited from the package, constituting 45pc of total industrial consumers.
In January, 619m units were sold to industries, accounting for 24.5pc of the total under the package. The financial benefit amounted to Rs6.382bn. The number of industrial consumers benefiting in January totalled 127,686, or 46pc of the total. The Power Division said Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari was personally committed to taking positive measures for the industrial sector and was directly overseeing these initiatives through regular reviews and progress updates.
This appeared to be in response to a letter from the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), which welcomed the government’s decision to reduce industrial electricity tariffs to restore industrial competitiveness and export viability.
“However, industry and exporters are alarmed over recent developments that have substantially diluted the intended impact of this relief,” said FPCCI President Atif Ikram Shaikh in a letter to the power minister.
He pointed out that the fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for January reflected an increase of approximately Rs1.78 per unit over the reference fuel charges. In addition, the forthcoming quarterly adjustment was expected to add approximately Rs0.40 per unit. Consequently, the effective benefit of the announced Rs4.04 cut for the January billing cycle reduces to nearly Rs1.70-1.80 per unit. This is because the January FCA reference was revised downwards from Rs11.64 to Rs10.40, resulting in a higher cost of Rs1.24 per unit for industrial consumers. “In practical terms, more than half of the announced relief has been neutralised within the same billing period,” the FPCCI chief said.
He highlighted that tariff rebasing was undertaken in July 2025 and again in January. Two structural resets within a short span had intensified tariff volatility and eroded planning certainty for industrial consumers. Exporters have already recalibrated international pricing, secured forward contracts, deployed working capital, and engaged labour based on the expectation of a meaningful and sustained reduction.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court on Friday dismissed multiple petitions challenging the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sales Tax on Services Act, 2022, ruling that the provincial levy on construction services does not contravene constitutional provisions governing the division of taxation powers between the federal and provincial governments.
Headed by Justice Aamer Farooq, a two-judge FCC bench addressed a number of challenges against a May 13, 2025, Peshawar High Court judgement.
Petitioners including M/s Matracon Pakistan (Private) Limited, Anwar Khan, Khawaja Muhammad Khan, Zhongmei-Al Mehreen Joint Venture, Merryland Housing Society Mardan and Subhan Smart City Society Mardan had challenged Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 to the act.
The challenged provision imposed a 2 per cent sales tax on services provided by construction contractors, architects, civil engineers, property promoters, developers, planners, interior decorators and allied professions.
It specifically covers construction services relating to structures, buildings, roads, bridges, underpasses, flyovers, electro-mechanical works, turn-key projects, and engineering, procurement and construction contracts.
Show-cause notices issued by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Revenue Authority demanded tax for the period from July 2021 to April 2022 on amounts received by the petitioners pursuant to construction contracts, which included the price of goods to be provided by the contractors.
The legal question before the FCC was whether Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 was unconstitutional.

 

The judgement observed that after examining Entry 49 of the Constitution — which states “taxes on the sales and purchases of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured or consumed, except sales tax on services” — the court found no inconsistency between the impugned law and the Constitution.
Entry 49 clearly stipulates that taxes on services cannot be imposed by the federation and the impugned law conforms to this mandate by imposing sales tax exclusively on construction services, the court said.
While the FCC acknowledged the petitioners’ concern that the revenue authority was levying tax on entire contractual amounts, it noted that Section 2(a) of the act defines “input tax” as cost incurred in the utilisation of goods for the execution of services.
The law allows registered persons to claim adjustments and refunds regarding tax paid under any other law on goods used in providing taxable services.
The FCC also addressed an ancillary matter regarding its jurisdiction to hear tax references not expressly enumerated in the Constitution. It held that Article 175E(5) of the Constitution authorises the FCC to call for the record of any case where a substantial question of constitutional interpretation arises.
The FCC observed that some constitutional provisions were “character-conferring” and also “competence-enumerating”. Article 175E(5) is of this kind, it said.
The court held that Article 175E(5) authorises the FCC to adjudicate matters involving substantial questions of constitutional interpretation, even in the absence of express jurisdiction. In the present case, the court said such a question squarely arose in the form of a challenge to the vires of the law.
The FCC concluded that Serial No. 14 of Schedule 2 to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sales Tax on Services Act, 2022, was not ultra vires the Constitution. The judgement explained that the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions, when considered together, show no inconsistency.

The oath was administered by AJK Chief Justice Raja Saeed Akram at a ceremony held in the Supreme Court building, attended by members of the legal fraternity and senior civil servants.
The office fell vacant following the expiry of the term of retired Justice Abdul Rashid Sulehria on January 13 last year.
Justice Mughal’s appointment was notified by the AJK government on Wednesday after the President’s office received advice in his favour from the chairman of the AJK Council — the prime minister of Pakistan.
Justice Mughal, who is over 70, previously served as CEC from February 2016 to February 2019 while he was a serving judge — first of the AJK High Court and later of the Supreme Court.
The long-delayed appointment is expected to allay concerns about the timely conduct of AJK’s next general elections, scheduled for July this year.
At the swearing-in ceremony, Justice Mughal declined to take up questions from journalists, saying he would invite media after receiving detailed briefings from election commission officials.

LAHORE: The Crime Control Department (CCD), Punjab, said a comparative review of crime data for the post-May period of 2024 and 2025 showed a significant reduction in crime across Punjab, particularly in Lahore.
According to the CCD, the department commenced operations in Punjab in May last year and held a meeting to review its performance in crime control.
It stated that the provincial capital, Lahore, recorded some of the most pronounced crime reductions in its history.
The CCD said the murder cases fell from 361 to 220 (39pc), while attempted murder declined from 812 to 504 (38pc). Incidents of dacoity dropped from 35 to 15 (57pc), and house dacoity from 33 to 6 (82pc).
Robbery saw the sharpest decline, dropping from 8,213 to 1,823 — a 78pc reduction. Theft within boundary walls fell by 9pc and burglary by 44pc, while motorcycle and car snatching decreased by 69pc and 50pc, respectively.
Punjab recorded significant declines across major crime categories, with murders falling from 3,952 to 3,022 (24pc) and attempted murder down 18pc. Dacoity and robbery dropped by 60pc and 53pc, while theft within boundary walls and burglary decreased by 17pc and 27pc, respectively.
This reduction, however, was not without cost. Across the province, 19 police officers embraced martyrdom, and 167 personnel —including 13 CCD members — sustained firearm-related or other serious operational injuries, according to CCD Punjab.
HRCP findings rejected
Meanwhile, the CCD has rejected allegations made in a fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), terming claims of staged encounters and extrajudicial actions as unfounded and contrary to the department’s operational framework.
The HRCP in its fact-finding report on CCD encounters in Punjab called for an urgent judicial inquiry into related deaths. It said that at least 670 encounters were conducted over eight months in 2025, resulting in 924 suspects killed, while two police officials lost their lives.
In a press release, the CCD stated that it does not follow any policy of staged encounters and operates strictly within the Constitution of Pakistan, the Police Order 2002 and applicable criminal procedure laws. The department maintained that arrest remains the primary objective of its operations and that the use of force is governed by the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.
The CCD said lethal force is employed only as a last resort in situations involving armed resistance and imminent danger to life. It added that Punjab faces a complex security environment in which criminal gangs and organised groups often possess automatic weapons and engage law enforcement personnel with lethal intent, compelling officers to act in self-defence to protect themselves and civilians.
Responding to concerns about abuse of authority, the department acknowledged that any misconduct by individual officers is unacceptable.
According to the statement, officers found involved in corruption, abuse of power, or professional misconduct are being proceeded against under departmental and criminal laws without discrimination.
The CCD reiterated that it maintains a zero-tolerance policy against torture, corruption, fabrication of evidence, intimidation of citizens, and unlawful use of force.

A two-judge SC bench headed by Justice Ayesha A. Malik took up an appeal filed by the finance ministry challenging the FST’s June 26, 2025 order along with an application seeking condonation of a 20-day delay in filing the petition.
Authored by Justice Malik, the four-page judgement described the 20-day delay as inexcusable and criticised the state’s casual approach towards statutory timelines.
The state enforces the law against citizens and expects compliance within prescribed timelines; therefore, it must also hold itself to the same standard, she emphasised.

Observes state is just like any other litigant and must comply with statutory timelines

Through the application, the finance ministry sought condonation of delay, explaining that the case was under process with the deputy secretary (Litigation-II) and awaiting approval from a CPLA committee, which could not be convened due to an insufficient number of cases for deliberation.
It further explained that once the caseload increased and approval was obtained, the draft was sent to the Law and Justice Division for vetting. The division suggested changes, and by the time the final draft was prepared, the limitation period had expired.
Justice Malik observed that if the state were permitted to disregard statutory timeframes on account of its internal inefficiencies, it would create an imbalance in the administration of justice and undermine the constitutional guarantee of equality before the law.
When the state fails to comply with these timelines and seeks indulgence for administrative delay, it transfers the consequences of its disorganisation onto the court and the opposing party, which is often in a weaker position, the judgement emphasised. It added that good governance requires institutional functioning through clear responsibility, internal discipline and adherence to the law.
If compliance depends on convenience rather than structured systems, delays become routine and accountability diminishes. The courts cannot condone such delays without weakening the expectation that the state must maintain efficient systems capable of meeting its legal obligations. Enforcement of timelines and internal procedures strengthens institutional discipline and reinforces public confidence, the judgement observed.

 

Such delay is inexcusable, particularly when no effort has been made to reform or improve the procedure causing the delay, the verdict noted, adding that the state must organise itself to function in a timely manner and meet legal deadlines rather than seeking indulgence for its own inefficiencies.
The judgement observed that enforcement of timelines and internal procedures strengthens institutional discipline and reinforces public confidence that the law applies equally to all under Article 25 of the Constitution.
In this context, the prescribed timeline under the SC rules is 60 days. When a statutory timeframe is set, it is meant to ensure diligence and prevent disputes from remaining indefinitely pending.
If internal file movement, committee scheduling constraints or staff shortages are accepted as sufficient cause, the statutory framework would become flexible at the convenience of the litigant, defeating the very purpose of limitation, which is to ensure certainty and predictability in the administration of justice. The court emphasised that limitation is not merely a technical requirement but carries substantive importance.
Every litigant, including the petitioner, is required to adhere to the prescribed timelines, failing which the remedy stands extinguished unless sufficient cause is shown.
“We find that the explanation provided in the application for condonation of delay is insufficient and reflects a very casual approach towards the prescribed limitation,” the judgement observed.
Consequently, the application for condonation of delay was dismissed and, as a result, the petition itself was dismissed as time-barred.

FORMER captain Michael Vaughan has urged the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to “act fast” on reports that Pakistani players will be overlooked by Indian-owned teams in the domestic Hundred competition.
The issue could be a factor during next month’s player auction for English cricket’s Hundred, a 100 balls-per-side competition featuring eight franchises rather than the traditional 18 first-class counties.
BBC Sport and The Telegraph have reported that with four of the eight franchises in the upcoming tournament owned by companies that control teams in the Indian Premier League (IPL), it is “an unwritten rule” that Pakistani players would not be considered for those team.
According to the BBC, a senior ECB official indicated to an agent that interest in his Pakistan players would be limited to sides not linked to the IPL.
Vaughan, referencing the ECB’s stated aim of cricket becoming the most inclusive sport in the country, posted on Friday on X: “The ECB need to act fast on this … they own the league, and this should not be allowed to happen … The most inclusive sport in the country is not one that allows this to happen.”







The Pakistan Cricket Board has not commented on the situation so far.
Politics, not sport
Longstanding political tensions between India and Pakistan have led to the rivals only playing each other in international cricket events, although their recent Colombo showdown at the ongoing T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka only went ahead after Pakistan called off a boycott.
Politics has also led to an effective ban on Pakistani players participating in the Indian Premier League, world cricket’s most lucrative T20 franchise competition.
And with several IPL owners now owning teams in several different countries, opportunities for Pakistani cricketers to participate in various leagues are in danger of being reduced further.
Players will go under the hammer in London on March 11-12, with the BBC reporting that the four Indian-affiliated Hundred teams — Manchester Super Giants, MI London, Southern Brave and Sunrisers Leeds — will deliberately avoid selecting players from Pakistan.
Two Pakistani international players — Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim — appeared in last year’s Hundred tournament, which was the final edition before new investors took control.
Others — including Shaheen Afridi, Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf — featured in earlier seasons of the men’s competition. No Pakistan players have appeared in the women’s Hundred.
‘Systemic isolation’
The BBC highlighted the exclusion of Pakistan players in what it called “a growing trend in franchise cricket”.
No Pakistanis have featured in South Africa’s SA20, which launched in 2023. All six of its teams are owned by IPL franchise groups — including the four now involved in The Hundred.
In the UAE’s ILT20, franchises controlled by the owners of MI London and Southern Brave have not signed a Pakistan player across four seasons, but have recruited cricketers from 15 other nationalities.
By contrast, American-owned ILT20 side Desert Vipers have signed eight Pakistan players over the same period.
Commenting on the development, BBC cricket pundit Aatif Nawaz said “There is no merit-based reason for Pakistani players to be excluded from any franchise T20 competition”.
“Call it what it really is: systemic isolation,” he wrote on X.







According to the BBC, the ECB sold its 49pc stakes in each of the eight Hundred franchises last year — raising £500m in private investment that has since been distributed to counties and the grassroots game.
The ECB retains control of the competition itself, with a new board featuring team representatives formed to help shape its strategic direction.
The tournament also remains under the jurisdiction of the independent cricket regulator — established following the 2023 Equity in Cricket report, which found discrimination to be “widespread” within the English game.
The BBC quoted the County Cricket Members’ Group as saying: “We expect the relevant county boards and the ECB to hold private partners accountable if there is any reason to believe the non-selection of Pakistan players was a blanket decision based on nationality.”

WASHINGTON: After the US Supreme Court struck down the President’s sweeping tariffs that he pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies, Donald Trump announced on Friday he was imposing an extra global tariff of 10 per cent on US trade partners.
The conservative-majority court ruled the emergency powers law — International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs”, marking Trump’s biggest defeat at the SC since returning to the White House last year.
While hard-hit Canada welcomed the ruling pointing out the levies were always “unjustified”, other US trading partners particularly European powers were cautious in their response, with the UK, Germany and EU stating that they were in contact with the Trump administration and analysing the court decision ‘carefully’.
Trump insisted he would impose tariffs “using alternative authorities” after rebuking certain members of the court for lacking the courage to do what’s right for the country.
He suggested that most trade deals negotiated under the threat of his tariffs remained valid, mentioning specifically India, despite the SC ruling those levies illegal. “The India deal is on,” Trump told reporters in response to a question, while suggesting tariffs under separate authorities would replace the ones overturned by the court. “All the deals — we’re just going to do it a different way.”
“In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past,” the president asserted.
“The Supreme Court’s decision today made a president’s ability to both regulate trade and impose tariffs more powerful and more crystal clear, rather than less,” he claimed while speaking to reporters after the 6-3 ruling upheld a lower court’s decision that the Republican president’s use of the 1977 law “exceeded his authority”.
Trump has leveraged tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a key economic and foreign policy tool. They have been central to a global trade war that Trump initiated after he began his second term as president, one that has alienated trading partners, affected financial markets and caused global economic uncertainty.
Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate over the next decade trillions of dollars in revenue for the United States, which possesses the world’s largest economy.
However, Trump’s administration has not provided tariffs collection data since Dec 14, 2025.
Powers to issue taxes, tariffs
The Supreme Court reached its conclusion in a legal challenge by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-governed, against Trump’s unprecedented use of this law to unilaterally impose the import taxes.
The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. But Trump instead turned to a statutory authority by invoking IEEPA to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner without the approval of Congress.
“Had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs” with IEEPA, “it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes,” the court noted
The SC’s three liberal justices joined three conservatives in Friday’s ruling, which upheld lower court decisions that tariffs Trump imposed under IEEPA were illegal.
Trump heaped praise on Brett Kavanaugh, the only justice he nominated who voted with him. Kavanaugh was joined in his dissent by fellow conservatives Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.
Chief Justice John Roberts, in delivering his opinion, said, “IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties.”
Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about a third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.
IEEPA lets a president regulate commerce in a national emergency.
Trump became the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials, domestic military deployments and military operations overseas.
He described the tariffs as vital for US economic security, predicting that the country would be defenseless and ruined without them.
Post-ruling strategy
In November, Trump told reporters that without his tariffs “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they’ve used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us”. He said the United States was abused by other countries, including China, the second-largest economy.
After the SC heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we’ll have to develop a ‘game two’ plan”.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the US would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump’s tariffs as possible.
Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten US national security and another that allows retaliatory actions, including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the US Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against American exporters.
None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.
Trump’s ability to impose tariffs instantaneously on any trading partner’s goods under the aegis of some form of declared national emergency raised his leverage over other countries.
It brought world leaders scrambling to Washington to secure trade deals that often included pledges of billions of dollars in investments or other offers of enhanced market access for US companies.
But Trump’s use of tariffs as a cudgel in US foreign policy has succeeded in antagonising numerous countries, including those long considered among the closest US allies.
IEEPA historically had been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs. The law does not specifically mention the word tariffs.
Estimates
Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists estimated that the amount collected in Trump’s tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act stood at more than $175 billion. And that amount likely would need to be refunded with a Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.
The Congressional Bud­get Office has estimated that if all current tariffs stay in place, including the IEEPA-based duties, they would generate about $300bn annually over the next decade.
Total US net customs duty receipts reached a record $195bn in fiscal 2025, which ended on Sept 30, according to US Trea­sury Department data.
In February and March of 2025, Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.
Trump has wielded his tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a weapon to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters. These have ranged from Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, India’s purchases of Russian oil that help fund Russia’s war in Ukraine, and an anti-tariffs ad by Canada’s Ontario province.
Reactions to ruling
The EU said on Friday that it was studying the US Supreme Court ruling. “We take note of the ruling … and are analysing it carefully,” EU trade spokesman Olof Gill said.
“We remain in close contact with the US Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,” he added.
“Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on stability and predictability in the trading relationship”.
The British government spokesperson said Britain planned to work with the US to see how the overturning of Trump’s tariffs by the US Supreme Court would affect the trade deal between the two countries. “We will work with the administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the rest of the world,” the spokesperson said, adding that the UK expects its “privileged trading position with the US to continue”.
The Canadian minister responsible for US trade said the US Supreme Court’s ruling affirms that the levies were “unjustified”.
International Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc noted, however, that tariffs causing the most pain in Canada — sector-specific measures affecting the steel, aluminum and auto industries — remained in force despite the ruling, promising Ottawa would work with Washington to “create growth and opportunities on both sides of the border”.
After the ruling, stock markets rose in the United States and Europe, led by shares of affected companies, including Europe’s luxury brands from LVMH to Hermes and Italian luxury outerwear group Moncler, all of which rose after the ruling.
Stocks rise
US and European stocks advanced on Friday and Treasury yields rose as investors absorbed the Supreme Court ruling, while also parsing a weak GDP report and higher-than-expected inflation data.
All three major US stock indexes moved higher immediately following the Supreme Court’s decision. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are on track to notch weekly gains, while the blue-chip Dow is currently flat versus last Friday’s close.
Europe’s STOXX 600 index extended gains following the ruling while gold prices came off the day’s highs in the immediate aftermath.
US Treasury yields rose following the Supreme Court’s ruling. The yield on benchmark US 10-year notes added 1.9 basis points to 4.094pc, from 4.075pc late on Thursday.

The SPI-based inflation has now increased for 29 consecutive weeks, underscoring persistent pressure on household budgets. The continued upward movement has largely been driven by a sharp rise in the prices of vegetables and other perishables, as well as higher electricity and petrol rates. On a week-on-week basis, the SPI edged up by 1.16pc from the previous week, official data showed on Friday.
The increase was attributed mainly to stronger demand for essential food items during the month of Ramazan, which traditionally leads to higher consumption and short-term price pressures. 
The latest figures suggest that food and energy remain the principal contributors to inflationary trends, with perishable goods particularly sensitive to supply constraints and seasonal demand patterns.

SPI rises 5.19pc year-on-year, driven by higher food and energy prices

An extraordinary surge in the retail prices of sugar and meat has also played a decisive role in reversing the easing trend witnessed in recent weeks. Meat prices, in particular, have been climbing steadily, adding further strain on household budgets already under pressure from elevated food and energy costs.
Weekly inflation had earlier reached a historic high of 48.35 per cent YoY in early May 2023. It subsequently moderated in the following years. The latest movement in sugar, edible oil, pulses, and meat prices suggests that volatility in essential food commodities continues to shape short-term inflation trends, with consumers facing recurring cycles of price spikes.
The items, whose prices increased the most over the previous week included bananas (16.05pc), electricity charges for Q1 (15.41pc), garlic (5.86pc), chicken (5.49pc), onions (3.83pc), tomatoes (3.82pc), diesel (2.69pc), petrol (1.93pc), beef (1.03pc), LPG (0.75pc), mutton (0.69pc) and long cloth (0.28pc).
The items whose prices saw a decline week-on-week included eggs (11.78pc), potatoes (2.24pc), wheat flour (2.02pc), pulse masoor (1.47pc), sugar (0.96pc), vegetable ghee 2.5Kg (0.72pc), pulse gram (0.58pc), cooking oil 5 litre (0.19pc), gur (0.16pc), vegetable ghee 1kg (0.11pc), rice IRRI-6/9 (0.08pc) and mustard oil (0.07pc).
However, on an annual basis, the items whose prices increased the most tomatoes (85.20pc), wheat flour (31.33pc), gas charges for Q1 (29.85pc), electricity charges for Q1 (17.33pc), bananas (15.83pc), chilies powder (15.20pc), beef (13.28pc), LPG (12.22pc), firewood (11.40pc), powdered milk (9.89pc), shirting (9.11pc), mutton (8.77pc) and gur (8.63pc).
In contrast, the prices of potatoes dropped 45.43pc, followed by garlic (27.51pc), pulse gram (23.30pc), chicken (19.36pc), onions (18.10pc), Lipton tea (13.95pc), salt powder (12.52pc), pulse masoor (12.33pc), eggs (8.54pc), pulse mash (5.08pc), mustard oil (2.13pc), sugar (1.43pc) and pulse moong (1.40pc).
The index, comprising 51 items collected from 50 markets in 17 cities, is computed weekly to assess the prices of essential commodities and services at shorter intervals. Data showed that the prices of 17 items increased, 12 decreased, and 22 remained stable compared to the previous week.

The session, which began 45 minutes late under the chairmanship of Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, started with the recitation of the Holy Quran.
The resolution was moved by JUI-F MPA Asghar Ali Tareen, who stated that although Balochistan was Pakistan’s largest province by area and rich in natural resources, it remained underdeveloped and beset by numerous challenges. He argued that meaningful representation was essential to addressing the province’s problems.
The resolution recommended that the provincial government approach the Centre to ensure practical steps were taken to increase the number of seats in the Balochistan Assembly from 65 to 85, and in the National Assembly from 20 to 28. The move, the resolution stated, wou­ld help reduce public anxiety and feelings of marginalisation in the province.

Provincial assembly unanimously adopts resolution for greater share in legislatures keeping vast geography in view

Vast geography
Speaking on the resolution, Mr Tareen pointed out that a single National Assembly constituency in Balochistan was geographically equivalent to an entire district in Punjab. He added that Rakhshan Division’s National Assembly constituency in the province covered an area comparable to the whole of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He noted that legislation to increase Balochistan’s representation was previously considered for inclusion in the 27th Constitutional Amendment but was not ultimately incorporated. He added that since the PPP and the PML-N were coalition partners in both the province and at the federal level, it was an opportune time to amend the Constitution to enhance Balochistan’s representation.
Provincial Planning and Development Minister Mir Zahoor Buledi said Balochistan had not received the attention it deserved in the past.
He suggested that, instead of a marginal increase, the number of National Assembly seats should be expanded by more than 40 overall.
Opposition Leader in the House Mir Younis Aziz Zehri supported the resolution, calling it vital for the province’s interests. He stressed that beyond passing the resolution, practical implementation was necessary. He also criticised past census results, claiming that Balochistan’s population had been undercounted, and remarked that out of 362 National Assembly seats, the province’s share was negligible.
Provincial Irrigation Minister Mir Muhammad Sadiq Umrani highlighted that an area in Nasirabad with a population of 600,000 lacked representation in the NA.
He urged the Balochistan Assembly speaker to form a committee to present the province’s case before the federal government with solid arguments.
Members from the National Party, ANP and other political parties also backed the resolution.
A proposal was also made to form a parliamentary committee under the leadership of the chief minister to engage with the federal government on the issue.
With broad cross-party support, the House unanimously approved the resolution, marking a significant step in renewed efforts to enhance Balochistan’s political representation at both provincial and national levels.

• Offers cooperation on critical minerals
• Premier meets regional leaders, IDFC chief
WASHINGTON: Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a two-day visit to Washington on Friday, securing a US pledge to cooperate on crit­ical minerals and energy after aligning his country with a US President Donald Trump-led Gaza peace initiative and praising his role in defusing a regional crisis last year.
PM Shehbaz met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday to discuss shifting the bilateral rela­tionship toward economic inv­es­tment while maintaining a partnership in counterterrorism, acco­rding to a State Depart­ment statement.
In their meeting, Rubio thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for its role as a founding member of the “Board of Peace”, which held its inaugural session on Thursday.
The State Department said Rubio also offered condolences for recent terror attacks in Pakistan and “reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counterterrorism”.
The ‘meaningful’ discussions cov­ered Pakistan’s recent participation in the Critical Minerals Min­­isterial in Washington, with the US welcoming Islamabad’s eng­a­gement and discussing commercial opportunities for Ameri­can companies in the country’s energy and mineral resources.
According to the Press Information Department of Pakistan, both sides reaffirmed the importance of Pakistan-US strategic ties and expressed satisfaction with the partnership’s progress under President Trump.
They agreed to boost trade, expand economic cooperation and strengthen counterterrorism efforts, while emphasising the need for continued high-level engagement to advance shared goals.

‘A saviour of South Asia’
PM Shehbaz also credited Trump with de-escalating a four-day military crisis between Pakistan and India in May. He called the president “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”, whose intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people”.
Speaking at the summit, Trump recounted his actions during that conflict, saying he warned both countries that the US would halt trade negotiations and could impose steep tariffs.
“I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” Trump said, adding that the economic threat helped achieve a de-escalation.
A notable moment at the summit came when Trump devoted nearly four minutes of his address to praising Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership for their “constructive and responsible role for regional peace and stability”, referencing his meeting with PM Shehbaz and the Chief of Defence Forces, Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots.
Meeting with regional leaders
According to Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz also held informal meetings with several leaders in Washington for the Board of Peace session, including the king of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, and the presidents of Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Indonesia.
It described Pakistan’s participation in the board as part of its broader effort to support peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives and “global peace”.
Separately, APP reported that PM Shehbaz met the chief executive of the US International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), Benjamin Black, on Friday. The premier praised the portfolio of more than $1bn and urged closer business-to-business engagement, while Black outlined the agency’s project pipeline and signalled interest in expanding the IDFC footprint in Pakistan.
Officials played down expectations of major agreements, suggesting the visit was aimed more at setting a direction than producing headline deals.
