The officials said the deceased also included the bride and the groom.
According to Pak­is­tan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) spokesperson Dr Aneeza Jalil, six bodies and 11 injured people were brought to the hospital, where the injured were being provided medical treatment.
She told Dawn that an emergency was imposed in Pims after the incident on the directives of Executive Director (ED) Dr Rana Imran Sikander.
One of the injured was being treated at the hospital’s burns centre as he had sustained 20 per cent burn injuries, she said.
Dr Aneeza later told Dawn that nine of the 11 injured had been discharged, and among the two at the hospital, the condition of one was “unstable”.
The victim would have to undergo surgery, she added.
Meanwhile, Islamabad Additional Deputy Commissioner (General) Sahibzada Yusuf reached the site of the incident after the explosion on the directives of Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon.
He said while speaking to the media that at least four houses had been damaged by the explosion and confirmed that the deceased included the bride and the groom.
Moreover, he told media persons that apart from the bodies and injured taken to Pims, two other bodies and an injured person were taken to the Capital Hospital.
The explosion occurred at a wedding venue, where guests were also present, he said, adding that all those trapped had been rescued from the rubble by means of “advanced technology”.
The rescue team was conducting further checks using specialised equipment, ADC Yusuf said, further stating that an inquiry had been ordered to determine the exact cause of the explosion. However, he added, the incident seemed to be that of a cylinder explosion.
Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa also spoke to the media and said the explosion appeared to be a result of a gas leak.
“So far, we have concluded that this explosion occurred due to a gas leakage,” he said. “Nonetheless, we will carry out an independent probe into it. We‘ve received instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office to launch a proper inquiry and find out the reasons as to why this incident happened.”
When asked about compensating the victims’ families, Randhawa said, “It’s not possible that there would be any delay in compensating them. However, the verification process may take four to five days.”
He added that one of the houses had been completely destroyed in the explosion, and arrangements had been made for the dead bodies to be brought to a ground near the site of the incident. They would then be taken to a graveyard, he said.
Hanif Masih, the father of the deceased groom, said while speaking to the media that his son’s wedding was held on Saturday, and they had reached home the night before.
“At the time of the incident (explosion), I was present at home but sleeping in a separate room adjacent to the house. I woke up after hearing a loud explosion and rushed to the place of the incident, but by that time everything had already been destroyed,” he said.
He said apart from his son and daughter-in-law, his sister-in-law was also among the deceased, and his daughter and other family members were admitted to the hospital.
Masih excused himself from speaking any further, saying that he was overcome with grief.
A statement issued by the Senate Secretariat said that Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani had expressed grief over the incident that took place “during a wedding”.
He expressed sorrow over the loss of lives and extended condolences to the families of the deceased.
“This is a heart-wrenching incident that turned celebrations into mourning for a family,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that he expressed concern over gas cylinder explosions.
“Such incidents demand that relevant departments fulfil their responsibilities seriously and ensure safety measures,” he said, stressing the need for an effective strategy to curb the “unsafe use of gas cylinders”. In this connection, he called for ensuring compliance with laws and educating the public about safety measures.
PM Shehbaz expresses grief, orders probe
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief over the loss of precious lives, prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and expressed condolences to the bereaved families.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), PM Shehbaz directed the federal minister for Health, the secretary of health, and the administration of Pims to remain on high alert and ensure that quality medical facilities were provided to the injured until their recovery.
He also directed the secretary Interior to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter and submit a detailed report to determine the causes of the incident and assign responsibility.</p><small>2026-01-12 03:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/120808384ef5a73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966436/istehkam-pakistan-party-demands-16-smaller-provinces-in-place-of-4' target='_blank'><strong>Istehkam Pakistan Party demands 16 smaller provinces in place of 4</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: President of the Istehkam Pakistan Party (IPP) and Federal Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan has urged political parties to show magnanimity and accept the need for smaller provinces to facilitate the people at their doorsteps.
Speaking at a party workers’ convention at Kamoke, around 50km from Lahore, he said that the IPP has launched a movement for creation of smaller provinces as an immediate and sustainable solution to problems of people living in far-flung areas.
“We will not change the names of provinces; new provinces should be created like in Punjab as North, South, West, and East Punjab. For this purpose, political parties must rise above narrow-mindedness and show magnanimity as it is in everyone’s own interest,” he said.

 

Welcoming support from MQM and other political parties for the proposal of new provinces, he said this would save people’s time and energy and allow their issues to be resolved closer to their doorstep.

Parties must show magnanimity to back the proposal: Aleem

He said that not only Punjab, but Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should also be divided into four provinces each with a new name.
The IPP leader announced linking cities of Kamoke and Gujranwala with the Lahore-Sialkot-Kharian Motorway which will provide these cities access to Islamabad via the Motorway network.
He also announced widening of this Motorway from four to six lanes which will benefit Gujranwala division in general and Kamoke city in particular.
The minister said that the prime minister would be invited to Kamoke and Gujranwala to inaugurate the link Motorway. He said the communications department has carried out important development works in Kamoke, including U-turns and that further projects will be added in future.
He demanded fixing of the minimum price of wheat for farmers at Rs4,000 per maund. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should take personal interest in reducing tax rates for the business community so that wheels of industry can move faster.
He said the youth are our future and providing them with dignified employment is our national responsibility.
If all-round development takes place, jobs will be created for the youth through the private sector for which business activities must be accelerated.
The minister also praised the leadership of the Pakistan armed forces for humbling the enemy and earning global respect for the country.

The significant delay in utilising the loan is mainly due to the failure of the Tranche III road project to begin, resulting from controversies in the bidding process discussed in five parliamentary standing committee meetings.
Without immediate acc­ele­ration by the National Highway Authority (NHA), the funds will expire without the completion of the Tranche-III road project, which involves widening sections of the N55 Highway.
In a letter seen by Dawn, the ADB warned the economic affairs division that based on current progress, there was a significant risk the approved $360m under the Multi-tranche Finan­cing Facility (MFF) would not be fully utilised by the expiration date of Dec 31, 2027.
The project has been stalled for eight months following controversies surrounding the bidding process.
Although bids were opened in February 2025 and approved by the ADB shortly thereafter, the process faced scrutiny from five parliamentary panels and Public Procurement Regulatory Authority.
Despite the administrative hurdles, the Islamabad High Court recently ordered that work be awarded without further delay. The court noted that continued stalling could result in loan cancellation, cost escalation and “serious reputational damage” to the national exchequer.
The total of the project cost is estimated at Rs170bn, which includes land acquisition, consultancy and taxes while the lowest bid received by the NHA for the project was of Rs147 billion.
The ADB covers Rs108bn of the total, with the government of Pakistan funding the remaining balance.
Officials indicate the NHA is in a difficult position regarding fund utilisation. Rebidding is considered unfeasible, as obtaining new approvals from the ADB and Ecnec would take more time, while the ADB stressed that its 2027 deadline is “firm, with no possibility of extension”.
“We seek EAD’s support in assisting NHA to expedite implementation, complete pending procurements, and ensure full utilisation of the loan proceeds within the MFF period,” the ADB stated.
The Ecnec has approved the bids from a joint venture comprising NXCC, Dynamic Constructor and Rustam Associates even though parliamentary committees and the PPRA expressed concerns.
The NHA defended the choice, stating that allegations of non-performance against the lead partner “did not reach finality in accordance with the procedure and rules”, and the firm was never blacklisted by any agency.
The ADB confirmed it has no objection to awarding the contracts to the lowest evaluated bidder across four specific lots:
Lot 1: Rajanpur to Jam­pur (57.5km) for Rs23.5bn; Lot 2: Jampur to Dera Gh­azi Khan (64km) for Rs29.1bn; Lot 3: Dera Ghazi Khan to Tibi Qaisrani (111.7km) for Rs52bn; Lot 4: Tibi Qaisrani to Dera Ismail Khan (96.2km) for Rs42bn.
IHC rejected PPRA’s petition on the Rs172bn Carec Tranch-III award to JV. In its verdict, the court warned that the regulator’s recent decisions “may also lead to the refusal of the finance facility agreed by the ADB,” and declared the petitions infructuous.

PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident.
The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted.
At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage.
The authorities had provided the video clips and the pictures of CM Afridi, former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, and two other PTI leaders, Irfan Saleem and Amir Khan Chamkani, for analysis. None of them had been nominated in the case.
In the report, the PFSA gave its opinion on two points: whether the videos in the USB were genuine and whether the persons whose profile pictures had been shared appeared in the clips. It said the five individuals, including the CM, were seen in the clips, but did not clarify if the videos were related to the Radio Pakistan attack or any other event.
It, however, said the clips were not edited except for the merger of multiple video clips of different camera views.
A legal expert, privy to the case, said the investigating officer, after this ‘evidence’ could nominate more accused through a supplementary report to the ATC. However, the court can also take cognisance of the matter. Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report.
‘Unrelated clips’
Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.
PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned.
The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial.
The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023.
‘Irrefutable evidence’
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report.
Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.

The opposition leader issue is expected to resurface after PTI’s Omar Ayub withdrew his petitions in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal.
Before the petition was withdrawn, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said he couldn’t begin the appointment process as the issue was sub judice.

 

With the summoning of the assembly, Speaker Sadiq is expected to ask the opposition to follow the process for appointing a new leader.
The opposition has repe­atedly accused the government of delaying the appo­intment process and nominated Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Achakzai as the opposition leader.
Rule 39 of the “Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007” confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.
However, the opposition has already submitted the name of Achakzai to the speaker’s office rather than presenting it to the speaker personally.
The rule also states the speaker must verify the signatures of all opposition members voting in favour of the candidate.
Rule 39, titled “Decla­ration of Leader of the Opposition,” states that after each general election — and at any time thereafter — the National Assembly speaker must declare the opposition leader as soon as possible following the election of the prime minister.

• Seeks tariff overhaul to lift exports beyond $60bn in three years
• Highlights cross-cutting barriers across 20 export products
• Notes ‘policy unpredictability’ undermines investor, buyer confidence               
ISLAMABAD: A body constituted by the prime minister and led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal has called for urgent reforms to improve the ease of doing business and for a serious restructuring and rationalisation of tariffs — both energy prices and trade duties — to more than double exports to over $60 billion within three years.
The committee was formed to devise a strategy for avoiding another IMF programme once the current $8.4bn arrangement expires at the end of 2027, amid mounting pressure from persistently weak economic indicators.
According to synopses compiled after week-long consultations with public and private sector stakeholders from Jan 5 to 9, the panel concluded that the current state of affairs was not capable of driving a fast-growing population of 250 million towards sustained prosperity because of cross-cutting constra­ints affecting “all 20 priority export products and six export drivers”.
Ironically, most of these constraints are generally well known, but the government’s inability, despite special interventions here and there, including through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), to create a conducive working environment in a fair, equitable, rule-based and transparent manner, has hampered sustainable growth path beyond stabilisation under a restrictive programme volunteered to the IMF.
The plan proposed easing electricity and gas prices through debt refinancing and rationalising price build-ups. It was found that “export competitiveness is undermined by high and volatile energy costs, with electricity and gas tariffs remaining above regional benchmarks and subject to frequent changes”.
It warned that volatility was inflating production costs across manufacturing, agro-processing, minerals, fisheries, and services, eroding margins and diverting orders to competing countries.
The Planning Commission also pointed out that the cost of doing business in Pakistan remained “structurally high due to fragmented and distortionary taxation, inverted input tariffs, advance income tax deductions, delayed sales tax refunds and persistent working capital lockups”.
It said these issues disproportionately affected exporters and were particularly binding for small and medium enterprises across manufacturing and agri-based value chains.
The panel said that policy unpredictability was also weakening investment and buyer confidence. “Frequent changes in tax policy, energy pricing, tariff structures, export incentives and regulatory regimes, often announced late in the business cycle, constrain forward planning, capacity expansion and scaling, particularly around annual export order booking cycles,” it said.
The synopses also highlighted institutional fragmentation and regulatory burdens. They said inconsistent definitions of SMEs across the State Bank of Pakistan, SMEDA, the Federal Board of Revenue and provincial authorities restricted access to finance, incentives and support schemes. Overlapping mandates, discretionary enforcement, excessive audits and weak inter-agency coordination increased compliance costs and uncertainty, the panel said.
Moreover, exporters also faced weak domestic quality, testing and compliance infrastructure, increasing reliance on overseas laboratories for certification and testing, it said, adding: “This raises costs, lengthens lead times and elevates rejection risks in regulated export markets, constraining movement into higher value products and destinations.”
Limited access to affordable finance was also highlighted as a constraint on upgrading and value addition. The panel said export credit, insurance, guarantees, and long-term financing instruments remained underdeveloped, while high interest rates, collateral requirements, and liquidity constraints curtailed SME investment in technology, compliance, and scaling.
The committee also questioned the implementation of export facilitation and input schemes, including the Export Facilitation Scheme, saying procedural delays, higher input costs and working-capital pressures were limiting effective sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs.
In addition, it cited logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, including high inland freight costs, underutilised rail, port congestion, slow customs clearance, inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and weak courier and postal systems for SMEs.
It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty. It also pointed to skills gaps, low value addition and weak branding as barriers to moving into higher-value segments.
Based on consultations, the Planning Commission is now collecting additional information through a private-sector survey to refine inputs and develop a data-driven, sector-specific technical roadmap to enhance exports under the Uraan Pakistan strategic plan.
“Pakistan’s development, economic sovereignty and even national security now hinge on one thing: how fast we can grow our exports and move to an export-led growth model,” Mr Iqbal said at the conclusion of the consultations.
He added that “the only way to break free from foreign crutches and avoid the next IMF programme is to rapidly increase our exports and build strong foreign exchange reserves”.
The 20 products covered during these engagements included copper, gems and jewellery, software and IT services, fish and fish preparations, rice, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat preparations, guar gum and its products, handicrafts, textile and apparel, sports goods, leather and leather products, surgical instruments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cement, carpets and rugs, engineering goods, footwear, plastic material and cutlery.
Pakistan currently exports about $30-35bn worth of goods, against Planning Commission estimates of an untapped annual potential of over $60bn.
The findings and recommendations will be consolidated into product-wise diagnostics and a targeted facilitation framework for submission to the prime minister. Their implementation would be subject to clearance under the tight requirements of the IMF conditions.

The 37-year-old batting maestro, who had scored 376 in his last four ODI innings, anchored India’s chase of 301 with a sublime knock of 93 featuring eight boundaries and a six, but he was dismissed by Kyle Jamieson when a landmark century was within reach.
The Vadodara crowd’s disappointment was palpable as their hero departed, but they rose to applaud Kohli, who achieved another milestone by becoming the second-highest run scorer in international cricket across all formats.
With his 77th ODI fifty, Kohli moved on to 28,068 runs and surpassed Sri Lankan great Kumar Sangakkara (28,016) to sit behind only Indian icon Sachin Tendulkar’s 34,357.
“If I look back at my whole journey, it’s nothing short of a dream come true for me,” Kohli said on moving one step closer to his mentor Tendulkar.
“I’ve always known my abilities, how much ability I had when I came in, and I had to work for a lot more to get to the place I am today. God has blessed me with way too much for me to complain about anything.
“I always look back at my whole journey with a lot of grace, a lot of gratitude in my heart, and I feel proud about it.”

NZ openers frustrate India
Earlier, India won the toss and elected to field, factoring in dew conditions for the second innings, but New Zealand’s openers Devon Conway (56) and Henry Nicholls (62) frustrated the hosts with a commanding 117-run opening stand.
Harshit Rana provided the breakthrough, striking twice in consecutive overs to dismiss both openers and apply the brakes on New Zealand’s scoring rate.
The middle order failed to capitalise on promising starts, with only Daryl Mitchell making a significant contribution, while skipper Michael Bracewell was run out from a direct hit by Shreyas Iyer.
Mitchell blazed his way to 84 with five boundaries and three sixes before being trapped leg-before to Prasidh Krishna while attempting another big shot. Kristian Clarke’s unbeaten 24 helped New Zealand add 50 runs in the final five overs to reach 300.
Kohli and Gill build parnership
India’s chase got off to a rocky start when opener Rohit Sharma fell for 26, but Kohli and captain Shubman Gill steadied the ship with a crucial 118-run partnership.
“I’m not thinking about the milestones at all. If we were batting first today, I would have probably gone harder. Even with the chase, because there was a total on the board, I had to kind of buckle down and play the situation,” Kohli added.
Gill contributed a patient 56 but fell shortly after receiving treatment on his back before Jamieson (4-41) then turned the match on its head with a devastating spell.He removed Ravindra Jadeja in the same over as Kohli before clean-bowling Iyer for 49, his off stump knocked out of the ground as India slumped to 242-5.
Enter Rana, who counter-attacked brilliantly and was fortunate to survive a dropped catch at long-on when on 12. He made New Zealand pay, scoring 29 before being caught behind, keeping India in the hunt.
With pressure mounting and India needing to maintain a run-a-ball rate, KL Rahul held his nerve to guide the hosts home with an unbeaten 29, sealing victory with two fours and a six in the penultimate over.
The victory gives India a 1-0 lead in the series ahead of the second game in Rajkot on Wednesday.</p><small>2026-01-11 21:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11232450688edee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966345/cm-afridi-briefly-addresses-crowd-near-mazar-i-quaid-pti-claims-hurdles-shelling-at-workers' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi briefly addresses crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid; PTI claims hurdles, shelling at workers</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday briefly addressed hundreds gathered near Mazar-i-Quaid for the party’s rally, while the PTI claimed it faced hurdles in reaching the venue and its supporters were met with shelling by the police.
The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue, saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid.
During the day, PTI supporters gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the police employed shelling. Disturbances were also reported near Numaish Chowrangi as police dispersed crowds, while media vehicles were also vandalised.
“I am deeply grateful to all Pakistanis and the people of Sindh for honouring us with enormous respect and esteem,” CM Afridi said while addressing a huge crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid late on Sunday night.







“We can never forget the respect we received from the people of Sindh. But you all must not forgive the Sindh government for the disrespect they have shown towards the Sindhi cap and Ajrak,” the PTI leader added.
“We will not allow anyone to steal our mandate, to snatch our rights, or to further keep our leader Imran Khan sahib in prison wrongfully,” Afridi said.
The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here.
“They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa, then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added.
“You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism. Whenever my leader issues a call, we will act as per his wishes,” the PTI leader said.
Afridi reiterated his claims of the Sindh government “leaving us stranded on deserted roads in the dark of the night” while returning from Hyderabad to Karachi.
However, a provincial minister refuted the claims, saying that a police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”.

 

“Shelling was also done at our sisters, children, workers here […] all routes were blocked, police baton-charged [supporters],” CM Afridi claimed in his brief address.
The chief minister further alleged that “they (authorities) also damaged the media’s vehicles”.
Afridi said the Sindh government “repeated” what its Punjab counterpart had done when he visited Lahore last month, calling both governments “fake”.
The gathering was a part of the KP CM’s four-day visit to Sindh, who is leading his party’s street mobilisation movement.
“God willing, our next stop will be Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and we will continue the same momentum in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” CM Afridi announced.
The KP CM also raised slogans of “every chowk is D-Chowk”.



‘Delays due to obstructions, public welcomes’
Earlier at 7:44pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said CM Afridi’s convoy was facing delays “due to obstructions at various places, and the public’s affection, welcomes and responses at numerous places”.
At around 9pm, Sheikh said the KP CM would reach the venue in five minutes, and lashed out at the Sindh police and government for their actions. At around 10:30pm, he shared footage of the caravan at Numaish Chowrangi, where Afridi also addressed the crowd.







The PTI also shared visuals of the welcome accorded to the party caravan by their supporters in Baldia Town and Ittehad Town‘s Khyber Chowk.







At around 6:40pm, the PTI said the Sindh police had “attempted to prevent” CM Afridi’s convoy from moving forward, but the party leaders “had the path reopened with the help of party workers”.
The video showed party leaders, including Shafiullah Jan, speaking to the police before the convoy’s vehicles were allowed to move ahead.







The PTI also shared videos of hundreds gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah by the evening, with supporters chanting “Jiye Imran” and “Tera yaar, mera yaar, Qaidi No. 804”.







In a video recorded while on his way to the venue, Afridi said his convoy would reach Mazar-i-Quaid after going through Baldia Town, Keamari, Banaras Chowk, Golimar and Gurumandir so PTI supporters could join the caravan.
Former MNA Faheem Khan said, “Ten of our vehicles were intercepted. But no worries; I am reaching the rally venue with another vehicle equipped with a sound system.”







In a statement on X, the PTI hailed the public for its “historic display of public power and expression of love for Imran Khan”.
“Despite all the fascism, violence, arrests and obstructions by the Sindh government through its police, thousands of people have gathered inside and around Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah and on the surrounding streets at the moment,” it said.
“This is the scene that serves as a clear message to those with fascist mindsets that public power cannot be stopped by walls and batons,” the PTI asserted.
“This gathering is a renewal of the pledge that we are ready to give every sacrifice for Imran Khan, Pakistan, true freedom, supremacy of the Constitution and law, independence of the judiciary, and our basic rights.”







Shelling, roadblocks at venue: PTI
Shortly after 4pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared a video on X wherein a woman said police have resorted to shelling at party supporters at “Mazar-i-Quaid’s garden”.







Video footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed multiple police vans at Bagh-i-Jinnah and cops employing shelling, with people gathered there retaliating by pelting stones.



Pictures from Numaish Chowrangi showed cops with batons detaining multiple individuals as PTI supporters gathered to make their way to Bagh-i-Jinnah.

A video shared with Dawn showed dozens gathered at an unknown location, with people pushing aside containers that had been placed to block a route.

The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — an ally of the PTI under an opposition alliance — also said its leader Allama Sadiq Jafri and others had reached “Jinnah Ground”, possibly referring to Bagh-i-Jinnah.







PTI spokesperson Mohammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn that police had blocked roads and were not allowing party workers to enter Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the government had previously allowed the party to hold the rally.
He reiterated his allegation that police had blocked roads in various areas and were preventing PTI workers from reaching the new venue of Mazar-i-Quaid’s VIP gate as well.
Bozdar said CM Afridi would pay his respects at the mausoleum and later on, he would address party workers from a truck, the arrangements for which had been completed.
‘Attack’ on mediapersons
Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of an “attack“ on Aaj News’ vehicle near Gurumandir Chowrangi.
He also directed the East district senior superintendent of police (SSP) to immediately provide details on “police action”.
“Miscreant elements will be dealt with firmly. We will not let anyone sabotage law and order,” Lanjar asserted.
The minister said the perpetrators would be arrested by tracing them using the modern monitoring system.

In a statement, PTI’s Bozdar also condemned the attack on mediapersons and said action should be taken if someone had “attacked the media”.
“The PTI’s workers are peaceful. No one is allowed to take the law into their hands,” he stated. “The media is the public’s voice; attacks on media will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he added.
The board members of Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the “attack of a charged crowd on media; violence against journalists, cameramen and staff; and damage caused to DSNGs”.
“How can this group declare themselves pro-democratic after attacking the media?” said a joint statement by KUJ President Ejaz Ahmad and others.
“What message did they try to convey by targeting the media?”
The KUJ demanded that the Sindh government trace the perpetrators through CCTV footage and bring them to justice.
The Crime Reporters Association (CRA) also strongly condemned the vandalism incidents, adding that there was a “clash between political workers and police” during coverage at Bagh-i-Jinnah.
“Media representatives busy in fulfilling their duties got caught in the middle of this chaos and were targeted, while the vehicles (DSNGs) and equipment of many media houses were damaged,” the CRA stated.
Sindh government spokesperson Sadia Javed, in a statement, said there were “attacks on multiple news channels’ vehicles and pelting”. The vehicles of GNN and Aaj News were among those damaged, while a worker of Channel 5 was reportedly assaulted.
In his statement, PPP Karachi General Secretary Rauf Ahmed Nagori alleged that PTI workers “vandalised citizen vehicles during their protest”.
PTI changes rally venue
The PTI had initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N.
But the party blamed the Sindh administration for “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum.

In a video statement, Sheikh criticised the Sindh government for allegedly blocking the rally. He recalled that Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had welcomed the KP CM at the Karachi airport and presented a Sindh cap and Ajrak to him.
“Was that a pretence?” he questioned, slamming the Sindh government for its “shamelessness”.
On the party’s decision to hold a gathering outside one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid, he said, “Holding a rally at a public gate does not block any route.”
Sheikh alleged the NOC for the rally had been deliberately delayed, further questioning that when the Sindh government had granted permission for the rally, “why was our vendor beaten and made to flee?”
He decried that the PPP was no longer late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s party.







“Police brutality and blocking of roads cannot dampen the morale of the people,” PTI Karachi President Raja Azhar said in a statement, adding that the rally would prove to be the “public’s referendum against cruelty”.
Similarly, party member Faheem Khan urged people to participate in the rally and termed the alleged blocking of roads “an attack on the rights of the people”.
Late on Saturday, Sheikh said that while the PTI had announced Mazar-i-Quaid as the venue as the NOC had not been issued by then, the party had again decided to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah after getting the permission.







PTI alleges arrests at Bagh-i-Jinnah
Separately, the PTI alleged that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, subjected its workers to violence and also arrested several of them.
Party spokesperson Bozdar, while speaking to Dawn, alleged that when workers reached Bagh-i-Jinnah around 2am on Sunday for rally arrangements and preparations, around 15 to 20 police mobiles reached the spot and law enforcement personnel resorted to baton-charge. They detained over a dozen PTI workers, he claimed.
At around 2:30am, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm.
“The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they can’t decide what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, the chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated.
But the Sindh home minister warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” Lanjar said in a statement.
In one of her posts at around 4:30am, Siddiqui said that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers.







In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers, and their belongings had been confiscated.







Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“.







In other posts, he decried the alleged police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence.







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media at Karachi Press Club today, decried the “barbarity” that PTI members had been subjected to.
“Cars were smashed, and two dozen members have been detained unlawfully. A lawyer of ours was detained this morning at Bagh-i-Jinnah. It is cordoned off by police right now,” he said, adding that the PTI had the NOC for the rally.
“So the rally will happen,” he asserted.
In response to a Dawn query, police sources denied detaining any PTI workers this morning and said they just removed them from Mazar-i-Quaid. The sources said police took action to disperse the party workers, alleging that they had blocked a main road.
The sources also said that while there would be no restriction on the movement of KP CM Afridi, PTI workers would not be allowed at Mazar-i-Quaid.
KP CM claims routes blocked from Hyderabad to Karachi
Earlier on Sunday, CM Afridi claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“.
“The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team members,” he said, warning that the precedent of such treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”.
“Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said.







However, Hyderabad SSP Adeel Chandio told Dawn that “no obstruction was created in the convoy and rally of KP CM in Hyderabad until he left the city”. “And he left the city safely,” he added.
Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad.
“They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.”
He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”.







Raja also posted on X that he had reached Karachi from Hyderabad after “seven hours, driving through jungles in the CM KPK’s vehicle”.
“Motorway closed. The fascist state lost its nerve after seeing the massive response of the people, given two days of freedom and human dignity,” he said.







PTI not abiding by assurances, claims Sharjeel Inam
From the Sindh government, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon maintained that his provincial government had warmly welcomed Afridi and provided him with complete security.
“The post of chief minister is a constitutional post and constitutional posts have been fully respected,” he said in a statement, maintaining that the PTI was in constant touch with the Sindh government.
He then accused the opposition party of “not abiding by the assurances” it had given, but did not specify any guarantees.
“It was clearly said on the very first day that they are allowed to hold a rally. It is inappropriate to make allegations against the Sindh government despite this,” he said, maintaining that no one had stopped the PTI from holding a rally in the ground.
However, the manner in which rallies and processions were being taken out on the roads was causing severe traffic disruption and common citizens were facing difficulties, he said.
“Karachi is a metropolitan city; traffic problems arise here even when a few hundred people gather,” he said. “We want the KP chief minister to complete his visit in a peaceful manner.”
He said that PTI workers should not take the law into their own hands and should follow the guidelines given by the government. The movement of common people should not be affected and violation of laws should be avoided, he added.
Memon said a security alert had also been issued regarding the rally, and a security plan had been devised.
“Unfortunately, the security plan is not being followed,” he claimed, further maintaining that complete security had been provided by Sindh police in connection with the rally.
“In view of security concerns, the instructions of the Sindh government should be followed, and only routes allocated by the government should be used,” he said.
Memon claimed that the route designated for the PTI in Hyderabad had not been followed and they took a route of their own choice.
“It is not correct to say that the convoy of the chief minister of KP was stopped on its return from Hyderabad,” he said. “The place where the convoy faced difficulty is the National Highway Authority bridge, where traffic congestions are frequent.”

His statements came after the PTI claimed its convoy was facing hurdles while on its way to Mazar-i-Quaid for a rally, and CM Afridi said he had to use risky routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad.
“I personally apologise if something [unpleasant] happened somewhere, as this should not happen,” Shah said during Geo News’ programme ‘Naya Pakistan’.
’’He is the chief minister of a province and whatever we did, the welcome and all, was in respect of the people of KP as he had their mandate,“ the PPP leader added.
Asked about the apparent change in the Sindh government’s attitude, Shah highlighted that the guests were “welcomed and taken care of”. He noted that the PTI sought permission to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah from the Sindh government “even though it falls under the federal government’s jurisdiction”.
He acknowledged that the PTI “adopted the proper procedure” to seek a no-objection certificate (NOC), which he said also caused delays. Then, the minister said, the issues arose when the NOC got delayed by about 1-1.5 hours, and the PTI announced that they would “hold the rally on a road”.
Shah added that the Sindh government had even offered the PTI to connect them to their vendors if the preparations were lacking.



The minister then pointed out CM Afridi’s “certain” statements, including one about President Asif Ali Zardari’s politics.
“There are no differences. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari sahib and President Asif Ali Zardari sahib are our PPP, the Sindh government. There is one stance,” he asserted.
Shah added that if President Zardari did not wish so, the PTI guests would not have been welcomed at the airport or facilitated. He said the PTI started making harsh statements, which also upset party members who noted the criticism despite offering them support.

 

Asked about the police action against PTI workers at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the early hours of Sunday, Shah said an inquiry was underway about what led to it.
He said the PTI was being urged to arrange the setup in the ground, but they were insistent on holding a gathering on the road.
On CM Afridi’s claims about his convoy being forced to take dangerous routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad, Shah said: “He had complete protocol, and as per the security threat issued, he was brought via the safest routes.
“Those were the safest routes, and police protection was with him,“ the PPP leader asserted.
“How could he have returned if there were pickets and if roads were blocked?” Shah asked rhetorically.
“As per the reports the administration has given, this protocol was adopted for their security and safety,“ the minister replied to a question about the police pickets set up.
On reports of shelling at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the day despite the NOC, Shah said, “Something unpleasant happened there.”
Criticising Zardari is our democratic right: Qaiser
Responding to Shah on the same show, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “We think that Sindh’s people and government respect democracy and […] they respect their opponents.”
He acknowledged that the PTI had differences with the PPP and concerns about it. “In our opinion, the illegitimate government in power right now is so because of their support,” he said.
“The legislation that they are doing. [Criticising it] is our stance. It is our democratic right to have whatever stance we want,” Qaiser stressed.
To a question raised by the host, Qaiser responded: “You and he (Shah) both understand what is happening from where. Will a democratic political party take instructions in this manner? Will we not have a say?”
Qaiser said the PTI respected the PPP, adding: “Even if you say that we criticised Zardari sahib, that is our democratic right.”



“Will this attitude continue? Is this democracy? […] Tell me, what unlawful [incident] has occurred over the past two days?“ Qaiser asked. He stressed the vendors needed two to three days to make arrangements at the venue, adding that there was “no lighting” at Bagh-i-Jinnah and that the Sindh government would be responsible for any unfortunate incident.
Responding to Qaiser, Shah pointed out the welcome accorded to CM Afridi on Friday, asking if it would have been given “if there were some instructions from somewhere”.
Shah also denied that the PPP “changed its strategy” because of the PML-N reportedly being criticised for its attitude towards the KP CM during his Lahore visit.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.</p><small>2026-01-11 20:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644543-passengers-appreciate-recently-launched-electric-bus-service-in-jhelum-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Passengers appreciate recently-launched electric bus service in Jhelum: minister</strong></a><br><p>

The officers would be deployed on Sunday and Monday to bolster the safety of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol officials already in Minnesota, Noem said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” programme.
Some 2,000 federal officers have already been dispatched to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever.
The new deployments were scheduled to begin even as more than 1,000 rallies were planned nationwide this weekend to protest the federal government’s deportation push and Wednesday’s fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an ICE officer.
Minnesota officials have called the shooting unjustified, pointing to bystander video they say showed Good’s vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired.
Noem and other US officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defence because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver’s side and told her to get out of the car.
In a separate Sunday appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Noem said other video footage showed Good protesting ICE agents at other locations earlier on Wednesday morning, but did not say if or when it would be publicly released.
Minnesota authorities on Friday said they were opening their own criminal investigation into the incident, after some state law enforcement officials said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state investigators.
White House Border Security Czar Tom Homan said on “Fox News Sunday” that he wanted to let the investigation play out, but that he “truly believe that officer thought his life was in danger to take that action.”</p><small>2026-01-11 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1123044908746a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966385/religious-ministry-organises-second-training-session-for-haj-2026-pilgrims' target='_blank'><strong>Religious ministry organises second training session for Haj 2026 pilgrims</strong></a><br><p>Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on Sunday organised the second phase of the training session for Haj 2026 pilgrims at the Haji Camp in Islamabad.
According to the ministry’s spokesperson, the primary objective of this programme was to “provide comprehensive awareness regarding the various stages of the pilgrimage, necessary precautionary measures, and the obligatory acts (Faraiz and Wajibat) of Haj and Umrah,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
During the session, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Umar Butt, briefed the participants on administrative matters, departure procedures, and accommodation in Makkah and Madinah.
Master Trainer Tanveer Asghar provided technical training on the methods of performing Haj and Umrah, highlighting the religious obligations.
The event was attended by the Director of Haji Complex Islamabad, Qazi Sami-ur-Rehman, Deputy Director Hakim Khan Khattak, and other senior officials.
“Pilgrims were advised to improve their physical fitness by walking two to three kilometres daily. Essential travel documents, including the original passport, computer national identity card (CNIC), flight ticket, visa copies, and vaccination cards (for meningitis, flu, and polio) must be kept ready,” the report said.
A strict warning was issued against carrying prohibited items such as narcotics, naswar, cigarettes, and unverified medicines, it added.
The ministry has made the Pak Haj App” mandatory for all pilgrims to access flight schedules, accommodation details, and group information.
Furthermore, the procedure for remote biometric verification via the “Saudi Visa Bio” app was explained in detail, the APP said.
For those arriving directly in Madinah, the stay will range from three to eight days before proceeding to Makkah.
In Makkah, approximately 250 buildings have been arranged for accommodation, with a 24-hour free shuttle bus service available to transport pilgrims to the Haram Sharif.
The session covered the pillars of Umrah (Ihram, Niyyat, Tawaf, Sa’i, and Halq/Qasr) and the three Faraiz (obligatory acts) of Haj: Ihram, Wuquf-e-Arafat, and Tawaf-e-Ziyarat. The Wajibat (essential acts), such as the stay at Muzdalifah, Ramy al-Jamarat (stoning the devil), Qurbani (sacrifice), and the Tawaf-i-Wida were also explained.
Due to expected extreme weather, pilgrims were instructed to use umbrellas, spray bottles, and ORS to prevent heatstroke.
In case of emergencies, they were advised to contact the Saudi helpline 937 for medical assistance and 911 for security matters.
The Ministry of Religious Affairs urged the pilgrims to maintain discipline, patience, and compassion throughout the sacred journey, the report said.
The session concluded with a detailed Q&A segment, where officials and trainers addressed specific concerns regarding administrative and travel arrangements, ensuring the pilgrims are fully prepared for their journey.
In July 2025, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistical measures for the pilgrimage season. The following month, the government started accepting Haj applications.
The Kingdom has allocated a total quota of 179,210 pilgrims for Pakistan — 119,210 under the government scheme and 60,000 for private operators, according to the ministry.

“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.
With the country’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if force is used on protesters.
Authorities intensify crackdown
The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices. Authorities accuse the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Iran’s police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront “rioters”.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching along a street at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd “has no end nor beginning,” a man is heard saying.
In footage from the northeastern city of Mashhad, smoke can be seen billowing into the night sky from fires in the street, masked protesters, and a road strewn with debris, another video posted on Saturday showed. Explosions could be heard.
Reuters verified the locations.
State TV aired footage of dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner’s office on Sunday, saying the dead were victims of events caused by “armed terrorists”.
Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any US intervention.
An Israeli military official said the protests were an internal Iranian matter, but Israel’s military was monitoring developments and was ready to respond “with power if need be”.
An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment.Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, which the United States briefly joined by attacking key nuclear installations.
Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar.
Iran denounces ‘rioters and terrorists’
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a TV interview, said Israel and the US were masterminding destabilisation and that Iran’s enemies had brought in “terrorists … who set mosques on fire …. attack banks, and public properties”.
“Families, I ask you: do not allow your young children to join rioters and terrorists who behead people and kill others,” he said, adding that the government was ready to listen to the people and to resolve economic problems.
Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple Iran’s ruling establishment.
“I think it is more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker,” he told Reuters, noting that Iran’s ruling elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition.
Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for security personnel killed in protests.
State TV said 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan and that six more were killed by “rioters” in Kermanshah in the west.
Us ready to help, says Trump
Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”
In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of US intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source present for the conversation.
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, said Trump had observed Iranians’ “indescribable bravery”. “Do not abandon the streets,” Pahlavi, who is based in the US, wrote on X.
Netanyahu, speaking during a cabinet meeting, said Israel was closely monitoring developments. “We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny,” he said.
Pakistan embassy in Tehran establishes crisis cell
The Pakistan embassy in Tehran has established a crisis management unit to facilitate its citizens, Pakistan’s envoy to Iran Mudassir Tipu said on X.

World number three Orfi was up against Malaysia’s Sivasangari Subramaniam, who she demolished 3-0 to take an expected victory with a scoreline of 11-8, 11-2, 11-7.
“The final is never an easy match,” the 18-year-old said after her 38-minute match that saw her win her fourth title of the season.
“Me and Siva have played several times this season, I know how dangerous she is; I just have to prepare in this sport very well.
“Thanks to the fans for supporting us, they’ve built the atmosphere and it made me happy to see the crowd here today cheering for both of us,” Orfi said.

Her compatriots stayed true to saving the best for last as Zakaria and Aly Abou Eleinen put on a show for the crowd in a dazzling 100-minute match.
The first game saw Eleinen prevail 11-9 after a series of minutes-long rallies that saw the two slipping on their own sweat.
Zakaria was trailing Eleinen 7-3 in the second game but finally found his rhythm and won 11-9 against his 26-year-old opponent, despite a break in play for a cut on his knee to be attended to by courtside medics.
Victory belonged to Zakaria in the third game as well – or so he thought. He had removed his protective eyewear and exited the court but Eleinen had already called for a player review that proved inconclusive. The two were neck-and-neck in the lengthy game that lasted 27 minutes before Eleinen switched gears and won 14-12 in a brutal, high-quality rally that delighted the crowd on Sunday evening.
Both players seemed tired by the time the fourth game rolled around, but Zakaria took the game 11-7 to level the score 2-2.
Eleinen was cramping up in the fifth game that saw Zakaria pull ahead, but not before hitting three costly errors. He nevertheless finished strong to seal his victory 11-7, not once, but twice. Another player review from Eleinen at the final point saw the referee shushing the crowd that cheered for Zakaria’s championship win.
The seconds ticked by, Zakaria had already dropped his racket and glasses to the floor and was waiting for a verdict when the referee upheld his decision that saw Zakaria win the biggest title of his career so far.
“I made it to the fifth game and I wasn’t tired, so I’m most impressed with my physical side this time because I’ve worked really hard on it,” Zakaria said after the match.
“I just won my first gold level event at 18 so I’m over the moon,” the ginger-haired teenager said to applause from the crowd.
“I grew up playing with Aly in Alexandria, so this was a proud moment for us to be playing a major final together,” Zakaria said.
Speaking to Dawn after the final, Eleinen echoed the same sentiment of Zakaria, “who I consider my younger brother.
“I’m eight years older but we grew up together and it’s amazing to see him doing so well,” Eleinen said of the teenager, who achieved his career-best ranking of 11 just last month.
“We always dreamed of playing major finals together, and today is hopefully a good step towards more battles that people can enjoy, and I’m sure people back home are proud of us.”</p><small>2026-01-11 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644518-72-students-leave-for-pakistan-amid-protests-in-iran-confirms-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>72 Pakistani students head home as protests rage in Iran, confirms envoy</strong></a><br><p>

On May 9, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
“The planning was carried out by the same elements involved in the violence, and their statements — including those of Murad Saeed — are on record,” she said.
Bokhari added that evidence related to the May 9 incidents had already been presented before the nation earlier, but the “PTI leadership, true to its past conduct, chose to deny facts and fabricate false narratives.”
“Lying is not merely a habit of PTI; it has become a chronic disease from which they appear unwilling and unable to recover,” she remarked.
The minister emphasised that the individuals who stormed Jinnah House and engaged in vandalism were not ordinary people, but official office bearers and ticket holders of PTI.“
Despite this, a persistent false narrative was promoted, branding the events as a so-called ‘false flag operation’, she said, noting that even the party’s founder had publicly stated that he would apologise if incontrovertible evidence emerged.
“Yet, despite evidence surfacing repeatedly, there has been no remorse or acceptance,” she said.
Bokhari further stated that the Punjab Forensic Science Laboratory was among Asia’s most credible forensic institutions and that the report —  which was dispatched on December 23 and  a copy of which is available with Dawn — included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence.
“It clearly documents the torching of Radio Pakistan, attacks on multiple toll plazas, and the burning of ambulances — all of which constitute grave criminal acts,” she said.
The PML-N stalwart categorically stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting, vandalism, and damage to state property will be brought to justice.
“The politics of abusing, intimidating, and blackmailing the state through lies will no longer be tolerated,” Bokhari concluded. “The law will take its own course.”</p><small>2026-01-11 15:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11195738a537845.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966380/india-proposes-requiring-smartphone-makers-to-share-source-code-with-govt-in-security-overhaul' target='_blank'><strong>India proposes requiring smartphone makers to share source code with govt in security overhaul</strong></a><br><p>India has proposed requiring smartphone makers to share source code with the government and make several software changes as part of a raft of security measures, prompting behind-the-scenes opposition from giants like Apple and Samsung.
The tech companies have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.
The plan is part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to boost the security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world’s second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.

 

IT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that “any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind”, adding it was “premature to read more into it”.
A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.
Ongoing tug of war over govt requirements
Apple, South Korea’s Samsung, Google, China’s Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian industry group that represents the firms, did not respond to requests for comment.
Indian government requirements have irked technology firms before.
Last month, it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security cameras over fears of Chinese spying.
Xiaomi and Samsung — whose phones use Google’s Android operating system — hold 19 and 15 per cent, respectively, of India’s market share and Apple 5pc, Counterpoint Research estimates.
Among the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code — the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.
The Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to “avoid malicious usage”.
“Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,” said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.
The security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.
Companies say source code review, analysis ‘not possible’
Smartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China’s request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and US law enforcement has also tried and failed to get it.
India’s proposals for “vulnerability analysis” and “source code review” would require smartphone makers to perform a “complete security assessment”, after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and analysis.
“This is not possible … due to secrecy and privacy,” MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters.
“Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.”

 

MAIT asked the ministry last week to drop the proposal, a source with direct knowledge said.
The Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones.
Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.
MAIT’s document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone’s battery and seeking government approval for software updates is “impractical” as they need to be issued promptly.
India also wants the phone’s logs — digital records of its system activity — to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.
“There is not enough room on device [sic] to store one-year log events,” MAIT said in the document.</p><small>2026-01-11 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644500-punjab-forensic-lab-confirms-kp-cm-pti-leaders-in-may-9-visuals' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab forensic lab confirms KP CM, PTI leaders in May 9 visuals</strong></a><br><p>

There have been no signs of Russian or Chinese ships or submarines around Greenland in recent years, the FT said, citing two senior Nordic diplomats with access to NATO intelligence briefings.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House and NATO did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
It is simply not true that the Chinese and Russians are there. I have seen the intelligence. There are no ships, no submarines, the FT quoted one senior diplomat as saying.
Another Nordic diplomat said claims that waters around Greenland were crawling with Russian and Chinese vessels were unfounded, adding that such activity was on the Russian side of the Arctic.Trump has repeatedly said Russian and Chinese vessels are operating near Greenland, a claim Denmark disputes. He has not provided evidence to support it.Trump said on Friday the US must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and mineral-rich territory.“The image that’s being painted of Russian and Chinese ships right inside the Nuuk fjord and massive Chinese investments being made is not correct,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said earlier this week.Vessel tracking data from MarineTraffic and LSEG show no Chinese or Russian ship presence near Greenland.Greenland’s assembly said late on Friday it would bring forward a meeting to discuss its response to US threats to take control of the island.Trump’s renewed push for Greenland, after US military intervention in Venezuela, worries many of the island’s 57,000 inhabitants, whose widely held goal is to eventually become an independent nation.</p><small>2026-01-11 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1113420245aebcf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966372/us-says-carried-out-large-scale-strikes-against-is-in-syria' target='_blank'><strong>US says carried out ‘large-scale’ strikes against IS in Syria</strong></a><br><p>US and allied forces carried out “large-scale” strikes against the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group in Syria on Saturday, the US military said, the latest response to an attack last month that killed three Americans.
US Central Command (Centcom), which oversees American military forces in the region, said multiple strikes “targeted ISIS throughout Syria,” using an acronym for the terrorist group.







Centcom’s post on X did not give specifics on where they took place.
Grainy aerial video accompanying the post showed several separate explosions, apparently in rural areas.
The strikes were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched “in direct response to the deadly ISIS attack on US and Syrian forces in Palmyra,” Centcom said.

 


Two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed on December 13 after a lone gunman — whom Washington described as an IS militant — ambushed them in Palmyra.
Syria’s interior ministry later said the gunman was a member of the security forces who had been set to be fired for extremism.
“We will never forget, and never relent,” US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Saturday in a post on X, replying to the Centcom statement.







The United States and Jordan carried out a round of strikes last month in response to the Palmyra attack, with Centcom saying at the time that “more than 70 targets” had been hit.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, later reported those strikes killed at least five IS members, including a cell leader.
On January 3, Britain and France announced joint strikes targeting an underground facility they said IS had likely used to store weapons.
The US personnel targeted in Palmyra were supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the international effort to combat IS, which seized swaths of Syrian and Iraqi territory in 2014.
The IS members were ultimately defeated by local ground forces backed by international air strikes and other support, but the IS still has a presence in Syria, especially in the country’s vast desert.
US President Donald Trump has long been sceptical of Washington’s presence in Syria, ordering the withdrawal of troops during his first term but ultimately leaving American forces in the country.
The Pentagon announced in April that the United States would halve the number of US personnel in Syria in the following months, while US envoy for Syria Tom Barrack said in June that Washington would eventually reduce its bases in the country to one.
Syria govt forces detain 300 Kurds, evacuate 400 fighters from Aleppo
Meanwhile, Syrian government forces evacuated more than 400 Kurdish fighters from the last district in Aleppo to fall to the army and detained 300 Kurds, an interior ministry official told AFP on Sunday.
Kurdish forces said the combatants were evacuated “through the mediation of international parties to stop the attacks and violations against our people in Aleppo”.
The two sides clashed in Aleppo city earlier this week, after negotiations to integrate the Kurds into the country’s new government stalled.
The ministry official, who requested anonymity, said that 419 fighters, including 59 wounded and an unspecified number of “killed” were transferred from the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood to the Kurds’ de facto autonomous zone in the northeast.
An AFP correspondent saw buses filled with men leaving Sheikh Maqsud under escort by government forces during the night.
The official added that 300 other Kurds, including fighters, have been arrested.
On Saturday, an AFP correspondent saw dozens of young men in civilian clothing seated on the ground and guarded by security forces, before they were transported to an unknown location.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP that 300 “young Kurds” had been arrested, stating that they were “civilians, not fighters”.
In the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli in the northeast, hundreds of people gathered for the arrival of the wounded, according to AFP correspondents on the ground.</p><small>2026-01-11 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11105801cffbac2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966362/israels-recognition-of-somaliland-an-act-of-political-aggression-says-dar-at-oic-moot' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s recognition of ‘Somaliland’ an act of ‘political aggression’, says Dar at OIC moot</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Sunday that Pakistan believed the recognition of the so-called “Somaliland” as an independent state by Israel was an act of “political aggression that sets a perilous precedent, threatening peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea region, and beyond”.
Dar said this while addressing the extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers in Saudi Arabia.
His statement follows a joint statement by the OIC, which initiated its 22nd extraordinary session in Jeddah on Saturday. The moot has been convened against the backdrop of Israel recognising Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Soma­liland’s president, Abdira­hman Mohamed Abdul­lahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”.
Dar expressed Pakistan’s “unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia” in his address today.
“We strongly condemn the illegal and unlawful recognition by Israel of the Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia and the subsequent unwarranted and highly provocative visit of its foreign minister to Somaliland,” he said.
He added that Pakistan also voiced its firm support for Somalia and condemned Israel’s actions during the UN Security Council’s briefing on the issue.
“We identify this development as a direct assault on Somalia’s internationally recognised borders, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law,” Dar said.
“The principle of state sovereignty and territorial integrity constitutes a peremptory norm of international law from which no deviation or derogation is permitted.”
Dar called the internationally-recognised borders of Somalia “sacrosanct and inviolable” and said that the Somaliland region remained an “integral, inseparable and inalienable part of Somalia”.
“No external actor has either the legal standing or the moral authority to alter that fundamental reality,” he said. “Any act, statement or recognition thereof by a state or an external entity regarding any part of the Federal Republic of Somalia should therefore be considered null and void, producing no political or legal effects.”
He added, “We believe that such recognition of an integral part of a sovereign state is not a diplomatic act, but an act of political aggression that sets a perilous precedent, threatening peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea region, and beyond.”
The foreign minister added that Pakistan joined the group of OIC countries in “unequivocally rejecting the unlawful Israeli move” through the joint statement released in the immediate aftermath of the supposed Israeli recognition of Somaliland.
The joint statement termed the recognition of “parts of states” a violation of the cardinal principles of international law and the UN Charter and noted the Israeli action’s potential “serious repercussions” for the Horn of Africa region, the Red Sea region and for international security as a whole, he said.
“The OIC and the wider international community’s firm rejection of this unlawful overture by Israel is, therefore, vital so that the impudent Israeli act does not set a precedent for other countries,” Dar added.
He said that the developments in the region were “particularly alarming at a time when Somalia is demonstrating encouraging and tangible progress on its political and institutional trajectory”, pointing out that the Federal Republic of Somalia had made notable strides in national reconciliation, constitutional reform and the revitalisation of state institutions.
“Positive trends in the financial sector, particularly the efforts related to economic legislation and the move towards an inclusive one-person-one-vote election, represent important steps towards consolidating Somalian democracy and stability,” he added.
“These gains reflect a Somali-owned and Somali-led path towards political reconciliation and cooperation,” he said.
“This positive momentum must be protected and reinforced, not sabotaged and undermined by actions that risk fragmenting the country and reversing hard-earned progress across the entire milieu of national indicators.”
In addition, he said that Pakistan also recognised the sacrifices and resilience of the Somali people and its security forces in thwarting the consistent threat posed by Al-Shabab and its affiliates.
“Israel’s brazen recklessness undermines regional and international efforts aimed at combating terrorism in a region beset with this challenge.
“It also opens the door to the creation of fragile environments susceptible to infiltration and exploitation by extremist groups, thereby negatively impacting regional and global security,” the foreign minister said, adding that in this context, continued support for Somalia’s security and stabilisation efforts remained “indispensable”.
“At this pivotal juncture, when Somalia is focused on defeating extremism, any action that deflects attention, weakens cohesion or fuels division is profoundly irresponsible,” Dar said.
He said that Pakistan fully aligned itself with the OIC’s call “for all states and organisations to refrain from any form of formal, semi-formal, or informal engagement with the authorities of Somaliland”, and to ensure that any engagement strictly respected the sovereignty and unity of Somalia.
“Pakistan categorically rejects any proposal or plan aimed at the forced displacement of Palestinians and linkages of Somaliland region of Federal Republic of Somalia with any such illegal action,” he added.
“Any action that advocates or implies the displacement or relocation of Palestinians not only violates international law but also undermines the prospect of a just and lasting peace in the region.”
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast support for the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination, saying that the only path to lasting peace and stability lay in the realisation of an “independent, contiguous and sovereign” state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders and with Al-Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
Dar added that as a “frontline supporter” of the UNSCR 2803 and the “Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict”, Pakistan reiterated the intention to contribute to its successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the conflict in Gaza, to secure a “dignified life” for the Palestinian people who had endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.
“As a non-permanent member of the UNSC, Pakistan will continue to work with the OIC and Arab partners to mobilise global support for the Palestinian right to self-determination, justice and peace,” he said.
On the topic of India-occupied Kashmir, the foreign minister said that the unresolved dispute remained the “primary source of conflict in South Asia and a nuclear flash point”.
He stressed the urgent need for renewed and concerted efforts under the UN auspices to secure a “just, lasting, and peaceful resolution of the dispute“, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
Dar also appreciated the “strong, unwavering and consistent support that the OIC has always afforded to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters”. Nevertheless, he urged the OIC to step up its efforts to support a just resolution of the dispute.
Dar called upon the OIC and the broader international community to “speak with one voice” and firmly reject all actions that undermined Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
“This meeting today is a resounding manifestation of our collective solidarity with Somalia against a blatant transgression of its sovereignty by a decidedly unconscientious actor,” he said.
“On our part, Pakistan remains resolutely committed to standing with the government and people of Somalia as the country continues its advances towards continued peace and progress.”</p><small>2026-01-11 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/69630a701f0e2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966330/karachi-flyovers' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi flyovers</strong></a><br><p>FLYOVERS are being demolished all over the world because they are considered ugly and they break the openness of the city. The space they occupy is being turned into parks and recreational areas. This is being done through spatial reorganisation of the city, and by realising that building them is the most expensive way of trying to solve traffic-related issues.
When Karachi flyovers were first planned, there were professionals and civil society members who pointed out that they would solve traffic problems at non-rush hours. But at rush hours, they would increase them considerably. And today, conditions at rush hours at various nodes have become much worse than earlier — not only because of an increase of cars.
I can give a few examples of what has happened in the West, as I am sure that some readers are acquainted with the places I am going to mention. These projects are part of a larger city strategy to reclaim public space.

 

In the US, the Waterfront Park in Oregon is on a demolished freeway, and so is the West Side Highway in New York. Meanwhile, many US cities have proposals to remove elevated highways, converting them into public spaces, such as the Hudson River Park.
Similarly, France has turned expressways and elevated roads in Paris into green areas and pedestrian precincts. In the UK, too, in a number of areas, elevated highways have been demolished, creating public spaces, better environmental conditions and neighbourhood open spaces. This has also become a policy for the future.
Many of these areas, such as the Hammersmith flyover, which Karachi residents use on the journey to Heathrow on their way back to Pakistan, are also set to be demolished. However, the city most active in replacing flyovers and expressways with public space is Seoul in Korea. In the past decades, it has demolished some 18 flyovers and converted them into public spaces. Seoul hopes to achieve neighbourhoods where the dominance of automobiles and concrete structures is replaced by an environmentally friendly city. Seoul has a population of 10.26 million.

Flyovers have not solved the city’s problems.

Let’s come back to Karachi, which has built 43 flyovers in the last two decades. The FTC flyover opened to traffic in October 2004. It cost Rs109.4 million. Taking this as an average, the cost of these flyovers works out to around Rs5 billion, not taking inflation into consideration. They have not solved Karachi’s problems, and most of them were unnecessary, even to the then head of the traffic engineering bureau of the KDA, who was of the opinion that the decision to build the flyovers was not a technical but a political one.
As proof of this, there is the issue of the Gurumandir traffic management problem. Five roads converge at Gurumandir. A complex system of flyovers was envisaged for this and supported by the then president. The approximate cost worked out to Rs300m. However, the problem was solved very effectively by a traffic management and engineering solution with no flyovers, at a fraction of the calculated cost. Many professionals also feel that the flyovers help us in spending the loans that we take from IFIs.

 

Apart from aesthetics, the negative spaces created under the flyovers could have been used for public use (such as sports activities, parks for low-income communities, women’s toilets) instead of charity dastarkhwans and disorganised car parks. These are very large spaces, and with proper planning and no flyovers, they can still be used for public use. I am not advocating for their demolition, but for a public use of the spaces under them, and in future, the location of flyovers being decided on technical considerations and not for political and financial favours.
The cost of flyovers is added to by unnecessarily painting them with various motives of questionable aesthetic design. All over the world, most flyovers are finished in grey concrete so that the world of automobiles and buildings stands out in contrast, and the cost of repainting them periodically does not arise. The Lyari Expressway is 16.5 kilometres long. It is painted on both sides. The cost of this exercise works out to nearly Rs20m. It will have to be periodically painted, costing a huge financial loss to state agencies.
It is hoped that the lessons learned by the rest of the world are taken into consideration in the future, along with the points that have been raised in this article, when designing the location and deciding on the necessity of having a flyover. As a result, large volumes of land parcels can be used for the benefit of the majority of the people of the city, and not inappropriate and expensive solutions for the benefit of its elite.

The phenomenon is not limited to the big powers’ actions on the global stage but is mirrored by developments in the region and even within countries, with domestic politics being shaped by the ‘might is right’ principle, if it can be called a principle. The resultant scenario is scary to say the least.
This must be the reason that some of the ‘rattled’ middle-ranking economic-military powers are now forging alliances and concluding pacts so that their collective strength or power enables them to better negotiate the challenges and come out relatively unscathed from the reshaping of the world that seem underway. Let me get into the specifics.
The US-backed Israeli attack started against the around two million Palestinians in the tiny and largely defenceless Gaza Strip ostensibly triggered by the October 2023 Hamas attack. It has continued, despite the murder of thousands of civilians including children, in the face of worldwide demonstrations and calls for an immediate ceasefire by international institutions such as the UN. (In fact, the US sanctioned International Criminal Court judges and its prosecutor examining war crimes charges against Israeli leaders.)

Against the international backdrop, Pakistani foreign policy has so far delivered well.

But the October Hamas attack was only an excuse, as before the brutal Gaza bombing campaign was over, Israel also attacked Lebanon, annexed more of the Syrian Golan Heights and not just attacked Iran itself but also sucked in the US to bomb Iranian nuclear sites (by this time Donald Trump had moved into the White House).

 

This was the beginning of the reshaping of the Middle East, the move towards the realisation of the ‘Greater Israel’ dream. Those still defiant and seen as obstacles were attacked too like the Houthis in Yemen; allies were encouraged to increase their influence and footprint in non-Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen from sites overlooking the Red Sea water routes in the southwest to the northeast of the country.
The fighting in Sudan and the Israeli recognition of Somaliland across the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa are aimed at the same strategic objective: to have oversight of shipping routes south of the Suez Canal whether for transport of oil or other essential supplies.
But in the power game, even states with smaller militaries can apply economic levers effectively to be heard. And this assumes greater significance in the ‘transactional’ Trump era. So when the Israelis attacked targets on Qatari soil, it was seen as an overreach by even those countries in the region which restricted their reaction to lodging verbal protests during the Gaza genocide.
It also brought home the truth that American bases and troops on their soil were not there for their protection but served US interests and were there to project US power. This led to a flurry of activity and saw a defence pact inked between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Now a Bloomberg report suggests, citing unnamed sources, that Turkiye may join the pact too.
Of late, Saudi Arabia has reasserted its power and re-established itself as the main backer of forces in the non-Houthi parts of Yemen, bombing and evicting the South Transitional Council from areas the latter had taken over from the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in Sanaa after rebelling from the governing coalition.
Zooming out of the region, we can see the US reviving the Monroe Doctrine (Trump has rechristened it the ‘Donroe doctrine’) and applying it to Venezuela, after kidnapping its president and his spouse on the flimsiest of charges, some of which were amended between their snatching in Caracas and their indictment a day later in New York City.
Trump says the US will “run Venezuela” now, having left the regime in place, after an apparent deal with interim president Delcy Rodríguez and will sell their oil to who he likes but the country itself cannot sell oil, for example, to China, Cuba and Russia.
Donald Trump is also making similar noises about ‘hitting’ other South American countries, such as Colombia and Mexico, whose leaders do not conform to his (far) right-wing worldview. He also keeps repeating his desire to take over Greenland one way or another. Given the collapse of the rules-based order and US military might, who knows what he does next.
No different is the use of military power by Russia to make inroads into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine is a country that gave up its nuclear arsenal after the collapse of the Soviet Union primarily on account of US security guarantees.

 

Now under Trump, the US is telling Ukraine to pretty much forget about its lost territory and do a peace deal with Russia. It has nearly halted all military aid to Ukraine and also told Nato states in Europe that they must step up their defence spending dramatically because the leader of the so-called Free World is done underwriting their defence.
Against this backdrop, one must say, Pakistani foreign policy has so far delivered well with the three major world military powers the US, China and Russia seemingly onside, along with the well-resourced Gulf states. With Pakistan responding robustly and effectively to an Indian attempt to project power in South Asia by missile attacks on Pakistani soil without legal justification in May last year, Islamabad’s stock has risen in the world.
With the rules-based order becoming more of an irrelevance, Pakistan too appears to be taking inspiration from how domestic dissent particularly over Gaza has been handled in the US and Europe. Perhaps, Pakistan feels that when established democracies can get away with it, why shouldn’t a hybrid government? The answer is some distance away. The old order may be crumbling but what will rise from its ashes is still to take concrete shape.

Once again, it involves India, which has been intent on throwing its weight around. This time, though, it is getting a taste of its own medicine.
Less than a month before the Twenty20 World Cup is set to be played in India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh have cited security reservations over travelling to India. The Bangladesh Cricket Board is, instead, in a discussion with the International Cricket Council about playing its matches in Sri Lanka.

 

Its concerns have been triggered on account of worsening Dhaka-New Delhi ties and the recent events related to its fast bowler Mustafizur Rehman.
Mustafizur had been signed by the Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders, only for the Board of Control for Cricket in India to ask the team to release him due to “recent developments”. The move sparked a furore in Dhaka, which banned the broadcast of the IPL in the country and asked the ICC to shift its World Cup matches from India.
Its argument is that when India cannot ensure Mustafizur’s safety, the only Bangladeshi played snapped up in the IPL auction, how can it guarantee the security of the entire team.
The World Cup, beginning on Feb 7, is set for geopolitical strains again after Pakistan-India tensions eased with an arrangement which sees both teams play their matches at neutral venues during tournaments held in either country.
Pakistan will play their World Cup games in Sri Lanka, just like India played their Champions Trophy matches in the UAE last year. India has cited security concerns for not sending its team to Pakistan. Now, it has to address Bangladesh’s similar concerns.
It is imperative for the ICC, led by former Indian cricket supremo Jay Shah, to make an impartial decision instead of forcing Bangladesh to play in India.

“Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. “The USA stands ready to help!!!”
The president later repeated the message in other posts as well while US media reported that Washington was mulling potential strikes against Iran.
Iran has witnessed waves of protests since late December, triggered largely by a sharp decline in the value of the Iranian rial and worsening economic conditions. The demonstrations began on Dec 28 near Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and later spread to several other cities.
On Friday, Trump said Iran was “in big trouble” as unrest grew, adding that the United States was “watching very closely” and warning Iranian authorities against using lethal force against protesters.
Iranian officials have accused the United States and Israel of fomenting the unrest, warning that security forces and the judiciary “will show no tolerance whatsoever toward saboteurs“.
On Saturday, Trump also reposted comments by US Senator Lindsey Graham on his Truth Social platform. In the post on X, the South Carolina lawmaker warned Tehran that its actions against protesters would not go unanswered.
Trump also reposted a Fox News report claiming that a protester had climbed the Iranian embassy in London on Saturday, torn down the current regime’s flag and hoisted a pre-revolutionary symbol.
Meanwhile, US media reports suggested the Trump administration was weighing tougher options. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration had held initial discussions on potential strikes against Iran.
The New York Post separately reported that Washington may carry out preliminary strikes on selected targets, though it did not specify when or which targets could be involved.
Separately, a retired US Navy officer urged the administration to expand support for Iranian protesters in cyberspace. Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of US Central Command, called on Washington to establish new State Department initiatives to help Iranians gain access to secure virtual private networks (VPNs).
“Approximately 86 per cent of Iranians use VPNs to bypass government restrictions and online surveillance,” Harward wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News, arguing that expanded access to secure VPNs during internet disruptions would allow protesters to organise and communicate “more safely.”
Harward also urged the administration to draw up a target list of Iranian government entities involved in repressing free speech and violating human rights, including military command-and-control centres, cyber police headquarters and morality police facilities.</p><small>2026-01-11 05:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11090338dedeaa7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966288/dollar-inflows-from-exchangers-dip' target='_blank'><strong>Dollar inflows from exchangers dip</strong></a><br><p>• Banks receive 30pc fewer dollars in 1HFY26• Untraceable outflows raise questions over currency flows
KARACHI: Banks received 30 per cent fewer US dollars from exchange companies in the first half of the current fiscal year, according to official data.
Exchange companies sold about $1.4 billion to banks during July-December FY26, compared with around $2bn in the corresponding period of FY25, reflecting a decline of nearly 30pc.
Exchange companies are required to sell surplus foreign currency in the banking market. However, they are also allowed to sell dollars to individuals for specific purposes.
“The customers bought about $1.2bn in six months from exchange companies, kept $400m in bank accounts and the remaining $800m is not traceable,” said Malik Bostan, Chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
The untraceable $800m is believed to have been used for purchasing virtual currencies. Trading in virtual currencies remains unregulated in Pakistan, though the State Bank is working on a framework to regulate cryptocurrency transactions.
The government has expressed support for cryptocurrency trading and is willing to legalise it with the assistance of the State Bank. Selling dollars to the general public is not straightforward, as exchange companies typically issue cheques for encashment through banks or directly transfer dollars into buyers’ bank accounts instead of providing cash.
Data show that currency sales to banks have been on a declining trend from June to December 2025. The highest inflow was recorded in June, when banks received $408m.
At the start of FY26, sales stood at $279m in July, falling sharply to $163m in August. They recovered to $187m in September, rose to $243m in October, dipped slightly to $238m in November and increased again to $271m in December.
Despite rising remittance inflows this year, dollar sales by exchange companies to banks have declined.
“Special apps available on websites are attracting dollars from Pakistan. The current US dollar rate offered by these apps is around Rs292, which is highly attractive for dollar holders,” Mr Bostan said, adding that these platforms guide holders either to sell at these rates or invest in cryptocurrencies.
Exchange rate outlook
“The latest liquidity profile of the SBP shows aggregate short positions of less than $2bn, broadly in line with the IMF’s target, and suggests that reserve accumulation has not been driven by buy-sell swaps but by mopping up excess liquidity from the interbank market,” said Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark.
The current trajectory implies a potential breach of the Rs280 to a US dollar; however, with the real effective exchange rate at 104.8, competitiveness already appears stretched. In this context, the central bank should resist a decisive break below Rs280, preferring stability over signalling strength, particularly as import demand gradually recovers and longer-dated external pressures remain unresolved, he said.
“For now, the dollar-rupee parity is likely to remain range-bound, with two-way movement increasingly coming into play,” he added.

ISLAMABAD: At a time when the federal government is grappling with its own fiscal shortfall, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has raised concerns that revenue transfer shortfalls from the centre during the first half of 2025-26 have jeopardised the province’s ability to meet its annual budget surplus target, as agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The provincial government further warned that the delayed and reduced federal transfers are exerting significant pressure on its finances, particularly impa­cting the delivery of essential services in the merged districts of the former Federally Admini­stered Tribal Areas (Fata).
The issue was formally raised in a two-page letter from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Adviser on Finance to the Chief Minister, Muzammil Aslam, to Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. The letter followed weeks after newly appointed Chief Minister Sohail Afridi publicly accused the federal government of withholding the province’s rightful share from the divisible pool.
The provincial government said that the budgeted surplus of Rs157 billion for the current fiscal year was based on the assumption that federal transfers would be released in full and on schedule. Any delay or shortfall in these transfers, the letter warned, directly undermines the province’s ability to uphold fiscal discipline and achieve its agreed surplus target.
The scale of the problem was most visible in the merged districts.
The KP government allocated Rs292bn for the merged districts in 2025-26, including Rs143bn for current expenditures, Rs50bn under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP), Rs40bn for the Annual Development Programme (ADP), Rs43bn as the province’s estimated 3 per cent share of the NFC award, and Rs17bn for temporarily displaced persons (TDPs).
However, actual federal releases during the first half of FY26 amounted to just Rs56bn, only 19pc of the total allocation. Provincial officials have warned that this shortfall has significantly constrained development activity and severely disrupted essential public service delivery in some of the country’s most historically neglected regions.
According to Mr Muzammil, despite limited federal support, the provincial government has continued to sustain development through its own resources. The province released Rs26.4bn under the AIP, even though it received no federal funding under this head.
Similarly, against federal releases of just Rs9.8bn, the KP government provided Rs16.4bn from its own budget to maintain development momentum, despite growing fiscal imbalances. For current expenditures in the merged districts, provincial spending has reached Rs63bn, while federal transfers stood at only Rs46bn, leaving a funding gap of Rs17bn.

 

The concerns now extend beyond the merged districts, as shortfalls in federal transfers continue to undermine KP’s fiscal stability. Releases under straight transfers have fallen sharply below target, only Rs19bn has been received so far against the annual allocation of Rs115bn, representing just 17pc of the total.
Moreover, shortfalls in divisible pool tax transfers have further strained the province’s finances. KP’s share in federal tax assignments for the first half of FY26 was projected at Rs643bn, including the 1pc share for the war-on-terror. However, actual receipts amounted to only Rs567bn — resulting in a shortfall of Rs76bn.
The shortfall is also pronounced in Net Hydel Profit (NHP) payments. Against a budgeted amount of Rs106bn for FY26, the federal government has released only Rs18bn during the first half, just 17pc of the expected disbursement.
These mounting revenue pressures have coincided with unavoidable spending obligations. The KP government incurred Rs28bn on flood response and rehabilitation efforts, along with an additional Rs7bn on support for TDPs. Officials warn that these unplanned expenditures have further squeezed the province’s already limited fiscal space.
The KP government has cautioned that if federal releases continue at the current pace, achieving the budgeted surplus of Rs157bn will become increasingly complex. It has called for urgent corrective measures, stressing the need for timely and predictable federal transfers in line with budgeted assumptions to stabilise provincial finances and protect public service delivery, the letter added.

Netanyahu has said Israel should not be reliant on foreign military aid but has stopped short of declaring a firm timeline for when Israel would be fully independent from Washington.
“I want to taper off the military within the next 10 years,” Netanyahu told said. Asked if that meant a tapering “down to zero”, he said: “Yes.”
Netanyahu said he told President Donald Trump during a recent visit that Israel “very deeply” appreciates “the military aid that America has given us over the years, but here too we’ve come of age and we’ve developed incredible capacities.”
In December, Netanyahu said Israel would spend $110bn on developing an independent arms industry to reduce dependency on other countries. The US and Israeli governments had signed a memorandum of understanding for the 10 years through September 2028 that provides $38bn in military aid, $33bn in grants to buy military equipment and $5bn for missile defence systems.

Netanyahu says Israel has developed ‘incredible capacities’ and has come of age militarily

Israeli defence exports rose 13 per cent last year, with major contracts signed for Israeli defence technology including its advanced multi-layered aerial defence systems.
US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Israel supporter and close ally of Trump, said on X, “We need not wait ten years” to begin scaling back military aid to Israel.







“The billions in taxpayer dollars that would be saved by expediting the termination of military aid to Israel will and should be plowed back into the US military,” Graham said. “I will be presenting a proposal to Israel and the Trump administration to dramatically expedite the timetable.”

The severe cold has reduced gas supply in several areas, causing serious difficulties for residents trying to keep their homes warm. The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has been implementing loadshedding in Quetta and surrounding areas from midnight to 5am.
People in Kalat, Mastung, Ziarat, Pishin and several other areas are also facing similar gas shortages amid the ongoing cold spell.
However, residents say many localities in the provincial capital and its outskirts are not receiving gas properly even outside these hours. “We are getting gas for a very limited time without any timetable,” Mehmood Khan, a resident of the Sariab area, told Dawn, adding that the situation worsened after winter rain and snowfall on the mountains surrounding the Quetta valley.
Several localities in the main city area are also facing low or no gas supply from SSGC as temperatures plunged to between minus five and minus seven degrees Celsius. “We have no option but to purchase gas cylinders to keep our houses warm and for cooking,” Mansoor Ahmed, a resident of the posh Samungli Housing Scheme, said.
Amid the worsening situation, residents of the Sariab area, who have been facing the most severe gas shortages, staged a protest against low gas pressure and prolonged supply suspensions. Protesters burned tyres and erected barricades, blocking the road and bringing all types of traffic to a complete halt.
The protest came during an intense cold spell, with citizens facing severe hardship due to reduced gas pressure. The temperature in Quetta dropped to minus three degrees Celsius, while in Kalat it plunged to minus eight degrees Celsius.
Over the past several days of extreme cold, people in Quetta and surrounding areas — particularly the elderly, women and children — have been suffering because of gas shortages and outages.
Protesters said they had repeatedly informed SSGC officials about the low gas pressure, but no action was taken. In response, residents blocked the main Sabzal Road by burning tyres and placing obstacles, demanding the immediate restoration of adequate gas supply.
They said gas pressure in Killi Ferozabad and adjoining areas had dropped significantly, compounding their difficulties during the harsh winter.
