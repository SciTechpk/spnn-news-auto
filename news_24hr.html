The operation to put out the fire is still under way, according to updates received around 11:30am, hours after the blaze erupted.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn today (Sunday) morning that the initially reported death toll of three from the fire had risen to five. Later, the Edhi Foundation said in a statement that one more death had taken the toll to six.
Separately, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn in the morning that around 20 people had been injured in the incident.
As of early Sunday morning, he said, the fire had been controlled up to 30 per cent.
The rescue service spokesperson said there were around 1,200 shops in the mall. “There are goods such as crockery, clothes, electrical appliances, cosmetics and perfumes in various shops, due to which the fire intensified.”
Khan added that on Sunday morning, 20 fire tenders from different departments and institutions were being employed to extinguish the blaze.
“But the building appears very old, and there is a danger that its structure may fall anytime because of the impact of the fire. Thus, the rescue operation is being carried out with extreme caution,” he said.
He earlier told Dawn that the fire had erupted in shops located on the building’s ground floor.
In a morning update, the Edhi Foundation said that a part of the building had collapsed due to the intensity of the fire.
Garden Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Mohsin Raza said in a statement on Saturday night that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit at one of the shops, before spreading to the entire mall.
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, expressing concern over the incident, ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations, according to a statement from his office.
He also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed officials to divert traffic in the area to alternative routes for the safe passage of citizens.
In a statement, he said that the cause of the fire should be ascertained through a thorough investigation. He said that the building should be secured so that the fire does not spread.
The minister said the routes should be cleared so that fire brigade vehicles could access the scene.
A Sindh Rangers spokesperson said in a statement that personnel had been deployed to the scene of the incident.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in rescue activities and rescue operations along with the fire brigade staff,” the statement, which was issued shortly after the fire erupted, said. “Officers and personnel will remain at the scene until the rescue operation is completed.”
The statement further read that in addition to aiding in rescue operations, a contingent of Rangers had been deployed to cordon off the building for the safety of civilians and to ensure traffic flow.
“Alongside fire tenders, Rangers personnel are evacuating trapped people and ensuring the safety of valuables,” the statement read, adding that protecting lives and preventing the fire from further spreading was a top priority.
The development comes a day after at least 20 containers, mostly containing electrical batteries, were destroyed as a huge fire erupted at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on Friday afternoon.

This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate.

In a review published in the British journal The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Womens Health on Saturday, the team said they had focused on amassing the best-quality evidence to address the claims.
Paracetamol is safe to use in pregnancy, said lead author Asma Khalil, professor of obstetrics and maternal foetal medicine at City St Georges, University of London.
The key message is reassurance: When used as recommended, the best available evidence does not support a causal link with autism, ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) or intellectual disability.

President Trump claimed last year the painkiller could be linked to autism in children if taken during pregnancy

Khalil said she had been asked about the popular pain medication also known as acetaminophen by her patients after Trump in September told pregnant women not to take the drug. At the time, national and international medical groups decried the presidents comments, saying they were not evidence-based.
Paracetamol/Tylenol is the only pain reliever considered safe for pregnant women, and doctors already advise them to use the smallest amount for the shortest time to control pain and fever during pregnancy. Untreated, these conditions can be risky for both pregnant women and their babies. The researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data, finding 43 studies that were then assessed for quality and bias using a standard tool.
The team particularly focused on studies that looked at children born to the same mother who took paracetamol/Tylenol during one pregnancy but not the other. These take into account shared genetic factors and family environments that could be linked to autism or the other conditions studied, Khalil said.
There were only three studies of this type, but they were large, covering more than 260,000 children assessed for autism, and around 335,000 and 405,000 for ADHD and intellectual disabilities respectively.
They showed no significant link between use of the drug and any of the conditions studied. This remained the case when results from all of the high-quality studies that were assessed were pooled, the authors said.
Khalil said much of the work showing a potential link, including a review of 46 studies cited by Trump officials, was prone to bias or confounding factors that her team’s review had tried to account for. Grainne McAlonan, professor of Translational Neuroscience at King’s College London, who was not involved in the research, praised the study, adding: I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close.

Speculation abounds about what made US President Donald Trump change his mind — from entreaties by Gulf friends, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, to a seemingly bizarre New York Times report that claimed that the apartheid state’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also asked the US leader not to launch military strikes for the time being.

 

However, in Trump’s own words “nobody” made him change his mind and it was the staying of 800 hangings of protesters that Iran had supposedly planned that was the main reason he had called off the strikes and also because the protesters’ “killing has stopped”.
Whatever led to the pause, temporary or permanent, it is a welcome development for the region, which seemed to be sliding towards strife, with worries in the Gulf about Iran’s possible retaliatory missile strikes against American military bases and, who knows, even economic infrastructure such as oil and gas facilities.

Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders.

Perhaps, the most serious challenges would have come Pakistan’s way in either a regime change or collapse-chaos scenario. In the case of regime cha­­­nge, it would not have been surprising to see an administration in Tehran sympathetic to Isra­­el. That would have meant a hostile entity like Israeli intelligence enjoying far greater access to Iran than, for example, Indian intelligence has at present.
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are like a sty in Israel’s eye. And, therefore, you can well imagine the consequences of the latter’s intelligence sitting on our nearly 1,000-kilometre border with Iran, adding to our existing security concerns due to the situation on the Indian and Afghan borders. Coastal security would be another concern.
In the other scenario, where a central authority collapse would lead to chaos and fragmentation, it would be reasonable to assume that Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province would be one of the regions affected by any such development, which, in turn, would lead to even more issues across our common, often porous, border.
With the same ethnicity straddling the border, you can well imagine the boost the insurgency in our Balochistan could get from the collapse of the central authority in Iran. Israel has enhanced its security through internal strife in Syria. It is the Mossad playbook for all states around it who are not in its pocket.
So, Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders and up the coast, in the short run at least. But Trump’s decision to impose another 25 per cent tariff on anyone doing business with Iran will deepen the crisis in the sanctions-clamped nation.

 

It was the economic crisis, with the rapidly falling value of the Iranian currency and inflation, that triggered the recent round of street protests. There can be no doubt that the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was involved in arming and instigating some of the protesters as the former CIA chief and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo openly tweeted, but the protests erupted due to the economic mess where even purchasing bread is becoming a problem.
This fact was acknowledged by Iran’s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who said the government needed to address the legitimate concerns of the protesters who had a right to take to the streets. Now a new budget is expected to be presented before parliament to replace the earlier proposal rejected by it. But then, the protests turned violent and the security services were ordered to crack down.
Some Tehran-based sources say the protests were peaceful till some elements from among the protesters fired at the security forces and also attacked infrastructure. These sources claimed that, of the 2,000 people killed, some 700 were law-enforcement officers. But these claims were impossible to verify independently.
Trump’s tariffs on top of sanctions could create further problems for the Iranian leadership as even the thus far recalcitrant India is having second thoughts about doing business with Iran and has pulled out of the Chabahar port project, which it saw as vital to expanding its trade ties all the way to Central Asia.
With the exception of China and Russia, additional US tariffs would be sufficient to discourage the smaller economies from trading with Iran, which would worsen the resource crunch in that country. The oppressive Iranian regime has some serious thinking to do over the coming weeks.
The immediate threat of US-Israeli military action may have receded somewhat but the economic crisis is going to worsen. Iran may consider easing restrictions on how women should be attired and create more space for peaceful expression of dissent as a means of reducing tensions within its society.
Side by side, it should consider what price tag it wants to attach to its nuclear programme. With its successful and lethal missile programme, it has already gained a degree of effective defence. Only Iran can tell if stopping its enrichment programme in exchange for lifting of sanctions and economic relief is worthwhile.
If its missile stockpile, particularly of the hypersonic variant, is what prompted many of its Gulf neighbours and, by some accounts, even Israel, to ask the US not to provoke it by attacking, Iran’s defence shield seems to be working. Only the decision-makers in Tehran will know if that is enough or whether their pursuit of nuclear weapons is non-negotiable.
Their past experience of doing a deal with the Obama administration in 2015 to cap enrichment that Trump later annulled is not encouraging. Even then, it’s not clear what other options a country facing economic ruin and internal strife can exercise.

But the human losses have left a deep new wound on the Iranian psyche. The immediate threat of a US-Israeli strike has also dispersed. Washington and Tel Aviv, backed by most Gulf capitals, recalibrated their stance after strategic assessments highlighted the danger of a wider regional war and the absence of any realistic plan for a post-regime change scenario.

 

Inside Iran, resistance against the establishment still struggles to form a unified front or leadership. However, this does not mean the US, Israel or their allies have dropped the goal of political change in Tehran. Instead, they are adjusting their methods. Media reports indicate the regime will not collapse quickly due to a strong security apparatus, loyal institutions, and backing from a sizable segment of the population.
Even so, external actors, along with internal resistance networks, are unlikely to allow the regime much time to fully recover from this crisis. Pressure is expected to persist, shifting from low to high intensity, to gradually soften the ground for change.
A key indicator that the ground is fertile for such a shift are the visible cracks within the Assembly of Experts (Majles-i-Khobregan-i-Rahbari), the Guardian Council (Shura-i-Negahban), and disputes within or between the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the regular military (Artesh). All these critical institutions are still aligned with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s core strategic worldview, as one Iranian-origin expert noted.

The recent internal resistance has emboldened separatist elements in Arab and Kurdish regions.

To break the regime’s coherence, external actors would not only seek to energise internal political resistance but also exploit other domestic fault lines, including fuelling dormant or active insurgencies.
Analysts speculate that separatist and anti-clerical movements are concentrated in several key regions: Khuzestan province in the southwest, where many Arab Iranians harbour grievances; the western border areas, including Kurdistan and West Azerbaijan, where Kurdish separatists remain active; and, from a Pakistani perspective, the Baloch districts in Sistan-Baluchestan and parts of the Khorasan region, where anti-regime Baloch insurgent groups continue their operations.
As Vali Nasr explains in his latest book, Iran’s Grand Strategy, the clerical regime’s doctrine of ‘forward defence’, projecting power abroad to protect the state at home, can also be turned against Iran. Its adversaries can adopt the same approach to weaken the regime from within. Iran’s enemies have already disrupted the Axis of Resistance, the network of Iranian regional proxies built around this forward defence strategy. The next step, as a few analysts suggest, could be the deployment or activation of proxies inside Iran itself.
If this occurs, the primary objective would be to draw the Iranian Revolutionary Guard into a deeper engagement on the internal front. An amalgam of political resistance and armed struggle can strain Iranian forces, especially when their proxies cannot come to their aid, as Iran’s Axis of Resistance is weak and unable to provide any support.
These broader trends are now evident on the ground. Although reports suggest that the recent internal resistance has emboldened separatist elements in Arab and Kurdish regions, it is in the Sistan-Balochestan belt where several militant outfits have reportedly formed a stronger coalition to intensify their campaign against the Iranian state.
Jaishul Adl is a Baloch separatist group operating along the Iran-Pakistan border. It frequently targets Iranian security forces in Baloch-majority regions. The group now calls itself the People’s Fighters Front (PFF). Three smaller militant outfits, the Nasr Movement, the Pada Baloch Movement, and the Muhammad Rasul Allah Group, have reportedly merged into this new organisation.
This rebranding is significant. By shedding its overtly religious identity, Jaishul Adl is attempting to project a more accommodative, secular nationalist profile that resonates better with the region’s relatively moderate Baloch population. It also aligns the group’s ideology with that of other nationalist insurgent movements, such as the terrorist Baloch organisations BLF and BLA and Kurdish groups like PJAK. Such a shift is also likely to make the organisation more eligible for support and funding from the Baloch and Iranian diaspora, as well as other external backers.

 

Strategically, the makeover aims to make the group acceptable to the West and the Arab world. It mirrors Abdolmalik Rigi’s approach. He was the founder of a Baloch militant group in Iran and sought Western backing but failed, as the global war on terrorism was at its peak then.
This is a different time. If separatist groups inside Iran become more active, they might join forces with Baloch separatists in Pakistan, who have sharpened their skills. Some experts are unsure about this, arguing that the PFF has long been seen as Saudi-backed. Since Riyadh maintains strong ties with Pakistan, the alliance seems unlikely. But if the PFF has gained support from other external players, it could act with more strategic independence.
Baloch separatist groups on both sides of the border ultimately subscribe to the idea of a ‘Greater Balochistan’. This concept spans regions of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, making cross-border cooperation a possibility.
If turmoil grows in Sistan-Baluchestan, many terrorist actors could get involved. These could include IS elements and militants who have left Ahmed al-Sharaa’s networks in Syria. As this region is part of the Golden Crescent, a hub for drug trafficking and human smuggling, the ongoing instability could create a chaotic zone across Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Any significant political shift in Iran will inevitably affect Pakistan with its broad geopolitical and geoeconomic consequences. While certain outcomes may offer limited strategic advantages for Pakistan, escalating instability along the Iran-Pakistan border would raise internal security pressures and could generate serious frictions with the regime in Tehran.

Donald Trump has not received the Nobel Peace Prize. He has simply acquired the medal. This is akin to holding a friend’s Oscar during a selfie and then captioning it ‘great night’.
The distinction, however, has never really troubled the American president, who had campaigned for the honour for years. He had listed his achievements numerous times, compared himself favourably to past winners and expressed bafflement that the committee kept missing the point — him. That pursuit was not subtle.

 

President Trump spoke of the Nobel as something he had earned but been unfairly denied, a prize that history had misplaced. The grievance lingered, resurfacing whenever foreign policy or legacy came up.
What irony then, that María Corina Machado, the actual Nobel laureate, simply handed the medal to him. With the trophy now sitting on Mr Trump’s desk, destiny must feel restored.
The custodians of the prize were quick to clarify matters. The Norwegian Nobel Institute reminded everyone that the Nobel cannot be transferred, shared or quietly passed along. The medal may move. The honour stays put.
The natural question that arises then is, why hand over the cherished prize at all? For Ms Machado, the gesture is less about personal generosity than political leverage.
Post-Maduro, Venezuela’s future is being argued in Washington, and she arrived with an unusually shiny lobbying tool. It cost her nothing, and flattered him enormously, a rare bargain in diplomacy.
Mr Trump has chosen to keep the medal, and although it is a symbolic prize, it implies responsibility. That means calm, restraint, and thinking before tweeting.
No one is updating the laureates’ list. No Oslo speech is pending. Still, now that peace is sitting on his desk, expectations may quietly follow. After all, it would be awkward to own the medal and then start a fight with it.
Published in Dawn, January 18th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-18 05:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967629/gaza-second-phase' target='_blank'><strong>Gaza second phase</strong></a><br><p>MORE than three months since the ceasefire in Gaza took effect, the second phase of President Donald Trump’s peace plan for the occupied Palestinian territory has been launched.
Among the features of this phase is the announcement of the so-called Gaza ‘Board of Peace’, which the American leader will head. Other luminaries serving on this body include his son-in-law Jared Kushner, administration staffers Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff and former British prime minister Tony Blair, among others. In Mr Trump’s own words, this “is the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled”.

 

Meanwhile, a serving American general has been named to head the International Stabilisation Force, which is supposed to oversee security and disarmament in Gaza, while Ali Shaath, an ex-Palestinian Authority official, is to head the Gaza governance committee.
All the hyperbole notwithstanding, it remains to be seen whether these interim governing structures will succeed in addressing the still dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, and stopping Israel from committing more slaughter in the Strip.
While Tel Aviv had butchered over 70,000 Palestinians since Oct 7, 2023, more than 400 people have been murdered in Gaza by Israel since the ceasefire took effect. Moreover, Israel continues to occupy the Palestinian territory.
There are also questions about how much liberty the Palestinian committee will have in running Gaza’s affairs. There are genuine fears that the foreign-led Board of Peace — in true colonial fashion — will be making the actual decisions that matter, with little to no Palestinian input, seeking to protect Israel’s interests over all else.
Interestingly, the board’s goals include bringing “investment attraction” to and initiating “capital mobilisation” in Gaza. Rather than a humanitarian effort, this sounds more like a business deal.

 

Also, the inclusion of Tony Blair in the board has raised eyebrows. As UK prime minister, Mr Blair was an enthusiastic supporter of America’s devastating invasion of Iraq. It should be remembered that Iraq has yet to fully recover from that disaster.
As for the ISF, its mandate is still unclear. Will the force, led by an American general and consisting of troops from Muslim countries, take Hamas’s weapons by force if the Palestinian group refuses to give up its guns? Will Muslim states be willing to participate in such an endeavour? Pakistan, and other states that are mulling sending troops, must consider these scenarios.
The fact is that the plan is a temporary fix at best, and a cover for permanent Israeli occupation at worst. If there is to be lasting peace in Gaza and the rest of the occupied territories, then the question of Palestinian liberation must be addressed in unambiguous terms. A clear roadmap is needed, which leads to the end of the Zionist occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state.

MUZAFFARABAD: The Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) has accused the government of violating a landmark agreement signed in October last year and has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene, citing serious delays in implementation and expressing concern over the induction of a “controversial figure” into the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) ahead of the upcoming elections in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

 

In an open letter addressed to the prime minister on Saturday, the JAAC said the agreement was signed on October 3–4, 2025, following deadly protests in late September that claimed several lives. A high-powered delegation from Islamabad, dispatched on the premier’s directives, had visited Muzaffarabad and concluded what the committee described as a historic accord, reassuring the people of AJK of Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding their legitimate rights.
However, the committee alleged that the agreement had been repeatedly breached. It pointed out that the final clause required meetings of the negotiating committee to be held every 15 days, followed by the issuance of an official communiqué. Over the subsequent three months, however, only two meetings were held, on October 21 and November 4. A third meeting scheduled for January 5 this year was boycotted by the JAAC.
The committee also highlighted delays and shortcomings in the implementation of the Health Card Scheme. Although funds were released after a delay of more than 100 days, many major local hospitals in AJK were not included in the State Life Insurance Corporation’s panel. This, it said, would force even poor patients to travel to Rawalpindi or Islamabad for treatment, undermining the utility of the scheme.
Referring to compensation for victims of the protests, the JAAC said the agreement promised financial compensation equivalent to law enforcement allowances for those killed on October 1 and 2, Rs1 million for each gunshot injury, and a government job for a family member of each deceased person within 20 days.
“However, this clause has yet to be fully implemented, which amounts to a serious breach of the agreement,” the letter stated.
The committee further said that FIRs registered against JAAC members and members of the public between May 9, 2023, and October 4, 2025, were to be withdrawn under the agreement, but the issue remained unresolved. It added that young people continued to face difficulties in obtaining police character certificates, while several individuals seeking employment abroad had been offloaded from flights and arrested after being placed on exit and passport control lists, causing financial losses and mental distress.
The JAAC also accused the authorities of violating another clause calling for the formation of a high-powered committee to review the issue of AJK Assembly members elected from constituencies outside the territory. It said the committee’s formation had been unjustifiably delayed, while MLAs elected on refugee seats were granted parliamentary privileges and standing committee positions. The committee further alleged that non-residents continued to be admitted to educational institutions under refugee quotas, in violation of the agreement.
Expressing alarm over political developments ahead of the forthcoming AJK elections, the JAAC strongly criticised the PML-N for inducting Saqib Majeed, whom it accused of opening fire on peaceful protesters in Muzaffarabad on September 29, 2025, killing three people and injuring dozens. The committee said the incident had triggered widespread protests and clashes across AJK, resulting in further loss of life.
It noted that Mr Majeed, the son-in-law of Muslim Conference chief Sardar Attique Ahmed Khan and a former chief organiser of the party, was now being given political cover by the PML-N, a move it said had generated strong resentment across the region.
The JAAC said it had boycotted the negotiation process in protest against Mr Majeed’s inclusion in the PML-N and urged the prime minister to take personal interest in the matter, hold the local PML-N leadership accountable, and reconsider the party’s decision to induct what it described as an individual responsible for killing peaceful demonstrators.

Light snowfall was recorded in parts of Skardu, Kharmang, Shigar, Ghanche, Astore and Ghizer on Friday and Saturday. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast further rain and snowfall in several areas until Jan 23.
Officials said Skardu received about two to three inches of snow on Saturday, while parts of Ghizer saw intermittent snowfall over the past two days.
Light snow was also reported in Hunza, Nagar and other areas last week, but residents said most valleys remained dry, with mountains largely bare and rocky.

Experts warn ‘snow drought’ could worsen flood risk downstream

Muhammad Ali Alam, a resident of Skardu, said the region typically received heavy snowfall by mid-January. “The mountains should be snow-clad by now, but the first snow of the season in Skardu and adjoining areas only fell on Friday,” he told Dawn. He said residents had observed later and lower snowfall over the past two years.
Karim Hayat, a resident of Hussaini village in Upper Hunza’s Gojal valley, said snowfall usually began in late November.
“It is alarming that we are facing a snow drought till January,” he said, adding that the light snow on surrounding peaks would melt quickly in the sun. He also said temperatures remained unusually high until the end of December.
Saeed Farooqi from the Tirashig area of Astore said the district would normally be blanketed in snow by this time. “This year, the area remained dry through January,” he said.
Experts said a shift in winter patterns had been observed across GB in recent years, with snowfall starting later, the areas receiving less snow and temperatures remaining higher than usual.
Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn the region’s fragile ecosystem was being disturbed by climate change and environmental degradation.
He said snowfall had increasingly shifted to mid-January and February, reducing the chance of snow compacting and turning into ice on mountains and glaciers.
“Late snowfall does not compact and can melt rapidly when the summer season starts, which increases the risk of floods downstream,” he said.
Mr Hussain said climate change was a major driver of the shift, but local factors were also contributing. He cited deforestation, unplanned construction of roads and other infrastructure, the influx of tourism and increasing human activity near glaciers.
“Greenhouse emissions, increasing traffic discharge emissions in the fragile environment, human settlements near glaciers, burning of tyres, animal dung and cutting of forests for firewood impacted glaciated areas,” he said.
He said uncontrolled population and increasing human activities in environmentally sensitive areas also contributed to the weather pattern change in the area.
Citing data collected by GBEPA, he said the average temperature in GB rose by about 0.6 degrees Celsius between 1987 and 2013. He said the region had faced a rise in flash floods, accelerated glacial melt and other climate-linked hazards in recent years.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump escalated his bid to acquire Greenland on Saturday, threatening tariffs of up to 25 per cent on eight European nations until his purchase of the Danish territory is achieved.
Trump aimed the threat at Denmark and fellow NATO members who have deployed troops to the mineral-rich territory in recent days. The ultimatum threatens to create unprecedented tension within the alliance.
Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump announced that starting Feb 1, all goods sent to the United States from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would be subject to a 10 per cent tariff.
“On June 1st, 2026, the Tariff will be increased to 25pc. This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,” Trump wrote.
The US president argued that the European nations are “playing this very dangerous game” and have introduced unsustainable risks.
“Therefore, it is imperative that, in order to protect Global Peace and Security, strong measures be taken so that this potentially perilous situation end quickly, and without question,” he added.
It was not immediately clear what legal authority the president would invoke to impose the levies. Since returning to office, Trump has frequently utilised sweeping tariffs to combat what the administration labels unfair trade practices and to press foreign governments on US interests.
The president has repeatedly claimed the US “needs” Greenland for national security reasons and that Denmark is incapable of ensuring the defence of the island, which is home to 57,000 people and sits at the strategic gateway to the Arctic.
European NATO members recently deployed troops to Greenland for military exercises. France stated the mission was designed to demonstrate a commitment to defending the territory. Denmark confirmed the US had been invited to participate in those exercises.
Trump characterised the resistance from European allies as a threat to global stability, warning that the nations opposing the deal “have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.”
Protests in the Arctic
Trump’s announcement coincided with mass demonstrations on Saturday in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, and across Denmark. Thousands of protesters joined Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen in Nuuk, waving flags and chanting slogans under light rain.
Many demonstrators wore caps reading “Make America Go Away” — a play on Trump’s “Make America Great Again” campaign slogan.
“We don’t want Trump invading Greenland, that is the message,” said Paarniq Larsen Strum, a 44-year-old nurse at the rally. She described the geopolitical stand-off as “nerve-wracking.”
Opposition to the US annexation plan is widespread among residents. A poll published in January 2025 showed 85pc of Greenlanders oppose joining the United States, with only 6pc in favour.
“We demand respect for our country’s right to self-determination and for us as a people,” said Avijaja Rosing-Olsen, an organiser of the demonstration. “This is not only our struggle, it is a struggle that concerns the entire world.”
The situation spurred groups like Uagut, an association of Greenlanders in Denmark, to mobilise. Organisers said their aim was “to send a clear and unified message of respect for Greenland’s democracy and fundamental human rights”. In a display of cultural unity, demonstrators chanted traditional Inuit songs, rejecting the view of their homeland as merely a strategic asset to be bought or sold.
Allies push back
In Copenhagen, protesters showed solidarity, waving Danish and Greenlandic flags and chanting “Kalaallit Nunaat”, the island’s name in Greenlandic.
“You cannot be bullied by an ally. It’s about international law,” said Kirsten Hjoernholm, a 52-year-old charity worker at the protest.
Some placards read “USA already has too much ICE”, a reference to Trump’s deployment of armed immigration officers in US cities.
The dispute occurred as a delegation of US lawmakers, led by Democratic Sen Chris Coons, visited the region for talks with Greenlandic and Danish politicians. Coons told reporters that Trump’s stance was misguided and not supported by the majority of Americans.
Coons insisted there was no security threat justifying the administration’s aggressive posture.
“There are legitimate reasons for us to explore ways to invest better in Arctic security broadly, both in the American Arctic and in our Nato partners and allies,” Coons said.

Mehmood Khan Achakzai

• Newly appointed NA opposition leader terms preventing Imran from meeting his family a violation of fundamental rights• Urges political parties to decide whether ‘voice of majority’ or ‘undemocratic forces’ will be supreme
SANN (Jamshoro): The leader of the country’s main opposition alliance believes that there can only be talks if the other side realises that excesses have been committed that need to be redressed.
Dawn caught up with Mehmood Khan Achakzai, the newly-appointed Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, at the residence of Syed Zain Shah on Saturday, where he had arrived to attend the 122nd birth anniversary celebrations of G.M. Syed.
However, Mr Achakzai made it clear that he was speaking in his ca­­pacity as leader of the Tehreek Tah­afuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance.
“I haven’t yet received the notification, that’s why I will comment as TTAP leader,” he said in response to a question about how he would manifest his role as the opposition leader in the assembly.
On the subject of possible talks with the rulers to defuse prevailing political tensions, Mr Achakzai said, “If someone has the realisation that excesses have been committed, then there is recourse and treatment too. Let’s then talk.”
The TTAP leader was adamant that denying Imran Khan’s family access to him was a violation of fundamental rights, basic ethics, and humanity.
Questioned about Rana Sanaul­lah’s claim that while PTI leaders want negotiations, but Mr Khan does­n’t, Mr Achakzai posed a counter-question: “Talks on what issue? If someone robs the home of Saeen [Zain Shah] and loots everyone,” he said, gesturing towards his surro­undings, “then talks will be held [with the robbers] to recover the looted goods”.
He said everyone knows it was Imran Khan who won the elections with a resounding majority, and the fact that the most popular leader in the country was not even being al­­lowed to meet his family while in prison, was deplorable.
“A car can be invented, not a political leader. A leader emerges from amongst the masses,” he said.
Talking about his bitter past with the incarcerated PTI founder, he said it was no longer an issue since he and MWM chief Raja Nasir Abbas had joined hands with Mr Khan when he was in trouble.
While his associates are being punished or offered bribes, “I am one of those jumping in to help people in trouble”, he said.
Mr Achakzai urged major political parties to generate a consensus on a few crucial things — Pakistan being a federation; constitutional supremacy; parliament to serve as a bastion of power and to frame external and internal policies; people of federating units to have first right over their resources; and, respect for their languages and cultures.
“There should be talks whether Jamhoor (the people) will be supre­­me or the undemocratic forces,” he opined. He said that Pakistan was a pluralist state where people’s languages and cultures should be respected. Injustices engender hate and this leads to conflict, he said.
He was of the view that ever since the inception of Pakistan, civilian authority had not been allowed to establish itself.
On whether 26th and 27th Amend­ments served democracy, he said: “Many believe there has been constitutional demise in their wake. Two judges, who are supposed to interpret the Constitution, resigned. The judiciary’s wings are clipped, journalism is banned. Now, parliament is no longer even a debating society. To date, nothing has been brought before parliament for debate.”
He noted that a single individual could not handle the current situation. “Collective wisdom” could work.
“The TTAP was formed because we had foreseen then that this parliament [after the Feb 8 polls] will come after the Constitution, because everything is being done through the assembly,” he said, recalling that after Gen Ayub Khan’s martial law, parliament had passed a two-line resolution to forgive him for his crimes.

The impressive performance enabled Pakistan to overtake Vietnam and emerge as the world’s third-largest rice exporter, behind India and Thailand, during the month.
According to trade data, Pakistan exported 489,000 tonnes of rice in December 2025, excluding shipments to Iran, compared to Vietnam’s 387,000 tonnes. This marks Pakistan’s best monthly rice export performance, underscoring renewed momentum in the sector.
The UAE remained the top destination for Pakistani rice, importing 74,897 tonnes, including 16,850 tonnes of Basmati. China followed closely with 74,685 tonnes, while other major destinations included Tanzania (62,900 tonnes), Kenya (60,300 tonnes), Ivory Coast (41,700 tonnes), Guinea-Bissau (31,850 tonnes), Malaysia (23,930 tonnes), Madagascar (17,800 tonnes), Kazakhstan (17,050 tonnes), Saudi Arabia (16,032 tonnes, including 5,350 tonnes of Basmati), the EU and UK combined (21,100 tonnes, including 15,600 tonnes of Basmati), Oman (5,770 tonnes), the United States (2,230 tonnes), and Canada (1,321 tonnes).

December surge boosts rankings despite structural challenges

A notable development during December was Pakistan’s growing footprint in Central Asian markets. Exports to Kazakhstan exceeded 17,000 tonnes, including 10,300 tonnes of Basmati, while shipments to Uzbekistan stood at 10,382 tonnes. Industry experts say this reflects a structural shift, as Pakistan is now exporting directly to Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Previously, much of this trade moved indirectly through Afghanistan, but the closure of the Afghan border has prompted direct export routes, making Pakistan’s presence in the region more visible.
Despite the encouraging December figures, the rice export sector continues to face deep-rooted challenges. Structural, financial, marketing, and capacity-related weaknesses persist, with one of the most significant gaps being Pakistan’s negligible exports to Iraq — currently the world’s second-largest importer of Indian Basmati rice after Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Pakistan’s exports to Turkiye, a key transit hub for Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and parts of Eastern Europe, remain minimal.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has recently directed authorities to formulate a comprehensive strategy to boost rice exports and reduce the widening trade deficit.
Government officials have attributed the downturn to low-priced Indian rice and phytosanitary rejections at borders. However, exporters argue that Pakistan’s rice sector is suffering primarily due to policy missteps.
Hamid Malik, a rice sector analyst, says the causes include intense global competition, higher global production — especially in India — weakening international demand, rising ocean freight and logistics costs, inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, irrational regulatory frameworks, inflated domestic prices caused by hoarding and undocumented money, and security-related border closures.
Amid these challenges, Malik sees several positive developments as a silver lining. “There is strong demand for Pakistani rice in Bangladesh, although higher freight costs have eroded competitiveness.”
Central Asian states are also emerging as promising markets since the start of Pakistan’s harvesting season in October 2025. Additionally, a 50pc tariff imposed by the United States on Indian rice exports has begun to benefit Pakistan, with shipments to the US gradually picking up, says Abu Bakr, an exporter.
Another significant development is unfolding in Iran, where foreign exchange shortages have led the Iranian Central Bank to stop issuing subsidised foreign exchange for rice imports. Iranian traders are now importing rice using their own funds, a shift that has favoured Pakistan due to geographic proximity. Pakistani exporters report a surge in Iranian demand, while Indian exporters have been adversely affected.

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs6.159 trillion during July-December FY26 against the target of Rs6.490tr, a shortfall of Rs331bn. However, it is 10pc higher compared to the year-ago figure of Rs5.618tr.
The borrowing in 1HFY26 means the government spent much higher than the last year.
This is also interesting to note that the State Bank reported a net profit of Rs2.5tr for FY25, which was transferred to the federal government. Despite this additional liquidity, the government is borrowing heavily from banks.
Banks are comfortable to invest in the government papers as they get risk-free high yields which made the financial sector most stable financial sector.
Last week the banks bids for the treasury bills auctions were Rs2.5tr reflecting the eagerness of banks to park their liquidity in the safest place.
“Investments in government securities remained the main driver of banking sector balance sheet,” said the State Bank in its annual report for 2024-25.

According to an official of the polio laboratory located at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, as many as 127 sewage samples from 87 districts were tested for the presence of poliovirus in December 2025. Of these, 87 samples tested negative, while 40 samples were found positive for poliovirus.
“As many as 23 samples were collected from Balochistan, of which 21 were found negative and two were found positive. A total of 34 samples were collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, of which 26 were negative and eight were found positive. From Punjab, 31 samples were collected, of which 25 were negative and six were positive. In Sindh, six samples were found negative and 23 were positive. In Islamabad, one out of five samples was found positive. However, five samples collected from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan were found negative,” the official said.
Replying to a question, the official explained that if the virus causing the crippling disease was found in sewage, the sample was termed positive, while the paralysis of a child caused by the virus was recorded as a positive case. “A sewage water sample from an area is a basic parameter used to determine whether polio vaccination campaigns are being carried out successfully. After detection of positive samples, polio campaigns are immediately launched to eradicate the virus from the area,” he said.
“A polio case can be reported in any city due to the frequent movement of people from one city to another, but the presence of the virus in sewage water means that a vaccination campaign in the area did not meet its target. The presence of the virus in sewage water also indicates that the immunity level of local children has fallen and that they are at risk of the disease,” the official explained.
According to a statement, in 2025 the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, led by the government of Pakistan, conducted six vaccination campaigns, including five nationwide and one subnational drive, reaching over 45 million children.
As part of this roadmap, the first nationwide polio campaign of 2026 will be conducted from February 2 to 8 in all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children under the age of five.
“To further strengthen immunity, the government of Pakistan continues to provide free routine immunisation services for all children up to two years of age. Together, routine immunisation and repeated polio vaccination provide the strongest and most reliable protection against polio and other preventable diseases.
Parents and caregivers are strongly urged to en­­sure that children under five re­­ceive polio drops during every vaccination campaign to protect them from lifelong disability,” it stated.

Speakers stressed that the city’s green spaces were steadily being replaced by concrete due to weak governance, elite capture and a persistent conflict between populist decision-making and professional, science-based planning.
A key outcome of the discussion was a strong call for a new, collaborative approach to sustainable urban development through the establishment of a dedicated Islamabad-focused think tank. Participants emphasised the need to bring together independent professionals, policymakers, civil society and creative communities, including architects, designers and artists, to develop long-term, people-centred solutions. 
The webinar underscored that environmental degradation was not only an ecological issue but also a major public health concern, making citizen engagement and collective responsibility essential.
The webinar was organised by the Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) on the theme “Islamabad’s Green Future – Coping with Irrational Development”. It brought together environmental experts, policymakers, civil society members and concerned citizens to deliberate on the growing environmental challenges facing the federal capital.
Environmental expert Dr Tariq Banuri highlighted that environmental protection efforts were being undermined by institutional weaknesses and the marginalisation, and at times harassment, of environmental professionals and activists working to safeguard protected hills, forests and wildlife habitats.
Participants agreed that without transparent, democratic and inclusive governance, Islamabad’s ecological balance would continue to deteriorate. Dr Banuri focused on the environmental consequences of rapid and often unplanned urban development and underscored the urgent need for sustainable governance models that balance economic growth with environmental conservation.
He said Islamabad’s environmental degradation was a symptom of deeper governance challenges, pointing to elite capture, weak institutional frameworks and the ongoing tension between populism and professionalism as key factors driving the replacement of green spaces with unchecked concrete development.
Dr Zafar Mirza strongly condemned the ongoing tree-cutting in Islamabad, terming it a brutal act against nature and a direct assault on public health and environmental sustainability. Emphasising the power of citizen-led action, he suggested forming active citizens’ forums modelled on initiatives such as “Lahore Bachaao”, which have played a critical watchdog and advocacy role in urban conservation.
He said similar collective platforms in Islamabad could significantly contribute to protecting green spaces and the Margalla Hills National Park by raising public awareness, monitoring violations and holding authorities accountable for safeguarding the city’s natural heritage.
Former senator Mian Attiq stressed the urgent need to establish an independent, multidisciplinary think tank to guide the CDA on sustainable planning and environmental governance in Islamabad. 
He said evidence-based advice from professionals and experts was essential to correct the city’s current development trajectory.
Former Pak-EPA director general Ziaul Islam criticised the ineffective bureaucratic approaches dominating environmental governance in Islamabad, noting that such top-down systems often ignored ground realities and community knowledge.
Devcom Director Munir Ahmed said Islamabad was witnessing an alarming wave of tree-cutting that threatened the very identity of the capital as a green and liveable city. “The unchecked felling of trees in the name of development reflects a serious failure of planning and governance,” he said.
He emphasised that the Islamabad High Court and relevant parliamentary committees should play a proactive, pro-citizens role, calling for accountable governance, restoration of institutional mandates and meaningful participation of independent environmental professionals and citizens in decision-making.
Internationally known ecosystems expert Ashiq Ahmed Khan said sustainable development was fundamentally a governance challenge as much as an environmental one. 
He said true sustainability could not be achieved without inclusive and democratic decision-making processes that gave space to collective voices, particularly those of independent experts, local communities and civil society.
Others who spoke on the occasion included Rabia Raheel, Ivan Carmody, Abdul Shakoor Sindhu, Almas Shakoor and Silvia Shamoon.

The announcements from those leaders came after the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel.
Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory, which lies in rubble after two-plus years of relentless Israeli bombardment.
The moves came after a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue.
In Canada, a senior aide to Prime Minister Mark Carney said he intended to accept Trump’s invitation, while in Turkiye, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had been asked to become a “founding member” of the board.
Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said Cairo was “studying” a request for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to join.
Sharing an image of the invitation letter, Argentine President Javier Milei wrote on X that it would be “an honor” to participate in the initiative.







Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the heads of state of around 60 countries had recieved the charter of Trump’s proposed ‘Board of Peace’.
The document was sent to 60 heads of state — including in Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia — along with an invitation to join the board, the publication reported while quoting diplomatic sources.
According to the document, the board will work to “restore dependable and lawful governance and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” in place of other organisations, the report said.
“The charter also implicitly criticises the UN. It opens with emphasising the need for ‘a more nimble and effective international peace-building body’, adding that durable peace requires ‘the courage to depart from … institutions that have too often failed’,” the report added.
Meanwhile, in a statement sent to AFP, Blair said: “I thank President Trump for his leadership in establishing the Board of Peace and am honored to be appointed to its Executive Board.”
Blair is a controversial figure in the Middle East because of his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Trump himself said last year that he wanted to make sure Blair was an “acceptable choice to everybody”.
Blair spent years focused on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as representative of the “Middle East Quartet” — the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia — after leaving Downing Street in 2007.
The White House said the Board of Peace will take on issues such as “governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding and capital mobilisation”.
The other members of the board so far are World Bank President Ajay Banga, an Indian-born American businessman; billionaire US financier Marc Rowan; and Robert Gabriel, a loyal Trump aide who serves on the US National Security Council.
Trump has created a second “Gaza executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role.
It was not immediately clear which world leaders were asked to be on each board.
The White House, which said on Friday that additional members would be named to both entities, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Israel objects to line-up of Gaza governing body
Separately, Israel said on Saturday it objected to the line-up of the Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern post-war Gaza, which began its work in Cairo this week.
“The announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy,” said a statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“The prime minister has instructed the foreign affairs minister to contact the US secretary of state on this matter,” it added.
Israel strikes
Washington has said the Gaza plan had gone on to a second phase — from implementing the ceasefire to disarming Hamas.
On Friday, Trump named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to head the International Stabilisation Force, which will be tasked with providing security in Gaza and training a new police force to succeed Hamas.
Jeffers, from special operations in US Central Command, in late 2024 was put in charge of monitoring a ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, which has continued periodic strikes aimed at Hezbollah militants.
Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath was earlier tapped to head the governing committee.
Trump, a real estate developer, has previously mused about turning devastated Gaza into a Riviera-style area of resorts, although he has backed away from calls to forcibly displace the population.</p><small>2026-01-17 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1718270443769f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967495/u-19-world-cup-no-handshake-between-india-and-bangladesh-at-toss-but-players-shake-hands-after-game' target='_blank'><strong>U-19 World Cup: No handshake between India and Bangladesh at toss but players shake hands after game</strong></a><br><p>The captains of India and Bangladesh skipped the customary handshake during the toss of their U-19 World Cup match but the two sides did shake hands at the end of the game, which the former won.
At the toss, Bangladesh’s acting captain Zawad Abrar and India’s captain Ayush Mhatre did not do the customary handshake at the pre-match toss, which the former won.







“There were, however, handshakes between the teams at the end of the game, which India won by 18 runs (DLS method),” ESPN Cricinfo reported.
The report also quoted a statement from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) as saying that the “absence of a handshake with the opposition captain was completely unintentional and resulted from a momentary lapse in concentration”.
“There was no intent whatsoever to show discourtesy or disregard towards the opposition,” the report quoted the BCB as saying in a statement.
“The board has viewed the matter with due seriousness, as upholding the spirit of cricket and respect for opponents is a fundamental prerequisite for representing Bangladesh at any level and immediately advised the team management accordingly,” the BCB was quoted as saying.
“The players have also been reminded of their responsibility to maintain the highest standards of sportsmanship, camaraderie and mutual respect in all interactions with opposing teams,” it added.
It is worth mentioning that Indian cricketers had refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during last year’s Asia Cup matches, in the aftermath of a military conflict between the two countries.
Saturday’s development comes as Bangladesh has announced that it will not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team.
Mustafizur, who has played in the IPL for other teams in previous editions, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million. His sacking sparked fury in Dhaka.
Subsequently, Bangladesh “formally requested” the International Cricket Council to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
Earlier this week, during a video conference with the ICC, the BCB said it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.
Political relations between India and Bangladesh had soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.</p><small>2026-01-17 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1721570533aaf16.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967502/inquiry-committee-formed-to-probe-karachi-port-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Inquiry committee formed to probe Karachi port fire</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Maritime Affairs on Saturday constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the cause of a fire at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT) a day earlier.
Imported goods, mostly lithium batteries, stored in at least 20 containers were destroyed as a huge fire erupted at the KICT at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on Friday afternoon, according to officials.
A press release issued on Saturday said that Maritime Affairs Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry had constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the cause of the fire and to “fix responsibility to prevent similar incidents in the future”.
The committee will comprise senior officers from KPT, who will coordinate with KICT operators to determine the reasons for the incident, it said.
“KICT is a private terminal and the primary responsibility for safety measures at the container terminal rests with its administration,” the minister was quoted as saying.
The press release further said the minister took immediate notice of the incident and directed all concerned officials, including KPT Chairman Rear Admiral (retd) Shahid Ahmed, to utilise all available resources to bring the blaze under control and also sought a detailed report on the incident.
The statement said the KPT team supervised the firefighting operation and brought the fire under control, adding that no loss of life was reported.
It added that the minister also announced appreciation certificates for members of the KPT team involved in the firefighting operation, and particularly lauded the role of KPT General Manager (Engineering) Rear Admiral Kashif Munir and his team.
He added that the extent of financial losses and the exact cause of the fire were yet to be determined, and that investigations were ongoing, the statement said.
The statement also said that a report by KPT was submitted on the directives of the minister. According to the report, the fire erupted at around 1:35pm near Berth Number 27 at KICT Terminal, Karachi Port.
The incident was reported to KPT Central Fire Brigade and fire tenders were dispatched to the scene, the statement said.
“Upon arrival, it was observed that the fire/smoke was spreading quickly in the closely placed set of containers which were also placed on one another [sic],” it said.
It said that KPT fire tenders responded effectively in containing the fire, while support was also requested from the Pakistan Navy, the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works and Rescue 1122.
“The report stated a total of eight fire tenders from KPT were deployed on-site, supported by four fire tenders from the Pakistan Navy, one from Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works and two fire tenders from Rescue 1122,” it added.
“Through swift action, effective coordination, and professional handling by all responding teams, the fire was successfully brought under control, preventing its spread and ensuring the safety of port infrastructure and operations,” the press release said.
South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Friday that during the initial probe, it emerged that the fire erupted due to a short circuit inside a container.</p><small>2026-01-17 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17213017ccd8b72.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967501/india-fines-indigo-record-245m-after-december-flight-cancellations' target='_blank'><strong>India fines IndiGo record $2.45m after December flight cancellations</strong></a><br><p>India’s aviation regulator on Saturday fined IndiGo a record 222 million Indian rupees ($2.45m) for poor pilot roster planning that led to mass flight cancellations in December.
The regulator also issued warnings to senior personnel, including to Chief Operating Officer Isidre Porqueras and to Jason Herter, senior vice president of operations control centre, with directions to IndiGo to relieve Herter “of current operational responsibilities”.
A government source said the fine was the largest to date.
IndiGo has been ordered to provide a bank guarantee of $5.51m in favour of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, to ensure “compliance with the directives and long-term systemic correction,” the regulator said.
IndiGo said in a statement that the board and management were “committed to taking full cognisance of the orders and will, in a thoughtful and timely manner, take appropriate measures”.
India’s largest airline cancelled about 4,500 flights in the initial weeks of December, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded all over the country and leading to chaos at airports.</p><small>2026-01-17 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17204821ed720ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967500/speaker-sadiq-says-statements-against-pakistan-armed-forces-will-not-be-allowed-in-national-assembly' target='_blank'><strong>Speaker Sadiq says statements against Pakistan, armed forces will not be allowed in National Assembly</strong></a><br><p>Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Saturday said that statements against Pakistan, the judiciary or the armed forces would not be allowed on the floor of the National Assembly.
According to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat, the speaker made the remarks while visiting the National College of Arts (NCA) in Lahore.







“Negative or controversial remarks on the role of the judiciary, the armed forces of Pakistan and judges are unacceptable,” he said. He further stated that any kind of remarks against the armed forces was “intolerable”.
He further stated that only those remarks that fell within the ambit of the law and the Constitution would be allowed.
“Those who speak against Pakistan will not be allowed to express their views on the floor of the National Assembly,” he was quoted as saying.
Sadiq further asserted that as the NA speaker, he would continue to play an impartial role.
He further said that in a democratic society, protesting was a citizen’s right. However, this protest should be peaceful and remain within the ambit of the law and the Constitution, he said.
“There is no room for arson, damage to life and property or vandalism,” Sadiq was quoted as saying, adding that the “use of sticks and weapons” was a threat to the rule of law.
The development comes a little over a month after Senate Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasar barred criticism of “national heroes” and political leadership in the House.
“You cannot speak against political heroes who suffered martyrdom, went into exile, worked for the nation and the country, conducted nuclear tests, and made [the] nuclear bomb,” he had remarked just after finishing the day’s agenda amid voices of dissent from the opposition benches.
He had later vowed to enforce his ruling. In an informal conversation with media persons at the Parliament House, he had made it clear that derogatory or disrespectful remarks against national heroes whether from the armed forces, politics, judiciary, or any national institution cannot be tolerated within the House.
“Every member has the right to express views, but that right must be exercised within the constitutional framework, rules of procedure, and established parliamentary traditions,” he had emphasised.</p><small>2026-01-17 16:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/17202647d314670.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967491/incarcerated-pti-leaders-call-for-appointing-mwm-chief-abbas-opposition-leader-in-senate-immediately' target='_blank'><strong>Incarcerated PTI leaders call for appointing MWM chief Abbas opposition leader in Senate ‘immediately’</strong></a><br><p>Senior PTI leaders imprisoned in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail on Saturday demanded that Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas be appointed the Senate opposition leader immediately.
In a letter seen by Dawn, PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and Umar Sarfraz Cheema congratulated veteran politician Mehmood Khan Achakzai on his appointment as the opposition leader in the National Assembly after a months-long delay.
The letter was shared with the media by their counsel, Rana Mudassir.
The PTI leaders hoped Achakzai, under the guidance of party founder Imran Khan, would fulfil his responsibility in restoring democracy and the Constitution, ensuring the rule of law, the supremacy of the judiciary and the protection of the fundamental rights of the people and political workers.
They also hoped that Achakzai would hold consultations on lifting Pakistan out of the quagmire and economic crisis it has been dealing with for the past four years.
They noted that the government had appointed the NA opposition leader after much delay, adding that Nasir should be appointed the opposition leader in the upper house of Parliament “immediately”.
Earlier in the day, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had also commented on the matter while speaking to Geo News in Lahore.
Asked when the Senate opposition leader would be appointed, he said: “That will also happen. The Senate chairman is serving as the acting president right now … Sherry Rehman chaired yesterday’s meeting.
“Once the Senate chairman returns, then this will also happen,” the minister added.
Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Achakzai was finally appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly on Friday — a slot that had been lying vacant for almost five months since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub.
Incarcerated PTI founder Imran had named Achakzai and Abbas for the opposition leader’s slot in the NA and the Senate, respectively, last year in August.
The Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan (ECP) had disqualified both the-then NA and Senate opposition leaders, Ayub and Shibli Faraz, respectively, in August following their convictions in cases rela­ted to the May 9, 2023 riots.</p><small>2026-01-17 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1719231961dbc5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967498/presidents-trophy-ptv-creates-world-record-for-lowest-target-defended-in-first-class-cricket' target='_blank'><strong>President’s Trophy: PTV creates world record for lowest target defended in first-class cricket</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Television (PTV) created a world record of defending the lowest target in all first-class cricket when they stopped the opposition in a chase of just 40 runs.
PTV, defending champions in the President’s Trophy, shot Sui Northern Gas (SNGPL) for a paltry 37 to win the match by a mere two runs on day three of the four-day game.
This becomes a new record in 253 years of first-class cricket, beating England’s Oldfield’s 1794 feat when they successfully defended 41 against MCC at the Lord’s Old Ground to win by six runs.







PTV’s head coach Mohammad Waseem praised his team’s historic effort.
“I am delighted with my team’s world record effort,” Waseem told AFP. “My team’s motto is to never give up, fight till the last ball,” he said.
“This is not the first time we have won all our three matches coming from well behind by remaining positive in all situations.”
The star-studded SNGPL batting led by Pakistan Test captain Shan Masood were bowled out in 19.4 overs with just one batter, Saifullah Bangash, crossing double figures with 14.
Masood was out without scoring while Test players, Mohammad Ali made six and spinner Sajid Khan just three.
Pakistan’s international players Omair Bin Yousuf made six and Abdul Samad five.
For the winners, left-arm spinner Ali Usman wrecked the batting with 6-9 and pacer Ammad Butt took 4-28 - the only two bowlers used in their second innings innings.
SNGPL’s head coach is former Pakistan Test skipper Misbahul Haq with another former captain Azhar Ali their batting coach.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar lauded the PTV team for their record win, saying: “Well done my boys! Kudos to you.”







“PTV’s rise is no coincidence,” he said, adding that “this is what happens when talent is backed, hard work is valued, and merit is rewarded”.
Tarar noted the previous as well as current success of the team was due to the importance of merit and refusal of favours. “Merit and only merit. Have refused all sifarish,” he said.
He said it was a proud moment for the entire PTV management.</p><small>2026-01-17 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171757243da7749.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967496/social-media-posts-case-non-bailable-arrest-warrants-for-imaan-hadi-reissued' target='_blank'><strong>Social media posts case: Non-bailable arrest warrants for Imaan, Hadi reissued</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A district and sessions court on Saturday reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, for their repeated absences from trial proceedings.
In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
Court proceedings on Saturday were conducted over three sittings — 9am, noon and 2pm. At each stage, Imaan and Hadi were absent from the proceedings.
In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka — presiding over the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Court (Islamabad-West) — noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest.
At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad High Court.
The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused.
Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants.
The court ordered that once Imaan and Hadi were arrested, they could be produced via video link to join proceedings on Monday.
On Thursday, the same court had cancelled Imaan and Hadi’s bail following repeated absences and heated scenes in the courtroom.
The court had expressed displeasure over the conduct of the accused and the defence, revoked their right to cross-examination, and ordered that their statements under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) be recorded.
The prosecution, led by Special Public Prosecutor Rana Usman, had opposed adjournments, while the courtroom proceedings had been disrupted by a heated exchange between the prosecutor and Islamabad District Bar Association President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, prompting the judge to briefly rise from the bench.
The case will now be taken up on Monday, subject to the execution of the arrest warrants.
The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad.
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.</p><small>2026-01-17 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171639590f69121.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967489/irans-khamenei-says-trump-guilty-for-the-casualties-in-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Iran’s Khamenei says Trump ‘guilty for the casualties’ in protests</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday accused US President Donald Trump of being responsible for “casualties” during a protest wave in the country that rights groups said was met with a deadly crackdown.
“We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,” he told a crowd of supporters during an address marking a religious holiday.
“This was an American conspiracy,” Khamenei said, adding that “America’s goal is to swallow Iran … the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination”.
“By God’s grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition,” he said.
“We do not intend to lead the country to war, but we will not spare domestic criminals,” he added, saying that “international criminals” were “worse” and would also not be spared punishment.
Iranian authorities have blamed the United States for fuelling a “terrorist operation” that they say hijacked peaceful protests over the economy.
Iran was rocked by weeks of demonstrations sparked by anger over economic hardship that exploded into the biggest protests against the Islamic republic in more than three years.
Meanwhile, after repeated warnings, Trump on Thursday had changed his stance on military intervention in Iran, adopting a “watch it and see” posture instead.
He had cited assurances from “very important sources on the other side” indicating that Tehran had ceased using lethal force against demonstrators.
“They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place,” Trump said. Asked by a reporter if US military action was now off the table, the president replied: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is.”</p><small>2026-01-17 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171644183f233f2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967486/institutionalised-islamophobia-pakistan-condemns-profiling-of-mosques-in-occupied-kashmir' target='_blank'><strong>‘Institutionalised Islamophobia’: Pakistan condemns profiling of mosques in occupied Kashmir</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Saturday condemned the reported profiling of mosques and mosque management committees in India-occupied Kashmir, saying the “blatant intrusion into religious affairs constitutes a grave violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion and belief”.
The FO’s statement comes after police in the occupied valley distributed forms to “collect” financial and personal details of mosques and seminaries, including mosque leaders and members of management committees, according to a report by the Hindustan Times, which quoted local residents and Kashmiri leaders.







The action “reflects yet another coercive attempt to intimidate and marginalise the Muslim population of the occupied territory,” the FO said.
The forms included sections for seminary teachers and mosque leaders to provide details of their “Aadhaar cards, bank accounts, property ownership, social media handles, passport, ration card, driving licence, SIM cards and mobile phone model along with the IMEI”, the Hindustan Times reported. It added that details regarding the “religious sect” of the mosques were also sought.
A lawmaker from Srinagar called it “an infringement of the religious freedom guaranteed under the Indian Constitution,” saying the move aimed to “control religion and mosques”, the report said.
In the statement released on Saturday, the FO said, “The forcible collection of personal details, photographs and sectarian affiliations of religious functionaries amounts to systematic harassment, aimed at instilling fear among worshippers and obstructing the free exercise of their faith.
“These actions form part of a broader pattern of institutionalised Islamophobia driven by the Hindutva ideology of the occupying Indian government,” said the statement, adding the “selective targeting of mosques and Muslim clergy lays bare the discriminatory and communal character of these policies”.
The FO maintained that the “people of Jammu and Kashmir possess an inalienable right to practice their religion without fear, coercion or discrimination”.
“Pakistan will continue to stand in solidarity with them and will persist in raising its voice against all forms of religious persecution and intolerance targeting Kashmiris,” said the statement.
In November, United Nations experts sounded the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the Indian government, issuing the warning in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.</p><small>2026-01-17 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645696-pakistan-us-vow-to-bolster-security-border-management-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US vow to bolster security, border management cooperation</strong></a><br><p>

In Sargodha, six children were among 14 dead, while nine others were injured in the early hours of Saturday when a truck carrying cargo and passengers fell into a canal from the Galapur Bangla bridge due to fog, said Rescue 1122.
According to Punjab Rescue 1122 officials, the truck was travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad with 23 people on board for a funeral when the unfortunate incident took place.
“Due to heavy fog, the motorway was closed, so the vehicle took a local route. In the area of Kot Momin tehsil, the truck fell from the Galapur bridge into the canal,” said a statement from Rescue 1122, adding that the truck “lost control because of poor visibility”.
The Rescue 1122 statement added that the canal was dry, but passengers were stuck beneath the truck when it overturned.
The injured were provided first aid on site and were then taken to Civil Hospital Kot Momin, along with the bodies. Three of the injured were later shifted to Kot Momin Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.
“The incident was reported at 1:48am on January 17, 2026, after which rescue operations were launched immediately,” said the statement.
Dense fog often paralyses traffic on Punjab’s motorways and major thoroughfares during the winter months.
Earlier in the day, different sections of motorways, including the M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4 and M-11 were closed due to dense fog, according to the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP).







On Tuesday, 10 people died and 21 were injured in multiple fog-related accidents across Punjab.
Four lost their lives in a collision between a bus, a car and a motorcycle in Toba Tek Singh; three were killed when a car and a truck collided near Bhaban on the Indus Highway; three died in two separate accidents in Okara; and seven were critically injured in a multi-vehicle accident in Gujrat.
In early December, reduced visibility due to fog resulted in the collision of six trailer trucks on the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5), leaving seven people injured.
10 dead, over dozen injured in Makran Coastal Highway accident
Separately, 10 people died and over a dozen were injured when a speeding passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway at Hudd Goth near Gwadar’s Ormara tehsil.
In an update, the Edhi rescue service said 10 individuals, including a girl, had died in the accident.
It added that an Edhi mobile morgue had been sent to Ormara to bring the bodies to Karachi.
The coach was heading to Jiwani from Karachi, according to Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police (SP) Aslam Bangulzai. Earlier in the day, the officer had said nine people died and 14 others were wounded in the accident.
He added that the deceased hailed from various parts of Sindh and were going to Jiwani for labour.
SP Bangulzai said the bodies and the injured were initially taken to PNS Darman Jah Hospital in Ormara.



Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti held a telephone conversation with Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah to discuss the accident, his office said on X.
They exchanged details regarding the condition of the injured passengers and the medical treatment being provided to them.
The statement added that on the directives of CM Bugti, critically injured passengers were being airlifted to private hospitals in Karachi for advanced medical care.
The chief minister instructed Gwadar Deputy Commissioner Naqeebullah Khan and other relevant authorities to ensure the “immediate shifting of the injured and timely completion of all administrative arrangements”.
DC Naqeebullah was quoted as saying that all passengers injured in the accident hailed from Sindh.







Condolences
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed their deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the Sargodha and Ormara accidents, Radio Pakistan reported.
President Zardari offered condolences to the families of the deceased and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
He stressed that changing weather conditions were an undeniable reality and exercising caution while travelling was essential.
Affirming that safeguarding human lives was the state’s foremost priority, the president instructed provincial governments to enhance public awareness on safe driving.







In his statement, PM Shehbaz prayed for the deceased and directed the authorities concerned to provide the best treatment to the wounded.
He also instructed the authorities to ensure the implementation of traffic laws and safety measures on national highways.
The premier ordered strict monitoring of precautionary measures in view of dense fog to prevent any unfortunate incidents.







Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz Sharif also expressed her deep grief over the loss of precious human lives in the Sargodha truck accident, APP reported.
She emphasised the need for timely rescue and relief operations to support the victims’ families and mitigate the impact of the incident.
CM Maryam directed the commissioner to submit a detailed report on the circumstances leading to the accident and the measures taken for assistance.
She also urged authorities to ensure strict safety protocols on roads and near water channels to prevent such tragic incidents in the future.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
Earlier this month, five passengers lost their lives while 24 others sustained injuries after a bus plunged into a ravine in Punjab’s Talagang district when the driver opted for an alternative route.
On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed and 16 others injured in a head-on collision between a bus carrying players of a university and a van on Jhang-Faisalabad road near the Adda Faqeer Di Kulli area.
According to Rescue 1122, the police and the district administration, the accident occurred due to speeding by both vehicles when one was overtaking while the other was crossing a sugarcane-laden tractor trolley.
Following the incident, four officials of the Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) were suspended for failing to stop the overspeeding vehicles.</p><small>2026-01-17 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645689-blatant-intrusion-pakistan-assails-india-over-mosques-profiling-in-iiojk' target='_blank'><strong>'Blatant intrusion': Pakistan assails India over 'mosques profiling' in IIOJK</strong></a><br><p>

The agreement was reached as Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held a meeting with a high-level US delegation led by US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker.
The meeting featured in-depth deliberation on boosting relations between the two countries and expanding cooperation in shared areas of interest.
It was mutually agreed to further strengthen existing cooperation with the US Anti-terrorism Assistance Programme and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.
During the meeting, matters relating to the establishment of a centre for crime and an academy within the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) with US support also came under review.
The delegation also discussed training programmes for officers of the FIA, Federal Constabulary and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
‎It was also agreed that border security agencies, coastal guards and other institutions would be equipped with modern US-supplied equipment.
Naqvi stated that modern technology would enhance the capacity of border security agencies and coastal guards.
He also welcomed US assistance in the reorganisation of the Federal Constabulary and in strengthening the capabilities of the FIA and the NCCIA. He added that US support in activating FIA’s counterterrorism wing would prove highly beneficial, making it the first federal anti-terrorist wing with effective coordination with provinces.
‎Naqvi said that the NCCIA was carrying out an extensive crackdown on illegal call centres across the country. He noted that advanced software was vital for preventing financial fraud and terror financing, and US cooperation with the NCCIA in this regard was highly significant.
The minister emphasised the need to further expand collaboration with Pakistani institutions. Meanwhile, the US delegation appreciated Pakistan’s efforts to increase security cooperation and strengthen bilateral ties.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her medal on Thursday to Trump, who thanked her for it. The White House released a photo of Trump and Machado, with Trump holding up a gold-coloured frame displaying it, and a White House official said Trump intends to keep it.
Machado’s award also consists of a diploma and 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.19 million).
“Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,” the award body said in a statement.







“There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money. This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items,” it added.
‘Inseparably linked’
The medal and the diploma are physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the prize, said the five-strong award committee.
“The prize itself the honour and recognition remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee,” it said.
The committee, which did not refer to Trump and Machado by name in its statement, said it does not comment on a laureate’s statements, decisions or actions after the prize is announced.
It was not the first time a Nobel laureate has given away the medal. In 1943 Nobel literature laureate Knut Hamsun gave his to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
In 2022, Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov sold his medal for $100 million to raise money for the UN children’s fund UNICEF to help Ukrainian refugee children.
In 2024, the widow of former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan donated his 2001 Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma to the UN office in Geneva.</p><small>2026-01-17 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645633-man-accused-of-sexually-abusing-over-100-children-arrested-with-accomplice-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Man accused of sexually abusing over 100 children arrested with accomplice in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

The United Nations treaty, also known as Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), was finalised in March 2023 after 15 years of negotiations, and will allow the creation of a global network of “marine protected areas” in vast and previously unregulated ocean ecosystems lying in international waters.
“It’s two-thirds of the ocean, (and) it’s half the surface of the planet that for the first time will have a comprehensive legal regime,” said Adam McCarthy, first assistant secretary at the Australian foreign ministry and a co-chair of the treaty’s preparatory committee, speaking at a media briefing.
The treaty reached the threshold of 60 national ratifications on September 19 last year, meaning that it would go formally into operation within 120 days. The number of ratifications has since risen to more than 80, with China, Brazil and Japan adding their names to the list.
Others, including Britain and Australia, are expected to follow soon. The United States signed the treaty during the previous administration but has not yet ratified it.

 

“Whilst we only needed 60 for it to enter into force, obviously it’s really critical for its implementation and for it to be as effective as possible for us to achieve global or universal ratification of the treaty,” said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups.
“We’re really aiming for all UN member states to ratify the treaty.”
Under the treaty, countries must conduct environmental assessments of activities that have an impact on ocean ecology. It will also create mechanisms allowing nations to share the spoils of the “blue economy”, including “marine genetic resources” used in industries such as biotechnology.
Environmentalists say more than 190,000 protected areas would need to be established in order to meet the “30 by 30” target to bring 30pc of the oceans under formal protection by 2030. Currently, only about 8pc — or 29 million square kilometres — is protected.
But the treaty will have little impact on what some conservationists identify as one of the greatest threats facing the marine environment — the clamour to extract mineral resources from the ocean bed.
“BBNJ is very ambitious but there are certain defined limits,” McCarthy said.
“The question of mining in the substrate or in the seabed simply belongs to the ISA (International Seabed Authority). It’s not something where the BBNJ gets a role.”</p><small>2026-01-17 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/171150056266a8a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967480/dar-expresses-hope-for-peace-stability-in-iran-in-phone-call-with-araghchi-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Dar expresses hope for peace, stability in Iran in phone call with Araghchi: FO</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar expressed his hope for peace and stability in Iran on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
According to a post by the FO on X, Dar spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in a phone call in which the two diplomats discussed the current situation in Iran and the wider region.
Dar “expressed hope for peace and stability, and both sides agreed to continue bilateral consultations on matters of mutual interest”, the statement added.







On Thursday, Pakistan had expressed hope at the United Nations Security Council for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, which saw its largest demonstrations in years, challenging the country’s government.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds.
Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions.
US President Donald Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters. However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country.
Meanwhile, the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in neighbouring Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in Iran were directly linked to Pakistan’s own interests. He also said that Pakistan was engaging with Washington on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran.
Earlier this week, Iran’s envoy to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, met the chairman of the National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem, where he expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support. He said it had been given “wholeheartedly”, stressing that the country needed moral and political support, rather than material assistance.</p><small>2026-01-17 07:19</small></div><hr>
