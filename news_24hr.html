OUR existence is a rhythm which continues to play every 24 hours, throughout our lives. This is true for all living beings — animals, plants and even microorganisms. Sounds a bit poetic, a bit mystical — indeed that’s how our existence is.
Our body functions are hardwired to an endogenous day and night clock. We follow this in autopilot mode — not at the conscious level, but very much like breathing. We breathe all the time but we don’t have to think about breathing. Likewise, a route is set for our bodies to follow every 24 hours (with individual variations of up to four hours or so). It is an intrinsic autonomous daily routine called the circadian rhythm. Here is a super summary of it.
As the darkness of the night fades and sunlight gradually takes over, light enters our eyes and strikes the retina at the back. The photoreceptor cells of the retina convert the light into neural signals, which are then transmitted through the optic nerve to the hypothalamus, a part in the forebrain which regulates many autonomic functions, for example, temperature, hunger, sleep and emotions. The light signal stimulates a particular part of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which then triggers the release of a hormone called cortisol. This is primarily secreted by the adrenal glands located on top of our kidneys.

To be healthy is to be in sync with our circadian rhythm.

Cortisol is an arousal hormone, which activates the body. Between 7am and 8am, our pancreas secretes the maximum insulin and our body needs glucose, so it’s time for a hearty breakfast. Around 9am, testosterone levels are elevated, which imparts a sense of well-being and boosts energy, among other functions. Around 10am our hormones have prepared us to face the world and we are ready for the day. Our alertness peaks at this time.
Between 2pm and 6pm, our body temperature reaches its daily high, which makes our muscles more flexible and pliable. We have the greatest cardiovascular and skeletal muscle strength at around 5pm. At 6pm, we have the highest level of lipids in our bloodstream. It is in anticipation of the fasting period at night during sleep since lipid metabolism is slow. At around 8pm, we have the highest level of neutrophils circulating in our body. As guardians against inflammation, these white blood cells are ready to take their position during the night in our cells to undertake immune surveillance and respond to any cell damage.
Around 9pm, the small cone-shaped pineal gland, situated almost at the centre of the brain between the two hemispheres, slowly starts releasing the sleep hormone melatonin. We are tired, start yawning and are ready to fall asleep. Between 2am to 4am we have the deepest restorative sleep. This is when we don’t even see dreams and are unconscious. During this phase we have our lowest body temperature in 24 hours. After deep sleep, there is again a gradual build-up of cortisol and we slowly wake up, also due to sunlight, ready for another day.
Day after day, apart from autonomous breathing, a beating heart, constant digestive work in our gut, the functioning of our liver and kidneys, there is a timetable followed by our hormones which bring changes in our physiology at fixed times of the day.
 
 

The science of the circadian rhythm has been a subject of constant inquiry by researchers. Experiments have startled scientists who find that even if a person is kept constantly in a dark environment for 24 hours and there are no external stimuli of light, the body still follows the timings of the circadian rhythm. The same is true for plants. Most readers would know about the plant called touch-me-not (Mimosa Pudica), which folds its leaves on being touched. This plant has been extensively studied. Normally, it folds its leaves at night and unfurls them in sunlight. However, it would still follow the same routine if kept in complete darkness for 24 hours, i.e., folding and unfurling its leaves at fixed times of the 24-hour day.
This shows that these attributes of organisms are deeply embedded in our existence at the genetic level. In 1971, a gene was finally located in a fruit fly by American chronobiologists. They called it a ‘period (per) gene’. The per gene is “the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioural rhythmicity”. Later, another gene called the ‘time gene’ was also discovered. They also demonstrated that if these genes are destroyed then the fruit fly loses its circadian rhythm. Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young were given the Nobel Prize of Physiology or Medicine in 2017 for this “cracking the clock” discovery.
The quote in the beginning of the column is from a press release issued by the Nobel Committee at the time of bestowing this Nobel Prize. Please read this again. Our state of health and disease has a lot to do with how much we are aligned or misaligned with our circadian rhythm.
 
 

External stimuli, those in the environment — for instance, light, temperature and especially those we generate ourselves through our lifestyle behaviour — if not aligned with our circadian rhythm, can have a huge negative effect on our health and we become prone to developing various diseases. The lifestyle stimuli include what and when we eat; whether and when and how we exercise; when we sleep and the quality of sleep; how we manage stress; the quality of our social connectedness and relationships and whether we use any addictive substances.
To be healthy is to be in sync with our diurnal or circadian rhythm, and to be mindful about it.

Held on October 23-26, against the dazzling backdrop of Thailand’s capital, the conference became more than a scientific event. It was a moment of reckoning — and hope.
The human papillomavirus (HPV) continues to fuel cervical, head-and-neck, and other cancers worldwide. Yet, as new vaccines, screening tools, and treatment strategies take shape, experts now believe elimination of HPV-related diseases is within reach.
Speakers called for a unified approach that integrates prevention, screening, and treatment, especially in low- and middle-income countries where the burden remains highest. Vaccination for both girls and boys, HPV-based screening, and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions were cited as cornerstones of elimination.
As one expert noted, “Elimination isn’t just about having the tools. It’s about deploying them equitably and sustainably.”
Out of 1,435 delegates, 45 per cent of the participants were from Asia, most of whom represented countries that have recently introduced or are about to introduce the vaccine.
Beyond the scientific presentations, some of the most talked-about sessions explored the intersection of media, storytelling, and health. The session ‘Uniting Media, Survivors, and Young Champions to Advance HPV Awareness through Storytelling’ drew a full house, reflecting growing recognition that facts alone don’t change minds — stories do.
Survivors and journalists shared the stage to discuss how authentic narratives humanise data and mobilise communities. Each story revealed how courage and compassion can dismantle stigma and misinformation faster than statistics ever could.
A defining feature of IPVS 2025 was the presence of cancer survivors who were not just attendees, but change makers: open, approachable, and determined to prevent others from walking the same painful path. “Storytelling is not just communication,” one participant said. “It’s empowerment.”
Among the most powerful voices was that of Jason Mendelsohn, a 56-year-old father of three from Florida, USA. Jason is a survivor of HPV-related oropharyngeal (tonsil) cancer and a passionate advocate for gender-neutral HPV vaccination.
“I wish parents never had to choose which of their children to protect,” he said, his voice steady but charged with emotion. “If you want to keep your sons and daughters safe, vaccination is imperative.”
In 2014, Jason discovered a small lump on his neck — a sign that would upend his life. The diagnosis revealed HPV-related tonsil cancer. What followed was a harrowing seven weeks of chemotherapy and radiation that left him with third-degree burns in his throat.
“I couldn’t swallow; even saliva was too thick,” he recalled. “I was bedridden, lying there 18 hours a day, wondering if I’d ever see my kids grow up.”
At his lowest point, Jason began recording video messages for his family — his way of saying goodbye. “I made those videos over and over again to make sure I left something behind,” he said quietly. “If I can prevent other parents from ever needing to make those videos, then my journey has a purpose.”
Now cancer-free, Jason devotes his energy to raising awareness that HPV affects everyone, not just girls. “A simple vaccine can prevent a lifetime of suffering, or even save a life. If my story convinces even one parent to vaccinate their children, then everything I went through was worth it,” he said.
The session also featured survivors like Deepa*, a cervical cancer survivor from Malaysia who spoke candidly about the stigma she faced.
“My own mother blamed me for the cancer,” she said. “That was harder than the treatment itself.”
Finding support from other survivors helped her heal and gave her purpose. “Now, I make sure no woman goes through this alone,” she said.
Stories like Deepa’s reminded attendees that misinformation and shame still prevent women and families from seeking care. Accurate, empathetic storytelling, whether through digital or electronic media, remains one of the most effective tools to bridge science and society.
As one journalist noted, “Our job isn’t just to report the science; it’s to translate it into something people feel, understand, and act on.”
Bangkok also became a stage for a broader discussion about HPV’s reach beyond cervical cancer. With rising cases of HPV-positive head and neck cancers, particularly among younger men, experts urged expanding focus and vaccination coverage.
Professor Praphan Phanuphak, in his keynote address, drew parallels between lessons from HIV control and the HPV response. Both diseases, he noted, require science as well as courage to confront stigma.

People with weakened immune systems, such as those living with HIV, face an increased risk of persistent HPV infections — a reminder that elimination must include everyone, including marginalised and immunosuppressed populations.
By the end of the conference, a strong consensus emerged: eliminating HPV-related diseases is feasible, but only through coordinated global action.
Vaccination coverage, screening access, and treatment availability must all rise in tandem, supported by robust data and community engagement.
Delegates underscored the need for multi-stakeholder collaboration among governments, NGOs, scientists, and the media. No single actor can achieve elimination alone. As one participant summed it up, “Science gives us the map, but storytelling gives us the movement.”
At the IPVS Conference discussions across sessions and hallways echoed a shared concern: the pressing need for more funding to advance HPV research and accelerate cervical cancer elimination efforts.
Participants emphasised that current resource constraints in global health particularly in HPV related research initiatives threatens to slow down the momentum towards achieving elimination goal set by the World Health Organisation.
As delegates departed the conference halls, Bangkok’s skyline shimmered with a sense of possibility.
The conversations had made one thing clear: eliminating HPV-driven cancers is not just a medical mission, it’s a communication mission. Every survivor’s voice, every journalist’s headline, and every young advocate’s message pushes the world one step closer to prevention, awareness, and hope.

We’ve seen familiar anxieties resurface: the perennial ‘debt trap’ narrative, alarmist talk of ‘strategic drift’, and politically motivated suggestions of security breaches.
It is time to apply rigorous, long-term analysis, instead of succumbing to short-term geopolitical anxiety. This current wave of negative discourse is not a genuine concern for Pakistan’s well-being but a geopolitical smokescreen. This manufactured noise is strategically generated by external powers who fear the success of a robust, non-Western, South-South development model exemplified by the China-Pakistan comprehensive collaboration.
Pakistan’s partnership with China is not a transactional alliance subject to transient political tides; it is a transformative, structural, and historical commitment. Its foundation is not fragile convenience, but unconditional respect and a shared aspiration for regional stability and prosperity. To understand why this bond is truly ‘all-weather’, we must look past the headlines and examine the principles that underpin it.
Non-transactional essence — sovereignty and equality: The core difference between the China-Pakistan partnership and Pakistan’s historical alliances with Western nations lies in a single word: conditionality.

The China-Pakistan All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership defies geopolitical noise.

For decades, Pakistan’s crucial financing — from the IMF, the World Bank, and other Western lenders — has been rigidly tethered to structural adjustment programmes. These mandates often involve deregulation, privatisation, and austerity measures that frequently impinge on long-term sovereign development goals. In essence, these are transactional relationships where sovereign policy choices become negotiating chips.
 
 

The Chinese model, in sharp contrast, is defined by unconditional respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs. The ‘All-weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership’ is rooted in this principle of equality. Historically, Pakistan’s support for China — from pioneering diplomatic recognition in the early years to actively championing its inclusion in the international multilateral system — long preceded any major economic partnership. This was an act of non-reciprocal strategic solidarity that helped China break out of strategic containment.
This tangible commitment to connect our nations permanently predates contemporary geopolitical calculus. To suggest that our necessary diplomatic diversification equates to a ‘strategic pivot’ is to misunderstand both our foreign policy acumen and the deep, non-transactional nature of this anchor relationship.
Strategic cooperation — an indispensable pillar of stability: The intense reaction to speculation suggesting strategic compromise warrants a cold, clear assessment of national security logic.
The China-Pakistan strategic cooperation is the cornerstone of Pakistan’s defence architecture. China remains the most significant, reliable, and consistent supplier of technology, training, and strategic defence platforms to Pakistan.
Now, consider the logical absurdity of the narrative being pushed. Why would a sovereign nation deliberately risk sabotage to the very foundation of its own defence system? Why would Pakistan, for any short-term, conditional transactional benefit from a historically fickle partner, risk alienating the strategic partner that guarantees its long-term strategic depth and technological edge against regional threats? The answer is a simple No.
Undermining strategic trust with Beijing is, effectively, an act of national self-sabotage. The intensity of this information warfare is a clear reflection of the extreme discomfort felt by regional and global competitors who feel threatened by the longevity and cohesiveness of the Pakistan-China strategic alignment. This narrative is a calculated attempt to induce paranoia and force a strategic fissure. We must reject this psychological warfare as an insult to the intelligence and security integrity of the Pakistani state.
Resilience amidst global and regional constraints: The true measure of the China-Pakistan ‘all-weather’ partnership is its enduring salience amid a turbulent international environment. This reciprocal support acts as an indispensable strategic asset. Domestically, the persistent threat of terrorism necessitates high-level intelligence and defence cooperation, ensuring the security of the nation’s promising future. Furthermore, as a nation highly vulnerable to climate change, Pakistan requires massive, resilient infrastructure; China’s investment in backbone infrastructure offers a structural solution to build climate resilience, not just short-term aid.
Externally, unceasing strategic competition necessitates a robust defence capability on Pakistan’s part. China remains the most consistent provider of advanced military hardware, making the security calculus the solid cornerstone of the relationship. In a nutshell, the all-weather partnership is a strategic necessity. It is a fundamental alignment that secures Pakistan’s strategic interests and underwrites its economic ambition in the face of profound challenges.
Conclusion — guardians of a shared future: The storm of negative publicity surrounding the China-Pakistan relationship serves a singular purpose: to sow internal doubt and externally signal the fragility of a partnership that has become too successful for the comfort of others. The intensity of the external noise is directly proportional to the perceived threat of our joint success.
The challenge is not navigating debt, but maintaining strategic resolve and internal cohesion. We must not allow externally generated fears to cloud the clear, long-term vision of a shared destiny and prosperity. The ‘community of shared future’ is not a mere slogan; it is the philosophical scaffolding for a future where both Pakistan and China achieve their development goals, free from geopolitical coercion.
To the peoples of Pakistan and China, we are the final, most crucial guardians of this friendship. Be vigilant. Do not let the digital disinformation or the cynical geopolitical games of outside powers distract us from the roads we have built, the lights we have powered, and the future we are building. Our bond is built on history, cemented by respect, and driven by development. It is, and will remain, unbreakable.

Quite often, radical preachers have misused the mosque and madressah to spread hate speech, sectarian views and mount challenges to the state’s writ. Pakistan’s history is replete with examples where extremist clergymen have taken on the state, with the Lal Masjid fiasco being perhaps the gravest episode of its kind.
In recent days, the TLP’s problematic and violent outbursts invited a crackdown from the state, leading to the party being banned. Yet questions had been swirling about the 400-plus mosques and madressahs run by the TLP in Punjab. Initially, it was announced that the Auqaf department would run the institutions. But after pushback from senior Barelvi clerics — who feared the state may grant control of the mosques to other sects — the Punjab government has decided to hand over the administration of the religious places to ‘moderate’ clerics led by Mufti Muneeb ur Rehman. The Punjab administration has also announced monthly stipends for imams of the province’s over 65,000 mosques.
These moves raise questions about how much the state should exert control over religious institutions, and where the line should be drawn to preserve individual religious freedoms. In other Muslim states, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkiye, the state is heavily involved in the appointment and oversight of imams, particularly Friday prayer leaders, while the contents of Friday sermons are also vetted.
Can similar models be followed in Pakistan? In this country, attempts have also been made to regulate mosques. For example, laws were passed in the 1960s to ensure mosque loudspeakers were only used for azan and Friday sermons. In more recent decades, especially after the rise of religiously inspired militancy in the country, the state resolved through NAP to register and regulate madressahs. Yet problems have persisted, as the TLP phenomenon and the activities of sectarian groups have shown.
 
 

It is clear that state oversight is needed of religious institutions, but with some guardrails. For example, there must be clearly defined areas which necessitate state intervention and action against preachers violating SOPs. This includes hate speech, particularly language demonising any religion, sect, or community, as well as calls to violence and insurrection against the state. In this regard, the state has often failed to act against clergymen who have promoted and incited violence, only taking action after the damage is done.
Beyond these guidelines, the state should not be regulating religious rituals, or penalising imams who stray from the official line about any particular subject, unless they promote violence or hate speech. A balance needs to be struck between maintaining order and cracking down on hate speech, and respecting individual freedoms.

Andrew, 65, the younger brother of Charles and second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has come under mounting pressure over his behaviour and ties to Epstein and earlier this month he was forced to stop using his title of Duke of York.
 
 

Charles has now escalated his actions against Andrew by stripping him of his titles, leaving him to be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor.
The Buckingham Palace statement said a formal notice had now also been served on Andrew to surrender the lease of his Royal Lodge mansion on the Windsor Estate, west of London, and he will move to alternative private accommodation in eastern England.
“These censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him,” the palace said. “Their Majesties wish to make clear that their thoughts and utmost sympathies have been, and will remain with, the victims and survivors of any and all forms of abuse.”
A palace source said that while Andrew continued to deny the accusations against him, it was clear that there had been serious lapses of judgement. The source said the decision was taken by Charles, but that the monarch had the support of the wider family, including heir-to-the-throne Prince William.

This was revealed in the Annual Impunity Report 2025 of Freedom Network, produced with assistance of International Media Support (IMS). The report indicates a worsening environment of freedom of expression and the safety of journalists under the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The report noted a “sharp rise” in attacks and violations against journalists and other media professionals in Pakistan. “At least 142 cases of violations were documented, marking a nearly 60pc increase compared to the previous year. The hostile environment for the media, which intensified after the February 2024 general elections, has made almost every region in Pakistan unsafe for journalism, with incidents reported across all provinces and territories,” it said.
It also documented at least 36 formal legal cases against 30 journalists and media practitioners under the controversial Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) during the first year of the current federal government. The Act was amended through the parliament in early 2025, making its punitive provisions harsher for journalists, which sparked widespread outcry.
Of these 36 cases, 22 cases were registered under the Peca and 14 under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), with some individuals facing multiple charges. Most Peca cases targeted practitioners in Punjab, while all PPC cases were also registered in the province.
The report, titled “Impunity Report — 2025: Crime and Punishment in Pakistan’s Journalism World,” is Freedom Network’s annual flag publication. It provides detailed insight into the impunity for crimes against journalists and efforts to combat the menace, which undermines the freedom to report freely and professionally.
“The use of legal framework to crack down on free expression has become a tool the federal government is now using excessively to target critical voices. Pakistan cannot afford to silence critical media, which is equally important in a democratic dispensation,” Freedom Network Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said, responding to the increasing number of legal cases against journalists under Peca and other laws.
Covering violations against journalists and media professionals across Pakistan from Nov 2024 to Sept 2025, the report found Punjab and Islamabad to be the most dangerous places for journalists.

According to a summary sent to the KP governor by the provincial government, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Afridi picked Meena Khan Afridi, Arshad Ayub Khan, Amjad Ali, Aftab Alam Khan, Fazal Shakoor Khan, Khaleequr Rahman, Riaz Khan, Syed Fakhar Jehan, Aqibullah Khan and Faisal Khan as provincial ministers.
He also picked Muzammil Aslam and Taj Muhammad as advisers, and Shafi Jan as a special assistant. The PTI’s KP chapter also confirmed the names in a post on social media platform X.
 






Subsequently, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that he had signed the summary for the new KP cabinet that was submitted by the chief minister.
“The oath-taking ceremony of the newly appointed provincial ministers will take place at the Governor House today at 3pm,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, former KP minister Taimur Saleem Khan Jhagra congratulated the new provincial cabinet and wished them all the best.
 






Afridi — who was elected the new provincial chief executive earlier this month — had previously insisted that he would announce his team after meeting incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan. However, after repeated attempts to meet the former premier were unsuccessful, Imran’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
Opposition members in the KP Assembly had been criticising the ruling PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers had also voiced the fear that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
The PTI’s provincial chapter had previously also insisted that members of the previous cabinet with “corruption allegations and bad reputation” should not be part of the new one.</p><small>2025-10-31 03:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/310826546d5c9f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952312/allies-put-final-touches-on-plan-for-ajk-no-trust-vote' target='_blank'><strong>Allies put final touches on plan for AJK no-trust vote</strong></a><br><p>• PPP likely to announce PM nominee today as incumbent premier stays put
• AJK planning department suspends release of development funds
ISLAMABAD: After days of consultations, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday endorsed the plan for in-house change in Azad Kashmir in a meeting attended by senior PPP and PML-N leadership at the Presidency.
Sources said the name of the PPP candidate for AJK premiership would most likely be announced today (Friday) after a meeting of the PPP AJK parliamentary party to be chaired by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. A source describing the meeting as the final round of consultations over the upcoming no-trust motion termed it “very positive”. He said both sides called for political stability in Azad Kashmir and criticised the incumbent AJK government for the manner in which it handled recent protests in the state.
A member of the AJK Assembly, when asked if the PML-N would vote for the no-confidence motion against Anwar ul Haq as well as for the PPP nominee, said that “they will be automatically voting for the PPP candidate when they vote against Haq, as the successor’s name will be there on the resolution to be passed”.
It may be noted here that it is mandatory under the interim constitution to summon the session of the Legislative Assembly within 14 days of the submission of the resolution for a vote of no-confidence. The resolution has to be signed by at least 14 members of the House.
Under the law, a resolution for a vote of no-confidence cannot be moved in the assembly unless, by the same resolution, the name of another member of the assembly is put forward as the successor. “A resolution shall not be voted upon before the expiration of three days, or later than seven days, from the date on which it is moved in the assembly,” the law reads.
Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act 1974 provides that when a no-confidence motion is passed in the house, the successor proposed in the resolution becomes the next prime minister without any separate election procedure.
Meanwhile, incumbent AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar ul Haq, who at one stage had decided to step down, has decided to remain the chief executive of the state as long as he can. A source close to him said though the option of resigning before a vote on no-confidence will be open, PM Haq was ready to face the vote.
Moreover, the Planning and Develo­pment Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has suspended the release of funds to the tune of billions sanctioned for different line departments for development projects under the annual development programme for the first half of the current financial year 2025-26.
The letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, proposed clearance of Rs 3,721.259 million in “mature liabilities” in various sectors like communication, agriculture, education, health, etc. A formal notification barred the release of further funds for any development scheme without written approval. Huge funds amounting to well over seven billion, however, have already been released to different departments.

A second round of discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had began in Istanbul on Saturday, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Kabul remained a major point of contention, resulting in a stalemate. A breakthrough came after Türkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Wednesday that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home.
A joint statement released by Türkiye, the host of the latest round of talks, early on Friday stated “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
Though the statement didn’t specify who the “principals” would be, it is expected that it meant the defence ministers of the two countries, who led their sides in the first round in Doha, would now meet in Istanbul.
The joint statement further said that during this period, the two countries also agreed on a “monitoring and verification mechanism” to ensure the maintenance of peace and to impose a penalty on the side that breaches the ceasefire.
“All parties have agreed to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and imposing penalty on the violating party,” said the joint statement released by Türkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
 






The statement further said that as mediators, Türkiye and Qatar expressed their appreciation for the “active contribution of both parties” and the two countries will continue their cooperation with both sides for “lasting peace and stability”.
Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, commenting on the development, said, “Just as the Islamic emirate seeks good relations with other neighbouring countries, it also desires positive ties with Pakistan and remains committed to relations based on mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs and not posing a threat to any side.”
The joint statement came shortly after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — who had earlier issued a strongly worded warning to Kabul after the stalemate in talks — said that a “ray of light” was visible in the Istanbul negotiations.
“Different drafts are being exchanged for an eventual agreement. You can say that some ray of light is visible; there is very guarded optimism. Let’s hope that some shape emerges from this,“ he stated while speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
“Qatar and Türkiye are very respected by us and are our well-wishers. Türkiye clearly openly supported us in the Pakistan-India conflict, so we respect them and their opinion,” the defence minister said.
‘Verifiable action’
The Istanbul negotiations centred on Pakistan’s core demand that Afghanistan take “clear, verifiable and irreversible action” against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist groups involved in cross-border attacks from Afghan territory.
Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, speaking earlier in Peshawar, reiterated Pakistan’s red lines, saying that while Islamabad desired peace with all its neighbours, it “will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil against Pakistan.”
The Taliban delegation, while participating in the dialogue, however, maintained that it could not fully control TTP operatives. A senior Taliban official said the Afghan side had offered to detain and expel any TTP members found on Afghan territory.
“But Pakistan keeps insisting that we control TTP’s attacks inside Pakistan,” the official said. “These fighters are Pakistani nationals operating within Pakistan.”
Pakistani negotiators also demanded that the Taliban formally declare the TTP a terrorist organisation and publicly denounce it as a fitna — an Islamic term for sedition or mischief.
Diplomatic sources said direct interaction between the two delegations remained limited throughout the five days, with most communication handled through mediators. “Even during meal breaks, the sides barely spoke,” one source said.
Afghanistan continues to deny harbouring militants, accusing Pakistan instead of violating its sovereignty through airstrikes and, according to Afghan media, allowing US drones to operate from its airspace — a charge Islamabad denies. Kabul insisted during the talks that any future agreement must include assurances against such operations.
While the Istanbul agreement marks a breakthrough after days of tension, diplomats cautioned that deep mistrust persists. “This is a framework for peace, not yet peace itself,” a foreign diplomat said. “It will take sustained verification, discipline and trust to make it hold.”
Border skirmishes and talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Türkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.</p><small>2025-10-31 03:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31081217d3e1fce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952288/ex-fbr-chief-shabbar-zaidi-booked-over-unauthorised-refunds' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-FBR chief Shabbar Zaidi booked over ‘unauthorised refunds’</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The FIA has booked prominent chartered accountant Shabbar Zaidi over allegations of issuing unauthorised income tax refunds amounting to Rs16 billion during his tenure as chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in the PTI government, it emerged on Thursday.

According to the FIA, three private banks, two cement factories, and one chemical company were the beneficiaries of these refunds. The agency alleged that these entities were clients of Mr Zaidi’s private audit and consultancy firm prior to his appointment as FBR chairman, raising concerns of conflict of interest.

Even small disruptions at critical moments can hurt Pakistan’s agriculture sector as Islamabad lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations, says the report released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) — a Sydney-based independent, non-partisan and non-profit think tank dedicated to shifting the world’s focus to peace as a positive, achievable and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.
The report warns that Pakistan’s dam capacity can hold only about 30 days of Indus flow and any prolonged cut will be disastrous if not managed.
However, at present, India’s ability to “turn off” the flow of rivers is constrained by its infrastructure.

Ecological Threat Report warns even small disruptions can hurt country’s farm sector in near term; says Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations

“All of India’s dams on the weste­rn rivers are run-of-the-river proje­cts with minimal storage,” the report says.
 
 

While the implications are unclear, the rising tensions in South Asia and the Middle East are potentially linked to the future of water diplomacy for the Indus.
“For Pakistan, the danger is acute. If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons. Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers,” the report reads.
Foreign involvement
The report says that following the signing of the defence treaty betw­een Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the kingdom will most likely support Isl­­amabad in any conflict with India.
“This is likely to be supportive of the continuation of the Indus agreement as India is more likely to think carefully before creating a pretext for war.”
If the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) unravels, the involvement of other players like China or even Afgha­n­is­­tan can further complicate matters.
“For now, the IWT remains officially bilateral, but the 2025 episode showed that global powers have a stake in preventing water conflicts,” warns the report.
Internationally, India’s suspension of the IWT raised concerns about setting a precedent.
China, a close ally of Pakistan and an upstream riparian, also took interest in the affair.
In May this year, China’s state media announced an acceleration of the Mohmand Dam project in Pakistan — a hydropower initiative financed by Beijing — framing it as a gesture of support to Islamabad in the face of India’s water “threats”.
The implication was clear: China signalled solidarity with Pakistan, effectively cautioning India against pushing Islamabad too far on water.
For the first time, India began operating its dams outside the treaty constraints.
‘Reservoir flushing’
In May, Indian authorities carried out “reservoir flushing” on the Chenab River’s Salal and Baglihar dams without notifying Pakistan.
This operation, which involves emptying reservoirs to flush out silt, had been forbidden under the treaty (or at least tightly regulated) because it causes sudden downstream flow changes.
India proceeded unilaterally, aiming to boost its dams’ storage and power generation capacity now that it considered itself unbound by IWT limits.
The immediate impact was dramatic: sections of the Chenab in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for a few days, as India’s dam gates were shut, then released sediment-laden torrents when opened.
The IWT between India and Pakistan has acted as a core conflict resolution tool and point of cooperation for 60 years.
India’s suspension of the treaty this year marks a period of heighten­­ed tension between the two countries.
There was no armed conflict over water in these instances. In fact, the IWT often served as a safety valve, providing legal and diplomatic processes to address grievances that might otherwise provoke unilateral retaliation.
“However, these arbitrated conflicts have accumulated over time to reduce trust even as cooperation continued,” the IEP says in its report.

• 90pc of flood assessment survey completed; data of 463,000 victims verified by deputy commissioners
BAHAWALPUR: The Punjab government has distributed Rs6.39 billion among flood-affected people across the province. The amount is part of the Rs100bn allocation made under the Punjab Chief Minister Flood Rehabilitation Programme.
Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb made the announcement while addressing a ceremony to distribute ATM cards among the flood-hit people at Jinnah Stadium, Khairpur Tamewali, about 45km from here, on Thursday.
She said 90 per cent of the flood assessment survey, covering data of 569,000 victims, had been completed by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA). Data of 463,000 victims had also been verified by the respective deputy commissioners to ensure transparency in the compensation disbursement process.
According to an official statement issued from Lahore, authorities told a meeting that over 98,000 ATM cards had been prepared, while 37 camp sites had been set up in 27 flood-affected districts across Punjab for compensation payments through the Bank of Punjab. Each beneficiary will receive Rs50,000 in cash along with an ATM card.
The distribution of compensation in 13 districts began on Oct 20, while disbursement in the remaining districts will start in the second phase from Nov 3.
Each flood victim can withdraw up to Rs300,000 per day from Bank of Punjab ATMs. According to the statement, 19 camps have been established for flood victims in 36 tehsils, with Rs50,000 in cash and ATM cards to be issued to 500 people at each camp.
Flood rehabilitation camps have also been set up in Bahawalnagar, Depalpur, Jhang, Nankana Sahib, Muzaffargarh, Chiniot and Khairpur Tamewali.
Provincial ministers Mian Kazim Hussain Pirzada, Khwaja Salman Rafique, Malik Sohaib Ahmed Berth, MPA Rana Tariq, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, Divisional Commissioner Musarrat Jabeen, Bahawalpur Deputy Commissioner Dr Farhan Farooq, and former senator Saood Majid Chaudhry accompanied Ms Aurangzeb at the ceremony.
The senior minister said Rs20bn had been transferred to the Bank of Punjab for the rehabilitation of flood-affected people, of which Rs11bn had been credited to victims’ accounts.
She said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would continue to stand by the flood survivors until their complete rehabilitation, noting that the process had begun within a record 26 days.
Ms Aurangzeb added that the survey in 72 tehsils of the flood-affected districts had already been completed, despite earlier claims that it would take six months. Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada also addressed the ceremony.

• Dispute between senior lawyers over list of who gets to meet Imran in Adiala leaves many within the party red-faced
LAHORE: Mere weeks after incarcerated founder Imr­an Khan warned party leaders against airing their dirty laundry in public, ano­ther tiff — this time over the leadership of PTI in central Punjab — has erupted over the social media platform X, in full public view.
In a telling series of tweets on Thursday, Secretary Gene­ral Salman Akram Raja railed against those who were “conspiring against him”, and recalled that Mr Khan had personally tasked him with conveying messages from Adiala jail.
 






Although he didn’t explain the issue at hand, a cursory glance at his earlier tweets and messages posted by other PTI leaders laid bare the dispute.
The controversy centres around the ouster of PTI Cen­tral Punjab President Ahmad Chattha and Gene­ral Secre­tary Bilal Ejaz, who were remo­ved on instructions supposedly conveyed by Imran Khan on Oct 16, when he met Barr­ister Gohar Ali Khan and Salman Akram Raja in Adiala jail.
Mr Chattha was one of the men shot and injured in Wazirabad when Imran Khan’s container was fired upon during a rally in 2022.
A notification, issued on the same day by PTI’s Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza, had announced Mr Chattha’s removal. He was to be replaced by Ali Imtiaz Warraich.
 

Aliya Hamza

Following the Oct 16 meeting, however, Mr Raja had tweeted that the party founder had not ordered any change in the Punjab hierarchy in his presence, adding that they would seek confirmation of this decision from Mr Khan at their next meeting.
In a tweet on Wednesday, however, he clarified that he was told the ‘decision’ to remove both men was conveyed — ostensibly to Barrister Gohar — before he arrived at the prison.
 






Speaking to the media on Thursday, Mr Raja disclosed that two lawyers, Ali Imran and Mubashir Maqsood Awan, had met Imran Khan in jail, and later claimed that he had instructed the appointment of Mr Warraich as central Punjab president.
In a tweet, Mr Raja also claimed that he told the new president, Ali Imtiaz, to start working after being informed that the confusion stemming from the matter had brought the party’s affairs to a standstill in Punjab.
But the decision to remove the two men was disputed by Imran’s sister Uzma during an interaction with reporters, as well as a tweet from Mr Khan’s official X account — which he doesn’t have access to while in prison.
“I wish to make it clear that Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. They have stood by me with unwavering loyalty and made tremendous sacrifices. I have not issued any orders for their removal,” said the tweet, published on Wednesday.
 






Diving headfirst into the fray, PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza tweeted that Imran Khan was the final authority on all decisions, and that she was simply implementing the instructions that had been passed to her.
 






Ms Hamza had earlier appointed Ali Imran as the party’s Punjab spokesman.
When approached, party insiders alleged that Ali Imran was a controversial person, being one of the men who ‘misguided’ Salman Akram Raja over Ahmad Chattha’s removal.
Some went as far as to accuse Ms Hamza of ‘playing for the other team’, claiming that she was preoccupied by optics; holding meetings, visiting workers’ homes, holding cake-cutting ceremonies and protests on court premises, while silencing voices being raised from the party’s Punjab media cell.
When approached for comment, Aliya Hamza denied any leadership crisis, saying that the PTI Punjab president’s portfolio was still with Dr Yasmin Rashid, adding that Mr Khan had instructed her to serve as acting president after Hammad Azhar stepped down from the role.
List dispute
 

Salman Akram Raja

Another dispute that Mr Raja alluded to in his tweets on Thursday was the confusion about who would submit lists for access to Adiala jail.
It may be recalled that the Supreme Court had recently specified that the party’s secretary general, i.e. Salman Akram Raja, should be the one to submit such lists.
However, a tug-of-war over who has the authority to issue these lists erupted after two separate lists were sent to the Adiala Jail superintendent on Oct 29, one by secretary-general Salman Akram Raja and the other by Barrister Ali Zafar.
In another thread of tweets on Thursday, Mr Raja explained that he had personally messaged Barrister Zafar, informing him that he would send the list. He then claimed to have forwarded the list to the superintendent through TCS, WhatsApp and in person through a lawyer.
However, he wrote, “Senator Zafar still sent a separate list of meeting participants”.
 






Party leaders Dawn spoke to on Thursday seemed embarrassed, saying that such a controversy erupting between such senior party members was tantamount to ‘party ka mazaaq’ (making a mockery of the party).

Sub Inspector Nabeel Haider said that three suspects had been hired to kill journalist Tahir Naseer, based in Rawalpindi, for Rs200,000.
“They (the suspects) surveilled Naseer’s house for three days,” the IO said, adding that they had also received Rs99,000 in their bank account and that one of the suspects procured weapons.“
“Police arrested the three suspects and seized their vehicle and weapons from near Naseer’s house,” the IO added. “They were produced before the district magistrate, who rejected the request for physical remand and sent the suspects to jail on judicial remand instead.”
In a first information (FIR) report filed on Wednesday under Section 120B (Punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), Naseer said that around 4pm, he received a phone call from his cousin saying that suspicious people were asking about him at a local baker.
“When I arrived at the tandoor, I saw a white car with three young men,” Naseer stated in the FIR. “My cousin told me that they had been asking about me and showing my picture. While they were asking around, they said their names were Ahmed, Akash and Vishal.”
The journalist stated in the FIR that the apparent reason for the attempt on his life was a vlog he published earlier about a private company and later also reported on DawnNewsTV on the same subject.
“I filed a case against them (company owners) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act and the PPC,” he stated. “They then began threatening me over WhatsApp through international numbers,” added the journalist.
Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists.
According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.</p><small>2025-10-31 02:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/31075803acdeed8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952286/appellate-courts-should-only-permit-additional-evidence-in-rare-cases-sc' target='_blank'><strong>Appellate courts should only permit additional evidence in rare cases: SC</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Cou­rt ruled on Thursday that appellate courts should permit additional evidence under Section 428 of the Cri­m­inal Procedure Code if it is necessary for a just decision, rather than using this power to correct defects in the prosecution’s case or investigation.
The section should be invoked by courts after being satisfied that the recording of additional evidence was necessary, observed Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, who was heading a two-judge bench that had taken up a jail appeal of Waseem Hassan Khan against the Islamabad High Court’s decision on April 11.
CrPC Sec­tion 428 allows the appellate court to record additional evidence separately and then decide the appeal, which cannot be intertwined with the exactitudes of Section 423, which deals with the ge­­neral powers of the appellate court, ob­­served Justice Mazhar.
Justice Mazhar observed that the jurisdiction vested in this section of law applies in rare cases where the appellate court’s conscience was satisfied that without the fresh eviden­­ce, there would be a failure of justice.
In this case, Justice Mazhar observed that if the high court felt that the recording of additional evidence was inevitable, the high court ought to record the additional evidence by itself or directed a sessions court or a magistrate to do so.
The case at hand revolves around Esha Hassan, sister of complainant Muneeb Khan, who was married to petitioner Waseem Hassan Khan. It was alleged by the complainant that he was informed by his sister that the petitioner maltreated her on numerous occasions and tortured her.
On March 6, 2023, the complainant tried to contact the petitioner after their sister didn’t respond, but he disconnected the call.
In the evening, the police infor­m­­ed them about the death of their sister. When the complainant along with his brother went to the Polyclinic Hospital to collect the body, they found violence marks on her neck, hands and feet, suggesting that she had been strangled to death.
A case was subsequently registered at the Sihala police station on March 6, 2023, under Section 302. According to the post-mortem report, the cause of death was asphyxia.
The Islamabad additional district and sessions judge-IV (east), on June 3, 2024, convicted the petitioner and imprisoned him for life. The petitioner filed a jail appeal in IHC to challenge his conviction, which allowed the appeal by means of the impugned judgement under Section 428 and while setting aside the conviction, remanded the matter to the trial court to record additional evidence and also directed the investigation officer to record additional statement in the evidence while explaining the CCTV footage to the trial court.
Justice Mazhar observed that the requirement of due diligence accentuates that only new or previously unavailable evidence that was overlooked despite best efforts, but if the oversight was due to a party’s own negligence or strategy, the appellate court may refuse the recording of additional evidence.
Setting aside the judgement, the Supreme Court remanded the matter to high court to decide the jail appeal afresh, preferably within three months.

However, the poster is doctored.
In September 2025, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah Khan said that the tenure of the army chief, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, would end in 2027 and a decision whether to extend it or not will be taken at that time.
He said that earlier, the army chief’s term comprised four years, and it was reduced to three years before it was extended to five years. The army chief’s tenure and extension have been under discussion for a while.
In 2024, the government extended the tenure of the chiefs of the army, navy and air force from three to five years under the Pakistan Army Amendment Act 2024. The hasty passage of the law was severely criticised by opposition parties such as the PTI and Jamaat-i-Islami, with even the PPP, a federal coalition partner of the PML-N, also later distancing itself from the development.
On Oct 29, a user who appears to be a PTI supporter based on his previous posts, shared an image on X showing a banner featuring Field Marshal Munir with the text: “For God’s sake, let go of the talk about leaving“, while questioning the authenticity of the banner.
The post was captioned: “Is this panaflex really hanging on Rawalpindi Murree Road? Need guidance from friends in Rawalpindi. A friend sent this picture from Pindi, which I didn’t believe, and now he has sent it again at night.”
The post gained over 51,100 views.
Mirza Shehzad Akbar, former adviser to ex-PM Imran Khan on accountability and interior, also shared the same image of the banner featuring COAS Munir and compared it with similar banners of former army chief Raheel Sharif, captioning it: “Nothing has changed in ten years! Not even the poster.”
That post received 66,000 views.
The same image, along with similar claims, was also shared by several other PTI supporters on X as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here, collectively garnering more than 62,000 views.
Except for one, none of these posts mentioned anything about the location where the alleged poster was seen or provided any other contextual information or alternate pictures.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter.
A keyword search conducted to corroborate whether such a poster was reported about by credible mainstream news outlets did not yield any reports or other images and videos from different angles and viewpoints from the public or media outlets on any such alleged banner.
Observing the image closely revealed visual inconsistencies. The English text at the bottom right of the banner is not decipherable and appears to be gibberish — a common feature of text generated using AI.
The same is also the case with the text on the logo inscribed on the banner. Moreover, the edges appear smudged, and the internal text looks half-rendered or fuzzy, typical of AI-generated symbols.
 


This is in contrast to similar posters featuring former army chief Gen (r) Raheel Sharif that were hung in major cities in 2016 by Move on Pakistan, a political party established in 2013 by a businessman from Faisalabad and working for education, health and peace. The posts were also reported about by mainstream news outlets such as Dawn, Express Tribune, Dunya News and Al Arabiya English.
The posters were strung up in the year that the former army chief retired at the end of.
The current banner featuring Field Marshal Munir follows the same design. However, in the original post showing Gen Sharif, the text on the banner reads coherently and says: “Education”, “health” and “peace”.
 


Analysing the current image through verification tools for potential manipulation showed that AIorNot flagged the photo as likely created using artificial intelligence.
 


Only one of the numbers mentioned on the banner picked up when called for corroboration with the person on the end of the line denying having printed the poster or having anything to do with it. He said the poster circulating on social media was likely AI-generated and he would publicly address the matter as well.
Dawn correspondents in major cities across Pakistan — Imran Gabol in Lahore, Malik Asad in Islamabad, Tahir Naseer in Rawalpindi, Abdullah Zehri in Quetta, Zahid Imdad in Peshawar and Imtiaz Ali in Karachi — also confirmed that they hadn’t seen the posters in their respective cities or heard about them.
Lastly, a keyword search yielded a November 8, 2022, fact-check report by Geo Fact Check titled: “Fact-check: Posters requesting army chief to seek extension are fake”.
The report showed that manipulation of the original Gen Sharif poster is not a new phenomenon and was done previously as well with the image of former army chief Gen (r) Qamar Javed Bajwa crudely doctored onto the original banner and shared in the same way as the current one featuring Field Marshal Munir.
 


Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral image shows a ‘Move on Pakistan’ banner of Field Marshal Asim Munir is false. The poster is doctored.

Rodrigues and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who hit 89, put on 167 runs for the third wicket as India won with nine balls and five wickets to spare in the outskirts of Mumbai at DY Patil Stadium.
Amanjot Kaur hit the winning boundary to trigger wild celebrations in the Indian camp with smiles and tears of joy in the dug out.
India will face South Africa in the final at the same venue on Sunday with the 50-over marquee tournament to get a new champion.
 






The hosts made history to get past the previous best chase of 331 by Australia against India in the league stage of this edition.
Seven-time champions Australia faltered in their title defence and suffered their first defeat in the ODI World Cup after 15 victories since 2017 when India beat them in the semi-final.
India looked in trouble at 59-2 in the 10th over, but Rodrigues and Kaur rode the storm and then took the attack to the opposition at a nearly-packed house that cheered every run.
A key moment in the game came when Rodrigues survived a dropped catch on 82 by skipper Alyssa Healy who failed to hold on to the ball with her wicketkeeping gloves off Alana King.
 






Annabel Sutherland broke through to get Kaur caught out for 89 with India needing another 113 for victory and an exhausted-looking captain trudged back.
An ice-cool Rodrigues, who was dropped again on 106 by Tahila McGrath, despite Deepti Sharma’s run out on 24 and then Richa Ghosh dismissed for 26, kept anchor and saw the team through.
India lost Shafali Verma and then star batter Smriti Mandhana caught behind for 24, a decision reviewed by Healy and replays suggested the ball grazed the bat.
Mandhana looked disappointed and trudged back with a wry smile, but had the last laugh when the team won.
 






After Australia elected to bat in overcast conditions, Phoebe Litchfield smashed 119 off 93 balls to steer the team to the mammoth total.
Hosts India struck regular blows after a second-wicket partnership of 155 between Litchfield and Ellyse Perry, who made 77 after overturning an early lbw decision.
But Ashleigh Gardner ensured that Australia’s good start did not go to waste as she contributed a brisk 63 before the last three wickets fell in the final over.
Spinners Shree Charani and Deepti took two wickets each.
Both teams wore black armbands in support of promising 17-year-old Australian cricketer Ben Austin, who died Thursday after being struck with a ball while training in Melbourne.</p><small>2025-10-30 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301855534d920da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952174/pakistan-seeks-peace-with-all-neighbours-but-will-not-allow-cross-border-terrorism-from-afghanistan-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks peace with all neighbours, but will not allow cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan: COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir said on Thursday that Pakistan sought peace with all neighbours, including Afghanistan, but reiterated that the country will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil.
According to a statement from the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Field Marshal Munir made the comments during a trip to Peshawar, where he held an interactive session with a jirga of tribal elders. Later on, he was given a comprehensive briefing at Headquarters 11 Corps on the prevailing security environment, operational preparedness and ongoing counter terrorism efforts to maintain peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border.
Pakistan-Afghanistan relations have worsened sharply in recent weeks, marked by border clashes and mutual accusations. Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul against permitting the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to use Afghan territory for attacks — an allegation the Taliban reject. After a ceasefire, both sides initiated talks in Turkiye to develop a mechanism for monitoring Taliban measures to curb cross-border assaults, but discussions have so far reached a stalemate.
While addressing the jirga, Field Marshal Munir highlighted that “despite the continuation of cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan, Pakistan, over the last few years has exercised patience and extended multiple diplomatic and economic overtures to Afghanistan, aimed at improving Pak-Afghan bilateral relations.”
“However, instead of acting decisively against Indian-sponsored terror proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan, [the] Afghan Taliban regime has been providing all possible assistance to these groups,” the statement said.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
It added that during the interaction, the COAS assured the tribal elders that Pakistan, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, will be “cleansed of the terrorists and their abettors.”
The army chief also appreciated the “steadfast and unconditional support” rendered by the tribal people to the security forces during the recent standoff between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban.
“He paid rich tribute to the resilience and sacrifices of the brave people of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa in [the] war against terrorism,” the statement said, adding that the tribal elders reiterated their “full support to the armed forces against terrorism and also against the Afghan Taliban.”
Per the statement, the tribal elders appreciated the candid discourse by the COAS and expressed their unwavering commitment to peace in Pakistan and highlighted that the “twisted ideology” of the Fitna al Khwarij had no acceptance among the tribes of KP.</p><small>2025-10-30 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/302231369394e7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952182/fact-check-website-impersonating-dawncom-circulates-false-report' target='_blank'><strong>Fact-check: Website impersonating Dawn.com circulates false report</strong></a><br><p>A supposed news website impersonating Dawn.com is currently online and accessible.

In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that last night the movement of a group of khwarij attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border was picked up by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district.
“Own troops effectively engaged and thwarted khwarijs’ attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, four khwarij, including kharji leader, a high-value target kharji Amjad alias Mazahim, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement further said that the militant leader was the deputy of TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and the head of Rehbari Shura of Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP.
The ISPR said the militant leader was wanted by law enforcement agencies and the government had allocated a bounty of Rs5 million on him as he remained “actively involved in perpetuating numerous terrorist activities inside Pakistan while residing in Afghanistan”.
“It is pertinent to highlight that the leadership of Fitna al Khawarij, while residing in Afghanistan, is orchestrating infiltration attempts into Pakistan — primarily to project an impression of domestic presence and to raise the diminishing morale of their khwarij in Bajaur and Mohmand because of effective operations of security forces,” the ISPR said.
“It is once again reiterated that the interim Afghan government must take concrete measures to ensure that Afghan soil is not used by kharji proxies to perpetrate terrorism against Pakistan,” the ISPR said.
“It also validates our stance that Afghan soil is continuously being used as [a] safe [haven] by khwarij belonging to Fitna al Khwarij against Pakistan,” it said.
18 terrorists killed in 2 separate operations in Balochistan
Earlier in the day, the ISPR said that 18 terrorists were killed in two separate operations in Balochistan. In a statement, the ISPR said that the militants belonged to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR stated that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in the Chiltan mountain range in Quetta district on the reported presence of terrorists.
 






“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said.
The ISPR further stated that another IBO was conducted in Buleda in Kech district, where a hideout was busted and four militants were “successfully neutralised”.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” the ISPR said.
It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area, adding that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement posted on X, paid tribute to security forces for eliminating 18 militants. He said that the operation was a reflection of security forces’ determination to eradicate terrorism.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also said the entire nation stood with the country’s security forces in the fight against terrorism. In a statement, he also reiterated the firm commitment to eradicating terrorism in all its forms from the country, Radio Pakistan reported.
In a post on X, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to security forces for thwarting the infiltration attempt.
“The nation takes pride in the skill and bravery of the security forces,” Naqvi said, vowing to “stand side by side” with them.
 






Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
A day earlier, at least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred, while seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district. According to the military, seven terrorists were also killed in the operation.</p><small>2025-10-30 15:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30202857ccbf9b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952177/thousands-of-ultra-orthodox-jews-protest-israeli-military-service' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews protest Israeli military service</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men, dressed in black, rallied in Jerusalem on Thursday to protest against military conscription, an issue that has caused major strain in Israel’s right-wing ruling coalition.
The vast crowd were protesting against the absence of a law guaranteeing their right to avoid Israel’s mandatory military service — a pledge long promised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Crowds of men, many wearing black hats, set fire to pieces of tarpaulin as hundreds of police officers cordoned off several roads across the city, AFP correspondents reported.
Carrying placards denouncing conscription, demonstrators marched along main roads leading into Jerusalem. The mass demonstration follows a recent crackdown on ultra-Orthodox draft dodgers, with thousands of call-up notices sent in recent months and several deserters imprisoned.
Under a ruling established at the time of Israel’s creation in 1948, when the ultra-Orthodox were a very small community, men who devote themselves full-time to the study of sacred Jewish texts are given a de facto pass.
This exemption has come under mounting pressure since the military conflict erupted in Gaza in October 2023, as the military struggles to fill its ranks.
 
 

Whether the exemption should be scrapped has been a long-running point of contention in Israeli society, with Netanyahu pledging that his government would pass a law enshrining the waiver. But he has so far failed to deliver.
Responding to the call of two ultra-Orthodox parties — one of which forms a key part of the ruling coalition — men travelled from all over Israel today to demand the continuation of their exemptions.
The police closed roads to Jerusalem and announced the mobilisation of 2,000 officers in the city.
In June 2024, the supreme court ruled that the state must draft ultra-Orthodox men, declaring their exemption had expired.
Vital support for coalition
A parliamentary committee is now discussing a bill expected to end the exemptions and encourage young ultra-Orthodox men who are not studying full-time to enlist.
The issue has placed Netanyahu’s coalition — one of the most right-wing in the country’s history — under severe strain.
In July, ministers from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party resigned from the cabinet over the issue, though the party has not formally left the coalition. The other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, has already quit both the government and the coalition.

The Sephardic Shas, which holds 11 seats in the 120-member Knesset (Israeli parliament), has warned that it will withdraw support unless military service exemptions are anchored in law — a move that could topple Netanyahu’s fragile coalition, now down to 60 seats.
Some ultra-Orthodox rabbis fear that conscription will make young people less religious, but others accept that those who do not study holy texts full-time can enlist.
Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up 14 per cent of Israel’s Jewish population, or about 1.3 million people, and roughly 66,000 men of military age currently benefit from the exemption.
According to an army report presented to parliament in September, there has been a sharp increase in the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews enlisting despite opposition from their leaders, but the numbers still remain low, at a few hundred over the past two years.</p><small>2025-10-30 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631306-jehlum-landlord-mutilates-cow-for-straying-into-his-field' target='_blank'><strong>Jehlum landlord 'mutilates' cow for straying into his field</strong></a><br><p>

The CM inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS), commonly known as the e-ticketing system, at the Central Police Office (CPO) on Monday.
He explained that the new system replaces the outdated manual ticketing process with a fully automated e-ticketing mechanism, utilising advanced AI-integrated CCTV cameras to detect violations such as speeding, red-light jumping, and helmet non-compliance.
According to the press release, CM Shah received a report from Sindh Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon detailing traffic rule violations under the new system, which has issued fines to 35 official vehicles for various infractions.
“According to the report, e-challans were issued for offences such as not wearing seatbelts, running red lights, using tinted windows, and operating mobile phones while driving,” the press release stated.
The report revealed that a police vehicle was fined for a seatbelt violation on the Lyari Expressway at 1:36pm on Tuesday. Traffic Deputy Inspector General Peer Muhammad Shah informed the chief minister that the vehicle’s driver was twice observed not wearing a seatbelt between Garden and Lyari Expressway, triggering the automated system to issue a Rs10,000 fine, according to the press release.
“The CM said that first-time offenders can have their fines waived within 10 days by appearing in person and submitting an apology,” the press release stated.
“Even the police must comply with traffic regulations. This system upholds fairness and accountability for all citizens,” CM Shah was quoted as saying.
The press release added the provincial chief executive underlined the importance of traffic law compliance for public safety and directed that while first-time offenders can have their challans waived, repeat offenders would pay fines without exception.
“All citizens have equal rights under the law — compliance must be ensured across the board,” CM Shah added.
On Tuesday, more than 2,650 electronic challans were issued by the Karachi Traffic Police following the inauguration of the new e-ticketing system. According to the Sindh police, 1,535 challans were issued for not wearing a seat belt, 507 challans for riding a motorcycle without a helmet, 419 for speeding, 166 for running a red light, and 32 for using a mobile phone while driving.
Additionally, seven challans were issued for putting tints on vehicle windows, five challans each for improper parking and parking in a no-parking zone, four for stop line violation, and three each for lane line violation and driving on the wrong way.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
The decision came amid Karachi witnessing a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.</p><small>2025-10-30 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631300-field-marshal-munir-castigates-afghan-regime-for-supporting-indian-backed-terrorists' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir castigates Afghan regime for supporting India-backed terrorists</strong></a><br><p>

A first information report (FIR) — seen by Dawn.com — was filed against two landowners who allegedly attacked and mutilated a cow that crossed onto their land under Section 429 (Mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc, of any value or any animal of the value of fifty rupees) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant, who is the owner of the cow, alleged that the suspects struck its front leg with an axe, severely injuring it. They fled the scene while threatening the complainant.
Jhelum District Police Officer Tariq Aziz Sindhu told Dawn.com that both suspects had been arrested, one of whom was apprehended from a forested area near the scene of the incident.
“Police have registered a case under Section 429 of the PPC and investigations are underway,” the DPO said
“Cruelty against animals is intolerable and after proper investigation, those found guilty will be presented before the court of law,” the DPO added.
The FIR read that the cow had been shifted to a veterinary hospital in Chak Aka for treatment.
Animal cruelty is not a new phenomenon in Pakistan.
On Sunday, a landlord and his son were charged with animal cruelty after they tortured a buffalo and tried to cut off its legs for entering their home in Minchinabad, in Bahawalnagar.
Police said that a farmer from Munshi Hathar owned some cattle and one of them accidentally entered the house of a landlord while grazing on October 18.
The landlord allegedly trapped the animal and, along with his son, tried to cut off its legs with axes and stabbed it repeatedly. They allegedly left the buffalo on the road in a critically injured state. After video footage of the incident went viral on social media, police took action and arrested the main suspect.
In September, a female camel, allegedly tortured by a landowner in Sukkur, was handed over to a private animal shelter in Karachi.
According to an FIR, the complainant alleged that when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond on the land, one of the suspects hit one of them with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor, causing severe injuries.
Last year, a magistrate in Sanghar remanded six suspects into police custody in connection with the mutilation of a camel that saw the animal’s right leg chopped off in Mund Jamrao village. The incident took place when a landlord allegedly chopped off the camel’s leg as punishment for foraging into his field for fodder.
In July this year, that camel stood up for the first time since the incident with the help of a prosthetic leg.</p><small>2025-10-30 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631299-karachis-e-challan-riddled-with-errors' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi's e-challan riddled with errors</strong></a><br><p>

The denial comes despite the Islamabad High Court (IHC) last week directing the Adiala jail superintendent to implement a March 24 order that reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for the former prime minister.
Afridi has termed consultation with Imran as crucial in order to announce his new provincial cabinet after he was elected as the chief minister earlier this month.
Speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, Afridi said he was yet again prevented by the police from meeting Imran.
He was flanked by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was approved by the IHC as the designated person to provide the jail officials with the list of individuals named to meet Imran.
 






Afridi highlighted the various legal steps he had taken in order to secure his meeting with Imran, including letters written to the Punjab Home Department and the federal government, along with approaching the IHC.
“Imagine that someone in Pakistan is so powerful that they are considering themselves beyond the scope of the law and the Constitution, so now we are in a quandary about what to do next,” he said.
The chief minister added that the PTI leadership will gather to discuss the matter and announce a plan of action.
In a video statement, Senator Aon Abbas Buppi, flanked by Afridi, said they both were listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today and had departed for Adiala jail.
However, Buppi claimed, they were stopped by the Punjab Police while on their way to the prison.
“What will be bigger shamelessness than this. The Islamabad High Court’s chief justice is ordering the CM in writing that go and meet your leader, and a jail superintendent — a Grade 17-18 officer — said ‘I do not acknowledge any court’,” the senator said.
Without disclosing where they were, Buppi said they were waiting for someone to “come to their senses and allow the meeting”.
 






Earlier today, CM Afridi told reporters in Peshawar that if barred again from meeting the PTI founder, he would file a contempt case against the Adiala jail administration for not following the IHC directives.
A day after he took the oath as the chief minister on October 15, Afridi secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court (PHC) till November 18 and went to Adiala to meet Imran, but failed to do so despite a two-hour wait.
CM Afridi had also filed a separate plea in the IHC seeking permission to meet Imran, on which notices were issued to Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum and others.
 
 

Then, on October 23, after the IHC ordered the jail superintendent to implement the twice-a-week meeting schedule, Afridi headed to Adiala jail but could not do so again.
Most recently, the KP CM visited Rawalpindi on Tuesday but was denied to meet the imprisoned ex-premier for the third time.
Delay in forming KP cabinet
Having faced criticism from KP opposition MPAs over the delay in forming the provincial cabinet, Afridi said earlier today that he would announce a “compact” cabinet later today.
Considering the multiple failed attempts to meet Imran in person, the latter’s sister, Uzma Khanum, told the newly appointed CM on Tuesday he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet.
 
 

“I direct Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi to establish a compact, need-based cabinet. The selection of ministers is entirely his prerogative, as I have proposed no names,” a post on Imran’s official X account quoted him as saying.
KP opposition members have said government affairs had come to a halt due to the failure to form the cabinet.
The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.</p><small>2025-10-30 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/30165236a25ecbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952145/pti-backed-khurram-zeeshan-wins-senate-seat-vacated-after-shibli-farazs-disqualification' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan wins Senate seat vacated after Shibli Faraz’s disqualification</strong></a><br><p>PTI-backed independent candidate Khurram Zeeshan on Thursday was elected as a senator on the general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz, who was the opposition leader in the Senate, after he was convicted in cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots.
A minimum of 75 votes were needed to win the seat.
Zeeshan won a total of 91 votes out of the 137 cast by KP lawmakers during the polling process today. He defeated opposition-backed Taj Mohammad Afridi, who was able to secure 45 votes.
Out of the 145-member KP Assembly, eight lawmakers did not cast their ballots, including four Awami National Party (ANP) leaders. One vote was rejected.
“Thank God,” Zeeshan said in a post on his Facebook account after his win.
“Our priority is Pakistan’s haqeeqi azadi (true freedom)”, the PTI leader told reporters outside the KP Assembly earlier today, echoing a phrase used by Imran.
Though three candidates were in the run for the polls, the main contest was expected to be between Zeeshan and Afridi. Irfan Saleem, another PTI-backed candidate on the electoral roll, was the covering candidate for Zeeshan.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also took part in the voting process, with a post on his X account voicing support for Zeeshan.
 






The polling began at 9:30am and concluded at 4pm, with provincial election commissioner Saeed Gul as the returning officer (RO).

Zeeshan and Saleem had also been nominated by the PTI to contest the Senate elections in 2024, but the polls for seats from KP were postponed and later held in July this year.
Afridi, who hails from the Khyber tribal district, was in 2020 reported to be the richest senator with his assets declared for the previous year amounting to Rs1.22 billion.
 
 

Two other candidates — independent Abid Khan Yousafzai and PPP’s Nisar Khan — withdrew their candidature.
Yesterday, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed the request of Faraz’s lawyer to stay today’s by-polls.
Faraz had challenged his disqualification and subsequent de-notification as a senator before the Peshawar High Court (PHC). However, the PHC earlier this month denied him and two MNAs any relief, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats, and instead ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court.
CM Afridi to announce ‘brief’ KP cabinet today
Separately, CM Afridi said he would announce a “brief” provincial cabinet once the Senate elections had concluded.
This comes two days after PTI founder Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “complete authority” to form the provincial cabinet after he was once again denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier.
 
 

Opposition MPAs in the KP Assembly have criticised the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province.
Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, the chief minister said PTI came to power in the province for the third time because of its “good governance”.
Afridi said he was listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today.
He added that if barred again from meeting his party founder, he would file a contempt of court case against the Adiala jail administration for not implementing the Islamabad High Court’s directives.
During his media talk, the chief minister termed the KP government the “main stakeholder” in the recent counterterrorism talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
CM Afridi said the government and people of KP were not taken into confidence for “any decisions or talks”. While welcoming the Pak-Afghan discussions, he said his government had “some reservations”.
 
 

The chief minister said Pakistan should take decisions while considering its interests. However, he added that the security decisions of KP, which has “sacrificed more than 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism”, should not be taken behind closed doors.
CM Afridi said, “One person comes with his formula and turns them (militants) into Mujahideens and heroes. Another person comes and carries out operations. A third person comes and thinks about rehabilitating them. Then a fourth person again thinks to conduct operations.”
“This is not a laboratory; this is our province,” he quipped, calling for a clear policy and questioning why terrorism had not been eradicated despite thousands of intelligence-based operations.
The chief minister further said legal action should be taken against those responsible for “collateral damage in drone attacks”. He added that an in-house committee of all parliamentary leaders yesterday discussed various topics, including the introduction of laws related to the matter.

People across the Bahamas and nearby Turks and Caicos hunkered down as the passing storm pummelled them with dangerous gusts and rain. Around 600 miles (970 km) northeast of the storm’s last position, Bermudans prepared for its approach, expected by the evening.
Authorities across the region, struggling to keep track of the devastation, confirmed 25 deaths in Haiti - 10 of them children - and four in Jamaica.
As of 1200 GMT (5pm PKT) Melissa was packing winds of close to 105 miles per hour (165 kph), according to the US National Hurricane Centre, downgraded from its peak to a Category 2 hurricane.
Wading barefoot through mud
It was expected to keep accelerating northeastward and “pass to the northwest of Bermuda” later on Thursday, before likely weakening on Friday, the Florida-based forecaster said.
Bermuda will close its causeway on Thursday night and all schools and ferries on Friday, among other measures, “out of an abundance of caution,” National Security Minister Michael Weeks said in a statement.
“I implore all residents to remain vigilant while we navigate another natural threat to our way of life,” he said. People should check on their neighbours and stay off roads until further notice, he added.
Melissa struck Jamaica on Tuesday as the strongest-ever hurricane to directly hit its shores, with sustained winds of 185 mph, far above the minimum strength for a Category 5, the strongest classification for hurricanes.
In a neighbourhood of the island’s Montego Bay, 77-year-old Alfred Hines waded barefoot through thick mud and debris as he described his narrow escape from the rising floodwaters.
At one stage, I see the water at my waist and (after) about 10 minutes time, I see it around my neck here and I make my escape,” he told Reuters on Wednesday.
“I just want to forget it, and things come back to normal.” The capital Kingston, was spared the worst damage, and its main airport was set to reopen on Thursday.
But US forecaster AccuWeather estimated Melissa could cost $22 billion in damages and economic loss, and that rebuilding could take a decade or more. “DEVASTATION,” read the front page headline on Thursday’s Jamaica Observer newspaper.
Evacuations and floods
Melissa was the Caribbean’s third-most intense recorded hurricane, as well as its slowest-moving, which made it particularly destructive, AccuWeather said.
Across the Bahamas archipelago, the government flew out nearly 1,500 people as the storm approached, in what it called one of its largest evacuation operations.
High winds shook palm trees and whipped up waves at a resort near George Town, video showed on Wednesday.
The storm did not directly hit Haiti, the Caribbean’s most populous nation, but lashed it with days of rain. Authorities reported at least 25 deaths, largely due to floods in Petit-Goave, a coastal town 64 km west of the capital, where a river burst its banks.
At least 10 children were killed and 12 people are missing there, Haiti’s disaster management agency said, adding that more than 1,000 homes have been flooded nationwide and nearly 12,000 people moved into emergency shelters.
In Cuba, at least 241 communities remained isolated and without communications on Wednesday following the storm’s passage across Santiago province, according to preliminary media reports, affecting as many as 140,000 residents.
Across eastern Cuba, authorities evacuated around 735,000 people as the storm approached.
Scientists say hurricanes are intensifying faster with greater frequency as a result of warming ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Many Caribbean leaders have called on wealthy, heavy-polluting nations to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief.</p><small>2025-10-30 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631281-sindh-cm-directs-traffic-officials-to-waive-first-e-challan' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CM directs traffic officials to waive first e-challan</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted the police one more week to trace Usman. The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14.
However, according to an Oct 29 short order from Lahore Judicial Magistrate Naeem Wattoo, Usman was in the FIA’s custody and remanded to three days in physical custody with directions to produce him before the district court on Saturday.
According to the remand request from the FIA’s investigating officer, the NCCIA official was arrested on Wednesday in connection with a case of colluding with other NCCIA officials, misusing their authority and extorting bribes.
Usman was nominated in the case registered on Monday by Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who was arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
Apart from Usman, six NCCIA officials from Lahore and Islamabad NCCIA Deputy Director Ayaz Khan and Inspector Salman Aziz were also nominated in the case.
The first information report (FIR) was registered under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 161 (public servant taking gratification other than legal remuneration in respect to an official act) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 5(2)47 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deals with criminal misconduct by public servants.
It stated that the NCCIA had arrested Rehman and the inquiry into his case was assigned to Lahore NCCIA Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz.
The FIR said it was found during the inquiry that Riaz “misused his authority” to “extort Rs9m” through his frontmen from Rehman’s family. It was further alleged in the FIR that Riaz also colluded with Rehman’s lawyer, Chaudhry Usman, for this purpose.
According to the FIR, Riaz extorted Rs6m on the pretext of “providing relief to Aroob Jatoi” and another Rs3m for Rehman’s judicial remand, who had been on physical remand.
In August, Riaz extorted Rs6m in cash through his frontman, Aziz, in Sheikhapura, while the remaining Rs3m was obtained via three cheques of Rs1m each through another frontman identified as Shehbaz, the FIR alleged.
It added that Riaz gave Rs5m to a friend of Lahore NCCIA Deputy Director (acting in-charge) Zawar Ahmed’s for safekeeping, while Rs500,000 was given to Salman Aziz, lawyer Chaudhry Usman and Additional Director Sarfaraz each.
Riaz himself kept Rs2m, the FIR said, adding that it was also found during the inquiry that he had transferred $326,420 from Rehman’s account to his own via Binance.
“During the inquiry, the suspects were found guilty of deceiving detained Saadur Rehman’s family about providing him relief and misusing their authority,” the FIR stated. “It was also found during the inquiry that the suspects were operating as a network and misusing their authorities, taking bribes in cash monthly for facilitating call centres, aggregate companies and individuals involved in online fraud. After keeping their shares, they would give the rest of the amount to the higher-ups.”
Officers at the NCCIA headquarters were sent these amounts via Muhammad Usman and Ayaz, the two NCCIA deputy directors in Islamabad, according to the FIR. Sarfaraz and Zawar in Lahore would hand over Rs 1m to the two officials in Islamabad almost every month, and the latter would then transfer it to the higher-ups, the FIR said.
It added that FIA’s Lahore Anti-Corruption Circle Assistant Director Syed Zainul Abideen was assigned the investigation of the case.</p><small>2025-10-30 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631283-pti-backed-khurram-zeeshan-wins-senate-seat-in-by-poll' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan wins Senate seat in by-poll</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan-Afghanistan ties have deteriorated sharply in recent weeks amid border clashes and mutual accusations. Islamabad has long been warning Kabul against allowing the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil — a claim the Taliban deny. Following a ceasefire, talks in Turkiye began to establish a mechanism to monitor Taliban efforts to curb cross-border attacks, but have so far resulted in an impasse.
At a press briefing, the spokesperson received questions asking why Pakistan was blaming Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij for terrorist attacks on its soil and  Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s remarks about Kabul fighting a proxy war on behalf of Delhi.
“In my last briefing, I had elaborated our point of view; our thoughts on this particular matter. Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its territories,” Jaiswal replied. “Pakistan seems to think it has the right to practice cross-border terrorism with impunity. Its neighbours find it unacceptable.
“India remains committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaiswal said.
 


In response to a question about Indian projects in Afghanistan, Jaiswal referred to Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s recent visit to India and the joint statement issued afterwards.
“As part of the visit, we had issued a joint statement between both countries,” the spokesperson said. “This joint statement clearly emphasises that India stands ready to support all efforts of Afghanistan that are directed towards the sustainable management of water resources, including hydroelectric projects.”
Border skirmishes and failed talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital.
But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.</p><small>2025-10-30 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631274-weak-la-nia-expected-in-november-december-ndma' target='_blank'><strong>Weak La Niña expected in November, December: NDMA</strong></a><br><p>

Discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had begun in Istanbul on Saturday, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern of terror attacks emanating from Afghanistan had been a bone of contention, resulting in a stalemate.
“While the talks have not begun [again], our delegation is still in Istanbul,” Asif said in an exclusive interview with Geo News.
He added that “discussions could still restart” if there was “some development that indicates a material change in Kabul’s attitude on the insistence of these two friendly countries (Turkiye and Qatar)”.
“Our stance, that there will not be any attacks on us (Pakistan) from their land and they will not back such attacks, is a sticking point. If an understanding can be reached on that, [well and good], it will be a good thing,” Asif said.
 


The minister noted, “There has been no breakthrough so far. There has been no development that you can have high hopes from.”
However, he added that the defence ministers and intelligence chiefs of the mediating countries were making efforts to end the stalemate in talks.
Asif said the Pakistani delegation had even reached the airport in Istanbul to depart, but a request was made by Turkiye and Qatar to “give us one more chance”. He said Turkish officials offered to speak to Kabul’s delegation and “pave a way out”.
The minister noted that bilateral trade and investment should take place, but added that it was in the “hands of Kabul if it wanted to play a constructive role in this”.
“But if they are stubborn or are insisting on becoming a proxy of India and backing the destruction of Pakistan’s peace, then so be it,” Asif added.
 
 

The defence minister’s comments come after security sources earlier today said Pakistan had agreed to resume talks with the Afghan Taliban at the request of mediators.
A security official said the Pakistani delegation in Istanbul was about to return, but would extend its stay there.
However, the source stressed that the discussions will be held on Pakistan’s “main demand” that Afghanistan takes “clear, verifiable and effective action” against terrorists.
It was decided to “give another chance to peace” by continuing the talks, the security official said. They added that Pakistan again underscored that Afghan soil will not be used to carry out terrorist attacks against Pakistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a rapid deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with both sides over the past few weeks engaging in border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
A first round of Pak-Afghan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19 had extended an initial 48-hour truce between the neighbouring countries. The Doha talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
The second round of dialogue in Istanbul failed to “bring about any workable solution”, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said late on Wednesday after four days of deliberations. The statement was followed by strongly worded remarks by Asif, who warned Kabul of strikes deep in Afghanistan if terrorist activities continued to target Pakistan.
Obstacles in reaching agreement
According to Asif, the Afghan Taliban acknowledged that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) must be stopped from carrying out attacks and “that they use our (Afghan) soil”.
However, the other side “was not ready” to give the assurance in writing, despite agreeing with them, the minister told reporters at Parliament House yesterday.
Asif stated that Pakistan was not offered to include the TTP in the talks, and even if it had been, the proposal would not have been accepted. He said the Afghan delegation was in continuous contact with Kabul, which was colluding with India and preventing an agreement.
In a separate interview with Al Arabiya, the minister said he had evidence to back his assertions that New Delhi was “pulling the strings” during talks with Taliban representatives in Doha and Turkiye.
 
 

Asif asserted that “India is actually waging a low-intensity war against us from the Afghan territory and trying to settle the score“ after the May conflict with Pakistan, where it was “defeated”.
The talks in Turkiye had began with the aim of finalising a mechanism to monitor Afghan Taliban actions aimed at preventing cross-border terrorist attacks.
The agenda included dismantling known TTP sanctuaries, arresting or expelling key figures and defining clear timelines and benchmarks for measurable action such as raids, arrests and destruction of safe houses.
To ensure implementation, Islamabad had planned to propose mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, cross-border coordination and real-time monitoring of militant movements and financing. Pakistan also supports establishing a third-party oversight structure, potentially co-chaired by Turkiye and Qatar, to verify progress and address non-compliance.
Additional priorities included securing Afghan assurances against providing safe havens to hostile groups, strengthening border control, ensuring financial transparency on militant funding and holding regular review meetings to assess compliance.</p><small>2025-10-30 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/301237486cc4d4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952156/imaan-mazari-hadi-ali-chattha-indicted-in-case-pertaining-to-controversial-social-media-posts' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chattha indicted in case pertaining to controversial social media posts</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Thursday indicted human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, in a case related to controversial social media posts.
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
 
 

Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the case, in which Mazari and Chattha both denied guilt.
The court summoned all prosecution witnesses for the next hearing and ordered Chattha to once again submit bail bonds, to which Mazari responded, “If you want to arrest us, reject my bail as well.”
The judge replied, “My principle is that if I respect you, I will get respect.”
Mazari’s advocate, Qaiser Imam, pointed out that the accused also had to appear in other cases, “sometimes at the Islamabad High Court (IHC), sometimes in Rawalpindi”.
However, in response, Judge Majoka said that he had “adjourned the hearing three times on their request for that reason”.
The court then adjourned the hearing till November 5.
Yesterday, Chattha had been arrested outside the courtroom for non-appearance, despite Mazari claiming that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom” on social media platform X.
 






He has now been released.
Speaking to reporters outside the court today, Chattha claimed that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”, saying, “This was not according to any law.”
He added that Majoka had recalled his “illegal order” even before they could argue against it today, but had insisted that they submit another Rs10,000 bail bond as the previous one had been forfeited. He also recalled this order after Chattha refused to comply with it, the advocate said.
“The principle is this … you are running a court, you are a judge; how are you so far removed from the four corners of law?” he said while speaking to the media. “Why do you feel that doing this (specifically targeting the two accused) will get you praise?”
Chattha also said that the era of the courts intimidating people with the threat of jail time or punishments was over, saying, “Nowadays, word spreads very quickly. People are present — witnesses are present and they see this.”
 






Asked what proceedings had been delayed yesterday and whether they had taken place today, the advocate said that only four days after the supply of copy, the court wanted to frame the charge. According to him, the judge had told the accused beforehand that if there were cases against them, they could come in at the end of the day as he was there until 3:30pm.
“Imaan went first in the morning, then at 11am, then sat there waiting for him from 2-2:30pm,” he said. “He did not leave his chamber.”
Chattha added, “The moment I got back from cases in Pindi, I was present in court before 2:35pm. And he got angry that I had appeared at the end of the day, so he couldn’t indict me … So he forfeited the bail bonds and issued the warrant to my face and had me arrested from the courtroom.”</p><small>2025-10-30 09:40</small></div><hr>
