It’s my go-to icebreaker with drivers in Pakistan. Lately, the answers have been unsettlingly similar. “I used to work in the development sector,” one man told me. “Then I lost my job.”
I’ve heard that line — or a version of it — too many times to dismiss as coincidence.
Since the United States pulled the plug on its aid apparatus, the fallout has been immediate. On the surface, the shutdown of USAID is being framed as just another abrupt policy reversal — a bureaucratic casualty in an era of disruption. But look closer, and it reveals something far more profound: the cumulative weight of domestic and international tensions that have been simmering, both within and beyond the US for decades.
Cycles of aid, cycles of distrust
The first source of strain lies beyond US borders. From its inception as a Cold War instrument, American foreign aid has been shaped by an enduring tension between its declared objectives of development and altruism and its underlying strategic and political calculations.
This duality has long been apparent to the recipient elites and the broader public alike. During the Cold War, many governments acquiesced, in part because Western donors faced little competition and alternative sources of assistance were scarce. That landscape has since changed. As non-traditional donors, most notably China and the Gulf states, have expanded their presence, and as domestic political incentives within recipient countries have shifted, scepticism toward USAID has become more explicit and politically salient.

 

In countries such as Pakistan, where mistrust of American intentions runs deep, US assistance is often perceived less as generosity than as intrusion. What is now framed as a backlash against American aid is better understood as the culmination of a long-simmering tension and a legacy of mutual misperceptions between donor and recipient.
Pakistan’s experience with US foreign aid agency illustrates this dynamic with particular clarity. American assistance to Pakistan has never been linear or predictable; instead, it has unfolded in cycles closely attuned to Washington’s shifting strategic priorities. During the Cold War, aid was channelled primarily through a security-alliance framework aimed at containing the Soviet bloc, with economic assistance tightly coupled to military cooperation. These flows declined sharply after the 1965 war, reinforcing perceptions of US aid as conditional, transactional, and reversible.
Another peak in this equation followed in the 1980s, when General Ziaul Haq aligned Pakistan with the US in opposing Soviet expansion in Afghanistan. Yet with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the subsequent imposition of US sanctions on Pakistan’s nuclear programme under the Pressler Amendment, assistance once again contracted. It was only after 9/11 that the aid surged anew, this time framed around counterterrorism and stabilisation. Even at its height, however, much of this assistance remained shaped by security imperatives, short funding horizons, and heavy reliance on contractors, rather than long-term institution-building.
For many Pakistanis, therefore, the shutdown of USAID feels less like an abrupt rupture than the latest turn in a familiar cycle of engagement and disengagement.
The second factor is bureaucratic pathologisation. Like many large organisations, aid agencies are susceptible to institutional dysfunction, and USAID has been no exception. In practice, particularly in contexts such as Pakistan, as commissioner on the Afghanistan War Commission Andrew Wilder has noted, its programmes increasingly came to be structured through a security lens rather than a development one. Key decisions were made in Washington, filtered through multiple layers of contractors, and ultimately deployed on the ground with limited scope for local input.
At the same time, bureaucratic incentives privileged projects with easily quantifiable indicators, favouring what could be measured over what was substantively effective. These patterns were neither accidental nor new, nor are they unique to the US. Over time, however, they eroded both the legitimacy and the perceived effectiveness of USAID, among recipients abroad and critics at home.
These institutional dynamics had tangible consequences on the ground. In Pakistan, USAID funding became heavily concentrated in sectors aligned with stabilisation and security objectives — such as service delivery in so-called “fragile” districts or rapid-impact infrastructure — often at the expense of slower, politically unglamorous investments in local institutional capacity. NGOs and development professionals structured entire career paths around USAID project cycles, only to see those opportunities vanish when priorities shifted or funding was abruptly frozen.
The result was a hollowing out of local expertise and institutional memory. When aid was withdrawn, it left behind far fewer durable institutions than its scale and visibility might have led one to expect.
The mismatch between stated development objectives and the underlying security logic was further compounded by an overreliance on quantifiable metrics to demonstrate impact. This tendency was reinforced by a development ecosystem shaped by the overproduction of economists and political scientists trained as methodological specialists rather than regional experts. Programmes designed in Washington often prioritised what could be easily counted — number of schools built, clinics refurbished, trainings delivered, or kilometres of roads completed — over whether such interventions meaningfully strengthened local institutions.
In Pakistan, this logic was especially evident in sectors such as education, health, and local governance, where projects were assessed primarily through output indicators rather than sustainability or local ownership. Multiple layers of contractors further diluted accountability and blurred responsibility once funding cycles ended. Over time, this produced a paradox: USAID became both omnipresent and poorly understood — associated with large budgets and extensive reporting, but yielding limited and uneven institutional impact. That credibility gap left the agency especially exposed when domestic political support in the US began to erode.
The third major factor behind the dismantling of the aid lies in the domestic backlash within the US against international cooperation. Opposition to foreign aid, multilateralism, and international institutions long predates Donald Trump, reflecting decades of polarisation over globalisation and America’s role in the world. By the time Trump entered office, hostility toward international engagement was already deeply embedded in US politics.
In this context, shuttering a highly visible aid agency became a potent domestic signal; it becomes a way to demonstrate responsiveness to voters who view global commitments as costly, wasteful, or illegitimate. Dismantling USAID was therefore less a recalibration of foreign policy than an act of domestic political theatre.
The US government’s official justification for shutting down USAID frames the move as a response to “China’s exploitative aid model” and a means of advancing American “strategic interests in key regions around the world”.
It is true that China has dramatically expanded its development footprint and largely operates outside the traditional Western aid framework. But that explanation doesn’t hold up to deeper scrutiny. If Washington were genuinely seeking to compete with Beijing in the development arena, the more coherent response would have been reform and reinvestment, not withdrawal.

 

Moreover, Chinese and US aid are not direct substitutes. They target different sectors, rely on distinct instruments, and frequently operate alongside one another in the same countries — Pakistan among them — without displacing each other.
In Pakistan, Chinese assistance has concentrated on large-scale infrastructure and energy projects, while USAID has focused primarily on education and health. Chinese aid typically flows through bilateral, government-to-government channels, whereas US assistance has often bypassed the Pakistani state, working instead through NGOs and contractors. China’s rise may well be sharpening anxieties in Washington, but it does not, on its own, explain why the US would choose to erode its own institutional capacity in response.
A looming domino effect
The shutdown of USAID, then, should not be understood as a one-off policy blunder or an idiosyncratic choice tied to a single administration. Rather, it reflects the convergence of long-accumulating tensions: between the professed ideals and strategic deployment of aid abroad; between development objectives and bureaucratic practices within aid agencies; between international commitments and domestic political incentives at home.
USAID’s collapse is best understood not as the cause of these pressures, but as their most visible manifestation.
The consequences of this decision extend well beyond the fate of a single agency. They reveal the fragility of the broader international aid regime, which ultimately depends on the willingness of a small number of leading powers to absorb the political and financial costs of institutionalised cooperation.
When that willingness erodes, institutions lose both credibility and purpose and eventually collapse. Signs of this erosion are already evident, as other major donors, including the United Kingdom and Germany, begin to scale back their own aid commitments.
What is at stake, then, is not merely the dismantling of USAID, but the gradual unravelling of an international aid regime built on mutual trust and a sustained commitment to lifting the world’s poorest out of poverty.</p><small>2026-02-17 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17124627c804c28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973884/fire-breaks-out-at-chemical-factory-in-karachis-site-area-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Fire breaks out at chemical factory in Karachi’s SITE area: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A fire broke out at a chemical factory in Karachi’s SITE area on Tuesday, Rescue 1122 said.
Spokesperson Rescue 1122, in a statement, said that the chemical factory was located near Valika Chowrangi and efforts were underway to control the fire.
“A fire brigade truck, along with rescue teams, was immediately dispatched to the site of the incident, as soon as the Rescue 1122 received report of the incident,” the spokesperson added.
A contingent of Sindh Rangers personnel was also dispatched to the site of the incident, their spokesperson said in a statement.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in the relief activities and rescue operation along with the fire brigade and rescue personnel,” the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab took notice of the incident. In a post on X, Mayor Wahab said, “KMC fire team is attending to the fire incident reported at a factory in SITE Industrial Area. Will keep everyone posted.”







According to an earlier statement, Mayor Wahab had “directed all departments of the KMC to stay alert”.
He issued instructions to utilise all available resources for the rescue operation. The statement added that the “water board authorities were also instructed to take emergency measures”.
“All possible steps should be taken to control the fire,” the mayor was quoted as saying.
“There will be no compromise made on the safety of human lives,” he added.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, as per a statement, directed Mayor Wahab and the commissioner to supervise the rescue efforts and investigate the cause of the fire.
The incident comes a day after a huge fire erupted in the bushes near the University of Karachi (KU). It was brought under control later.</p><small>2026-02-17 07:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17120510975f13f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973880/alleged-serial-killer-shot-dead-by-accomplices-while-fleeing-custody-in-gujranwala-claim-police' target='_blank'><strong>Alleged serial killer shot dead by accomplices while fleeing custody in Gujranwala, claim police</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A suspected serial killer, accused of kidnapping and murdering at least four people, was reportedly killed by gunfire from his own accomplices during an alleged encounter with the Gujranwala police on Tuesday.
A spokesperson for the Gujranwala police said that the suspect, who was caught while attempting to flee from Lahore to Karachi via train, had been in the custody of the Gujranwala police on physical remand.
He claimed that the police team was taking the suspect to an area he had identified to recover the murder weapon, when unidentified armed accomplices of the suspect intercepted the police party.
The police spokesperson further claimed that four armed accomplices opened fire on the police in an attempt to free the suspect from custody. “However, the suspect was killed by gunfire from his own accomplices while trying to flee,” the spokesperson added.
The attackers fled the scene shortly afterward, he said. The police later moved the suspect’s body to the Gujranwala District Headquarters Hospital for an autopsy.
The spokesman said that a case was being lodged against the attackers and that the police had started an investigation into the incident.
Earlier on Monday, Gujranwala City Police Officer (CPO) Dr Ghias Gul told reporters at a news conference that police found two unidentified bodies of a 32-year-old woman and her five-year-old son along the bank of a canal near Citi Housing Society on Feb 10.
Both the deceased, he said, had been slain with a sharp-edged weapon. They were later identified, and a case of double murder was lodged on the report of a police official.
The CPO added that the suspect was nabbed by a special investigation team while attempting to flee.
The suspect, he said, had confessed to killing the woman and her two children, including her eight-month-old daughter Mubara. The second child’s body was recovered from the canal after the suspect was identified. The suspect revealed that he had killed the three victims to steal the gold earrings the woman was wearing.
The CPO added that the suspect had also confessed to killing a 13-year-old boy from Mado Khalil in the Ladhewala police precinct on December 20 last year.</p><small>2026-02-17 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17113355bb41234.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973877/bears-continue-to-dominate-as-kse-100-loses-over-1500-points-during-early-trading' target='_blank'><strong>Bears continue to dominate as KSE-100 loses over 1,500 points during early trading</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, lost 1587.06 points by 11:10am on Tuesday.

The opposition on Monday decided to extend their sit-in, which began on Friday, for another day to “see the government’s response” to their demand for access to the former premier, whose health has recently been called into question by a medical report following his examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn, said that as Tuesday was supposed to be a meeting day with Imran, two of the sit-in participants — Salman Akram Raja and Barrister Gohar Ali Khan — would be going to Adiala jail, as their names had been included in the list of those to meet the PTI founder.







“Moreover, we are hoping that the meeting of all sisters or at least one of the family members will be allowed today,” he said. “It will end the rumours about the health of Imran Khan, as they will directly hear from him and will share Khan sahib’s views regarding his health.”
Responding to a question, Yousufzai said that the government should allow the meeting as it may help defuse the current tensions if the medical report regarding Imran was correct.
“It is a fact that during the last two years we have been deceived a number of times, due to which the level of trust has been reduced,” he said.
The spokesperson added that the family needed to meet Imran, after which the three sisters would hold a press conference.
The spokesperson further said he met KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi last night, where it was decided to hold an evening meeting to determine the next course of action.
“During the meeting, we will consider the next phase of our sit-in and movement,” he added.

 

Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s (SC) intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which quoted Imran as saying only 15 per cent vision was left in his right eye.
This prompted a strong response from the opposition alliance, which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination.
Meanwhile, another protest outside the Parliament Lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while KP CM Sohail Afridi led a demonstration at the KP House.
Imran’s party, family ‘reject’ medical report
Imran’s party and family have rejected the report issued by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday, sticking to their demand that he be taken to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital in the presence of his personal doctors.
In a post on X, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram referred to the statement by Imran’s longtime personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf, who had spoken to the doctors currently treating the ex-prime minister.
Akram noted that Dr Yusuf said “that he neither met Khan nor could he talk to him nor could he examine him or take care of him, therefore he can neither confirm nor deny” the report prepared.
He stated that the PTI “rejects this report and strongly demands that Imran Khan sahib be immediately met by his family and personal physician and that he be immediately treated and examined at Al-Shifa International”.
“To issue such a report by having doctors of one’s choice examine him shows that something is definitely being hidden and the only solution to avoid all this is to immediately have Imran Khan examined at Shifa International on the recommendation of his family and personal physician,” Akram contended.







In her statement posted hours earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said: “We categorically REJECT all the medical reports circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan.”
“[…] as Dr Asim Yousuf stated in his video, there is NO way for us to verify any of this,” she highlighted.
“Now we are even more concerned and worried and our demand remains unchanged: Imran Khan must be urgently transferred to a proper medical facility (Shifa International Hospital Islamabad) where he shall be examined by qualified specialists under Dr Asim Yousuf’s supervision and in the presence of his family,” Aleema demanded.
She added that she and others will be at the Adiala jail at 1:30pm today to attempt to meet Imran.
“We expect the authorities to allow us to meet Imran Khan as this is his legal right. The family will also hold a press conference outside Adiala at 4pm after our meeting with Imran Khan,” the sister said.

Rahman is set to take over from an interim government that has steered the country of 170 million people for 18 months since the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina was overthrown.
The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin.
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) lawmakers are expected to formally elect Rahman as their leader, with President Mohammed Shahabuddin then to administer the oath of office to the prime minister and his ministers later on Tuesday afternoon.



Rahman, 60, chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country’s most powerful political dynasties, won a landslide victory in the February 12 elections.
“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” he said in his victory speech on Saturday.
“This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”
But he has also warned of the challenges ahead, including tackling the economic woes of the world’s second-largest garment exporter.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by the authoritarian regime, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions, and a deteriorating law and order situation”, he added in his victory speech.
The new leader has pledged to restore stability and revive growth after months of turmoil that rattled investor confidence in the world’s second-largest garment exporter.

 

He has also called for all parties to “remain united” in a country polarised by years of bitter rivalry.
‘Peaceful opposition’
Rahman’s win marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.
The BNP coalition won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance.

 

Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament — a four-fold increase on its previous best — has challenged results in 32 constituencies.
But Jamaat leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.
Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part in the elections.
Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal” election.
But India praised the BNP’s “decisive win” — a notable shift after deeply strained ties.
Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.
Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven per cent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.

 

Despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.
“If the BNP can do a good job with the economy, it will make everything else easier for the government,” Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean said.
“It will help to create a level of stability, to tackle the many other challenges beyond the economy.”</p><small>2026-02-17 05:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17093419376cd2c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973768/serial-killer-held-for-slaying-four-in-gujranwala' target='_blank'><strong>Serial killer held for slaying four in Gujranwala</strong></a><br><p>GUJRAT: The Gujranwala police on Monday arrested a ‘serial killer’ involved in kidnapping and killing of four people, including a woman and her two children as well as a 13 years old boy after snatching valuables from them in different hits.
Gujranwala CPO Dr Ghias Gul told reporters at a news conference on Monday that police found two unidentified bodies of a 32 years old woman and her five years old son along the bank of canal near the Citi Housing Society on Feb 10.
Both the deceased, he said, had been slain with a sharp-edged weapon. They were later identified as Malaika and her son Muhammad Ahmed and a case of double murder was lodged on the report of a police official.
The CPO said a special investigation team under SP Civil Lines Imran Khan and DSP Hameed Virk was constituted that used modern techniques and traced a suspect namely Haroon Javed who was nabbed while making an attempt to flee to Karachi from Lahore via train.
The suspect, he said, had confessed to have killed the woman and her two children – eight months old daughter Mubara through asphyxiation and threw her body into the canal. The body of deceased girl was recovered from the canal on the identification of the suspect.
The suspect revealed that he had killed three people of a family just to snatch gold ornaments the woman was wearing in her ears.
The suspect belongs to the same area of Alam Chowk where the deceased woman resided.
The CPO said that the suspect had also revealed to have killed 13 years old boy Rehan Ali of Mado Khalil locality in the precincts of Ladhewala police on Dec 20 last.
The suspect, he said, had kidnapped the boy to snatch a bridal dress from him and later murdered him. The boy had been sent by his father to deliver the dress to a customer in a nearby vicinity.
A case of kidnapping of that boy had been lodged with the police against the unidentified suspects on the report of his father Muhammad Imran who ran an embroidery factory in the area.
The CPO commended the police team for tracing and arresting the killer.

In Gaza, we have witnessed genocidal violence; Israel’s ultimate aim is seemingly to ethnically purge the coastal Strip of its native inhabitants. Meanwhile in the West Bank, the Israeli state is paving the way to permanently occupy Palestinian territory through ‘legalised’ land grabs.
The latest move in this regard has been the approval by the Israeli cabinet to declare large parts of the West Bank as ‘state land’, thereby allowing for their annexation, in violation of international law. Israel’s extremist finance minister — who has said on record that Palestinians are “fictitious” — has termed this a “settlement revolution”. The Palestinian presidency, meanwhile, has called the Israeli move a “serious escalation”, while Hamas has described it as an attempt to “steal and Judaise lands”.
As many observers have noted, including Israeli rights groups, if Tel Aviv goes ahead with this dark plan, it will effectively dash all hopes of a two-state solution. While violent illegal Jewish settlers are being facilitated by the Israeli regime to occupy even more Palestinian land, the Arabs are required to submit high burdens of proof, with documents dating back a century, to establish ownership. Very few Palestinian families — who have been uprooted and exiled for decades — would have such documents in their possession.

 

But it is not just in the Palestinian territories where Israel exhibits its insatiable greed for devouring land belonging to others. In Syria, while it has occupied the Golan Heights since 1967, it has seized more Arab land in the aftermath of the Assad regime’s downfall, while Tel Aviv also continues to occupy various Lebanese outposts. These facts illustrate that the Zionist state very much intends on recreating the mythical ‘Greater Israel’, stretching from the Nile to the Euphrates.
US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace — originally formed to address the situation in Gaza — is due to meet on Thursday. This meeting may also be its litmus test; the BoP must take firm action to stop Israeli killings in Gaza — over 600 Palestinians have been murdered since the October ceasefire — while calling for a halt to illegal land grabs in the West Bank. The Israeli foreign minister is expected to attend, and if Mr Trump is serious about the ‘peace’ component in the name of his new board, he must use all his powers to convince the Israelis to end their atrocities in occupied Palestine.
Pakistan, which has condemned the latest Israeli move, and the other Muslim states that will be attending the moot, must unequivocally condemn Israel’s actions from the BoP platform, and ensure that the bloodshed in Gaza and continuing annexation of Palestinian land in the West Bank are brought to an immediate halt.

“I’ll be involved in those talks, indirectly. And they’ll be very important,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.







Tensions are soaring ahead of the talks, with the US deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East. The US military is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Asked about the prospects for a deal, Trump said Iran has long sought a tough posture in negotiations but learned the consequences of that approach last summer when the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
Trump suggested Tehran was motivated this time to negotiate.“I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” Trump said.
Washington pushes Tehran to forego enrichment
Prior to the US strikes in June, US-Iran nuclear talks had stalled over Washington’s demand that Tehran forgo enrichment on its soil, which the US views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon.
“We could have had a deal instead of sending the B-2s in to knock out their nuclear potential. And we had to send the B-2s,” Trump said, referring to the bat-winged US stealth bombers that carried out the bombings.
“I hope they’re going to be more reasonable.”
The remarks contrast with those by the US president on Friday, when he embraced potential regime change in Iran and lamented decades of failed talks.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi met with the UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday, saying in a post on X that he was in Geneva to “achieve a fair and equitable deal.” “What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araqchi said.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440 kg of highly enriched uranium following Israeli-US strikes and let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed in June last year: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.
Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in retaliation against any attack, which would choke a fifth of global oil flows and send crude prices sharply higher.
Iran held a military drill on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital international waterway and oil export route from Gulf Arab states, which have been appealing for diplomacy to end the dispute.
Despite Trump’s comments about Iran seeking a deal, the talks face major potential stumbling blocks. Washington has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues such as Iran’s missile stockpile.
Tehran says it is only willing to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief and won’t accept zero uranium enrichment. It says its missile capabilities are off the table.
Speaking during a visit to Hungary on Monday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said reaching a deal with Tehran would be hard.
“I think that there’s an opportunity here to diplomatically reach an agreement … but I don’t want to overstate it either,” Rubio said.
“It’s going to be hard. It’s been very difficult for anyone to do real deals with Iran, because we’re dealing with radical clerics who are making theological decisions, not geopolitical ones.”</p><small>2026-02-17 04:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651280-how-will-weather-be-during-ramadan-2026' target='_blank'><strong>How will weather be during Ramadan 2026?</strong></a><br><p>

They ply democracies. They ply autocracies. They work for the rich. They work for the toiling masses. The American parliament, Congress, made president Barack Obama look impotent and isolated by showering Benjamin Netanyahu with deafening applause and a standing ovation, mocking their head of state’s opposition to the Israeli leader’s visit. The Russian parliament, or the Duma, on the other hand, was attacked with tanks by its disputed and unconstitutional president at the time, Boris Yeltsin. The Duma had impeached Yeltsin, but he had the military behind him. Western capitals that have arrogated the right to declare what is kosher and what isn’t about the people’s will, applauded the assault on Russia’s elected deputies.
The Speaker’s role is vital in running parliaments or subverting them. History is replete with relevant lessons. The Reichstag Speaker’s role was key to turning Adolf Hitler into the unimpeachable Führer. It was a Nazi masterstroke to appoint Hermann Göring as the president of the Reichstag without whose machinations Hitler could not have continued as chancellor. A terrified German president Paul von Hindenburg got wind of Hitler’s nefarious plans to hijack parliament. He dispatched an emissary to dissolve the Reichstag. Göring carefully ignored the messenger, a rival right-winger Franz von Papen, until as the Speaker he had helped pass the Enabling Act to give Hitler his unbridled powers. It was only after the deed was done, so to speak, that he beckoned the emissary and read Hindenburg’s orders. As per the Nazi plot, Göring declared that Hindenburg’s orders arrived too late.
India’s opposition parties, principally the Congress, are ranged against Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. They accuse Birla, who has had long-standing links with the neo-fascist RSS, of not letting them speak on crucial issues dogging the nation. They want to remove him but don’t have the numbers to vote him out. Now the BJP is considering barring Rahul Gandhi from parliament and future elections. There’s a trade deal with the US that needs urgent attention amid opposition accusations that it’s a sell-out.
Then there’s the spin-off from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal that has not left India’s ruling elite untouched. India’s foreign ministry moved swiftly to shield Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s unflattering mention in the files. The ministry slammed Epstein’s mention of Modi as “trashy ruminations of a convicted criminal”. Now the Mandelsons, the Andrews and the Starmers might help themselves to the stunning Indian response to arm themselves against the damning fallout.

Parliaments uphold democracy, and they subvert it just as readily.

In the midst of all this, a stalemate has stalled discussion, which opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has sought over a book by former army chief M.M. Naravane. The government says the book doesn’t exist even as Gandhi has been flaunting a copy without being allowed to discuss its embarrassing contents for the government. Delhi Police wasted no time in filing an FIR over the mysterious surfacing of a “non-existent book”. Caravan magazine first broke the story citing the ghost book which the publishers now need to explain to the police.

 

Parliaments uphold democracy, and they subvert it just as readily. Richard Nixon was impeached by his parliament and forced to resign. Bill Clinton and Donald Trump were impeached but endured the embarrassment to survive. Taciturn Narasimha Rao, believed to be an intellectual prime minister, insidiously betrayed India’s parliament by bribing MPs from Jharkhand Mukti Morcha to win a close trust vote. He was the toast of the elite for winning the vote, led by business dailies and their editors. The foundations of the celebrated liberalised economy owe more than gratitude to the corruption carried out inside the hallowed precincts of India’s parliament. Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his part refused to summon the Upper House to discuss the Kargil war, which he fought as a lame-duck prime minister after losing the Lok Sabha’s trust by a single vote shortly after the stunning 1999 Lahore summit with Nawaz Sharif.
Not letting Rahul Gandhi reference a former army chief’s book that the defence ministry has blocked is indefensible. Every major scam has come to the notice of India’s parliament and to the people through something that was published or broadcast by a local or foreign media outlet. What has changed? The Congress boasted parliamentarians of the calibre of Feroze Gandhi, a role model for as piring journalists. He unearthed such massive financial scandals that his father-in-law Jawaharlal Nehru’s government felt seriously jolted. Nehru didn’t use his political muscle to get the Speaker of the Lower House to stop his son-in-law and Indira Gandhi’s husband from revealing the embarrassing facts to the country. In fact, before the debate was over, the concerned minister was forced to resign. Those were the days of probity in politics, and professional scruples in journalism.
Other books have been quoted too to put the government of the day on the mat. The most memorable perhaps is Mystery of Birla House (1950) by Debajyoti Burman. It was a critical book, not a fictional mystery, that investigated the rapid and often controversial accumulation of immense wealth by the Birlas, particularly during the 1943 Bengal famine. It explored how the family business prospered while others suffered, highlighting close ties with the colonial government. The Birlas, as it turned out then and happens ever too often now, bought the entire first edition and the second edition of the book before they bought the copyrights of the book from Burman. He opened a leftist press with the money.
Had the economic history teacher at JNU, the late Prof Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, not mentioned it in his class, one would have perhaps never thought of tracking down the solitary copy of the book that evaded Birla’s clutches. If it can be found in the ‘rare books’ section of the Nehru library at Teen Murti Bhavan, it could only be thanks to the probity that parliamentarians of yore were committed to.

Published in Dawn, February 17th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-17 04:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/17091933685eb9c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973870/frances-macron-eyes-rafale-fighter-jet-deal-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>France’s Macron eyes Rafale fighter jet deal in India</strong></a><br><p>French President Emmanuel Macron begins a three-day visit to India on Tuesday, with talks focused on artificial intelligence cooperation and a potential multibillion-dollar Dassault Rafale fighter jet deal.
France is seeking to expand its military partnership with New Delhi, with discussions expected on a potential contract for 114 additional French fighter jets.
Macron and his wife Brigitte arrived around midnight on Monday in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, for his fourth visit to India since taking office in 2017.
He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on Tuesday.
Macron will then travel to New Delhi for an artificial intelligence summit on Wednesday and Thursday.
The visit follows New Delhi’s confirmation last week that it intends to place a major order for Rafale jets, as well as the signing of a landmark free trade agreement between India and the European Union in January.
‘Contract of the century’
New Delhi has sought over the past decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment, turning to other countries while also pushing for more domestic production.
An Indian defence ministry statement last week said the proposed purchase of Rafale jets had been cleared, with “the majority” of them to be manufactured in India.
The statement did not specify the exact number of jets New Delhi would purchase, but a New Delhi defence ministry source said that 114 was likely.
Christophe Jaffrelot, an India specialist at Sciences Po Center for International Studies in Paris, described the potential $35 billion deal for 114 Rafales as the “contract of the century” and a potential “crowning achievement” for bilateral ties.
If finalised, the jets would add to the 36 Rafales India purchased for its air force in 2016 and 26 it has ordered for its navy.
Negotiations over the additional aircraft still need to be concluded with manufacturer Dassault Aviation, but the French presidency has voiced optimism that what it calls a “historic” agreement could be reached.
‘Good chemistry’
Modi and Macron will also inaugurate on Tuesday India’s first helicopter final assembly line via videoconference from Mumbai, a joint venture between India’s Tata Group and Airbus.







The facility in Vemagal, in the southern state of Karnataka near the tech hub of Bengaluru, will manufacture the Airbus H125, the company’s best-selling single-engine helicopter.
France has emerged as one of India’s most important defence and economic partners in the last decade.
“Through this visit, we seek to further strengthen cooperation” with India, and to “diversify” France’s economic and trade partnerships, Macron’s office said.
India, the world’s most populous country with 1.4 billion people, is on track to become the fourth-largest economy globally.
This week’s talks are also expected to address global economic uncertainty triggered by tariff policies under US President Donald Trump, as well as China’s influence in the region.
Modi’s office said discussions would focus on “cementing the strategic partnership and further diversifying it into new and emerging areas”.
Bilateral trade between France and India, driven largely by defence and aerospace — India’s commercial fleet includes a substantial number of Airbus aircraft — stands at around $18 billion annually.
French foreign direct investment in India totals nearly $15 billion.
The two leaders will also be keen to nurture close personal ties.“There is apparently a good chemistry, a good personal rapport,” Jaffrelot said.
One sensitive issue remains Ukraine: India has not condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion and has continued buying oil from Moscow.US President Donald Trump has said India had committed to halting the purchases, though that has not been formally confirmed by New Delhi.
“If the Indians stop buying Russian oil, they won’t be blamed for abstaining at the UN,” Jaffrelot added.</p><small>2026-02-17 04:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6993d3d056323.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973841/eye-of-the-storm' target='_blank'><strong>Eye of the storm</strong></a><br><p>IT has been a worrying week for the PTI as the news about Imran Khan’s health became public and dominated news headlines and private conversations. From the sketchy information that came out initially, it appeared that he had some problem with his eye and has lost up to 85 per cent of his vision in that eye. This was reported by lawyer Salman Safdar, after his court-appointed visit to Khan at Adiala jail, though there had been news reports about the matter earlier. According to Safdar, the percentage was communicated to Khan by the doctors who examined him.
The government’s earlier reaction appeared a bit inexplicable. It took the government days to confirm the problem, after it had been reported in the media. And then it did nothing while the Supreme Court woke up to take notice, sending Safdar to the jail. Over the weekend, there were reports that a team of doctors had been sent to the jail to examine him, while his family and personal doctors continued to wait for access. As the family and party refused to accept the government’s decision of giving access to only certain individuals (rather than the family being allowed to choose the person) the examination was carried out at the jail by doctors without any relative present.
The party is trying to build up pressure through protests and sit-ins, which seems to cause no sleepless nights to the government. This is so despite reports that KP is cut off from the rest of the country. The PTI is getting criticised for this though it is hard to understand why the federal government is ignoring it.

 

To return to Adiala, this is a good time for a reminder that health issues, especially of imprisoned political prisoners, should not be downplayed or treated lightly. For this reason, the government should provide all help possible to Khan; this includes allowing his family and personal doctors access to him, so they can take decisions on his health, instead of the government making the call on which experts should conduct the examination and which family members can be present. This reeks of callousness.

The reports of Khan’s ill health have added fuel to the talk of a probable deal.

However, there is a political angle to this entire crisis. The reports of Khan’s ill health have added fuel to the talk of a probable deal or ‘dheel’, as it seems to share some parallels with the platelets issue which allowed Nawaz Sharif to be freed and flown to London. In fact, the question being asked again and again in Islamabad is if this is Platelets 2, implying that some backroom deal is being worked out.
It is important to point out that the rumours did not just emerge as a result of health worries but also because of the events of the past couple of weeks where the cooperation between the federal and provincial governments improved. Once this happened, the allegations of drugs and other criminal activities directed at Chief Minister Sohail Afridi gave way to praise for his cooperation with Islamabad. So once the reports of the illness emerged, it simply lent credence to rumours that something was cooking.
At the moment, it is hard for those of us who live away from Constitution Avenue to comment on these rumours with any authority. And beca­u­­se I would like to feel better about my ignorance, perhaps some of those living on Constitution Avenue may also be as ill-informed as the rest of us mortals.
Despite this, there is much support for the idea of a deal. For many within the PTI think it would provide respite to Khan and others and allow them to bide their time for a return to power (as in the case of other politicians in the past). On the government side, it is seen as a way to bring some stability to the situation, allowing the focus to remain on the economy.
But all of this ignores a larger issue, beyond the comfort of those in power and in the opposition. In other words, beyond the level of high politics, where the players tend to be the establishment, the parties and individuals, what will this deal bring to dissatisfied people who have been feeding into the popularity and stature of Khan? Indeed, it is this anger which has resurrected Khan and the PTI each time a fatal blow has been struck in the direction of the party in what is ‘high politics’. Be it the forcible exits from the PTI of the more well-known faces or the decision to deprive the party of its symbol — popular support for it has ensured that none of these steps proved sufficient.
So it is perhaps worth asking what the impact of such a ‘deal’ would be. Suppose the deal does disillusion the supporters of Khan and undermines his popularity in a way similar to Nawaz Sharif and the PML-N. (The economy and its poor performance landed the second blow on N’s popularity.) And then what options will be left for the people to still stay engaged in electoral politics. Will they opt for other, smaller political parties? Or will they look around for more radical options?
The point here is that the establishment needs to realise that it not going to be enough to win over politicians to its side; this is not what will make the system more stable. For the system to be more stable, it is not enough to quieten politicians such as Sharif or Khan and then revel in the decline of their popularity. For real stability, the anger of the people will have to be understood and then addressed through a more equitable economic system and by giving them a voice. Instead of focusing on high politics, it might help if for once attention were paid to the level at which people operate and exist. After all, electoral politics in Balochistan was tamed some time ago, but stability continues to be elusive.

KARACHI: Moving scenes were witnessed before the judicial tribunal investigating the Gul Plaza inferno on Monday when 23 relatives of 33 deceased persons narrated their ordeal, pointing fingers at the rescue work, firefighting and slow response by authorities.
In their statements before the single-judge tribunal headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court, they deposed that entry-exit points of Gul Plaza were closed, firefighters arrived late, ran out of water, lacked equipment and skill, while rescue authorities made no efforts to break the walls and windows to rescue people trapped inside.
Many of the witnesses broke into tears while testifying before the commission, which heard them at the Deputy Commissioner South Complex.
One of the witnesses, Haleem, deposed that his father and brother were inside the building when the fire broke out on Jan 17. He said his father lost his life and brother suffered injuries when he jumped out of the building to save his life.
He said firefighters faced a water shortage while the building’s electricity was switched off shortly after the fire broke out.
Witness Mohammad Hanif testified that his two sons were killed in the tragic incident. He said rescue officials made no efforts to break the walls and windows to rescue the people. He said police resorted to baton charge him and other relatives of the people trapped inside when they gathered near the plaza.

 

Another witness, Qaiser, whose wife, son and sister-in-law were killed in the blaze submitted before the tribunal that he had asked the recuse and firefighters to break a wall in order to rescue people, but to no avail.
He maintained that rescue authorities had lacked proper equipment and machinery.
Taj Mohammad, whose father was killed in the incident, blamed the fire and recuse officials for not fulfilling their responsibilities. He said that he, along with a cousin, managed to reach the rooftop of the building, but rescue officials did not brother to reach there in order to save people. One gate of the building was opened and other exit-entry points were closed, he added.
Saima, who lost her son in the incident, submitted that she and her daughter-in-law remained present outside the building for nine days, but the authorities did nothing to rescue their loved ones. She deposed that her other sons also participated in the rescue operation.
Shahnaz, whose son worked at one of the Gul Plaza shops and lost his life, broke into tears during her testimony.
Sanaullah said his sister was killed in the deadly fire and blamed the provincial and local authorities for the tragic incident.
Abdul Hafeez, who also lost his son, informed the tribunal that the firefighters were short of fuel and water.
Ahsan Ahmed, who lost his brother, also deposed that fire tenders were present on the spot but facing water shortage.
Mohammad Hadi said that his son was also killed in the fire, but an assistant commissioner asked him to file an affidavit about the presence of his son in the building at the time of incident.
Later, the tribunal provided the witnesses a questionnaire and asked them to submit it at the next hearing.
The commission sought reply to 17 questions about the arrival of fire tenders and rescue staff, proper equipment for rescue and firefighting, prompt availability of ambulances, whether police facilitate evacuation or create confusion and the roles of district administration and the management of ill-fated building.
The commission will also record the testimonies of various officials of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, Sindh Building Control Authority, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation, Sindh police, Gul Plaza Shopping Mall Association, K-Eclectic and others on Wednesday (tomorrow).

PM Shehbaz arrived in Vienna a day earlier on a two-day visit, with the Foreign Office (FO) noting that it marked the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria since 1992.
PM Shehbaz and Stocker held a “restricted meeting” at the Federal Chancellery today, which was followed by delegation-level talks, a press release issued by PID said.
The delegation talks included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, and Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch.
The statement read: “Both leaders recalled the friendly and historic ties between the two countries and committed to work together more closely to further strengthen the bilateral relationship in diverse fields, including economic cooperation, trade and investment, tourism, hospitality, education, IT, healthcare and human resource development and mobility.
“To this end, they agreed to work for the early finalisation of MoUs (memoranda of understanding) under consideration related to these areas.”
The premier and the chancellor also “exchanged views on regional and global developments, and agreed on the central role of the United Nations in addressing the challenges of peace and security, peaceful settlement of disputes, sustainable development, climate action and protection and promotion of human rights”.

 

“They expressed their shared commitment to multilateralism and appreciated mutual support for each other’s candidatures, while working together with the international community for strengthening the UN system,” PID added.
PM Shehbaz thanked Stocker for the “meaningful and productive meetings” during the visit, which he said would lend fresh impetus to bilateral ties.
He also extended an invitation to the chancellor to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at his earliest convenience.

According to the PID statement, the premier and the chancellor co-chaired a meeting of chief executive officers (CEOs) from leading Austrian and Pakistani companies working in a wide range of areas.
“It was agreed to expand G2G (government to government), G2B (government to business) and B2B (business to business) engagements between the two countries through the effective utilisation of the existing platforms,” the statement read.
The prime minister invited the Austrian businesses and companies to participate in the upcoming EU-Pakistan Business Forum to be held in Islamabad in April this year.
PM Shehbaz and Austrian Federal Economic Chamber Vice President Carmen Goby also witnessed the signing ceremony of an MoU between Pakistani and Austrian companies.







In a post on X later, PM Shehbaz stressed that his visit “carries special significance as we are having a high-level visit after more than three decades”.
“It also coincides with the 70th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan–Austria diplomatic relations,” he noted.
He termed the meeting with Stocker “most warm and productive”, reiterating that the two reaffirmed their countries’ resolve to work closely in diverse fields.







‘Pakistan working to jointly ban illegal immigration’
Separately, PM Shehbaz stated that Pakistan was working with European partners to “jointly ban” illegal immigration.
Addressing the Pakistan–Austria High-Level Business Roundtable in Vienna, he affirmed Pakistan was “absolutely” against illegal immigration and was “working with our European friends — Austria, France, and Germany — to jointly ban this illegal immigration [and bring it] to a grinding halt”.
He assured Austria that Pakistan would fulfil its “demand for skilled labour” as per the international certification required by it.
Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities.
A 2023 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European Union (EU) found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.



At the outset of his address, the premier stressed that Pakistan and Austria shared “long-standing friendly relations”.
The premier outlined the areas in which the two countries remained “proactively engaged”, including mining and minerals and renewable energy.
He detailed that he held meetings with the leadership of Austria, stating that he aims “to take many of these discussions to their logical conclusion”.
He noted that 6o per cent of Pakistan’s population was young and “needed modern training in their hands, including laptops, AI, and IT-led initiatives”.
PM Shehbaz highlighted that Pakistan held “huge potential” in the field of agriculture.
“Here, Austria can be a great partner, providing Pakistan with experience and modern technology to have value-addition in the field of citrus root, and make marmalade, juices and export them to Austria, the Middle East and other parts of the world”, the premier added.
FM Dar’s remarks
FM Dar delivered the opening at the roundtable, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said.
It added that the forum brought together leading businesses from both countries, reflecting the positive momentum in Pakistan–Austria trade and investment ties.
Speaking on the occasion, Dar emphasised expanding cooperation in trade, investment, technology, and innovation, while highlighting Pakistan’s ongoing economic reforms and focus on improving the ease of doing business.
He noted the “natural complementarities between Austria’s technological strengths and Pakistan’s dynamic market and young workforce”.
The FO statement said that he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to a stronger partnership with Austria and expressed confidence that enhanced business-to-business linkages, institutional collaboration, and sustained political engagement would open new avenues of growth, connectivity, and long-term economic partnership with Austria and across the European region.







Earlier on Monday, PM Shehbaz was welcomed by Stocker upon his arrival at the Austrian Chancellery and was presented with a guard of honour, the Prime Minister’s Office said.







The statement said that the national anthems of both countries were played at the arrival, and both leaders “introduced their respective delegations to each other before proceeding for tête-à-tête and the delegation-level talks”.
The premier also penned his remarks in the guest book at the Chancellery.

The ruling party’s leaders and workers have closed M-1 at Swabi rest area since last Friday to demand early treatment of their incarcerated leader, Imran Khan, for “vision loss”.
The closure of M-1, the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country, has put the Grand Trunk Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway.
Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment. The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed.

Businessmen wonder why PTI govt troubling people of KP

Jan Mulk, a businessman, who was travelling from Islamabad to Peshawar on Sunday evening, told Dawn that he left Islamabad at around 4:30pm and reached Attock at around 6:30pm before finding himself caught in a huge traffic jam at Attock crossing.
“Hundreds of vehicles were stuck in a long traffic grid lock and there was not even any way to turn back,” he said.
The businessman said that the Attock traffic gridlock forced him to return and spend the night in Islamabad before coming to Peshawar next morning.
“There were women, children and elderly, with a large number of them being on foot due to road closure and unavailability of public transport,” he said.
Mr Mulk said transporters in Attock were charging commuters Rs1,000 for a trip to Rawalpindi.
Khan Zaman Afridi, president of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Transporters Association, told Dawn that road closures had made life difficult for transports.
“Nearly 3,000 vehicles leave Peshawar General Bus Stand on a daily basis but the number has dropped to around 1500 due to road closures,” he said.
Mr Afridi said almost all public transport used the M-1 and now its closure has diverted all the traffic to the GT Road and a usual trip of two to three hours on motorway was taking over 10 hours on GT Road.
“GT Road is not old GT Road and is full of potholes and full of vans, Qingqi motorcycle-rickshaws and push carts, so it is very difficult to traverse and now, the entire motorway traffic has been diverted to it, causing massive traffic snarl,” he said.
Mr Afridi said that due to the road closures, many people had stopped travelling, and commuter arrivals at bus stands had almost halved as only people who had to attend urgent business meetings travelled in compulsion.
“It is ironic that the KP government is inflicting pain on its own people,” he said.
A representative of Faisal Movers told Dawn that his transport company had stopped its Peshawar-Islamabad operations since the start of the M-1 closure.
Junaid Altaf, president of KP Chamber of Commerce and Industry, questioned the rationale for the motorway closure.
“Who are they troubling? Is it the people of KP or residents of Punjab and Sindh who are being affected due to the M-1 closure?”
Mr Altaf said that KP chief minister and his cabinet had been sitting in Islamabad for the past many days, leaving their offices and official duties unattended.
He said that the prolonged closure of Pak-Afghan border points had already ruined the province’s business community and now, the politicians didn’t understand that the trucks stranded on the road to KP carried raw material to factories in the province and prolonged closure was hurting the business community as well as the economy of the province.
“If PTI thinks the people of KP deserve this for voting them to the powers, then it is ok and we deserve it,” he said.
Malik Sohni, president of All Pakistan Agriculture Produce Traders Federation, told Dawn that road closures had resulted in an over 10pc increase in the vegetable prices in the provincial capital.
He said that in the current season, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, okra, garlic, peas and leafy vegetables were transported from Punjab to Peshawar.
Mr Sohni said that as vegetables were perishable, prolonged blockages not only caused spoilage but also drove the prices up.
“Prices automatically go up when fresh supplies don’t reach on time,” he said.

The analysis, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, examined 22 previous studies involving nearly 2,000 adults across Europe, North and South America, China and Australia.
Researchers compared short-term fasting regimens — including the popular 5:2 diet and time-restricted eating plans that confine meals to eight-hour windows — with traditional advice to reduce calorie intake, or no dietary guidance at all, over periods of up to 12 months.
The findings were stark: the fashionable approach made little discernible difference to either weight loss or quality of life when measured against standard dietary advice. Luis Garegnani, the lead review author from the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, said intermittent fasting might be a reasonable option for some individuals, but the current evidence does not justify the enthusiasm observed on social media. While the authors expressed moderate confidence in the findings, they noted some underlying studies used less robust methods.
Nevertheless, the rev­i­ew is likely to pour cold water on a trend that has gained enormous traction online.

LONDON: The British Museum has removed the word ‘Palestine’ from some of its gallery displays, revising maps and information panels in its ancient Middle East collections on the grounds that the term was used inaccurately and is no longer historically neutral.
Reports in leading British papers, including The Guardian, said the changes affect displays in the museum’s ancient Levant and Egypt galleries, where parts of the eastern Mediterranean coast had previously been labelled as ‘Palestine’, and some individuals described as being of “Palestinian descent”.
At least one panel in the Egypt galleries was amended to replace “Palestinian descent” with “Canaanite descent”.
The revisions followed representations from UK Lawyers for Israel (LFI), a voluntary group of solicitors, which wrote to the museum’s director arguing that the retrospective application of the term ‘Palestine’ across thousands of years obscured historical change and erased the emergence of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah from around the first millennium BCE.
In its response, the museum said that while ‘Palestine’ had been widely used in Western and Middle Eastern scholarship since the late nineteenth century as a geographical designation, it no longer carried a neutral meaning and is now often understood as referring to a modern political territory.
The museum said it uses ‘Can­aan’ for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BCE, UN terminology for modern political boundaries, and ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.
The decision has prompted criticism from historians and members of the public, with more than 5,000 people signing a petition calling for the museum to reverse the changes and arguing that they contribute to the erasure of Palestinian presence from public memory.
The Guardian also noted that while several displays have been updated, the museum claims these changes were made last year after feedback and audience research. Historian and author William Dalrymple criticised the move, calling it ridiculous to remove the word ‘Palestine’, when it has a greater antiquity than the word ‘British’.
“The first reference to Palestine is on the Egyptian monument of Medinet Habu in 1186 BCE. The first reference to Britain is the 4th century BC when it appears in the work of the Greek traveller Pytheas of Massalia,” he wrote on X. In a subsequent post, Dalry­mple said that after speaking with the museum’s director, Nich­olas Cullinan, he had lear­ned that reports about the muse­um cancelling the name ‘Palestine’ altogether were inaccurate.







Quoting Cullinan, Dalrymple wrote: “To reassure you we are not removing mention of Pales­tine from our labels. Indeed, we have a display on at the moment about Palestine and Gaza.”
According to the historian, the director of the British Museum had said that only two panels in the ancient Levant gallery were amended last year during a routine gallery refresh, and that the director had not been aware of the issue until it became public. Cullinan was quoted as saying he had not seen the letter from UK Lawyers for Israel until recently and was “disgusted by the whole thing”.
Criticism
Academics who spoke to Middle East Eye defended the historical validity of the term. Marchella Ward, a lecturer in classical studies at the Open University, said “ancient Palestine” was a legitimate scholarly descriptor. “I use the term ‘ancient Palestine’ frequently in my own research and will continue to do so,” she said, adding that claims the term is illegitimate are aimed at “the erasure of Palestinians”.
The campaign group Energy Embargo for Palestine accused the museum of hypocrisy, saying it claims to objectively communicate history while “preparing itself to rewrite history, to erase Palestine, and its millions of people, out of the history books”.
Critics also argue that the museum’s decision fits into what they describe as a broader pattern of pressure exerted by UKLFI on public bodies.
According to the European Legal Support Centre (ELSC), a forthcoming database documents hundreds of incidents of alleged anti-Palestinian repression in the UK between 2019 and 2025, with UKLFI appearing in a significant number of cases.
Giovanni Fassina, executive director at ELSC told Middle East Eye that the targeting of the British Museum was part of a “very clear pattern” of letters threatening legal action or alleging breaches of UK law.
ELSC and the Public Interest Law Centre have submitted a complaint to the Solicitors Regulation Authority over UKLFI’s alleged use of strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs).
The UK Charity Commission has also confirmed it is investigating the group’s charitable wing following complaints by advocacy organisations.
UKLFI had argued in its letter that describing ancient civilisations as Palestinian creates “a false impression of continuity”.

The message, posted by Erdogan’s team on X, said he had talked with Al Nahyan by phone.
“During the course of the call, President Erdogan expressed his sadness over the health problem experienced by (President) Al Nahyan and wished him a prompt recovery,” said the three-paragraph message.







Erdogan would travel to the United Arab Emirates at a later date, still to be determined, the message added.
Although the message — of which AFP has a screen grab — was quickly deleted from the account, it had already been picked up by official Turkish media.
Turkiye’s state broadcaster likewise took down its article on Erdogan that mentioned the Emirati leader’s health problem.
The official Emirati news agency, WAM, reported on the telephone conversation between the two leaders, but did not mention that Erdogan’s visit had been postponed.
Contacted by AFP, neither the Turkish presidency nor the Emirati authorities — who have themselves made no statement on their president’s health — have yet answered.
The Emirati leader’s team on Saturday evening released photos taken the same day showing Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, smiling and apparently in good health, with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar.

The outage, which str­u­ck the platform owned by Elon Musk, rendered the site largely inaccessible for approximately two hours before timelines began populating and functionality returned to normal.
The platform appeared to be operating as usual by 3:30pm GMT. The restoration came shortly after Down Detector, a website that tracks online service interruptions, recorded a sharp spike in user reports regarding the site’s performance earlier in the afternoon.
Downdector indicated that in Pakistan, the number of users reporting issues peaked at 6:54pm with a total of 275 complaints, subsequently decreasing to 8 by 7:54pm.
During the disruption, internet connectivity monitor Netblocks posted on the open-source social network Mastodon that X appeared to be suffering “international outages”.







Netblocks, which tracks technical issues on major platforms as well as government-imposed internet shutoffs, clarified that Monday’s breakdown was “not related to country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
Access issues were verified globally, with journalists in countries including France and Thailand reporting an inability to access the platform.
Representatives for X did not immediately resp­ond to requests for comment regarding the cause of the outage.

A Shangla police official said a terrorist attacked a police party during a search-and-strike operation in the Kabalgram area, resulting in the martyrdom of three policemen. The police retaliated swiftly and eliminated two attackers.
The official added that the operation was ongoing in the area and a large police contingent had been dispatched to the spot.
The martyred personnel were identified as Head Constable Maqbool Ahm­ad and Elite Force constables Saeed-ur-Reh­man and Fida Hussain.
IED blast
Meanwhile, Bannu pol­ice said two people, including a Hafiz-i-Quran boy, were killed when an IED planted on a motorcycle parked outside shops near the Miryan police station exploded with a loud bang. At least 17 others were injured in the explosion.
According to Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson Muha­m­mad Noman, the bodies of the deceased and the 17 injured were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital.
Police and security forces cordoned off the area immediately after the incident, collected evidence from the site, and launched a search operation.

Under the notification, however, the Power Division also imposed a nominal Rs1,000 per consumer per month fixed charge on smaller industrial consumers, on the pattern of similar charges on residential consumers imposed last week. The new rates are effective from Feb 11, 2026.
This industrial consumer category is defined as B1 in official jargon for a connection load of up to 25kW. Its average tariff has been reduced from Rs30.80 per kwh (unit) to Rs26.03. This includes new off-peak rates of Rs25.48 instead of Rs30.05 and a new peak rate of Rs35.74 instead of Rs36.74 per unit. The fixed charges for the remaining three industrial categories have been kept unchanged at Rs1,250 per kilowatt per month.
The average energy rate for the B2 category, with a 25-500kW load, has been fixed at Rs26.16 per unit instead of Rs30.73. Its off-peak rate has been revised to Rs22.83 per unit instead of Rs27.41, while peak rates have been set at Rs35.68 instead of Rs36.68 per unit.

Tells Nepra to restore contractual rights of old net-metered solar consumers

Larger industrial consumers (B3) on 11–33kV transmission lines will now be charged an average energy price of Rs27 per unit instead of Rs31. Their off-peak rate has dropped to Rs23.67 from Rs28.24, while peak rates have come down to Rs35.68 from Rs36.68 per unit.
The tariff for the largest industrial consumers (B4) on main 66-132kV transmission lines has been reduced to Rs26.43 from Rs30.43 per unit. Their peak and off-peak rates are now set at Rs35.68 and Rs27.96 per unit instead of Rs36.68 and Rs23.38, respectively.
The Power Division also formally requested Nepra to suspend the withdrawal of specific contractual benefits to old prosumers under the PM’s directive. Nepra has again called for public comments within 30 days on fresh amendments to Nepra Prosumers Regulations 2026, notified only last week.
In the fresh amendments, Nepra is seeking deletion of subsection (2) of section 21 of the Prosumers Regulations 2026, which had changed payback rates for old consumers to Rs8.13 from Rs26 per unit and shifted them from net metering to net billing. The proposed clause now reads that existing approvals, licences and agreements will remain valid, and prosumers will continue to be billed under old rates and mechanisms until the expiry of their agreements.
Nepra introduced the prosumers regulations in February, attracting widespread condemnation from prosumers and political parties for disregarding government contracts.
Reacting to the backlash, PM Shehbaz Sharif sought a review of Nepra’s revised rules for rooftop solar users and directed the Power Division to file a reconsideration request to restore all contractual obligations to existing prosumers who had invested in response to government policies.
The PM directed that all possible protections for existing consumers be ensured and that a mechanism be formulated to prevent any undue transfer of the cost burden of 466,000 prosumers onto other national grid consumers.
Sources said Nepra suspended the controversial clauses. Other regulations for upcoming prosumers, including net billing and the Rs8.13 per unit payback rate, will remain in field as notified on Feb 9.
Under the new regulations, prosumers will be shifted to net billing instead of net metering, and their exported units will be credited for one month instead of the current three months.
Under net billing, electricity generated by a prosumer is purchased by the relevant distribution company (Disco), and the consumer is billed for electricity imported from the grid at about Rs37-55 per unit, after receiving credit for exports at the National Average Energy Purchase Price of Rs8.13 per unit.

JAKARTA: Indonesia is preparing a total of 8,000 troops for potential deployment to Gaza by June as part of a proposed multinational peacekeeping force but the final decision on deployment rests with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, the country’s army spokesperson said on Monday.
Army spokesperson Donny Pram­ono noted that initially 1,000 soldiers would be ready for deployment by early April.
“The departure schedule rema­ins entirely subject to the political decisions of the state and applicable international mechanisms,” Pra­mono said in a text message.
Indonesia’s foreign ministry clarified on Saturday that its military’s participation in the UN-mandated International Stabilisation Force should not be interpreted as a normalisation of political relations with Israel, a nation Jakarta does not recognise.
The deployment would carry a non-combatant, humanitarian mandate and requires the consent of the Palestinian Authority.
“Indonesia consistently rejects all attempts at demographic change or the forced displacement or relocation of the Palestinian people in any form,” the ministry said, adding that its troops would have no mandate to demilitarise any party.
The deployment plans are being announced as global leaders convene for the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, which will be chai­red by US President Donald Trump. Additionally, President Subianto is set to travel to Washington this week to participate in the event.
While the board was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution to oversee the Gaza truce, the European Union insisted on Monday that while it will participate in the meeting, Brussels would not be joining as a member.
European Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Suica will represent the bloc in Washington.
“She will participate in the meeting of the Board of Peace for the specific part dedicated to Gaza. Let me stress that the European Commission, it’s not becoming a member to the Board of Peace,” EU spokesman Guillaume Mercier said.
Some member states have raised concerns that the board could morph into a rival to the UN. “We still have a number of questions regarding several elements in the Board of Peace: one concerning its scope, two concerning its governance, and three, its compatibility with the UN Charter,” EU spokesman Anouar El Anouni said.
Meanwhile, Italy aims to play a role in stabilising the Middle East by offering training support while their Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani confirmed Rome is ready to participate as an observer.
“We are ready to train a new Gaza police force, and we are also ready to train a Palestinian police force,” Tajani told a news conference in Rome.
Ahead of the summit, President Trump announced that members of the US-led body have pledged more than $5 billion for Gaza’s reconstruction and committed thousands of personnel to international stabilisation efforts.
Trump plans to host the meeting on Feb 19 at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington.

JERUSALEM / ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan denounced the latest Israeli move to convert areas of the West Bank into “state property”, the UN chief called upon Tel Aviv to reverse its new, “unlawful” policy allowing registration of the occupied land in the occupied territory as state property.
Israel’s foreign ministry claimed the measure, approved late on Sunday, would enable “transparent and thorough clarification of rights to resolve legal disputes” but the move drew strong condemnations from across the globe for its violation of international law.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said this new measure was destabilising and unlawful, according to a statement by his spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
Pakistan also denounced the step as a clear violation of international law as well as relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions. Islamabad urged the international community to reject the decision, said a statement issued by the For­eign Office spokesperson. It added that the occupying power continued to disregard international law and its provocative actions undermined the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region.
“Pakistan calls on the international community to take concrete measures to end Israeli impunity, and ensure respect for international law,” the spokesperson added.
‘Undermine peace efforts’
Arab nations Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar and Jordan also criticised the move as illegal. The measure is “aimed at impo­sing a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank” that would undermine peace efforts in the region, Saudi Arabia’s foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II said the actions “undermine efforts to restore calm and thr­e­aten to exacerbate the conflict,” according to a statement released by the royal court.
The European Union called on Israel to reverse the move. “This constitutes a new escalation after recent measures already aimed at extending Israeli control,” EU foreign affairs spokesman Anouar El Anouni said. “We reiterate that annexation is illegal under international law.”
The Ramallah-based Palest­inian Authority called for inte­r­national intervention to prevent the “de facto beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state”.
Israeli anti-settlement watc­­h­dog Peace Now called the measure a “mega land grab”. Jonathan Mizrachi, the NGO’s co-director, told AFP that the move would attribute new resources for land registration.
“There was a lot of ambiguity regarding the land, and Israel decided now to deal with it,” Mizrachi said, adding that the grey area over Area C land ownership was likely to be used against Palestinians.
“A lot of land that Palestinians consider theirs, they will find out it’s not theirs under this new registration process,” he said, believing the move would further the Israeli right’s annexation agenda.
Changing demography
Palestinians see the West Bank as foundational to any future Palesti­nian state, but many on Israel’s religious right want to take over the land.
The latest Israeli initiatives come in the wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to rights groups.
“We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a recent statement.
US President Donald Trump has opposed Israel’s annexation of the West Bank, saying stability in the territory helps keep Israel secure.
However, he has held off from dire­ctly criticising the new Israeli measures, despite the international outrage.
Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, more than 500,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and outposts, which are illegal under international law.
Around three million Palestinians live in the territory, which Israel has occupied since 1967.
Al-Aqsa restrictions
Israeli police said Monday that they would deploy in force around the Al-Aqsa Mosque during Ramazan, as Palestinian officials accused Israel of imposing restrictions at the compound.
Over the course of the month of fasting and prayer, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians traditionally attend prayers at Islam’s third-holiest site. Arad Braverman, a senior Jerusalem police officer, said forces would be deployed “day and night” across the compound, adding that thousands of police would also be on duty for Friday prayers.
Braverman said police had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.
The Palestinian Jerusalem Governorate said it had been informed that permits would again be restricted to men over 55.

As part of its Vision 2028 agenda, the SBP launched Cyber Shield, a major initiative aimed at strengthening the safety and robustness of the country’s banking and financial system.
The banks have been facing increasing incidents of cyber crimes, while the international organisations believe that every second Pakistani is facing the cybersecurity problem.
With the rapid digitisation and very high growth of online payments, cyber threats have also increased. Bankers said the situation is not alarming, but there is a need to implement quick remedies to control it, which would help strengthen the banking system in Pakistan.

Outlines key priorities to counter growing threats by 2030

“The milestones laid down in the strategy will be implemented in a phased manner by 2030. All regulated entities are required to align their internal cybersecurity programs with the strategy to ensure compliance,” said the SBP.
The central bank said the strategy has been designed to better protect banks and financial institutions from cyber threats, thus ensuring that people and businesses can continue to access financial services safely.
The SBP said it set out a clear roadmap to help financial institutions strengthen their systems and controls, prevent cyber incidents, respond quickly when cyber threats materialise, and recover effectively from them.
“As the banking ecosystem faces increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, the strategy aims to enhance cyber defences of the regulated entities through a holistic, forward-looking and collaborative approach,” said the SBP.
Bankers said cybersecurity experts are not available to meet the growing demand in financial institutions, as many young Pakistani experts prefer jobs abroad with higher pay. There is no attractive policy to retain cybersecurity experts in the country.
The SBP said the Cyber Shield focuses on five key priorities: strengthening the ability of banks to withstand cyber incidents, improving governance and accountability for cybersecurity, encouraging cooperation and information-sharing across the financial sector, building skilled cyber talent, and continuously updating security practices to keep pace with new risks.
“The SBP will closely monitor both global and domestic cyber developments and will update the strategy as needed to address emerging threats,” said the SBP.
By strengthening cyber resilience across the banking sector, SBP aims to safeguard customers, support digital innovation in a secure environment and ensure financial stability, it added.
About 90 per cent of bankers believe that cybercrime is the biggest challenge confronting the banking industry in the country, according to a previous survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Pakistan.
Seventy per cent list fraud as their major concern, and 60 per cent believe terrorism financing is the biggest threat, the survey showed.
“Banks in Pakistan operate within an evolving financial crime compliance ecosystem,” said the survey report.

ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power and Regulatory Authority (Nepra) came under fire on Monday over abrupt changes to the net metering policy, as the National Assembly Stan­ding Committee on Industries and Production questioned the rationale of the move which would “shatter the trust of the investors in the government policies”.
In a meeting held under the chairmanship of MQM’s Syed Hafeezuddin, the parliamentarians and the government officials criticised the policy change from net metering to net billing.
Earlier this month, Nepra drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network.
According to the committee chairman, the policy will have serious implications for the government’s reputation. When the regulator can honour the commitments made to the independent power producers, it should also respect the response by industries and individuals who availed the net metering policy introduced by the government, he said.
Mr Hafeezuddin said the industrial units opted for this policy and invested in solar power systems, but they have been left in a lurch after the new net billing policy was introduced by the government.

 

Members of the committee and even the industries secretary expressed concerns that the policy change would shatter the trust of investors in government policies as well as discourage industries from adopting clean technologies. The com­m­ittee noted that the premise used by Nepra to change the policy was not based on any “rat­i­onal study” by the power ministry.
“Pakistan needs to promote solar and other clean energy for the industries; it will help reduce the cost of doing business on a long-term basis,” Mr Hafeezuddin added.
Development projects
The key agenda of the NA panel’s meeting was to review and approve the ongoing development projects under the various departments of the industries ministry. After strict scrutiny of the project, the committee turned down a large number of projects, demanding their monitoring reports from the Planning Commission. The delay and cost escalation particularly irked the panel members.
“I know and I understand that Covid and dollar crises, and a change in government had some impact on all matters,” Dr Mehreen Bhutto said, adding that all projects had been delayed by six to nine years and the briefs given to the lawmakers were “always incomplete — why is that the case”.
Committee members, including Abdul Hakeem Baloch and Shahid Usman, contradicted the claims made by the departments under the Ministry of Industries regarding several development projects. Responding to the projects in Hub and Karachi, the chairman reprimanded the officials that he had been to these areas and the ground reality was different.
While Shahid Usman had a different picture of the projects in Gujranwala, Dr Bhutto highlighted that the briefs presented to the committee lacked even basic details.
“There is no mention of rupees in millions or billions in the brief, the details are incomplete,” she added.
The committee members noted that departments opt to go for new buildings and purchase land for projects instead of using the land of non-functioning state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
“It is understandable why the SOEs are making losses,” Mr Hafeezuddin said.
The committee also discussed the case of a former employee of the Engineering Development Board, Engineer K.B Ali, who was transferred back to his parent department but he has approached the court of law and obtained a stay order.

Tehran’s foreign minister arrived in Geneva for the new round of indirect negotiations with the US, as the Revolutionary Guards began military drills in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping lane for oil and gas.
The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
“A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one,” said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, the official IRNA news agency reported.
According to Tehran, talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday in Switzerland.
Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.
The war games being conducted by the Guards, the ideological arm of the military, aim to prepare it for “potential security and military threats” in the Strait, Iranian state TV said.
Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic waterway through which about 20 per cent of global oil passes, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday, “We’re hopeful there’s a deal”.
“The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.”
Meanwhile, Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, wrote on X that he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, “for deep technical discussion”.







Grossi later confirmed the meeting on X, calling the conversation with Araghchi “in-depth” ahead of Tuesday’s “important negotiations”.







Protest crackdown
Araghchi is also set to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as other international officials, Iran’s foreign ministry said.
“I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal. What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araghchi added on X.







Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
The latest talks follow repeated threats from Trump of military action against Tehran, first over Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country’s nuclear programme.
The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.
His remarks came before demonstrations outside Iran against its authorities swept a number of cities, including in the US, over the weekend.
‘Viable’ deal
Iran’s deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy.
“If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement,” said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran’s ability to enrich more.
The whereabouts of Iran’s stockpile of around 400 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to 60 per cent remains unknown, with inspectors having last seen it in June.</p><small>2026-02-16 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651222-imran-khans-sons-fear-for-his-health-seek-visas-to-visit-him-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sons fear for his health, seek visas to visit him in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which said only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye.
This prompted a strong response from opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP), which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination.
The protest, which began on Friday, entered its fourth day today, with TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai saying that it would continue till Tuesday.
He shared this information with Dawn hours after a medical report was released following Imran’s examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
“We have gone through Imran Khan’s medical report, but we will not be satisfied unless his family and personal physicians are allowed to meet him,” he said, adding that the opposition had asked for Imran’s cousin Dr Nosherwan Barki and other family physicians to be provided access to him.
He also reiterated the opposition’s demand for shifting Imran to Shifa International Hospital, claiming: “We got a commitment from [Interior Minister] Mohsin Naqvi, [Parliamentary Affairs Minister] Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and [Prime Minister’s Assistant on Political Affairs] Rana Sanaullah that Imran Khan will be moved to the hospital.”
But, he continued, the government sent a team to the Adiala jail instead for Imran’s medical examination.
“The government deviated from its commitment,” he claimed.
Earlier in the day, routes to the Parliament House, which were blocked ahead of the sit-in on Friday, were cleared.
Speaking to Dawn in the morning, Yousafzai said it was a surprising step that all the routes had been cleared.
“First of all, we are going to have breakfast after four days, as previously we were eating only dates and biscuits and were being forced to drink tap water. It has been decided to merge the sit-in at the Parliament lodges with the one at Parliament House,” he had added.
The opposition’s sit-in was initially held at three places, including the Parliament House, led by TTAP head Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. The protest outside the Parliament Lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, KP CM Sohail Afridi led the demonstration.
The sit-in at the KP House was also ongoing on Monday night, in which KP Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi has also been participating.
Speaking to the media there, he stressed that getting medical treatment under the supervision of his personal physicians and in the presence of his family was Imran’s constitutional right.
“Imran Khan is not an ordinary prisoner. He is a former prime minister and the leader of a major political party,” Afridi said, adding that barring the PTI founder’s family and personal physicians from meeting him was increasing “apprehensions”.
He stressed that the health of Imran Khan was a matter “beyond politics and must be treated accordingly”.
If Imran’s medical report released today was accurate, “there is no justification for denying access to his personal doctors and family”, he said.
On Sunday, a team of doctors examined the PTI founder at Adiala Jail and left the premises after around an hour, sources said.
The party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital.
“We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party.
“We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad,” he told Dawn.</p><small>2026-02-16 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16224547c622ed5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973714/sri-lankas-8-wicket-win-over-australia-leaves-2021-champions-on-brink-of-exit-from-the-tournament' target='_blank'><strong>Sri Lanka’s 8-wicket win over Australia leaves 2021 champions on brink of exit from the tournament</strong></a><br><p>Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka scored the first century of the 2026 T20 World Cup on Monday to put his side into the Super Eights and leave Australia on the brink of elimination.
Nissanka scored 100 not out off 52 balls with five sixes and 10 fours as Sri Lanka, chasing Australia’s 181, reached 184-2 with two overs to spare in Kandy to win by eight wickets.
A victory by Zimbabwe over Ireland in Group B on Tuesday, or against Sri Lanka on Thursday, would eliminate the 2021 champions.
If Zimbabwe lose both, Australia will need to beat Oman in their final match on Friday by a big margin to get through on net run rate.
Nissanka was involved in a 97-run stand off 66 balls with Kusal Mendis for the second wicket with the wicketkeeper-batsman posting his third fifty in the competition.
Nissanka became the first Sri Lankan to score two hundreds in T20 internationals.
After Mendis’s dismissal, Nissanka and Pavan Rathnayake put on 76 off 34 balls to see Sri Lanka to victory.
Nissanka played some glorious cover drives off the spinners and played some elegant flicks against the quicks.
Sri Lanka came into the World Cup after a 3-0 drubbing at the hands of England, but have gained momentum and have won all three games so far.
Australia’s campaign has been plagued by injuries.
Their captain, Mitchell Marsh, who missed the first two games, returned and gave them a rollicking start by scoring 54.
Marsh and Travis Head (56) scored 104 runs off 51 balls for the first wicket.
With Australia eyeing a total in excess of 200, Sri Lanka’s slow bowlers kept them to 181 with leg-spinner Dushan Hemantha picking up 3-37.
Australia collapsed as they looked for quick runs, losing their last six wickets for 21 in 24 balls.</p><small>2026-02-16 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651165-pakistan-working-with-european-partners-to-combat-illegal-immigration-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Austria vow to boost bilateral ties in diverse fields</strong></a><br><p>
