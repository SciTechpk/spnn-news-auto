“Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
Earlier, officials and sources said the talks stalled without any agreement. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told reporters, confirming that the third round of discussions — which had began on Thursday in the Turkish capital — had hit an impasse.
The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”
Asif elaborated that during the earlier rounds, the negotiators urged for another round. “Even after the talks in Istanbul failed, they committed that they would participate in the next round.”
“Our returning empty-handed reinforces a lack of faith in Afghanistan. The situation, God forbid if it flares up, if there are attacks on us from their soil, then we will respond depending on the gravity of the situation,” said the defence minister.
Asif clarified that the ceasefire stands for the time being, but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.
“If they have put forward any unacceptable demand, then it is a means of escape, since they knew they would be unsuccessful, they can turn around and say that Pakistan denied our demands,” added the minister.
He reiterated that Pakistan has one main demand: the cessation of attacks from Afghan soil.
Atmosphere described as ‘not positive’
Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lieutenant General Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials. The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate.
The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks.
The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism.
Reports from Istanbul suggested that the Pakistani delegation left for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day.
DG ISI and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process.
A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials stayed behind to work with the mediators.
For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”.
“The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified, and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism,” Andrabi said. “They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.”
Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islamabad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive,” suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications.
According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation.”
A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive.”
Information Minister Ata Tarar, who had declared a similar deadlock at the previous round before mediators salvaged a statement, said the “onus lies on Afghanistan to fulfill its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism — in which so far they have failed.”
“Pakistan shall continue to exercise all options necessary to safeguard the security of its people and its sovereignty,” Tarar said, echoing the Foreign Office spokesman’s earlier warning about Islamabad’s response in case of failure of the talks.
“All I can say is that, in any eventuality, we will protect the lives of our people and make sure that our civilians, our military forces, and our law enforcement agencies on the border are not killed by attacks emanating from Afghanistan,” Andrabi said.
Border clashes and talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday.
The talks began yesterday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire.
Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.</p><small>2025-11-08 05:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08093142373c66d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953877/pakistan-us-explore-ways-to-develop-economically-entrenched-strategic-partnership' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US explore ways to develop ‘economically entrenched strategic partnership’</strong></a><br><p>The United States and Pakistan early on Saturday reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties between the two countries, with Islamabad’s envoy describing it as an effort to build an “economically entrenched strategic partnership“.
The development came as S. Paul Kapur — who assumed charge as the US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs on October 22 — met Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh at the State Department for what was described as a cordial and forward-looking exchange.
Ambassador Sheikh said the two sides explored practical ways to translate recent high-level political resolve into concrete cooperation.
“We discussed the ways and means of translating the resolve — expressed at the leadership level — of developing Pakistan–US ties into an economically entrenched strategic partnership, through sustained engagement in multiple domains of mutual interest,” he said in a post on social media platform X.
 






Meanwhile, Kapur said it was a “pleasure” to meet the Pakistani envoy.
“We discussed ways to advance the US-Pakistan relationship and make our countries more prosperous and secure,” he said in a post on X.
 






Kapur’s meeting with Ambassador Sheikh comes as Washington and Islamabad recalibrate their relations under US President Donald Trump’s second administration.
After years of uneven engagement and recurring mistrust, both sides are now emphasising economic cooperation alongside traditional security ties.
In recent months, US officials have pointed to Pakistan’s potential role in regional stability and its capacity to contribute to economic and energy initiatives in South and Central Asia. The Trump administration has also encouraged American firms to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s infrastructure, minerals, and technology sectors.
 
 

For Islamabad, the new tone in Washington offers an opportunity to diversify its partnership with the US, while the Trump administration appears keen to reduce Pakistan’s overreliance on China. Officials in both capitals say they want to anchor the relationship in trade, investment, and long-term development — not merely in aid or counterterrorism cooperation.
Late last month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan, but added that the recent strengthening of ties between the two countries did not come at the expense of Washington’s relationship with New Delhi.
In September, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also met with Trump in the Oval Office, where they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was also present during the meeting.
Trump’s South Asia narrative
Trump has continued to highlight his role in what he calls the prevention of a nuclear war in South Asia following the brief but intense military conflict between India and Pakistan earlier this year in May.
During several public remarks, he has claimed that his administration’s swift diplomatic engagement “stopped a nuclear conflict” after the two neighbours exchanged air strikes, and that Pakistan “shot down eight Indian planes” during those clashes.
 
 

While New Delhi has not confirmed Trump’s account, his repeated references to that episode reflect Washington’s renewed interest in South Asian stability — and the value it assigns to maintaining direct communication with both capitals.
Despite the fresh tone, the relationship needs greater effort to sustain its current momentum. Washington continues to view Pakistan through a regional lens — balancing its strategic interests between India and China — while Islamabad seeks broader recognition of its economic and geopolitical relevance.
Analysts note that although the two countries are again speaking of a “strategic partnership“, much will depend on how the rhetoric translates into measurable progress. Both sides must still bridge differences over regional security, trade access, and Pakistan’s deepening engagement with China.
As one observer in Washington noted, “It’s an encouraging start — but what matters now is whether this goodwill can evolve into a sustained, structured partnership.”</p><small>2025-11-08 04:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/08074659829e6ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953781/ecc-clears-circular-debt-plan-paves-way-to-wind-up-power-holding-limited' target='_blank'><strong>ECC clears circular debt plan, paves way to wind up Power Holding Limited</strong></a><br><p>• Okays Rs960bn sovereign guarantee for Rs1.225tr loans from local banks
• Says remittance incentives to be phased out with caution
• Gas allocated to fertiliser sector; LNG cost adjustments cleared for tariffs
ISLAMABAD: The Econo­mic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Fri­day approved an inter-corporate circular debt settlement plan, including tariff rationalisation for all six operational nuclear power plants in line with other power producers, thus also paving the way to wind up Power Holding Ltd (PHL), a shell company created to park old circular debt.
The meeting of the ECC, pre­­sided over by Finance Mi­­nister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also approved about Rs660 billion in sovereign guarantees for Rs1.225 trillion in commercial loans from local banks for circular debt settlement and the diversion of gas for fertiliser plants.
 
 

As finalised by the military-led task force on power sector reforms in line with similar previous renegotiations with private and government-ow­ned power plants earlier this year, the ECC approved a sum­mary of the Power Divi­sion for “rationalisation of tariffs and payment adjustments for nuclear power plants (NPPs), government-owned power plants (GPPs), OGDCL and SNGPL”, a statement said.
The ECC approved the memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and authorised the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division “to execute negotiated settlement agreements based on these MoUs”.
The meeting also authorised the CPPA and the commission to amend the relevant power purchase agreements of four key nuclear power plants, including four at Chashma (C1 to C4) and two at Karachi (K2 and K3), having a total capacity of about 3,500 megawatts.
The federal government would take over some of their financial contractual obligations, for which the ECC also approved a set of facilitation measures. Based on this, the PAEC will file separate tariff petitions for these six plants, in line with the debt adjustments agreed in the negotiated settlement agreements.
In most cases, the government has guaranteed some foreign supplier credits, while in other cases, it has extended cash development loans and charged significantly higher interest rates than the original borrowing cost.
The meeting also authorised the CPPA to pay outstanding liabilities of GPPs from funds available under the circular debt financing facility, worth Rs1.225tr, recently contracted with local banks.
The ECC approved PHL loan repayment of Rs23.6bn and a waiver of Rs119.5bn on late-payment interest receivables from the LNG-based GPPs at Bhikki, Balloki and Haveli Bahadur Shah. It also approved payment of the rem­aining balance due to OGDCL via the two Uch power plants of over 1,000MW combined.
The ECC also approved policy guidelines to the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority un­­der Section 21 of the Ogra Ord­­inance, enabling the inc­or­­poration of Rs22bn appro­ved by the federal cabinet to include LNG cost of supply in the consumer tariff, subject to verification by auditors.
The Ministry of Finance said the decision would enh­ance financial sustainability, strea­mline payments, and redu­­ce overall costs in the power sector.
Circular debt financing
The ECC approved another summary of the Power Divi­sion for the issuance of a government guarantee amounting to Rs659.67bn for circular debt financing of Rs1.225tr. The guarantee is intended for the settlement of Power Holding Limited’s debt and overdue payments to independent power producers.
It authorised the Finance Division to issue a “letter of comfort”, a document that as­­su­­res one party to another ab­­out a potential or existing busi­­ness or financial obligation.
The Power Division was directed to report back to the ECC on the timeframe for PHL’s closure following the settlement of the debt issue.
The meeting also decided in principle to phase out incentive schemes for banks and exchange companies for channelling home remittances, su­­bject to an appropriate timi­ng, given the State Bank of Pakis­tan’s warning that imme­diate action would severely affect healthy inflows.
The ECC also approved a proposal from the Ministry of National Food Security and Re­­­search to reallocate funds within the division. The ap­­p­r­oval allows the transfer of res­ources from the Inter-Provi­n­c­i­­al Coordination Division thr­ou­­gh a technical supplementary grant to support ongoing agricultural research initiatives.
A summary from the Minis­try of Maritime Affairs on utilising Pakistan International Bulk Terminal at Port Qasim for handling and exporting copper-gold and other mineral commodities was deferred, with instructions to resubmit a clearer framework after stakeholder consultation.
The Ministry of Interior was granted Rs960 million to ensure timely disbursements to the transferred staff of the Pak Public Works Department for October 2025 to June 2026.
On a Petroleum Division proposal, the ECC approved allocation of about 220m cubic feet of gas from the Ghazij and Shawal fields, diversion from decommissioned/auctioned older plants, and pricing of Mari field gas to fertiliser units to ensure adequate, affordable fertiliser supplies on a structural basis.

A US official said the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force initiated the plot late last year and that it was disrupted this year.
“The plot was contained and does not pose a current threat,” the US official said.
 
 

The US official did not provide detailed evidence or say how the plot was contained. The Iranian mission to the United Nations declined to comment.
According to the US official, the alleged plot would have taken place after April 1 last year, when Israel attacked the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, killing several top officers of the Revolutionary Guards.
Israel carried out a much more extensive bombing campaign in Iran this year that killed more than 1,000 people. The United States joined by bombing key nuclear sites. Iran has been a critical supporter of Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since winning an election in 2007.

With the ruling PML-N attempting to build consensus around the proposed 27th amendment and opposition parties scrambling to present a united front, the next few days are expected to see a fresh round of wheeling and dealing over what fresh constitutional alterations will be approved.
It is telling that no draft of the proposed amendment has yet come to the fore, even though the prime minister himself is rallying allies for the vote. This, of course, is not unprecedented. It was much the same when the 26th Amendment was being prepared for the vote — few knew what was in the legislation, but the expectation, given the pressure, was that lawmakers would vote in favour of it, without any questions asked. How the amendment was passed is now part of the historical record. It remains to be seen if the 27th amendment will be made part of the Constitution in the same way.
 
 

It is unfortunate that this has become the new normal. The onerous conditions placed on parliament for the passage of a constitutional amendment were meant to ensure that the process would be treated with the seriousness and sobriety it deserves. The ‘two-thirds of the total vote’ requirement, for example, was put in place to ensure that the Constitution would not be trifled with, and that any changes to it could only be enacted through parliament when there was an overwhelming consensus.
A series of unfortunate decisions from the country’s top court over the past year have all but ensured that those checks and balances have been reduced to minor inconveniences, and that, too, which mostly exist on paper. And yet, there is such secrecy around the next set of major alterations to the law that the government will not even talk about them openly, let alone host a debate on their implications.
For now, any legislation to roll back the 18th Amendment has drawn a ‘no’, not only from opposition parties, but also from the PPP, whose votes are vital for any amendment to pass. One may, therefore, rest a little easier on this subject.
 
 

However, at stake is also the future of two other institutions, and it appears at the moment that while the government may concede on the rollback of the 18th Amendment, it could get its way on the other subjects. This ‘lesser of the two evils’ way of enacting legislation does not convince anyone.
It remains necessary for the acceptance and legitimacy of any amendment that it be debated openly and at length. Therefore, the incumbent regime should not set even a tentative date for voting on it till the public’s representatives make clear where they stand. Parliament must not be reduced to a rubber-stamp for the whims of the powerful.

The Punjab Assembly passed a unanimous resolution on Oct 28, with significant support from the PTI-aligned opposition, proposing that the national parliament amend and expand Article 140-A of the Constitution in order to strengthen the constitutional framework for local governments (LGs) in the country.
Although there had been more than one proposal to amend Article 140-A in the past, these came either from civil society, political parties or individual legislators. This is the first time that a provincial assembly made this demand, with its Speaker holding a press conference the next day to lend strong support to the idea of a constitutional amendment to end the near-dysfunctional state and, in some cases, the total absence of elected LGs for long periods of time.
A constitutional amendment bill drafted by the renowned constitutional lawyer Shahid Hamid, at the request of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development And Transparency, was introduced by PTI senator Dr Sania Nishtar in the Senate in July 2023 to strengthen LGs in the country. The bill proposed the expansion of Article 140-A to include such details as elections taking place 60 days prior to the expiry of the LG term and the Sixth Schedule listing 36 subjects to be delegated to the LGs. The bill is pending before the Senate.
The MQM-P also introduced a constitutional amendment bill in the National Assembly in October 2024 to expand Article 140-A. The bill proposed the devolution of 42 subjects to the LGs. It called for a minimum guaranteed percentage of provincial revenue to be allocated to LGs and possibly directly transferred from the federal divisible pool to them. This bill also proposed the holding of LG elections before the expiry of their term.

There is a growing realisation in Pakistan that Article 140-A needs to be expanded.

The demand for a constitutional amendment to strengthen LGs started gaining momentum after almost 70 years of neglect of the LG system — a demand that was reinforced after the passage of the 18th Amendment in 2010 when significant powers were devolved from the federation to the provinces, precisely demarcating the powers between the federation and the provinces.
 
 

But the devolution from the provinces to the LGs was mentioned only in general terms through the insertion of the brief new Article 140-A (of 41 words). The new article provided that “each province shall establish a local government system and devolve political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local governments”, but, unlike in the case of the provincial governments, it gave no specific framework of LGs, such as the minimum powers, financial resources, term and elections. All these details were left to the provinces to decide through the LG laws to be framed by the respective provincial assemblies and, in the case of Islamabad, the parliament.
Although 15 years have passed since the 18th Amendment, LGs in the country remain ineffective and powerless. Usually, ineffective LG laws are framed by the provinces and amended frequently — the Election Commission of Pakistan is unable to keep pace with the changes and thus unable to hold elections.
A case in point is the election for the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation where the last LG existed till 2021. Since then, whenever the ECP completed the demarcation of the LGs and announced the election schedule, the government amended the law changing the number of union councils, thus forcing the ECP to start the process of demarcation afresh. The ECP narrated its tragic tale of failures in a press release issued in May this year where it summed up how it had conducted delimitation of constituencies five times and the election schedule was issued thrice, only to be cancelled later because of last-minute changes in election laws.
There is an inherent conflict of interest between the provincial and local governments.
Provincial governments do not want to let go of their powers and financial resources which have significantly increased since the passage of the 18th Amendment and the seventh NFC award. Generally, about one-third of the annual development funds are supposed to be spent through the LGs. No provincial government is, however, willing to part with these funds. In the absence of effective elected LGs, members of the national and provincial assemblies exercise considerable influence on local development spending and, therefore, are not keen on empowering LGs.
 
 

Neighbouring India faced a similar situation in the initial 42 years after enacting its constitution in 1950. In 1992, the Indian parliament passed two constitutional amendments inserting two full-fledged parts running into approximately 20 pages in the constitution. The 73rd amendment dealt with the panchayats or rural tier of the LGs and the 74th amendment was about the municipalities.
The Statement of Objects and Reasons of these amendment acts reveal considerable similarities between present-day Pakistan and pre-1992 India. The statement says: “In many states local bodies have become weak and ineffective on account of a variety of reasons, including the failure to hold regular elections, prolonged supersessions and inadequate devolution of powers and functions. … Having regard to these inadequacies, it is considered necessary that provisions relating to urban local bodies are incorporated in the Constitution… .”
No wonder there is a strong and growing realisation in Pakistan too that Article 140-A needs to be expanded to outline details, making it impossible for provinces to deny the establishment of effective LGs.
One may make the case that the LGs are a provincial subject and, therefore, expanding Article 140-A may run counter to provincial autonomy. The reality is that no one is suggesting the removal of ‘local governments’ from the provincial legislative list but as the insertion of Article 140-A was not a violation of provincial autonomy in 2010, further expansion of this article providing a basic outline of LGs will not interfere with provincial rights either.

A total of 7,764 Afghan nationals were arrested and detained in the week ending Nov 1, a significant increase from the previous week, the report said.
Of those arrested between Oct 26 and Nov 1, Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders and undocumented Afghans accounted for 77pc, while Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders represented the remaining 23 pc, it added.
 
 

The report noted that 86pc of the arrests and detentions occurred in Balochistan. Across the country, the top three districts for arrests and detentions between Jan 1 and Nov 1, 2025, were Chagi, Attock and Quetta.

The rate of returns and deportations also rose sharply in the last week of October. According to the UN data, the number of returns increased by 101pc and deportations by 131pc compared to the week of Oct 19-25.
The figures climbed from 18,630 returns, including 3,341 deportations, in the previous week to 37,448 returns, including 7,733 deportations, in the week ending Nov 1.
“This notable increase is primarily attributed to the reopening of the Chaman border, with Torkham also reopening on Nov 1,” the report stated.
From Sept 15, 2023, to Nov 1, 2025, a cumulative total of 1,667,713 individuals have returned to Afghanistan.
For the returns from Oct 26 to Nov 1, the largest group was PoR holders at 47pc, followed by undocumented individuals at 44pc and ACC holders at 8pc. In contrast, deportees during the same period were overwhelmingly undocumented at 93pc.
The report found that fear of arrest was the primary reason for return among 93pc of undocumented individuals and ACC holders, and for 39pc of PoR holders, since April 1, 2023.
The recent activity follows several government directives issued this year impacting Afghan nationals.
In July, the government ordered the repatriation of PoR card holders following the expiration of their card validity on June 30, later
setting a Sept 1 deadline for them to leave Pakistan.

Its purpose was clear yet ambitious: to provide a multilateral forum where nations could collectively agree on measures to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations and prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.
The early years of the COP process reflected a sense of optimism. The Kyoto Protocol (1997) represented the first legally binding framework, committing industrialised countries to emission reductions. However, the absence of major emitters like the United States and the lack of commitments from developing countries weakened its implementation. The Copenhagen Summit (2009) exposed deep fractures between the developed and developing world over responsibility, finance, and fairness and marked a turning point in the politics of climate diplomacy.
This tension between collective ambition and national interest has defined every COP since. Des­pite a shared understanding that no single nat­ion can solve the climate crisis alone, each negotiation cycle has been mired in differing historical responsibilities, domestic economic priorities and conflicting definitions of ‘justice’ and ‘equity’.
At the heart of climate diplomacy lies a paradox that explains why a universally accepted agreement remains elusive in achieving its objective: the countries that are most responsible for climate change are not the ones most vulnerable to its effects. Industrialised nations built their wealth on fossil fuels, while developing countries like Pakistan now bear the brunt of resulting climate impacts of floods, droughts, glacial melt and food insecurity with limited capacity to adapt. Efforts to reach universal consensus are stymied by this historical imbalance. The North-South divide manifests in three recurring areas of contention:
Responsibility and burden-sharing: Developed countries resist strong language on liability and compensation, while developing countries dem­and recognition of loss and damage as a matter of climate justice.

The COP process has evolved or devolved into what many observers now describe as a ‘climate fair’.

Finance: Despite pledges, the promise on climate finance has not been fully delivered, and falls far short of need.
Ambition gap: Many countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions remain insufficient to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The gap between pledges and implementation continues to widen. While the COP remains a vital arena for dialogue, its consensus-based decision-making model often leads to lowest-common-denominator outcomes with statements of intent rather than binding commitments.
The Paris Agreement (2015), celebrated as a diplomatic triumph for crafting a flexible, bottom-up framework, marked a shift from imposed obligations to voluntary pledges. Yet, a decade later, the reality is sobering. Global emissions continue to rise, and current trajectories point towards warming of around 2.7°C by the end of the century. Climate disasters from catastrophic floods in Pakistan to record heatwaves across Europe and droughts in the Horn of Africa underline that adaptation is no longer a distant concern but an immediate survival challenge.
Meanwhile, the COP process itself has evolved or devolved into what many observers now describe as a ‘climate fair’. Conference halls are crowded not only with negotiators but also with corporations, NGOs and lobbyists, all vying for visibility. While this diversity of actors fosters innovation and awareness, it has also blurred the focus.
 
 

The spectacle often overshadows substance and announcements frequently outnumber actual deliverables. The risk is that COPs have become a performative rather than transformative stage for declarations, not decisions. Real progress increasingly occurs in smaller coalitions or outside the formal UNFCCC framework, through initiatives such as climate finance partnerships, regional adaptation programmes, and private sector decarbonisation alliances.
For Pakistan, it is time to reframe its approach from normative attendance to strategic influence using COP not just as a diplomatic event but a platform for survival advocacy. To make its participation strategic, Pakistan should consider the following approach:


Adopt a justice-centred narrative framing its stance around climate justice and resilience through equity. Its experience as a climate front-line state gives moral authority to demand parity between adaptation and mitigation in global finance and policy.


Lead on regional solidarity as part of the Third Pole region to champion a South-South cooperation framework focused on shared challenges, glacier melt, river basin management, and food and water security. Regional diplomacy around climate resilience could become a signature pillar of Pakistan’s foreign policy.


Champion the loss and damage agenda for capitalisation — simplified access, grant-based finance and inclusion of local communities in rebuilding and adaptation planning.


Invest in science, storytelling, and strategy: negotiations are driven by data and diplomacy. Pakistan should strengthen its climate data infrastructure, empower young negotiators and amplify its stories of resilience, turning lived experiences into global advocacy tools.


Forge strategic partnerships: beyond government-to-government engagement, Pakistan can build alliances with global think tanks, civil society, and climate innovators to position itself as a thought leader on adaptation finance and resilience-building.


 
 

The journey from Kyoto to Paris, and now tow­ards COP30, reveals both progress and paralysis in global climate diplomacy. While the world has learned to talk about climate change with unprecedented urgency, it has yet to act with equal conviction.
For Pakistan, participation in COP must transcend attendance. It should be about shaping narratives, mobilising alliances and asserting leadership among the Global South. By focusing its voice on justice, adaptation, and regional solidarity, Pakistan can not only safeguard its national interests but also contribute meaningfully to a fairer and more resilient global climate order.

• Azerbaijan will only send peacekeepers ‘if fighting stops’
WASHINGTON: President Don­ald Trump said on Thursday that he expects a US-coordinated International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to be on the ground in Gaza “very soon”.
The multinational force — likely to include troops from Mus­lim countries such as Egypt, Qat­ar, Turkiye, etc — is part of Trump’s post-war governance plan for Gaza.
The plan helped lead to a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on October 10, but the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has not abated.
 
 

“It’s going to be very soon. And Gaza is working out very well,” Trump said at a White House fun­ction with Central Asian leaders.
“You haven’t been hearing too much about problems, and I’ll tell you, we’ve had countries that have volunteered if there’s a problem with Hamas.”
The force is supposed to train and support vetted Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip, with backing from Egypt and Jordan.
It also will be tasked with sec­uring border areas and preventing weapons reaching Hamas.
On Wednesday, the United States circulated a draft UN Sec­urity Council resolution to partner nations aimed at shoring up Trump’s plan, including by greenlighting the international force.
Washington’s UN envoy Mike Waltz shared the draft with the 10 elected Security Council members — which includes Pakistan — and several regional partners, a spokesperson for the US mission said in a statement.
A vote has not yet been scheduled. According to diplomatic sources, several countries have indicated their willingness to participate in the force, but insist on a Security Council mandate before actually deploying troops into the Palestinian territory.
Meanwhile, senior Muslim diplomats said the issue is already sensitive, and strong pro-Palestinian sentiment in their countries makes it even more delicate.
They noted that support for the US draft resolution would depend on a clear UN mandate, a non-combat role, and coordination with Palestinian authorities.
“It is a draft that will be negotiated and evolve,” a senior diplomat from a Muslim bloc country told Dawn. “The draft was already circulated — is being considered and discussed by the Council members at this stage.”
Azeri troops
Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Azerbaijan does not plan to send peacekeepers to Gaza unless there is a complete halt to fighting there between Israel and Hamas.
“We do not want to put our troops in danger. This can only happen if military action is completely stopped,” the Azerbaijani foreign ministry source said.
The source noted that any such decision would have to be approved by parliament. The head of the parliamentary security committee told Reuters that it had not yet received any draft bill on the matter.

These observations and recommendations emerged during the closing plenary of the 28th Sustainable Development Conference held on Friday, where experts — including representatives from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) — underscored the need for immediate action.
World Bank Country Director Dr Bolormaa Amgabazar said that Pakistan faces alarmingly high vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters, compounded by escalating air and water pollution. At the same time, the country’s rapid population growth — among the highest globally — is placing immense strain on its already depleting natural resources, posing serious long-term risks to environmental and economic stability.
 
 

She said that the Climate and Country Development Report by the World Bank predicted a 20-30 per cent decline in GDP by 2050, amid business as usual and no action to address climate vulnerability.

“Pre-arranged and predictable multi-year financing is the key for Pakistan in terms of emergency that should be multi-sectoral financing basically for development,” she added.
Dr Bolormaa mentioned the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework, which is a $20 billion financing for the next 20 years to be available for Pakistan, and the government can decide its future interventions and projects around it.
 






IMF Country Representative Mahir Binici, on the occasion, said that Pakistan’s newly approved $1.4 billion arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) will play a vital role in strengthening the country’s economic resilience and capacity to withstand environmental shocks.
“The initiative is aimed at integrating climate considerations into Pakistan’s public financial management and fostering long-term sustainable growth,” he said, adding that the RSF is operating in parallel with Pakistan’s ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF), a three-year structural reform programme running until 2027.
“Both programmes are Pakistan’s own reform efforts, supported by the Fund,” Binici said, emphasising that the synergy between the two frameworks is “instrumental in placing Pakistan on a path toward stronger, more inclusive and climate-resilient growth.”
Mr Binici said Pakistan is taking concrete steps to embed climate priorities into its budgetary process, starting from the next fiscal year. “Project selection under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) will undergo climate screening, especially for major infrastructure investments,” he added, stressing that such transparency would enhance accountability and resource efficiency.
UNDP Resident Representative Samuel Rizk said the world is witnessing a transformative phase where financing has become more appropriate and critical for ensuring sustainable development.
He noted that the government is the biggest source of financing for sustainable development, chipped in by multilateral development entities and the private sector together.

According to the Ministry of Finance’s fiscal operations report for July-September 2025, the overall budget balance showed a surplus of Rs2.12 trillion in absolute terms, up 10pc from Rs1.896tr in the same period last year. As a share of GDP, the surplus slipped marginally from 1.7pc to 1.6pc.
Last year eventually closed with a 5.4pc deficit, as rising expenditures gradually offset the one-time impact of SBP profits.
 
 

The primary balance — the difference between total revenue and expenditure, excluding interest payments — stood at 2.7pc of GDP this year, slightly lower than last year’s 2.8pc. In absolute terms, however, the primary surplus grew 8.4pc to Rs3.497tr, compared to Rs3.2tr a year earlier.
Behind these headline numbers, the report indicated weak revenue performance and limited expenditure control. Total revenues rose only 6pc to Rs6.2tr from Rs5.83tr, equivalent to 4.8pc of GDP, compared to 5.1pc a year earlier.

Record SBP profits, 30pc jump in petroleum levy, strong provincial balances key contributors

Tax revenues stayed flat at 2.4pc of GDP, while non-tax revenues fell to 2.4pc from 2.7pc last year. Despite this, total tax receipts grew 12pc to Rs3.15tr, compared to Rs2.77tr a year earlier.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs2.884tr, up 11pc from Rs2.563tr last year, but its share of GDP remained steady at 2.2pc.
The four provinces together mobilised Rs270bn in tax revenues, up 21pc from Rs213bn last year. They also more than doubled their combined cash surplus to Rs781bn, compared to Rs360bn a year ago — a 54pc increase.
 
 

Total expenditure in the first quarter rose 3.6pc to Rs4.08tr, from Rs3.93tr last year. As a percentage of GDP, spending edged down to 3.1pc from 3.4pc. The statistical discrepancy widened to Rs262bn from Rs117bn, apparently due to slower or delayed federal transfers to the provinces.
Current expenditure climbed 12.6pc to Rs4.07tr from Rs3.54tr but remained unchanged at 3.1pc of GDP. Within this, markup payments increased 5pc to Rs1.378tr from Rs1.31tr, holding steady at 1.1pc of GDP.
Defence spending rose 8.4pc to Rs447.5bn, up from Rs410bn last year, but declined slightly as a share of GDP — to 0.3pc from 0.4pc.
Of the total federal non-tax revenue of Rs2.984tr, down slightly from Rs2.997tr last year, the bulk — Rs2.43tr — came from SBP profits, compared to Rs2.5tr last year. These were driven by the lagged impact of the record-high 22pc policy rate. Markup and dividend income from state-owned enterprises fell 35pc to about Rs40bn from Rs62bn a year earlier.
The report attributed the 54pc rise in provincial surpluses largely to slower or last-minute fund releases from the centre. Punjab led the way, posting a record Rs442bn surplus in the first quarter — a tenfold increase from Rs40bn last year.
Sindh followed with a surplus of Rs209bn, up 37pc from Rs131bn a year earlier. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s surplus, however, dropped 35pc to Rs77bn from Rs104bn, while Balochistan’s contribution fell over 57pc to Rs54bn, compared to Rs85bn last year.

• Change of building won’t affect court’s powers, observes CB judge
• Lawyer challenges proposed amendment
ISLAMABAD: Though no draft of the 27th Amen­dment has been made public yet, its impact can alre­ady be seen in the judicial corridors of the capital.
On Friday, the proposed amendment was assailed before the Supreme Court, while a flurry of ‘administrative activity’ suggested that groundwork was alre­a­dy being laid for the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) — one of the proposals said to be part of the latest legislative package.
It was these moves that ostensibly prompted a Supreme Court judge to remark that a “change of building” would not reduce their authority.
Administrative activities observed at the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) hinted that the proposed FCC may be housed at the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) premises, with ongoing discussions suggested that the latter could be moved to the third floor of the IHC building.
 
 

At present, the FSC is fun­ctioning with only three judges, including the chief justice, against a sanctioned strength of eight.
Sources said all the judges of the FSC could be accommodated on one floor of the IHC.
They confirmed that the process of vacating the third floor of the IHC building is currently underway, with equipment and office materials being shifted to alternate locations.
The move has been described by officials as part of broader administrative realignments currently in progress.
An office order issued by the judicial department of the IHC on Nov 7 reflects the ongoing internal re-organisation related to record management.
‘Change of building’
These and related developments reverberated in the Supreme Court too, where during a hearing related to Civil Service Rules, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Constitutional Bench observed that “a change of building” will not reduce their authority.
The observation came after Justice Aminuddin Khan, who was heading the bench, asked senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui how much time he would take to conclude his arguments.
The counsel replied it might take some time, though he wished “the case should end today, since I have no intention of advancing arguments while standing inside the Shariat Court building”.
 
 

“If the possession of the building has to be taken, then why the FSC only,” the counsel continued, “Why the adjacent building (a reference to PM Secretariat) is not an option if at all a building is to be taken over?”
A smiling Justice Mandokhail remarked that there had been some progress in the counsel’s favour the previous night.
Mr Siddiqui then remarked he had a strong conviction that nothing adverse would come to harm the SC. “If this is the spirit, then why worry?” Justice Mandokhail quipped.
“We are bound to follow whatever Constitution dictates,” Justice Aminuddin Khan added.
The counsel further said, “How grand the judges look while sitting in the Supreme Court’s courtroom.” He remarked that everybody knows why the FSC was created.
At this point, Justice Mandokhail asserted that a change of building would not reduce any of the court’s powers.
Restraining order sought
Meanwhile, Barrister Ali Tahir through a separate petition urged the SC to declare unconstitutional any proposal, bill or discussion that curtails, transfers, suspends, or abolishes the constitutional jurisdiction of the SC under Article 184(3) or the high courts under Article 199.
The petition also sought a restraining order against the federal government, cabinet, parliament, and all other organs or functionaries of the state, pending a final decision.
The federal government, it pleaded, should be asked to refrain from taking any step, legislative, executive, or administrative, aimed at introducing, debating, processing, or passing any bill or proposal, including the proposed 27th Amendment bill.
It stated that the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) constitutes an essential, inviolable, and non-amenable feature of the Constitution, forming part of its basic structure and fundamental framework. Therefore, no constitutional amendment, legislation, or executive action can lawfully diminish or extinguish this jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court, the petition argued.
It sought a declaration that any attempt to establish a parallel or superior forum styled as a constitutional court, distinct from or in substitution of the SC or the high courts, would be repugnant to Articles 175 to 191 of the Constitution.

Addressing the media following the conclusion of the Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting, Bilawal said the moot debated the matter of constitutional courts for two days and the party “agrees in principle with the idea that constitutional courts should be formed”.
“In the 27th Amendment, the amendment to (article) 243 must be accepted.”
The party chairperson added that “unfinished agenda items” from the Charter of Democracy were also discussed.

“We will engage with the government and see which other points we can reach a consensus on,” said Bilawal. He added that if a consensus can be reached with the incumbent government on agenda items not fulfilled under the Charter of Democracy, “it would be a welcome step”.
Bilawal further said that they are giving their suggestions to the government on the matter of the transfer of judges as proposed under the 27th Amendment.
“The government’s suggestion is to do away with the consultation (with the president) and leave the decision (transferring judges) with the parliamentary committee.”
He stated that the PPP feels that the better approach would be that the “president initiates the transfer” and if we “want to give the judicial commission the role, then fair enough”. “It is a forum where serious debate can take place and the chief justices and senior judiciary are present.”
Addressing the issue of dual nationality, the PPP chairman said he was “not in a position to vote on this right now”, hinting that the party is divided on the issue.
“In conclusion, there are mainly three points in the constitutional amendment that the PPP is considering supporting, the amendment to (article) 243, constitutional courts in the context of the government having conversations with us about what other aspects of the Charter of Democracy they are willing to implement at this time and the transfer of judges as long as the incoming and outgoing chief justices are members of the commission.”
Fielding questions from reporters, the PPP chairman said that amendments to Article 243 must be accepted.
“The question of forming constitutional courts, along with the other provisions of the Charter of Democracy, will be accepted,” Bilawal said. “With the votes of the incoming and outgoing CJ, along with the judicial commission, if the PML-N agrees with it, then we will accept this, and the PPP will vote on it.”
He also reiterated the PPP’s position on the NFC award, stating that they will oppose any attempt to reduce the shares given to provinces.
“What has come under discussion is the PML-N’s proposal to remove the protection of provincial governments from the NFC. This protects all provinces and the PPP gave its response to it yesterday,” Bilawal stated.
“The Constitution says that the NFC share can only grow, not reduce,” he explained. “The PPP will defend this. Until we are in this parliament, we are not ready to accept that. We are ready to accept other amendments.”
Speaking about local bodies, Bilawal said that the PPP is “paying attention” and noted that the party brought about the protections granted to them by the Constitution.
“If you perform an impartial analysis of the local body legislation in the four provinces … most political, administrative and financial autonomy is in Sindh,” he said. “When the PML-N approached us about the 27th Amendment, they did not discuss local bodies with us, but we want to see local bodies that are strong.”
The party chairman also highlighted legislation passed by the Punjab Assembly that abolished the office of mayor.
“If we did that, what would your reaction be?” he asked reporters.
“Every province has its own context, but the strongest local body system is in Sindh,” he reiterated. “It is always working to do better and we are happy to talk to anyone who sees improvement in our local bodies.”
Earlier today, the PPP appeared divided over the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment but signalled support for changes to Article 243.
Last night, the party indicated conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.
Announcing decisions of the party’s CEC at Bilawal House late on Thursday night, PPP Chairman Bil­awal Bhutto-Zardari said discussions on the government’s proposed constitutional changes would continue on Friday but stressed the PPP “can never compromise on the financial rights of the provinces”.
PPP insiders told Dawn that today’s meeting began after Friday prayers and is ongoing. They said that, except for the proposed amendments to Article 243, none of the other proposals have been agreed upon.
They added that the party will support the proposed amendment to the constitutional courts if provinces receive equal representation. Proposals related to the provincial share of the National Finance Commission (NFC) award and federalising education — which was devolved to provinces — were rejected.</p><small>2025-11-08 02:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/072249564b69fdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953725/fo-rejects-baseless-malicious-indian-allegations-of-pakistan-conducting-nuclear-tests' target='_blank'><strong>FO rejects ‘baseless, malicious’ Indian allegations of Pakistan conducting nuclear tests</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Friday said it had not conducted any nuclear tests after May 1998, rejecting Indian allegations of clandestine nuclear activities as “baseless and malicious”.
Foreign Office (FO) Spokesman Tahir Andrabi, responding to a question from Dawn, said, “For the record, Pakistan’s last nuclear tests were conducted in May 1998. Our position on nuclear testing is well established and consistent.”
Pakistan has maintained a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing since its last series of tests conducted in response to India’s nuclear tests.
However, Pakistan has not signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, retaining the flexibility to resume testing if its security environment, particularly vis-à-vis India, deteriorates.
“Pakistan has been supporting United Nations General Assembly resolutions calling for a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing. In contrast, India’s abstentions on these resolutions reflect its ambiguous and questionable intentions on future nuclear testing,” Andrabi said.
The statement came after India cited an earlier remark by former US President Donald Trump, who in a recent interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, had claimed that “Pakistan’s been testing” nuclear weapons, a statement Islamabad had earlier chosen not to respond to to avoid offending Washington.
However, the FO broke its silence after India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) referenced Trump’s comment at a media briefing on Friday.
India’s MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan’s history, that is centered around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation. India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan’s record. In this backdrop, we have taken note of President Trump’s comment about Pakistan’s nuclear testing.”
Andrabi dismissed the Indian statement, saying, “India is clearly distorting facts and misrepresenting the remarks of US President Donald Trump. The US side has already clarified its position to the media regarding the statements by the president.”
He emphasised that “Pakistan’s nuclear program operates under a robust command and control structure, comprehensive export controls, and an impeccable record of compliance with the global non-proliferation regime.”
“Allegations of ‘clandestine or illegal nuclear activities’ are baseless, malicious, and part of India’s disinformation campaign aimed at diverting attention from its own irresponsible conduct,” Andrabi said.
The spokesman said India’s record on nuclear safety and security remained “deeply concerning”.
“Over the past several decades, numerous incidents involving the theft and illicit trafficking of sensitive nuclear material and other radioactive substances have exposed serious deficiencies in India’s ability to safeguard its facilities,” the spokesperson added.
“As recently as last year, radioactive equipment from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, along with the highly radioactive substance Californium (valued at over $100 million) was found on sale in India.”
He said such recurring incidents “point to the existence of a thriving nuclear black market for sensitive and dual-use materials in India”.
“The international community must take serious note of these alarming gaps, which pose a grave threat to both regional and global security,” Andrabi added.</p><small>2025-11-08 02:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632617-pakistan-pushes-for-economic-anchor-in-ties-during-meeting-with-top-us-official' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with top US official, Pakistan's envoy pushes for 'economic anchor' in ties</strong></a><br><p>

The offending remarks came during CM Afridi’s interaction with the media outside Adiala jail a day earlier, after he was once again denied an audience with PTI founder Imran Khan. 
During his media talk, he alleged that the sanctity of worship places was violated when sniffer dogs were brought there, while also making disparaging remarks about security personnel.
However, he claimed  that despite everything, they still supported the security forces. 
Reacting to the statement, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned Mr Afridi’s words, while Awami National Party (ANP) chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan  termed it an “attempt to incite religious sentiments”. 
“I condemn any rhetoric that seeks to undermine the honour and sacrifice of our armed forces,” the governor wrote on X. He said the brave sons of soil lay down their lives to protect our province and questioning their intent in sensational terms only damaged morale and public safety.
“The intelligence-based operations have been and will remain necessary to protect our people; these are conducted with the sole aim of safeguarding civilians and restoring peace. Political debate must not cross into actions or words that weaken our security institutions,” he said.
Mr Afridi should exercise restraint and place the safety and unity of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa above partisan posturing, he continued. “The security situation of our province demands that all political forces stand with our armed forces in pursuit of lasting peace and stability for our people. Ultimately, it is the people who will deliver accountability in the coming elections.” 
Need for maturity
ANP President Aimal Wali Khan also cautioned Mr Afridi on Friday, reminding him that the position of chief minister required maturity. Mr Khan said taking a collision course by the CM of a province was absolutely not in the interest of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
He said that the chief minister’s statement was aimed at inciting religious sentiments and a sane person would not even imagine doing so. His remarks were disrespectful of mosques and would cause further frictions with the state institutions, he noted.
The ANP president said it was CM’s responsibility to reduce differences and misunderstandings instead of increasing them further. He questioned what would be the fate of the province in such a situation. 
He said that Mr Afridi should fight a constitutional battle for his leadership through courts instead of confrontation and pay attention to the affairs of the province.
He said that the establishment should also respect mandate and the CM must get his protocol. However, he added, Mr Afridi, too, should better realise the importance of his position.
‘CM must tender apology’
Meanwhile, Baloch­istan CM Sarfaraz Bugti strongly reacted to the “irresponsible” statement of the KP CM, describing it as “an attempt to strengthen the enemy’s narrative”.
He also reminded his KP counterpart that the security forces restored peace from Balochistan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by sacrificing thousands of lives. He said Mr Afridi should apologise to the nation and the families of the martyrs for his irresponsible statement, as the mockery of security institutions could not be tolerated. 
The chairman of the Pakistan Ulema Council also condemned CM Afridi’s remarks, calling them “misleading”.
“The speech made by KP CM regarding mosques is regrettable,” Maulana Tahir Ashrafi was quoted as saying. “The statement made by the KP CM is also an attempt to tarnish the image of Pakistan,” Maulana Ashrafi said.

The previously unreported intelligence, described by the former officials as among the most startling shared with top US policymakers during the war, pointed to doubts within the Israeli military about the legality of its tactics that contrasted sharply with Israel’s public stance defending its actions.
Two of the former US officials said the material was not broadly circulated within the government until late in the Biden administration, when it was disseminated more widely ahead of a congressional briefing in December 2024.
The intelligence deepened concerns in Washington over Israel’s conduct in a war it said was necessary to eliminate Hamas fighters embedded in civilian infrastructure. There were concerns Israel was intentionally targeting civilians and humanitarian workers, a potential war crime which Israel has strongly denied.
US officials expressed alarm at the findings, particularly as the mounting civilian death toll in Gaza raised concerns that Israel’s operations might breach international legal standards on acceptable collateral damage.
The former US officials Reuters spoke to did not provide details on what evidence, such as specific wartime incidents, had caused concerns among Israel’s military lawyers.
Israel has killed more than 68,000 Palestinians during a two-year military campaign, say Gaza health officials. Israel’s military has said at least 20,000 of the fatalities were combatants.

Reuters spoke to nine former US officials in then-president Joe Biden’s administration, including six who had direct knowledge of the intelligence and the subsequent debate within the US government. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Reports of internal US government dissent over Israel’s Gaza campaign emerged during Biden’s presidency. This account, based on detailed recollections from those involved, offers a fuller picture of the debate’s intensity in the administration’s final weeks, which ended with President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.
Israeli Ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, declined to comment when asked for a response about the US intelligence and the internal Biden administration debate about it.
Neither the Israeli prime minister’s office nor the Israeli military spokesperson immediately responded to requests for comment.
Debate intensified in final days of Biden term
The intelligence prompted an interagency meeting at the National Security Council (NSC), where officials and lawyers debated how and whether to respond to the new findings.
A US finding that Israel was committing war crimes would have required, under US law, blocking future arms shipments and ending intelligence sharing with Israel.
Israel’s intelligence services have worked closely with the US for decades and provide critical information, in particular, about events occurring in the Middle East.
Biden administration conversations in December included officials from across the government, including the State Department, the Pentagon, the intelligence community and the White House. Biden was also briefed on the matter by his national security advisers.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“We do not comment on intelligence matters,” a State Department spokesperson said in response to emailed questions about Reuters reporting.
The American debate about whether the Israelis had committed war crimes in Gaza ended when lawyers from across the US government determined that it was still legal for the US to continue supporting Israel with weapons and intelligence because the US had not gathered its own evidence that Israel was violating the law of armed conflict, according to three former US officials.
 
 

They reasoned that the intelligence and evidence gathered by the US itself did not prove the Israelis had intentionally killed civilians and humanitarians or blocked aid, a key factor in legal liability.
Some senior Biden administration officials feared that a formal US finding of Israeli war crimes would force Washington to cut off arms and intelligence support — a move they worried could embolden Hamas, delay ceasefire negotiations, and shift the political narrative in favour of the group.
Hamas killed 1,200 people and abducted 251 in its October 7, 2023 attack, with Israel launching its campaign in retaliation.
The decision to stay the course exasperated some of those involved who believed that the Biden administration should have been more forceful in calling out Israel’s alleged abuses and the US role in enabling them, said former US officials.
President Trump and his officials were briefed by Biden’s team on the intelligence but showed little interest in the subject after they took over in January and began siding more powerfully with the Israelis, said the officials.
State Department lawyers repeatedly raised concerns
Even before the US gathered war crimes intelligence from within the Israeli military, some lawyers at the State Department, which oversees legal assessments of foreign military conduct, repeatedly raised concerns with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that Israel might be committing war crimes, according to five former US officials.
As early as December 2023, lawyers from the State Department’s legal bureau told Blinken in meetings that they believed Israel’s military conduct in Gaza likely amounted to violations of international humanitarian law and potentially war crimes, two of the US officials said.
But they never made a conclusive assessment that Israel was violating international humanitarian law, a move that other US officials at the State Department saw as the legal bureau pulling its punches.
“They saw their job as being justifying a political decision,” one of the former US officials said. “Even when the evidence clearly pointed to war crimes, the Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card was proving intent,” one of the officials said.

The lack of a definitive conclusion by the State Department’s lawyers was largely reflected in a US government report produced during the Biden administration in May 2024, when Washington said Tel Aviv might have violated international humanitarian law using US-supplied weapons during its military operation in Gaza.
The report, which was prepared by the State Department, stopped short of a definitive assessment, citing the fog of war.
“What I can say is that the Biden administration constantly reviewed Israel’s adherence to the laws of armed conflict, as well as the requirements of our own laws,” Blinken said through a spokesperson for this story. Blinken declined to comment on the intelligence matters.
International concerns about possible war crimes
Last November, the International Criminal Court in The Hague issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief, as well as Hamas leader Mohammed Deif, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.
Hamas has since confirmed Israel killed Deif.
Israel has rejected the jurisdiction of the Hague-based court and denies war crimes in Gaza. Hamas leaders have dismissed allegations that they committed war crimes.
Among the issues debated by US officials in the final weeks of the Biden administration was whether the government would be complicit if Israeli officials were to face charges in an international tribunal, said people familiar with this debate.
US officials publicly defended Israel but also privately debated the issue in light of
intelligence reports, and they became a point of political vulnerability for Democrats. Biden and later Vice President Kamala Harris waged ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaigns.
Biden did not respond to a request for comment.
Israel, which is fighting a genocide case at the International Court of Justice, rejects genocide allegations as politically motivated and says that its military campaign targets Hamas, not Gaza’s civilian population.
The Israeli military says it seeks to minimise civilian harm while targeting militants embedded in hospitals, schools and shelters, using warnings and appropriate munitions.
An Israeli military official told Reuters in September that the military was investigating about 2,000 incidents of possible misconduct, including civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure.
Some cases came to light through the genocide case filed at the International Court of Justice, the official said.</p><small>2025-11-07 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/07225825d0d0056.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953726/12-suspected-dacoits-killed-during-police-search-operation-in-sindhs-ghotki' target='_blank'><strong>12 suspected dacoits killed during police search operation in Sindh’s Ghotki</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Police on Friday eliminated 12 “wanted criminals” during an ongoing search operation against dacoits in Ghotki, including those who had bounties placed on them by the Sindh government, according to a statement.
For decades, dozens of dacoit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets that cripple local businesses, brutal killings and robbing people on highways have become a daily reality.
The Sindh Home Department’s statement said that the operation was carried out under the supervision of Sukkur Deputy Inspector General Faisal Abdullah Chachar, with Ghotki Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran, Sukkur SSP Azhar Mughal, Obaro Deputy Superintendent of Police Abdul Qadir Soomro, and their teams actively participating.
“Twelve extremely dangerous criminals were killed, some of whom had bounties placed on them by the Sindh government,” the Sukkur DIG said. “A reward of Rs5 million was placed on the dacoit Shah Nawaz alias Shahu.”
The DIG added that police took custody of the bodies of seven dacoits, while five bodies were taken by their accomplices under the cover of darkness.
“The slain criminals were members of the Shar gang,” he said. “Around ten armed dacoits were also seriously injured during the encounter, and their accomplices managed to flee with them.”
DIG Chachar added that the dacoits were forced to retreat due to the strong and effective response by the police, and the search operation is still ongoing in the area.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar reaffirmed the government’s resolve that the Sindh Police will not rest until all criminal elements are completely eliminated, the statement added.
“Lanjar lauded the outstanding performance of Sukkur DIG, Ghotki SSP, Sukkur SSP, and their teams for conducting a successful operation against dacoits in Ghotki.”
“Your courageous actions and the operation have brought the police a truly successful outcome,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. “The elimination of dacoits, who were considered symbols of danger and fear among the public, has boosted the police morale.”
He further said that the Ghotki Police deserve appreciation for their effective control over law and order and commendable performance against crime, according to the statement.
Last month, at least 72 riverine dacoits surrendered to the authorities as part of the provincial government’s ‘Sindh Surrender Policy’, a press release issued by the Sindh Home Ministry said.
“Around 72 dacoits surrendered under the Sindh Surrender Policy, and laid down more than 200 small-scale and heavy ammunition,” the press release read.
The weapons included 62 G3 rifles, 97 submachine guns, 48 double-barreled guns, two RPG-7s, an anti-tank recoilless rifle and a 12.7mm anti-aircraft gun.</p><small>2025-11-07 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/072211531d1c1eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953724/govt-will-proceed-with-parts-of-27th-amendment-that-have-consensus-says-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Govt will proceed with parts of 27th Amendment that have consensus, says Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Friday that the government will proceed only with those parts of the 27th Constitutional Amendment agreed upon by coalition partners, while disputed matters, including changes to the 18th Amendment and the NFC Award, will remain under discussion.
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, Sanaullah said the amendment’s draft was expected to be presented before the cabinet today, but was delayed as the PPP’s Central Executive Committee (CEC) had not yet finalised its position.
“We thought it better to wait for their opinion before moving forward. Once their input comes, we’ll finalise the draft and take it to the cabinet for approval before presenting it in the Senate,” he said.
Responding to a question about PML-N’s agreement with PPP on the formation of a constitutional court, Sanaullah highlighted that the PPP has been committed to the idea since 2005, and both parties are signatories to the Charter of Democracy.
“Their only demand was equal provincial representation,” the PM’s aide said, adding that PML-N agreed with that.
When asked about PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s concerns regarding proposed amendments to the subjects of education and population under the 18th Amendment, as well as the government’s stance on revising the NFC formula, Sanaullah said the imbalance between federal and provincial resources was a “reality that must be addressed through mutual understanding”.
He added there were different points of view on other aspects of the proposed 27th Amendment, including matters related to local governments, overseas Pakistanis’ voting rights, the Election Commission, and the issue of transfer of judges, which will be decided upon based on consensus.
“If there is no consensus, discussions will continue in the future,” Sanaullah said.
‘No roadblocks to amendment’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said there are no major roadblocks and impediments with respect to the 27th Amendment, according to a Dawn.com report.
Speaking to Geo News, the minister said consultations among political parties on the proposed amendment were taking place in a “positive environment” and that a broad consensus appeared to be emerging.
“The feeling I got during today’s (Thursday’s) meetings, in which different political parties were present … I got the feeling that there is no major roadblock or impediment,” he said.
“There was no need for any further discussions or debate. Ideas were shared in a positive environment, some of which were agreed upon.”
‘Govt lacks mandate’
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the current parliament lacks the mandate and moral authority to amend the Constitution, arguing that such changes require a “genuine two-thirds majority”.
Speaking to the media at the Lahore High Court, he warned the proposed 27th Amendment would harm both the federation and the provinces, noting that the 18th Amendment had faced no provincial objections. He also pointed out that the fate of the 26th Amendment remains pending before the Supreme Court.
Mr Khan said an independent judiciary is essential to democracy and parliamentary sanctity and made clear the PTI would not support the government on the latest amendment.
Referring to the process adopted for the 26th Amendment, he said a committee had been formed, but “no draft ever surfaced”, adding that the PTI has resigned from that body.
He said the release of the party’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan would come “under the law, not through any deal”, and that no protest call had been given for November.
“We are working within the law for his release, and he is satisfied with the ongoing efforts,” Barrister Gohar said, dismissing rumours of foreign involvement.</p><small>2025-11-07 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632568-last-nuclear-tests-conducted-over-27-years-ago-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Last nuclear tests conducted over 27 years ago: FO</strong></a><br><p>

The statement added that Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir was also present in the meeting.
The prime minister arrived in Baku earlier today for a two-day official visit to Azerbaijan at Aliyev’s invitation, where he will attend the country’s Victory Day ceremony.
Victory Day is observed to “commemorate the historic victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia”, according to the PM’s Office.
PM Shehbaz, accompanied by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, was received at Heydar Aliyev International Airport by First Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Yagub Eyyubov, First Deputy Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Fariz Razayev, Pakistani Ambassador to Azerbaijan Qasim Mohiuddin and diplomatic staff.
 






The statement read: “The prime minister thanked the President of Azerbaijan for extending [an] invitation to attend the celebration of the victory day of Azerbaijan.”
It added that PM Shehbaz congratulated the Azerbaijani government and people on the occasion and stated that the victory “served as a beacon a hope for oppressed people striving for self-determination, including the people of Indian Illegally Occupied in Jammu and Kashmir [sic] and Palestine”.
“The two leaders reviewed the whole range of bilateral relationships and agreed to further strengthen their multi-layered cooperation in the fields of political, trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence,” the statement read.
PM Shehbaz extended an invitation to Aliyev to visit Pakistan, which the PM’s office says he “graciously accepted”.
“The prime minister appreciated President Aliyev for signing the historic peace agreement with Armenia earlier this year,” the statement added.
“President Ilham Aliyev thanked Pakistan for its consistent support to Azerbaijan in its just struggle against [the] illegal occupation of the Karabagh region. He also appreciated Pakistan’s role in promoting regional stability in South Asia.”
 






Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said PM Shehbaz would undertake the visit to participate in events being held in connection with the fifth anniversary of Victory Day, which commemorates Azerbaijan’s triumph in liberating its territories from Armenian occupation.
The statement said that the premier was undertaking the visit at the invitation of Azerbaijan President Aliyev. “During the visit, the prime minister will attend the official Victory Day celebrations and hold a meeting with President Aliyev,” the FO said.
“Discussions will focus on reviewing the entire gamut of bilateral relations and identifying new avenues to further deepen cooperation in diverse sectors, including trade and investment, energy, defence, education, and regional connectivity,” it added.
 






The FO said that Pakistan and Azerbaijan enjoy “long-standing fraternal relations, rooted in shared faith, history, culture, and mutual trust”.
“The visit by the prime minister will reaffirm Pakistan’s steadfast support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and to further advance the strategic partnership between the two brotherly nations,” the FO concluded.
The premier had visited Azerbaijan earlier this year in May as well while on a four-nation tour. He had met the Azerbaijan president, and the two had renewed their pledge to diversify the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues.
President Aliyev had also called PM Shehbaz in August and expressed his appreciation for Pakistan’s consistent support on the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.</p><small>2025-11-07 16:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/072018183994a04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953715/pakistan-iran-vow-to-boost-counter-terrorism-cooperation-pursue-diplomacy-for-global-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran vow to boost counter-terrorism cooperation, pursue diplomacy for global peace</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Iran on Friday vowed to enhance cooperation to eradicate terrorism from the two states and reiterated their commitment to peaceful means of dialogue and diplomacy for the resolution of all outstanding disputes around the world.
Pakistan and Iran share close ties and have signed multiple agreements across sectors such as energy and trade. The two sides also expressed eagerness to further foster cooperation with each other in the fields of mutual interest.
The commitments were made when Speaker of Iranian Parliament Dr Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, a statement from the PM’s Office said.
“Both countries condemn state-sponsored terrorism and have always supported each other in the wake of unilateral aggression against their sovereign states”, the statement quoted the PM as saying.
The prime minister said Pakistan and Iran had unfortunately been victims of terrorism; thus, they firmly shared the resolve of global peace, prosperity and positive cooperation in the region.
“Pakistan and Iran are determined to work in cohesion and cooperation for the unity of the Muslim Ummah,” he added.
He warmly welcomed the delegation and recalled the cordial bilateral ties with the brotherly Muslim country of Iran.
The PM also extended utmost reverence to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pazeshkian.
Dr Ghalibaf expressed his gratitude to the prime minister, the government and people of Pakistan for their valued and well-placed support in the recent Iran-Israel conflict, the statement added.
He said the support shown by Pakistan to Iran in the 12-day war against Israel was deeply appreciated and cherished by the people of Iran. “Iran and Pakistan firmly believe in the unity of the Muslim Ummah and in the message of global peace,” he was quoted as saying.
While expressing special gratitude to the Speaker National Assembly, Ayaz Sadiq, the Iranian speaker cherished the positive and robust cooperation between the parliaments of both countries.
He also expressed Iran’s commitment to further enhance bilateral cooperation with Pakistan in the fields of economic development and trade.
The Iranian speaker conveyed a message of warmth and reverence from Iranian President Masoud Pazeshkian for the PM and people of Pakistan. He also expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him during his visit to Pakistan.
In August, President Pezeshkian visited Pakistan. During his visit, Islamabad and Tehran signed 12 agreements and memoranda of understanding (MoUs).</p><small>2025-11-07 16:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632549-ppp-backs-amending-article-243-constitutional-court-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>27th Amendment: PPP 'backs' tweaking Article 243, constitutional court</strong></a><br><p>

The operation was conducted on Wednesday morning by joint teams of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) and the Traffic Engineering and Transport Planning Agency (Tepa) to launch the Bhaati Chowk remodeling project, aiming to reduce traffic congestion and control pollution.
“The market consisted of a total of 149 shops, including some tuck (pan) shops. Around 13 to 14 [shops] were situated in the front, where the shopkeepers were able to take out the birds and cages late at night. The other shopkeepers could not do this since they closed the shops in the evening as per routine,“ Bahu Khan, Lahore Bhaati bird association office bearer told Dawn.
“Thus, all birds (parrots, sparrows, etc) were buried to death after the field operation teams raised all structures with heavy machinery,” Khan lamented.
The shopkeepers lashed out at the government for not even giving them adequate time to evacuate their birds and pets worth millions of rupees.
On the other hand, the government has rejected the allegations, claiming that not a single bird was killed during the operation.
“All shopkeepers were aware of this operation already, and our teams also helped them shift birds and other goods to other places,” LDA director general Tahir Farooq claimed in a telephonic conversation with Dawn.
“The pictures being shown on the media are fake, as not a single bird was injured,” Farooq said, calling it a “propaganda by the shopkeepers to defame the government” and adding that “some political elements are running this campaign against the government”.
Meanwhile, horrified after seeing videos from the demolition site, netizens have termed the action “cruel” and “inhumane”.</p><small>2025-11-07 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632542-punjab-govt-considers-raising-challan-amount-upto-rs15000' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt considers raising challan amount up to Rs20,000</strong></a><br><p>

A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held consultations with ruling allies to secure support for the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment, with the government expected to table the bill in the Senate within days.
“The provinces have a constitutional right to an increased NFC (National Finance Commission) award, not a reduced one,” he said, warning that if provincial rights were stripped, the JUI-F would “strongly oppose it.”
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Fazl said his party had agreed on certain points in principle, but would only comment further once a draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment was presented.
Commenting on proposed changes to Article 243, he said the matter must be viewed in two ways: “If it is used to affect democracy, the Constitution or politics, we will not accept it. But if it is purely administrative, we will review it first and then decide.”
He added that nothing was being resolved at the moment because the country was relying too heavily on one institution. “Until we adopt collective thinking, nothing will be fixed,” he said, urging dialogue among parliament, its security committee, and all stakeholders to reach a consensus.
Referring to the 26th Amendment, the JUI-F chief said that during that process, parliament’s engagement had led to the government withdrawing 35 clauses from the draft. “We should not repeat practices that raise questions about parliament’s representation of the people,” he cautioned.
He stressed the need for “natural lawmaking” rather than hurried or self-serving legislation. “We make unusual laws that society rejects. We must avoid misusing our authority,” he said.
On the pace of the amendment process, Fazl noted that the 18th Amendment had been passed through a consensus-driven, months-long process. “When this [27th Amendment] comes forward, we will see how long it takes,” he said, adding that there was no current plan to meet PPP leaders to discuss the matter.
PPP draws red line
PPP, a major ally of the ruling PML-N-led government, on Thursday drew a red line against any change to the provinces’ share under the NFC while indicating conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.
Announcing decisions of the party’s Central Exe­cutive Committee (CEC) at Bilawal House late in the night, PPP Chairman Bil­awal Bhutto-Zardari said discussions on the government’s proposed constitutional changes would continue on Friday but stressed the PPP “can never compromise on the financial rights of the provinces”.
“The PPP rejects the proposal for constitutional protection of the provinces’ share,” he said, adding that the CEC had, however, authorised support for specific adjustments in Article 243.
“The government has proposed giving the Joint Chiefs a new designation, creating a new position for Strategic Command and a position of Field Marshal. Only this amendment the CEC has allowed me to support,” Bhutto-Zardari added.
On the question of establishing a constitutional court, the PPP remained non-committal, saying further internal deliberation was required before arriving at any decision.</p><small>2025-11-07 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632541-lina-khan-pakistani-american-co-chairing-mamdanis-transition-team' target='_blank'><strong>Lina Khan — Pakistani-American co-chairing Mamdani's transition team</strong></a><br><p>

Recently, however, the matter has escalated, turning into a protest, resulting in the delay of flights and leading to the suspension of a few SAEP officials.
On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, because of which hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
Why are engineers protesting?
According to SAEP representatives, the protest was carried out over two primary issues: salary disparities as well as safety and the unavailability of spare parts.
SAEP members claim that while pilots receive salary hikes, engineers’ pay remains stagnant. Moreover, the engineers claim they are often told to reuse old aircraft parts instead of being provided with new ones, a practice they say could compromise passenger safety.
For the past two months, engineers have been fastening black ribbons around their arms to state a protest against low salaries. On November 3, PIA’s flight operations were disrupted across the country after the engineers’ group refused to issue clearances to aircraft, claiming that they could not compromise on travel safety.
Struggling national carrier
The PIA said in a statement that a “de-recognised entity, SAEP, in order to pressurise the management, tried to halt the operations during late hours of yesterday (Monday) night with their nefarious design to sabotage the privatisation process.“
The government is making efforts to sell the struggling national flag carrier, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.
Yesterday, SAEP President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon were dismissed from service, further worsening tensions.
SAEP says it plans to challenge the dismissals of employees in court.
Role of aircraft engineers
Aircraft engineers play a key role in flight operations: a plane cannot take off until they sign off on safety clearances. SAEP maintains that it prioritises passenger safety even as it faces what it calls a “frustrating” work environment created by the management.
Recently, an incident involving PIA flight PK859 highlighted SAEP’s concerns, where an aircraft on its way to Jeddah from Lahore had its windshield broken mid-air, forcing the pilot to reroute back to Lahore.
According to engineers, they had previously cautioned that the aircraft was unfit to fly, but PIA allegedly disregarded those concerns. The captain (pilot) of the flight said the aircraft could not fly any further.</p><small>2025-11-07 13:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632537-deadlock-persists-as-ppp-rejects-key-clauses-of-proposed-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Deadlock persists as PPP rejects key clauses of proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Police said 55 people were in hospitals with a range of minor to serious injuries, including burns, after the blasts at the mosque inside a school complex in the Kelapa Gading area.
“The explosion was loud, so loud that I could not breathe because I was shocked,” said Luciana, 43, who was working at the school canteen at the time.
She described multiple blasts and panic as dozens fled the complex.
“I thought it was a short circuit or the sound system which exploded — we were so afraid, so we rushed out.”
Deputy House Speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, speaking to the media after visiting a hospital, said the young male suspect was undergoing surgery, without giving more details or a possible motive.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences over the incident in a post on X, offering prayers for the swift recovery of the injured.
“Pakistan stands with Indonesia in global efforts against terrorism and extremism,” he wrote. “The Pakistani nation has already made heavy sacrifices against terrorism … Terrorism has severely affected my own life as well, but I never lost courage.”
 






Investigation
At a news conference, Jakarta city police chief Asep Edi Suheri said a probe was under way.
“We have taken several measures such as investigating the crime scene, setting up a police line and sterilising the area,” Suheri said.
Indonesia does have a history of attacks on churches and Western targets — but not mosques.
News channel KompasTV showed footage of a green-painted mosque with a line of shoes outside, cordoned off with police tape. There were no signs of damage to the exterior.
State news agency Antara quoted the deputy chief security minister, Lodewijk Freidrich, as saying there were two explosions.
Black-clad police carrying assault rifles guarded the iron gates of the compound, with emergency vehicles and armoured police vehicles on the street outside.
The complex is located in a crowded area of North Jakarta on largely navy-owned land, home to many military personnel and retired officers.</p><small>2025-11-07 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632503-istanbul-talks-pakistan-presents-evidence-based-demands-to-end-cross-border-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>Istanbul talks: Pakistan presents 'evidence-based' demands to end cross-border terrorism</strong></a><br><p>

Hamid was convicted in the case along with several PTI leaders on July 31. According to his brother, he was detained by Islamabad police earlier today while he was on his way to Faisalabad to court arrest.
He was later presented before the court, which issued an order, noting that Hamid had been convicted in the case registered at Civil Lines police station in Faisalabad by then-ATC Judge Javed Iqbal Sheikh.
He was produced before the court today by Inspector Mujahid Iqbal of Civil Lines police station, it added.
According to the order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Hamid was sentenced in the case on multiple counts, with the maximum term being 10 years.
It said that the Faisalabad Central Jail superintendent was required and authorised to receive the convict in his custody for the completion of his sentences in accordance with the law.
“The sentences of imprisonment awarded to the convict for all the offences shall run concurrently,” the order read, adding that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been extended in favour of the convict.
The detention
Earlier today, Hamid’s brother, Sahibzada Hassan Raza, had said the SIC chief had been detained by Islamabad police while he was travelling to Faisalabad with the intention of surrendering himself before the court.
Police arrested him near a picket on Islamabad bypass road, Hassan said while speaking to the media outside the Faisalabad ATC, where Hamid was produced.
A separate post on Hamid’s X account also cited Hassan as saying that Hamid
was detained by Islamabad police as he was en route to Faisalabad.
“He was travelling from Peshawar to Faisalabad to surrender. Islamabad police arrested him,” the early morning post stated.
 






PTI leader Omar Ayub also posted about the development, saying that Raza was “abducted” from Islamabad late last night.
“Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib, my dear friend and colleague, has been abducted from Islamabad late last night whilst en route to surrender in the conviction awarded by an anti-terrorism court [in] Faisalabad,” Ayub said, adding that he “strongly” condemned the move.
 






“Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib is a brave and very loyal ally of PM Imran Khan (sic). He must be produced immediately in the relevant court,” the PTI leader added.
The development comes just two days after the Peshawar High Court rejected Raza’s plea seeking transit bail in the May 9 riots case.
Violent demonstrations had broken out in the country on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of ex-premier and PTI founder Imran Khan.
Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested. Later, the ECP had also deprived the PTI of its bat symbol, compelling party members to contest the 2024 elections as independent candidates. Subsequently, the PTI had allied with the SIC in a bid to get reserved seats, which are allocated on a party basis.
Raza’s conviction also led to his disqualification as a member of the National Assembly by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
After today’s court order, Hassan said while speaking to the media in Faisalabad that they would move the court for a stay order against election for the seat vacated after Hamid’s disqualification.</p><small>2025-11-07 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/071302227424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953688/lhc-orders-punjab-govt-to-act-against-smoke-emitting-vehicles' target='_blank'><strong>LHC orders Punjab govt to act against smoke-emitting vehicles</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday ordered the Punjab government to launch a rigorous campaign against smoke-emitting vehicles in the province in an effort to curb smog and air pollution.
“Whenever you go out, you see dozens of smoke-emitting vehicles on the roads,” Justice Shahid Karim said while hearing a set of petitions against smog and environmental pollution.
Justice Karim instructed authorities to run the campaign for at least two to three weeks and urged strict implementation. He also observed that vehicles travelling from Lahore to Karachi, in particular, were causing pollution.
Officials from the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the Parks and Horticultural Authority (PHA) and other departments also appeared before the court at today’s hearing.
However, the judge expressed his displeasure over the absence of a director-level officer from the EPA, as instructed at the previous hearing.
Taking exception to pollution caused by vehicles, Justice Karim directed the EPA to display banners across Lahore which warned commuters that smoke-emitting vehicles would be impounded.
The EPA official informed the court that such banners had indeed been placed around the city. At this, the judge ordered the agency to depute its officers alongside police personnel at inter-city bus terminals.
He also enquired if vehicles travelling through the motorway toll plazas were being inspected and ordered officials to ensure strict checking of vehicles plying GT Road from Lahore to Multan.
If the court’s previous orders had been implemented in letter and spirit, Lahore’s condition would have been different, he regretted, directing authorities to “take action against anyone responsible for spreading pollution.”
The judge also instructed the Punjab government’s law officer to arrange a joint meeting of the environment department, the chief traffic officer and the transport department.
Earlier, the EPA officer informed the court that at least 60 tons of old tyres had been seized from plants in South Punjab and other cities.
Over the past few weeks, Lahore has continued to remain high on the list of cities with the most polluted air. Today, it ranked as the fifth worst in the world in terms of poor air quality, according to global monitor IQAir. The city registered an air quality index (AQI) reading of 177, which the monitor considers unhealthy.
On Monday, the LHC had expressed its displeasure at the city administration’s lack of action to counter smog and pollution, questioning the use of anti-smog guns and tree cutting in the metropolis. Justice Karim had clarified that the proceedings were not against anyone but meant to guide and assist the government.</p><small>2025-11-07 08:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632485-pakistan-backs-unsc-resolution-lifting-sanctions-on-syrian-president-sharaa' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan backs UNSC resolution lifting sanctions on Syrian President Sharaa</strong></a><br><p>
