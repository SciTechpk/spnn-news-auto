The ministry’s fact check account on X attributed the claims to “propaganda machineries in Afghanistan“ and Indian accounts, particularly identifying three handles — Khurasan Media Urdu, Baba Banaras and Afghan Defense.
Among them, a post by Khurasan Media Urdu claimed that “special American aircraft have reached Pakistan for an attack on Iran”. The post also mentioned “unusual” flight activity of US aerial refuelling and surveillance aircraft between Pakistan and Iran.
A post by Afghan Defense repeated the claim.
Baba Banaras’ post made a similar claim, stating: “Multiple US reconnaissance aircraft and cargo planes with weapons landed at Dalbandin Airbase and Pasni Airbase of Pakistan. Looks like the game has been set for Iran.”
The ministry’s fact check account said false claims had been made “that the US has moved aerial refuelling (KC-135R) and surveillance aircraft to Pakistan, that these aircraft are conducting unusual flights towards or into Iranian airspace, and that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support US stealth fighters (F-35/F-22) for a possible imminent military strike on Iran”.







The post added that while it was true that the activity of US aerial refuelling aircraft had increased, it was not from Pakistan. “Reuters reported the US moved a large number of refuelling aircraft to Europe as Middle East tensions rose,” the ministry clarified, referring to a June 2025 report.
It also referred to a June 2025 report by The Washington Post, which it said mentioned Pentagon dispatching “refuelling aircraft to European bases as posture expanded”.
The ministry’s post further stated: “No credible outlet confirms that US KC-135R/ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) aircraft are operating in Pakistan.”
It reiterated that “US refuelling aircraft movements have been reported, but mostly linked to Europe”.
“No credible proof that US aircraft/ISR are based in Pakistan. No credible proof of Pakistan-to-Iran operational flights for strikes,” it added.
It recalled that Pakistan had “publicly condemned US strikes on Iran” — ostensibly a reference to Islamabad’s stance during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, during which the US also carried strikes in Iran.
“This clearly denied the ‘Pakistan is facilitating strikes’ story,” the information ministry said. “This is a reckless, blame-pushing narrative that tries to drag Pakistan into a US-Iran conflict without any verifiable evidence.”
It said that the claim that “US aircraft arrived in Pakistan for Iran strikes’ is purely disinformation”.

 

The claims have surfaced as tensions are growing between Iran and the US, with US President Donald Trump warning Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on ongoing protests in the Middle Eastern country. Iran subsequently issued stern statements in response.
On Sunday, the Iranian government — which blames Washington and Tel Aviv for fomenting the unrest — warned the US of retaliation against its military bases and Israel if the Trump administration attacked the country over a crackdown on protesters.
The same day, Trump said he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests. He also said, “The leaders of Iran called [yesterday], … a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.”
A subsequent statement by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“.
“We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he added.</p><small>2026-01-12 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644669-jcp-confirms-four-judges-for-islamabad-balochistan-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>JCP confirms four judges for Islamabad, Balochistan high courts</strong></a><br><p>

The chief minister is currently on a visit to Karachi, where he staged a rally at the Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday.
In an address to the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi on Monday, Afridi thanked all the SHCBA members for their warm welcome and generous hospitality, adding that people from all over Pakistan — including Pashtuns, Kashmiris, Balochis — of every school of thought were present there.
In contrast to this welcome from the public, however, he decried the provincial government’s treatment of him and his guests in Karachi, saying that they had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi.







“I think every Sindhi will fully condemn this,” he said amid an outcry of support from the crowd.
The KP CM also criticised the fact that the constitution and law were being “toyed with,” saying that it was not only damaging institutions but the whole of Pakistan.
“On one hand, they are selling our national assets — they auctioned PIA on OLX,” he said, referring to the recent auction of the national airline. “But here they have sold justice.”
Afridi added that the general public at least had hope that the judiciary would provide them justice and stand with them.
He said that, although three judges in Islamabad had issued an order that he be allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, “the jail superintendent picks up this order and throws it away”.
“We are accused of protest politics,” he added. “But our Constitution allows us to do this, so we will do protest politics.”
He further claimed that the judiciary was not cooperating with the party, adding that he had called the chief justice repeatedly but received no answer.
“We are being put against the wall, so the only way left is for us to protest,” he said.
The chief minister affirmed that he would always stand beside those who turned out in support of the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, saying, “We have to fight for our rights ourselves … we will not get freedom on a plate.
“If we do not raise our voice, then more pressure will be put on us.”
Afridi further said that the passport of one province’s chief minister had been blocked, saying that the people of the province were being discriminated against.
However, he added that his leader, Imran, had always supported peaceful struggle.
Regarding the economy, the KP CM said that it was facing a very bad situation, with people “fleeing” Pakistan while unemployment had risen to 7.1 per cent.
“These people are building their properties abroad,” he said, adding, “These people are bound to answer to us and one day it will definitely happen”.
The chief minister told the crowd that he had come to Karachi as his [Imran] leader had directed him to call for a street movement and that he hoped for “full support” from them.
Expressing his thanks, he said, “I hope the rule of law will come to Pakistan one day.”
‘No Section 144 can stop us’: Salman Akram Raja
Addressing the ceremony, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said, “We talk about the constitution, we talk about the law, this is our job. No section 144 can stop us”.
“Today, our rights are being attacked again and again,” said the PTI general secretary.
He stressed that the “living Constitution and law” must be restored.
Raja also said that Karachi’s vote had been robbed “in an attempt to take away the rights of the people”.
The PTI leader said that whenever the Constitution had been attacked, the SHC had been the first to raise its voice.
“The Pakistani nation is alive, due to which the chief minister of KP has been elected,” he said. “If the vote is stolen in front of you, if the judiciary is attacked, how can we remain silent? We are an alive and proud people, we have to fight for our rights.”
He added, “This country was not made for the elite. This country is a country of farmers, no matter which province they are from“.
“We stand like a lead wall against oppression.”
SHCBA President Jamali says lawyers will participate ‘fully’ in KP convention
President of the High Court Bar Muhammad Haseeb Jamali, addressing the event, called Sindh a land of peace.
“Along with peace, this land also belongs to those who have raised their voice against oppression,” he said.
The president stressed that the bar would talk about its rights as it was independent and did not belong to any party.
He added that every citizen of this country held equal opportunities under the law.
Jamali further said that lawyers of the bar had protested the 26th Amendment, the 27th Amendment and the issue of Karoonjhar as they happened.
“We are not part of any revenge politics, nor do we support it.”
“Hold a convention in KP — we will participate in it fully,” he said.
“This Pakistan is dear to all of us. Lawyers built the country; lawyers will save it,” he added.
‘Only want supremacy of Constitution’: Amir Nawaz Warraich
Sindh Bar Council Member and head of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) Amir Nawaz Warraich, also addressed the ceremony, welcoming all those present.
He said that when any bad time came about, the bar association raised its voice against it.
“Whenever there is talk of supremacy of law and putting a curb on the Constitution, we raise our voice,” he said. “We do not support any party but only want the supremacy of the Constitution.”
Warraich added that the KBA would continue to protest against the recently passed Constitutional Amendment until the Constitution was restored to its rightful form.
Visit to Mazar-i-Quaid
Earlier in the day, the KP chief minister paid a visit to Mazar-i-Quaid, where he had also criticised the Sindh government’s treatment of the PTI delegation.
Speaking to the media, he called Sindhis a “proud nation” and said that the imposition of “such people” on a proud nation was a cruelty.
“Punjab’s false government also did this; Sindh’s false government also did this,” he said.
However, he said that the people of Pakistan were respectable and proud, and always treated the guests from any province with respect.
“This is not even one per cent of Pakistan that does such actions,” he said. “The remaining 99pc of the Pakistani nation is extremely proud, brave, courageous and hospitable.”







Salman Akram Raja also spoke to reporters at the mausoleum, saying that after “three excellent days” in Karachi, they had seen the public’s “love for democracy, for Imran Khan and for human rights” as well as the force of the state, including its refusal to allow them to hold a rally even after gaining permission.
“This is all a part of Pakistan,” he said. “We are fighting for a beautiful Pakistan, for the realisation of the Quaid’s dream for Pakistan under Imran Khan’s leadership.
“Today, we have come to renew our pledge that we will create that Pakistan.”

“Six policemen were martyred in the IED blast,” said a statement from the Tank police spokesperson, adding that their armoured personnel carrier (APC) was targeted within the jurisdiction of the Gomal police station.
“The blast occurred while the APC was on its way to Tank from the Gomal police station,” the statement added.
The martyred included an additional station house officer (SHO), the police spokesperson said.
The bodies were taken to the Tank District Headquarters Hospital by Rescue 1122. Police have sealed off the area and a “massive” security operation was underway, state-run APP reported.
Separately, another IED blast took place near Darra Tang road in Lakki Marwat, which injured three police personnel, according to APP.
According to a police statement, which did not specify the number of the wounded, a SHO and “police personnel were slightly injured and are now out of danger”.
“Fitna al Khwarij targeted the police APC with an IED explosion while they were patrolling near Jabar Khel on Darra Tang Road within the jurisdiction of the Saddar police station.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Subsequently, Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan reached the site of the incident and assessed the situation. A search operation was then launched in the area, the police statement said.
It quoted DPO Nazir as saying, “These cowardly acts cannot lower our morale. The Lakki Marwat police are responding vigorously to every challenge and are ready to give every possible sacrifice for the public’s protection.”
The officer asserted that the police were resolutely tackling Fitna al Khwarij, adding that security has been increased in the area.
PM Shehbaz orders probe into Tank attack
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered an “immediate investigation” into the incident and directed that those responsible be brought to justice at the earliest, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
The premier reaffirmed the government’s commitment to completely eradicate terrorism from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed his deep grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the “terrorist attack”, a statement from his office said.
He paid tribute to the cops’ “bravery and their passion to serve the country”. The president prayed for the martyrs’ elevated ranks and for patience for their families.







KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought an immediate report from the top police officials on the incident, a statement from his office said.
He expressed his deep grief and anger, conveying his condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs.
“The brave men of KP police embraced martyrdom to protect the lives and property of the people,” Kundi was quoted as saying, adding that he was proud of the martyrs.
“These actions by Indian-backed Fitna al Khwarij cannot dampen our morale,” the governor asserted.
The KP governor urged the PTI-run provincial government to “take practical steps to ensure peace in the province”.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also strongly condemned the attack and hailed the sacrifices of “five policemen”.
“The courageous men of the police sacrificed their today for the nation’s peaceful tomorrow,” Naqvi was quoted as saying by his ministry.
“The great sacrifices of the martyrs will always be remembered,” he added.







National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, in a statement condemning the blast, expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of six police personnel.
The NA speaker paid rich tribute to the sacrifices of the law enforcement agencies in the fight against terrorism.
“The martyrdom of police officials is an irreparable loss,” he said, adding that the entire nation was proud of its brave sons who stood against terrorism.
The speaker also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
“The nation stands shoulder to shoulder with its security forces in the fight against terrorism,” Sadiq affirmed.
Recent attacks on LEAs
Law enforcement personnel have increasingly come under attack in KP in recent weeks.
On January 10, a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another CTD official was gunned down in Bannu.
The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car.
Three cops were injured in Bannu on January 8 as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6.
Last month in December, five policemen were martyred when a police vehicle was ambushed in KP’s Karak district. Eight terrorists were killed in an operation launched to hunt down the attackers.
On December 1, a head constable lost his life and five cops were injured in Lakki Marwat when a suicide bo­mber targeted a police vehicle. The same day, a police constable was gunned down by terrorists in Bannu.</p><small>2026-01-12 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/112144000bca2c3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966378/officials-healthcare-workforce-decry-mandatory-bodycam-order-for-punjab-hospital-staff' target='_blank'><strong>Officials, healthcare workforce decry mandatory bodycam order for Punjab hospital staff</strong></a><br><p>Officials and healthcare workers have raised alarm over the Punjab government’s decision to make body cameras mandatory for hospital staff, warning that the move was imposed without consultation and risks infringing on patients’ fundamental rights, including privacy and dignity, inside healthcare facilities.
Body cameras, or bodycams, are wearable audio and video recording devices used to capture footage of official action for evidence.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Friday announced her decision to make bodycams mandatory for nurses, ward boys, security guards, and pharmacy staff, except doctors, upon receiving complaints from the public regarding the behaviour and negligent attitude of hospitals.
Last month, Multan’s Nishtar Hospital sacked a doctor working as an additional house officer for misbehaving with a patient’s family, a video of which had gone viral on social media. An inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident.
‘Unbelievable’ move
Officials have taken strong exception to the move, terming it hasty, ill-conceived, and a direct violation of patients’ fundamental rights.
“This is unbelievable. If at all this is decided and practically applied, it will not be a useful technique to improve the health delivery system,” Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) President Dr Izhar Ahmed Chaudhry told Dawn. “It will bounce back and give a bad name to the government.”
He maintained the government had not consulted anyone or any forum at any level and termed the decision “illogical, impractical and insane,” which was “against fundamental rights of patients as well as the health professionals.“
“It violates essential privacy of patients and professional liberty and confidentiality of the health professionals during treatment, which is mandatory and cannot be violated under the law,” he added.
In Chaudhry’s view, instead of taking measures to improve the current deteriorating conditions in the health sector and make it free for all, the government was creating situations and endangering lives and the very existence of health professionals.
He said that the government decided “to sell out the health institutions and deliberately make the working conditions miserable with each passing day.”
‘Useless act’
For Young Doctors Association (YDA) Punjab President Dr Shoaib Niazi, the decision was a “useless act” for which he was “not consulted”.
“I was not consulted at all. This decision came from the higher-ups, and it’s a useless act,” he said, adding that similar decisions, for example, a prohibition on the use of mobile phones on duty was imposed on hospital staff, but it was not implemented.
“This move will compromise patient privacy and confidentiality. For example, in the gynaecology and labour wards. The footage will go to the IT department, and anyone can access it with patients’ consent,” Niazi said.
Raising questions on the source of funding for the bodycams, Niazi said the “security guards have not been paid salaries for the last three months in Mayo Hospital. How will the government provide bodycams? How will they implement such a structure? Where will the money come from?”
He further said that there would be no “honest opinion” because of body cameras, adding that the government had taken the decision without consulting him, and it was expected that the next step would be make bodycams mandatory for doctors.
The YDA Punjab president said he would hold a press conference related to the issue soon, and he would speak in detail about it.
‘Unable to understand use, but will follow orders’
According to the Punjab Young Nurses Association Member and a staffer at Children’s Hospital Lahore, Muqaddas Tasneem, nurses were a major stakeholder in the decision, but none of them were consulted.
“The govt didnt consult us at all and decided on its own. However, we have to follow the orders and act upon the directions,” she said.
Junaid Tariq, the president of Allied Health Sciences — an alliance of ward boys and other staff members, except nurses at the Lahore General Hospital — voiced similar concerns, saying he or other members from the alliance were not informed or consulted at all.
“The govt has not consulted stakeholders. We are unable to understand the purpose of this order. It fits in with the responsibilities of security guards, but it will compromise the privacy of patients. It will compromise the confidentiality of patients’ medical records. The nature of our work does not relate to security,” he said.
‘Inconceivable decision’
Speaking to Dawn, former Punjab caretaker minister for health and ex- vice-chancellor of the University of Health Sciences, Lahore, Dr Javed Akram said he did not have any knowledge of the decision, saying it was “not possible that something like this will happen as it was inconceivable. How will they do it to so many people?”
Dr Akram raised multiple questions on the practical aspect of the decision: “How will they watch or analyse those [healthcare officials] with bodycams? What if the employees with cams have to go to rest rooms? Will they take the cam off each time?”
Worldwide practice limited to security staff
There are very few countries in the world that allow bodycams to be used or trialled for hospital staff, but it’s not widespread and is usually limited to security staff or situations with high risks of violence, not everyday clinical care.
For example, New South Wales (NSW) Health in Australia is running official trials of body‑worn cameras in public hospitals, equipping security staff with them in selected hospitals to record incidents of aggression or violence for safety and deterrence.
In the United Kingdom, some NHS trusts in England, including East Sussex cases like Conquest Hospital and Eastbourne District General Hospital, have trialled body‑worn cameras for staff (mostly security and senior nurses) to deter abuse and violence. However, such a blanket decision has not been announced anywhere in the world.</p><small>2026-01-12 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121715417eb5f3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966567/former-test-cricketer-and-chief-selector-mohammad-ilyas-passes-away-at-79' target='_blank'><strong>Former Test cricketer and chief selector Mohammad Ilyas passes away at 79</strong></a><br><p>Former Test cricketer and chief selector Mohammad Ilyas passed away at the age of 79 after fighting a prolonged illness, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Monday.
Ilyas — a right-hand batter and right-arm leg-spin bowler — played 10 Test matches along with 82 first-class and two List-A games between 1961 and 1976, PCB said in a statement as it expressed its grief following Ilyas’s passing.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi also extended his heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the bereaved family, while also paying homage to the late Ilyas for his valuable services to the game of cricket in Pakistan.
Ilyas made his Test debut against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on December 4, 1964 and played his last Test match against England at Dhaka from February 28 to March 3, 1969, according to the national board.







Apart from one Test century, the opening batsman boasted a record of 12 first-class tons, having scored 4,607 runs in the format.
His solitary Test century came in the third Test match of a 2-0 home series win over New Zealand in March-April 1965. He played a masterful 126 while opening the batting as Pakistan hunted down the 202-run target in Karachi to seal the series.
He played twice when England toured in 1968-69, making 42 runs in four innings. Early on his second tour to Australia, he was struck in the face, and he was also accused of indiscipline.
Rather than fly home, he applied for Australian citizenship and ended the season playing grade cricket for Waverley in Sydney. He made his last appearance in Pakistan in the BCCP Trophy final in 1971-72 when he helped PIA to victory.</p><small>2026-01-12 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12160415ef37620.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966562/indian-rocket-loses-control-after-lift-off-in-fresh-blow-to-countrys-space-agency' target='_blank'><strong>Indian rocket loses control after lift-off in fresh blow to country’s space agency</strong></a><br><p>An Indian rocket carrying 16 loads of equipment and experiments, including an earth surveillance satellite, went off track after lift-off on Monday in a fresh setback to the workhorse launch vehicle of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
It was a second disappointment for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in about eight months, denting its reputation for reliability, with a more than 90 per cent success rate over about 60 past missions.
The PSLV-C62 lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the island of Sriharikota at 10:18am local time, carrying the EOS-N1 observation satellite and 15 other payloads developed by startups and academic institutions in India and abroad.

 


The ISRO’s mission control said the rocket performed normally for most of the flight before an unexpected disturbance and deviation from its path.
“The PSLV-C62 mission encountered an anomaly during the end of the PS3 stage. A detailed analysis has been initiated,” ISRO said in a statement, without giving further details on what had gone wrong or where the rocket ended up.







The PSLV has been central to India’s space programme, having launched missions such as Chandrayaan-1 and the Aditya-L1 solar observatory. It also underpins India’s push to open space manufacturing to private industry.</p><small>2026-01-12 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121736282f78fd3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966555/may-9-riots-punjab-refutes-pti-claims-of-submitting-unrelated-videos-for-forensic-analysis' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Punjab refutes PTI claims of submitting unrelated videos for forensic analysis</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari on Monday refuted claims by PTI leaders that different and unrelated videos were submitted for a forensic report about the May 9, 2023 riots.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident.
“There are two separate videos [of KP CM] and they should not be confused. One of the videos must be from Zaman Park. However, the other one showing [him] vandalising and lighting fire has been deleted [from the social media account],” she said while addressing a press conference in Lahore.
“When KP chief minister realised that an effort to rebellion which he termed as revolution failed, he deleted the videos [of May 9, 2023] from social media. However, the videos remained in the record,” said Bokhari.
She further claimed their destination was the Corps Commander House, located very close to the Radio Pakistan building. However, they were denied entry there, so they entered the state media building, vandalised it, set fire, and destroyed the records there.
In response to the conviction of identified suspects in May 9 cases, she said those involved in cases in Punjab have been convicted and they were serving their sentences in prison. “We don‘t have any political revenge against anyone,” she said, adding the cases on PML-N leadership in PTI’s tenure were politically motivated.
Speaking on the PTI’s call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, the information minister said they planned a “new programme of anarchy to subjugate the state and make the law subservient to them, which cannot be made possible”.
The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted.
At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage.
Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.</p><small>2026-01-12 11:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1216225475179aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966564/president-zardari-to-embark-on-4-day-official-visit-to-bahrain-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari to embark on 4-day official visit to Bahrain tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari will undertake an official visit to Bahrain from January 13-16, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement on Monday.
According to the FO, the president will be accompanied by a “high-level delegation”.
It said that during the visit, the president will hold meeting with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who is also the prime minister.
“The discussions will focus on bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest,” the FO said.







“The visit seeks to reinforce Pakistan’s longstanding cooperation with the brotherly Gulf nation while expanding opportunities for collaboration in trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties,” it added.
Last year in November, Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif, during a two-day visit to Bahrain, had reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to deepening ties with the kingdom.
Discussing economic relations, the prime minister had unde­r­lined Pakistan’s desire to expand trade and investment and said bilateral trade was set to grow with the Pak­istan-GCC Free Trade Agree­ment.
Earlier in September, Bahrain’s interior minister had visited Pakistan, with the two countries agreeing to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, and immigration.</p><small>2026-01-12 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12132649c591c90.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966550/who-is-reza-pahlavi-and-what-are-his-links-to-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Reza Pahlavi — and what are his links to Iran?</strong></a><br><p>While Iran has grappled with widespread deadly protests for the past two weeks, Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, has once again emerged as an anti-government figurehead.
The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the authorities in Iran, who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States.
Pahlavi has urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement. He has also hinted at his plans to return to Iran at a time that he believed was “very near”.
He has even requested US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to get involved if force is used on protesters, to “be ready to intervene to help the people of Iran”.
So what links does Pahlavi have to Iran’s history, and what are the stakes for him in establishing a role in the ongoing crisis?
Born in Tehran on Oct 31, 1960, as the heir to the late Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza and Empress Farah Pahlavi, Reza Pahlavi was officially named crown prince at the age of seven.
He has lived in exile since his father was ousted by the 1979 revolution, a year before he died.

As per his website, Pahlavi left Iran for jet fighter training in the United States Air Force in 1978. “During this same period, the building unrest in Iran led to the royal family’s departure in January 1979,” his website says about his father’s ouster.
Pahlavi completed his higher education with a degree in political science from the University of Southern California. He volunteered to serve Iran’s military as a fighter pilot during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, but was declined by the Islamic regime.
Pahlavi married Yasmine Etemad-Amini on June 12, 1986. They have three daughters (all of whom he has named as his heirs successively): Noor Pahlavi (born April 3, 1992), Iman Pahlavi (born Sept 12, 1993), and Farah Pahlavi (born Jan 17, 2004).
The late shah’s heir has also authored three books: Gozashteh va Ayandeh (Kayhan Publishing, 2000); Winds of Change: The Future of Democracy in Iran (Regnery, 2002); and Iran: L’Heure du Choix [Iran: The Deciding Hour] (Denoël, 2009).
Ties outside Iran
Pahlavi’s website highlights that he remains in touch with “opposition groups, both inside and outside” Iran, and advocates for the establishment of a secular democracy in the country.
“He calls for regime change through non-violent civil disobedience, and for a free and open referendum on a new government of Iran,” the website reads.
While Iran and Israel are arch-enemies under the current regime, they both enjoyed warmer ties under Pahlavi’s father.
In October last year, Israeli-funded online campaigns in the Persian language used fake social media personas and AI to boost Pahlavi’s image and destabilise the Iranian regime, parallel investigations by Israeli newspapers and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab found.

 

During the 12-day Iran-Israel war last year, Pahlavi urged Khamenei to step down “for the sake of the Iranian people”.
In a similar fashion, during the ongoing protests, the late shah’s son called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag, which protesters briefly succeeded in doing so in London.</p><small>2026-01-12 11:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12143724dff590c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966524/trump-weighing-tough-response-to-iran-crackdown-on-protesters-tehran-says-ready-for-war-but-also-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>Trump weighing tough response to Iran crackdown on protesters; Tehran says ready for war but also dialogue</strong></a><br><p>Iran is fully prepared for conflict but also ready for negotiations, its foreign minister said on Monday, as US President Donald Trump said the Iranian leadership was seeking talks after he threatened to intervene militarily over a crackdown on protests and that he was weighing a range of strong responses.
The escalating protests in Iran, which began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Trump has warned Iran’s leaders that the United States would attack if security forces open fire on protesters, while Iranian authorities have accused the US and Israel of fomenting unrest.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said the US may meet Iranian officials and was in contact with the opposition, as he weighed a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests.
He said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the US bombed in a 12-day war in June.
“The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.”
However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“.
Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters on Sunday.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.
“The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options,” Trump told reporters.
Following his statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on Monday that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“.
“We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he said.
Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf earlier warned Washington against “a miscalculation.”
“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.

 

Near paralysis
In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis.
The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse.
There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown.
One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy.
The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States.
State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel.
Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests.
After three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday.
Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”.
The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed.
President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence.
Trump says he will talk to Musk about restoring internet in Iran​
Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days.
“He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.







Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’
The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic.
“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media.
Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag.
“The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said.
In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah.
The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.</p><small>2026-01-12 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644619-kp-assembly-seeks-peshawar-corps-commanders-in-camera-briefing-on-security-situation' target='_blank'><strong>KP Assembly seeks Peshawar corps commander's in-camera briefing on security situation</strong></a><br><p>

“People are exhausted after the 12-day war with Israel,” he said over the phone. “It’s the uncertainty. You can’t even plan for the near future because things keep changing.”
Iran is buckling under mounting economic pressure. Inflation has exceeded 36 per cent since March. The rial has lost roughly half its value, trading at around 1,390,000 to the US dollar. Sanctions linked to Iran’s nuclear programme have returned, utilities remain strained, and global financial bodies are forecasting a recession in 2026.
Unrest, at the worst possible time
Iran’s most significant protests since 2022 erupted around two weeks ago among traders and shopkeepers in downtown Tehran, triggered by the rapid collapse of the rial, which has driven up prices and left traders unable to restock goods.
Isolated market shutdowns in Tehran’s commercial districts quickly escalated into street demonstrations, drawing in wider sections of the public and prompting security deployments. Like falling dominoes, the unrest spread to other cities, claiming dozens of lives, according to rights groups.
Last week, major Iranian cities were gripped overnight by new mass rallies denouncing the Islamic Republic, as activists expressed fear that authorities were intensifying their suppression of the demonstrations under the cover of an internet blackout.
The crackdown follows what was initially a relatively soft response, with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian calling for a kind and responsible” approach, acknowledging public frustration. The government had also announced cash handouts to ease economic woes.
The regime appears to have shifted its tone since, accusing the US and Israel of orchestrating the protests. “The enemy has infiltrated trained terrorists into the country. Rioters and saboteurs are not the protesting people. We listen to the protesters and have made our utmost efforts to solve their problems,” Pezes­hkian said.
The US, meanwhile, has offered to “help” the Iranian people, and the Trump administration also reportedly discussed the possibility of strikes targeting Iran.
Posting on social media on Saturday, US President Trump said: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”
In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of US intervention in Iran, according to Reuters.
Meanwhile, addressing parliament on Sunday, Iran’s speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf warned the US against any miscalculation. If the US attacked, “both the occupied territory and centres of the US military and shipping will be our legitimate targets,” he told lawmakers. The warning came hours before Trump disclosed that Iran’s leadership had called seeking “to negotiate”.
“The leaders of Iran called yesterday,“ Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that “a meeting is being set up … They want to negotiate.”
However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“.
The timing could have hardly been worse.
US jets had just flown into Venezuela and captured President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. Maduro was taken to New York, and footage posted online showed him blindfolded in a grey tracksuit — an unsettling image, regardless of one’s politics.
A cat-and-mouse relationship
Miles away, in Tehran, Venezuela’s anti-American ally felt the pressure.
Could Trump pull a Venezuela on Iran, its longest adversary?
“We know that Donald Trump is not a reliable president, and he doesn’t care about international law,” said Soheili.
Iran and the US have long shared a cat-and-mouse relationship. Washington has consistently viewed Iran’s nuclear programme and its network of regional proxies with suspicion.
In 2020, an American strike killed Iran’s most revered military commander and foreign policy architect, Gen Qasem Soleimani. In June 2025, US jets struck key Iranian nuclear sites as Iran, shaken but defiant, fought a brief war with Israel.
Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which allows non-nuclear states to pursue civilian nuclear energy under international inspections. Tehran insists its programme remains peaceful, a claim disputed by the United States and its allies, who argue that Iran’s enrichment levels exceed civilian requirements. Iran, for its part, has repeatedly accused Washington of selectively enforcing the treaty while ignoring violations by its partners, including Israel.
Following the Iran-Israel war, sweeping UN sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed, while Tehran suspended nuclear inspections, effectively freezing its remaining commitments under the agreement.
Trump’s oil gambit
Iran, no stranger to the consequences of foreign intervention, was quick to condemn Washington’s actions in Venezuela as a “clear violation” of sovereignty and international law.
“In past decades, interventions were justified under slogans such as democracy and human rights,” Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Monday. “Today, they openly say the issue is Venezuela’s oil.”
After Maduro’s capture, Trump promised that American companies would gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. “We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,” he told reporters.
After vowing to “run” Venezuela, Trump later softened his tone, saying the United States would not deploy troops if the country “does what we want.”
Venezuela holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves, accounting for roughly 17pc of the global total, according to the US Energy Information Administration.
That is another point of comparison with Iran.
As the United Nations and states around the world debate the legality of Trump’s move, one thing is clear: the US president has moved on from peacemaker to interventionist. And that shift is making Tehran uneasy.
Iran on edge
Inside the country, the debate has already begun.
Pro-Iran outlets have quietly explored the implications.
“Following the US military attack on Venezuela and … Donald Trump’s threatening remarks … a serious question has emerged: could Tehran be the next target of Washington’s adventurism …,” wrote Nournews, an Iran-based digital news outlet.
Tehran-based foreign policy expert Mohammad Khatibi agrees that there is cause for concern.
“Yes, in light of what has occurred in Venezuela, there is clear reason for concern. Threats of intervention and open advocacy for regime change raise serious questions under international law and established norms,” he told Dawn.
That said, he cautioned against drawing direct parallels.
“From a geopolitical perspective, Iran is a central regional power in the Middle East with deep strategic depth, strong state institutions, and significant influence across multiple regional theatres,” he added.
Khatibi asserted that any attempt to replicate the Venezuelan model in Iran would therefore carry far greater risks of regional escalation and international confrontation.
Iran’s leverage in the Middle East has rested not only on its military capabilities but also on its network of allies and proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. An attack on Iran could create ripples through the region.
Apples and oranges?
Syed M. Ali, a security studies lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, cautioned against overstating the comparison.
“It is somewhat like comparing apples and oranges,” he said. “While the Venezuelan action will be tough for the US to justify internationally, this intervention is motivated by Trump’s desire to reassert hemispheric hegemony, which resonates with the historical Monroe Doctrine (a policy opposing European colonialism in the Americas, asserting that any foreign interference in the Western Hemisphere would be seen as a threat to US interests).”
Iran’s regional position, he added, makes any direct intervention far more complicated. And with the events happening in Gaza, the public perception not just in the Muslim world but also in the West has moved against the nexus between the US deep state and Israel, which act in tandem.
“After Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been little appetite for that kind of operation. Iran is not as isolated as it once was. There has been a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia. These are the reasons why I say Trump’s statement is more rhetorical — intended to increase pressure for change within Iran.”
While comparisons with Venezuela fuel anxiety, Tehran’s regional influence makes any direct foreign intervention unlikely — at least for now.
In turbulent times, hope often becomes a strategy.
Amid internal frustrations, a faltering economy, and the shadow of international pressure, ordinary Iranians are left clinging to the hope that cautious diplomacy, rather than confrontation, will chart the path forward.</p><small>2026-01-12 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644615-extreme-cold-wave-pmd-says-mercury-to-remain-in-normal-winter-range' target='_blank'><strong>'Extreme cold wave': PMD says mercury to remain in normal winter range</strong></a><br><p>

India will also be invited to join Pax Silica next month, Gor said, referring to a US-led initiative to build a silicon supply chain from critical minerals to semiconductors and AI.
Trade talks between India and the US fell apart last year and Trump then doubled tariffs on Indian goods in August to 50 per cent, among the world’s highest rates, including a levy of 25pc to punish New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil.
The two nations have been close to a deal on several occasions since they agreed to negotiate in February last year, India said last week.
“Both sides continue to actively engage. In fact, the next call on trade will occur tomorrow,” Gor said in New Delhi as he formally took charge of his position, adding that the two countries will continue to work on issues such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education and health.
The failure to reach a deal has pushed the Indian rupee to a record low and spooked investors waiting for progress in two-way negotiations.
Friends always resolve differences: Gor
Gor’s comments brought some cheer to Indian markets, and the benchmark Nifty 50 recovered 220 points to trade 0.15pc higher as of 12:45pm (12:15pm PKT).
Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal, in comments made elsewhere, also said that New Delhi continues to talk to Washington for a trade deal.
“The United States and India are bound not just by shared interests, but by a relationship anchored at the highest level,” Gor said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier agreed to target a deal by fall 2025, and more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.

 

To bridge the $47 billion goods trade gap, India pledged to buy up to $25 billion in US energy and boost defence imports.
Reuters has reported that New Delhi and Washington were very close to a trade deal last year but a communication breakdown led to the collapse of any potential pact.
“Real friends can disagree, but always resolve their differences in the end,” Gor said.</p><small>2026-01-12 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12134832e911b58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966554/at-37-kohli-reinvents-himself-to-extend-odi-dominance' target='_blank'><strong>At 37, Kohli reinvents himself to extend ODI dominance</strong></a><br><p>Virat Kohli has tweaked his approach to counter-attack early in his innings and put bowlers under pressure to flip the momentum for India, the batting stalwart said after his match-winning knock in Sunday’s one-day international against New Zealand.
The number three batter crafted 93 off 91 balls as India chased down a target of 301 with one over to spare en route to a four-wicket victory in the opener in Vadodara.
After opener Rohit Sharma fell for 26 in the ninth over, Kohli refused to retreat into a defensive shell.
Instead, he took the initiative in a match-defining 118-run stand with skipper Shubman Gill (56), using controlled aggression to force New Zealand’s attack onto the back foot.
“Well, the basic idea is I bat at No.3,” Kohli said after winning the player of the match award.
“So if the situation is a bit tricky, I back myself to counterattack now rather than just trying to play the situation in because some ball has your name on it.”
Batting great Kohli is active internationally only in the 50-overs format.

His masterclass on Sunday was the 37-year-old’s fifth consecutive 50-plus score in ODIs.
In his 17th year in international cricket, he continues to reinvent himself and said he now aims to make the most of the first 20 deliveries after coming in at first drop.
“There’s no point waiting around for too long. But at the same time, you don’t play outrageous shots. You still stick to your strengths, but you back yourself enough to put the opposition on the back foot,” he said.
“I just felt like if I push hard now in the first 20 balls, then we can probably string in a partnership straight after a wicket like Rohit’s where the opposition is going to go on the back foot.
“That actually ended up being the difference in the game.”
India take on New Zealand in the second ODI of the three-match series in Indore on Sunday.

The weather body dismissed the reports of extreme weather, stating that “No such extreme or historic cold wave is expected during the mentioned period”.
“According to the latest analysis of numerical weather prediction models and observational data, temperatures are within the normal winter range, with no indication of widespread or persistent record-breaking conditions,” PMD said.
It urged the public to rely on official forecasts, warnings and advisories issued by the PMD.

Separately, Weather Updates PK, an independent weather agency, took to X and said that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) “has been indicating a large and rare weather scenario since yesterday” — a polar vortex disruption.
A polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth’s poles, according to the US National Weather Service.
ECMWF is a service that provides global numerical weather predictions.
It said the forecast had drawn attention on social media, with some platforms claiming that “due to severe Arctic cold winds, record-breaking negative temperature anomalies could be observed in southern Pakistan, including Karachi and its surroundings.”







Weather Updates PK clarified that the forecast made by ECMWF was “long range“ and subject to “change with each passing day”.
The weather body said that no other weather models had yet confirmed the forecast, stating that it was “not right to take it seriously”.
It further added: “However, it is true that a western disturbance is expected between January 18 and 20 […] usually, every western system is followed by a cold wave; however, there is no final confirmation about its intensity yet”.</p><small>2026-01-12 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121058504f27e6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966546/motorways-now-open-for-traffic-say-police-following-partial-closure-due-to-dense-fog-conditions' target='_blank'><strong>Motorways now open for traffic, say police following partial closure due to dense fog conditions</strong></a><br><p>The motorway police have said that all motorways under its jurisdiction have been opened for traffic, after dense fog conditions prompted partial closure of several motorways early on Monday.
In a post on X, the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) said, “All motorways falling under the jurisdiction of the NHMP have been opened for traffic upon improved visibility”.







Earlier, due to dense and persistent fog conditions, the motorway police had partially closed various key motorways, including sections of the M-2, M-3, M-4, M-5, and M-11.
At 10:25am on Monday, NHMP said on its X account that the M-2 motorway had been closed from Thokar Niaz Baig to Sial Mor, the M-3 motorway remained closed from Faisal Pur to Darakhana, and the M-4 motorway is closed from Shershah to Pindi Bhattian.
While the M-5 motorway is closed from Shershah to Zaheer Peer, and the M-11 motorway is closed from Lahore to Sambrial.







Earlier, the NHMP said that Motorway M-5 was closed from Rohri to Rahim Yar Khan, but it had now been opened due to “improved visibility”.







According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s fog forecast, the M-2 (Pindi Bhattian-Lahore), M-3 (Lahore - Abdul Hakim), M-11 (Sialkot - Lahore), M-4 (Pindi Bhattian - Faisalabad), and M-5 (Multan - Sukkur) were expected to remain in “dense“ fog situation till 11am.



Last week, three people were killed, and 34 others were injured in fog-related accidents in various parts of Punjab.
On January 7, dense fog paralysed road traffic across large parts of Punjab, prompting authorities to close several key motorways.
According to a spokesperson for the NHMP Central Region, the M-4 Motorway from Gojra to Abdul Hakeem and the M-11 Lahore-Sialkot Motorway were closed for all traffic due to severely reduced visibility.</p><small>2026-01-12 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121221216509650.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966548/australia-moves-india-3-other-countries-to-highest-risk-category-for-student-visas-media' target='_blank'><strong>Australia moves India, 3 other countries to ‘highest risk’ category for student visas: media</strong></a><br><p>Australia has tightened checks for student visa applicants from India, moving it to the ‘highest risk’ category along with Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, according to Australian and Indian media.
The Times of India reported on Sunday that the re-rating of the countries was out of cycle, quoting Australian media, while the administration said this was triggered by “emerging integrity risks”.
According to the TOI report, the administration did not cite any specific reason for which India had been assigned to a new category. However, it added that the move came after reports of “fake degree busts” in India which had reached international media.







“India alone accounts for almost 140,000 of Australia’s 650,000 international students, and the four nations represent nearly one-third of 2025 enrolments,” the Indian outlet said.
Impact on students
Assessment levels influence not only the documentary burden but also how easily prospective students can plan to study in Australia, according to The Australia Today.
“Higher levels typically require more extensive proof of finances, English proficiency and genuine temporary entrant intentions, among other criteria. These changes can slow processing times, increase applicant costs and discourage applicants if perceived as overly burdensome,” it said.
It added that international education stakeholder groups had stressed that clarity and predictability are essential, especially for countries that contribute significant student numbers and economic activity.
India, in particular, is one of Australia’s largest source markets for international students, it added.
According to the Australian outlet, experts say the latest changes may lead to closer scrutiny of applications from South Asia, but also stress that genuine students still have pathways to study in Australia.
The Australian Department of Education and Home Affairs is expected to publish detailed guidance for providers and agents explaining the basis for the updates and how documentation requirements will be implemented in practice, it said.
“The sector will be watching closely for official documents that could explain whether the Assessment Level changes are temporary or if they signal a longer-term shift in how Australia manages risk across major international student source markets,” it added.
Fraudulent applications
“Authorities have seen evidence of a rise in suspected fraudulent documentation — both financial and academic — from certain source countries during recent visits to South Asia,” The Australia Today said.
Australia’s Minister for International Education Julian Hill, reportedly described Australia as having become “the least worst country of choice amongst the Big Four” destinations for international students — referring to global competitors such as the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.
Hill said that this had prompted a stronger emphasis on documentary evidence and risk filtering to protect visa integrity, the Australian outlet reported.
Meanwhile, The Times of India said that according to experts, Australia now remained the only option among these destinations, as the US, UK and Canada were shutting their doors to foreign students.
“It recently became obvious that student applicants who couldn’t get into those other three countries are increasingly applying to come to Australia, and in many cases we’ve seen an increase in fraudulent financial and academic documents,” TOI quoted Phil Honeywood, chief executive officer of the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA), as saying.
“By placing a number of these countries into the highest risk rating level, it automatically enhances any filtering of the student visa applicants to ensure bona fide study motivation.”
Concerns over ambiguity
While some in the sector acknowledge the importance of maintaining rigour against fraud, the sudden jump in assessment levels — particularly the broad move of multiple large source countries such as India and Bangladesh to AL3 — has prompted questions about how risk is being measured and communicated.
The Australia Today reported that Honeywood had raised concerns about the timing and frequency of assessment level changes.
He said that ambiguity around shifting risk categories was affecting education providers at a critical point in the academic calendar during the first intake of 2026.
According to the outlet, he said that he had had a “long discussion” with Minister Hill about the sector’s concerns, “primarily with two aspects of the assessment level changes”.
“First and foremost, the frequency of change is causing confusion among providers here and agents offshore. Secondly, at the very time we are trying to ensure a good start to the year intake, we appear again as though we are not quite sure which countries we seek to recruit from.”
Honeywood added that educational institutions needed stability and clear policy signals to properly plan recruitment efforts, liaise with agents and support prospective students trying to understand evolving visa requirements, the outlet added.</p><small>2026-01-12 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644569-who-got-what-fresh-toshakhana-records-emerge' target='_blank'><strong>Who got what: Fresh Toshakhana records emerge</strong></a><br><p>

The threatening social media post drew an angry retort from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who said “no one” would tell his country what to do.
Washington has imposed economy-crippling sanctions on its island neighbour for decades, but Trump has ramped up the pressure in recent days.

 

US special forces seized Maduro and his wife this month in a lightning raid that left dozens of the ousted Venezuelan president’s security personnel dead — many of whom were Cuban.
Though Maduro’s allies have become interim leaders, Trump has claimed the United States now actually controls Venezuela through a US naval blockade of its vital oil sector.
“THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
“I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”
He said, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.”







Trump provided almost no details about what potential deal he referred to, or what such an arrangement would achieve.
Asked about it later on Sunday, Trump told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted people forced out of Cuba or who “left under duress” to be taken care of.
“Most importantly, right now, we’re going to take care of the people that came from Cuba, that are American citizens, or in our country,” Trump said, without clarifying how this would be achieved under a deal with Havana.
‘Ready to fall’
A week ago, Trump stated that “Cuba is ready to fall,” noting that the island’s economic crisis was worsening and it would be difficult for Havana to “hold out” without receiving heavily subsidised Venezuelan oil.
Earlier on Sunday, the president reposted a message that jokingly suggested US Secretary of State Marco Rubio — a child of Cuban immigrants who concurrently holds the posts of national security advisor, acting head of the US archives, and acting international aid administrator — could also become the president of Cuba.
Trump shared that post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!” Cuba’s president rebuffed Trump’s threatening language, saying the Caribbean island’s residents were “ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do,” Diaz-Canel wrote on X.
Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez also weighed in to stress that Cuba is within its rights to import fuel from any willing exporter, “without interference or subordination to the unilateral coercive measures of the United States.”
‘Talk, talk, talk’
A Cold War-era US trade embargo has cinched Cuba’s economy beginning in 1962, and since 2000 Havana has increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, the firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez.
On Sunday in the streets of Havana, retiree Mercedes Simon seemed to dismiss the US leader’s latest bluster.
“Trump is not going to touch Cuba,” the 65-year-old told AFP.
“All the presidents talk, talk, talk” about Cuba, for decades, “but they don’t act.” Marcos Sanchez, a 21-year-old working in the restaurant business, said the two countries should find common ground, “without resorting to violence.”
Trump’s provocative language on Cuba comes as the emboldened American leader has hinted he has other countries in his sights after capturing Maduro.
Trump, who had openly sought last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has recently threatened Colombia, Mexico, Iran and Greenland.
Some Republican US lawmakers on Sunday lauded Trump for his aggressive comments on Cuba, including Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida.
“The tyranny in Cuba will not survive the second term of President Trump,” Diaz-Balart posted in Spanish on X, “and Cuba will finally be free after decades of misery, tragedy, and pain.”

According to police, the operation was conducted within the jurisdiction of Mirakhel Police Station on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel.
Acting on credible intelligence, CTD Bannu’s Special Weapons and Tactics teams, along with Bannu Police, cordoned off the area and launched the operation. During the action, the terrorists opened fire, prompting effective retaliatory fire by the police and CTD personnel.
Following an exchange of fire, two terrorists were found dead during a search operation. They were identified as Suhail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman.
Police stated that both terrorists were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police check posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building.
Weapons and ammunition recovered from the slain terrorists included two Kalashnikov rifles, one pistol, multiple rounds of ammunition, a motorcycle, two mobile phones, two national identity cards, and a card belonging to the proscribed TTP.
Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, along with the Additional IG CTD, commended the Bannu Police and CTD SWAT teams for the successful operation.
The IGP KP stated that intelligence-based targeted operations will continue uninterrupted across the province until terrorism is completely eliminated.
In a separate incident, militants launched an attack on the Nala Kasho police checkpost, using light and heavy weapons.
However, the attack was foiled after retaliatory action by police personnel.
As soon as information about the attack was received, police contingents from Domel and Town Police Station, along with other security forces, immediately reached the site of the incident.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during 2025, according to the “Pakistan Security Report 2025” report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS).
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-12 04:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1209135167657d3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966429/efforts-on-to-improve-pressure-resume-normal-gas-supply-ssgc' target='_blank'><strong>Efforts on to improve pressure, resume normal gas supply: SSGC</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has said that the utility is actively pursuing efforts to fix the technical fault that caused a 30 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) shortfall, and the deficit was likely to be fully recovered within the next few days.
“Once normal supply levels resume, pressure tightness is anticipated to ease, restoring full service to households across Sindh and Balochistan,” it said.
A gas utility spokesperson said that as an unexpected cold snap swept across Pakistan, households in Sindh and Balochistan faced a sudden surge in natural gas demand, pushing the SSGC into emergency measures to protect the domestic supply.
She said that the winter spike, driven largely by increased use of geysers and space heaters, raised overall consumption by roughly 10per cent. “To bridge the gap, SSGC diverted about 90MMCFD of reliquefied natural gas into the network,” she said.
However, the spokesperson said a rapid temperature drop in recent days caused a further, unanticipated rise in household demand, extending cooking hours and intensifying morning and evening peaks.
She said that an upstream technical issue cut supply by an estimated 30MMCFD, compounding the situation and creating a shortfall that lowered distribution pressures in several tail-end localities.
“In response, SSGC activated its government-approved load management plan, which includes curtailing gas to fertiliser plants and enforcing weekly industrial closures to prioritise residential consumers,” she added.
The spokesperson said that domestic supply remained the gas utility’s first priority, in line with the prime minister’s directives and the approved load management framework. “The company pledges to maintain uninterrupted service from 5 am to 10pm daily, while deploying special 24-hour teams to address low-pressure complaints across the franchise areas,” she added.

Speaking at a party workers’ convention at Kamoke, around 50km from Lahore, he said that the IPP has launched a movement for creation of smaller provinces as an immediate and sustainable solution to problems of people living in far-flung areas.
“We will not change the names of provinces; new provinces should be created like in Punjab as North, South, West, and East Punjab. For this purpose, political parties must rise above narrow-mindedness and show magnanimity as it is in everyone’s own interest,” he said.

 

Welcoming support from MQM and other political parties for the proposal of new provinces, he said this would save people’s time and energy and allow their issues to be resolved closer to their doorstep.

Parties must show magnanimity to back the proposal: Aleem

He said that not only Punjab, but Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should also be divided into four provinces each with a new name.
The IPP leader announced linking cities of Kamoke and Gujranwala with the Lahore-Sialkot-Kharian Motorway which will provide these cities access to Islamabad via the Motorway network.
He also announced widening of this Motorway from four to six lanes which will benefit Gujranwala division in general and Kamoke city in particular.
The minister said that the prime minister would be invited to Kamoke and Gujranwala to inaugurate the link Motorway. He said the communications department has carried out important development works in Kamoke, including U-turns and that further projects will be added in future.
He demanded fixing of the minimum price of wheat for farmers at Rs4,000 per maund. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should take personal interest in reducing tax rates for the business community so that wheels of industry can move faster.
He said the youth are our future and providing them with dignified employment is our national responsibility.
If all-round development takes place, jobs will be created for the youth through the private sector for which business activities must be accelerated.
The minister also praised the leadership of the Pakistan armed forces for humbling the enemy and earning global respect for the country.

The significant delay in utilising the loan is mainly due to the failure of the Tranche III road project to begin, resulting from controversies in the bidding process discussed in five parliamentary standing committee meetings.
Without immediate acc­ele­ration by the National Highway Authority (NHA), the funds will expire without the completion of the Tranche-III road project, which involves widening sections of the N55 Highway.
In a letter seen by Dawn, the ADB warned the economic affairs division that based on current progress, there was a significant risk the approved $360m under the Multi-tranche Finan­cing Facility (MFF) would not be fully utilised by the expiration date of Dec 31, 2027.
The project has been stalled for eight months following controversies surrounding the bidding process.
Although bids were opened in February 2025 and approved by the ADB shortly thereafter, the process faced scrutiny from five parliamentary panels and Public Procurement Regulatory Authority.
Despite the administrative hurdles, the Islamabad High Court recently ordered that work be awarded without further delay. The court noted that continued stalling could result in loan cancellation, cost escalation and “serious reputational damage” to the national exchequer.
The total of the project cost is estimated at Rs170bn, which includes land acquisition, consultancy and taxes while the lowest bid received by the NHA for the project was of Rs147 billion.
The ADB covers Rs108bn of the total, with the government of Pakistan funding the remaining balance.
Officials indicate the NHA is in a difficult position regarding fund utilisation. Rebidding is considered unfeasible, as obtaining new approvals from the ADB and Ecnec would take more time, while the ADB stressed that its 2027 deadline is “firm, with no possibility of extension”.
“We seek EAD’s support in assisting NHA to expedite implementation, complete pending procurements, and ensure full utilisation of the loan proceeds within the MFF period,” the ADB stated.
The Ecnec has approved the bids from a joint venture comprising NXCC, Dynamic Constructor and Rustam Associates even though parliamentary committees and the PPRA expressed concerns.
The NHA defended the choice, stating that allegations of non-performance against the lead partner “did not reach finality in accordance with the procedure and rules”, and the firm was never blacklisted by any agency.
The ADB confirmed it has no objection to awarding the contracts to the lowest evaluated bidder across four specific lots:
Lot 1: Rajanpur to Jam­pur (57.5km) for Rs23.5bn; Lot 2: Jampur to Dera Gh­azi Khan (64km) for Rs29.1bn; Lot 3: Dera Ghazi Khan to Tibi Qaisrani (111.7km) for Rs52bn; Lot 4: Tibi Qaisrani to Dera Ismail Khan (96.2km) for Rs42bn.
IHC rejected PPRA’s petition on the Rs172bn Carec Tranch-III award to JV. In its verdict, the court warned that the regulator’s recent decisions “may also lead to the refusal of the finance facility agreed by the ADB,” and declared the petitions infructuous.

PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident.
The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted.
At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage.
The authorities had provided the video clips and the pictures of CM Afridi, former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, and two other PTI leaders, Irfan Saleem and Amir Khan Chamkani, for analysis. None of them had been nominated in the case.
In the report, the PFSA gave its opinion on two points: whether the videos in the USB were genuine and whether the persons whose profile pictures had been shared appeared in the clips. It said the five individuals, including the CM, were seen in the clips, but did not clarify if the videos were related to the Radio Pakistan attack or any other event.
It, however, said the clips were not edited except for the merger of multiple video clips of different camera views.
A legal expert, privy to the case, said the investigating officer, after this ‘evidence’ could nominate more accused through a supplementary report to the ATC. However, the court can also take cognisance of the matter. Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report.
‘Unrelated clips’
Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.
PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned.
The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial.
The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023.
‘Irrefutable evidence’
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report.
Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.

The opposition leader issue is expected to resurface after PTI’s Omar Ayub withdrew his petitions in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal.
Before the petition was withdrawn, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said he couldn’t begin the appointment process as the issue was sub judice.

 

With the summoning of the assembly, Speaker Sadiq is expected to ask the opposition to follow the process for appointing a new leader.
The opposition has repe­atedly accused the government of delaying the appo­intment process and nominated Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Achakzai as the opposition leader.
Rule 39 of the “Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007” confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.
However, the opposition has already submitted the name of Achakzai to the speaker’s office rather than presenting it to the speaker personally.
The rule also states the speaker must verify the signatures of all opposition members voting in favour of the candidate.
Rule 39, titled “Decla­ration of Leader of the Opposition,” states that after each general election — and at any time thereafter — the National Assembly speaker must declare the opposition leader as soon as possible following the election of the prime minister.

• Seeks tariff overhaul to lift exports beyond $60bn in three years
• Highlights cross-cutting barriers across 20 export products
• Notes ‘policy unpredictability’ undermines investor, buyer confidence               
ISLAMABAD: A body constituted by the prime minister and led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal has called for urgent reforms to improve the ease of doing business and for a serious restructuring and rationalisation of tariffs — both energy prices and trade duties — to more than double exports to over $60 billion within three years.
The committee was formed to devise a strategy for avoiding another IMF programme once the current $8.4bn arrangement expires at the end of 2027, amid mounting pressure from persistently weak economic indicators.
According to synopses compiled after week-long consultations with public and private sector stakeholders from Jan 5 to 9, the panel concluded that the current state of affairs was not capable of driving a fast-growing population of 250 million towards sustained prosperity because of cross-cutting constra­ints affecting “all 20 priority export products and six export drivers”.
Ironically, most of these constraints are generally well known, but the government’s inability, despite special interventions here and there, including through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), to create a conducive working environment in a fair, equitable, rule-based and transparent manner, has hampered sustainable growth path beyond stabilisation under a restrictive programme volunteered to the IMF.
The plan proposed easing electricity and gas prices through debt refinancing and rationalising price build-ups. It was found that “export competitiveness is undermined by high and volatile energy costs, with electricity and gas tariffs remaining above regional benchmarks and subject to frequent changes”.
It warned that volatility was inflating production costs across manufacturing, agro-processing, minerals, fisheries, and services, eroding margins and diverting orders to competing countries.
The Planning Commission also pointed out that the cost of doing business in Pakistan remained “structurally high due to fragmented and distortionary taxation, inverted input tariffs, advance income tax deductions, delayed sales tax refunds and persistent working capital lockups”.
It said these issues disproportionately affected exporters and were particularly binding for small and medium enterprises across manufacturing and agri-based value chains.
The panel said that policy unpredictability was also weakening investment and buyer confidence. “Frequent changes in tax policy, energy pricing, tariff structures, export incentives and regulatory regimes, often announced late in the business cycle, constrain forward planning, capacity expansion and scaling, particularly around annual export order booking cycles,” it said.
The synopses also highlighted institutional fragmentation and regulatory burdens. They said inconsistent definitions of SMEs across the State Bank of Pakistan, SMEDA, the Federal Board of Revenue and provincial authorities restricted access to finance, incentives and support schemes. Overlapping mandates, discretionary enforcement, excessive audits and weak inter-agency coordination increased compliance costs and uncertainty, the panel said.
Moreover, exporters also faced weak domestic quality, testing and compliance infrastructure, increasing reliance on overseas laboratories for certification and testing, it said, adding: “This raises costs, lengthens lead times and elevates rejection risks in regulated export markets, constraining movement into higher value products and destinations.”
Limited access to affordable finance was also highlighted as a constraint on upgrading and value addition. The panel said export credit, insurance, guarantees, and long-term financing instruments remained underdeveloped, while high interest rates, collateral requirements, and liquidity constraints curtailed SME investment in technology, compliance, and scaling.
The committee also questioned the implementation of export facilitation and input schemes, including the Export Facilitation Scheme, saying procedural delays, higher input costs and working-capital pressures were limiting effective sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs.
In addition, it cited logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, including high inland freight costs, underutilised rail, port congestion, slow customs clearance, inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and weak courier and postal systems for SMEs.
It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty. It also pointed to skills gaps, low value addition and weak branding as barriers to moving into higher-value segments.
Based on consultations, the Planning Commission is now collecting additional information through a private-sector survey to refine inputs and develop a data-driven, sector-specific technical roadmap to enhance exports under the Uraan Pakistan strategic plan.
“Pakistan’s development, economic sovereignty and even national security now hinge on one thing: how fast we can grow our exports and move to an export-led growth model,” Mr Iqbal said at the conclusion of the consultations.
He added that “the only way to break free from foreign crutches and avoid the next IMF programme is to rapidly increase our exports and build strong foreign exchange reserves”.
The 20 products covered during these engagements included copper, gems and jewellery, software and IT services, fish and fish preparations, rice, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat preparations, guar gum and its products, handicrafts, textile and apparel, sports goods, leather and leather products, surgical instruments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cement, carpets and rugs, engineering goods, footwear, plastic material and cutlery.
Pakistan currently exports about $30-35bn worth of goods, against Planning Commission estimates of an untapped annual potential of over $60bn.
The findings and recommendations will be consolidated into product-wise diagnostics and a targeted facilitation framework for submission to the prime minister. Their implementation would be subject to clearance under the tight requirements of the IMF conditions.
