The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and is one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
“This is an evolving situation and we are monitoring developments closely. We have been in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan at multiple levels,” a US State Department spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.
“The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,” the spokesperson added.
 
 

The State Department spokesperson also said Washington “stands with India and strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Pahalgam”, reiterating comments similar to recent ones made by US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.
In public, the US government has expressed support for India after the attack but has not criticised Pakistan. While Saudi Arabia and Iran have offered to mediate, Trump last week said he was confident that India and Pakistan would “get it figured out”.
India is an increasingly important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence in Asia while Pakistan remains a US ally, even as its importance for Washington has diminished after the 2021 US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and writer for the Foreign Policy magazine, said India is now a much closer US partner than Pakistan.
“This may worry Islamabad that if India retaliates militarily, the US may sympathise with its counterterrorism imperatives and not try to stand in the way,” Kugelman told Reuters.
Kugelman also said that given Washington’s involvement and ongoing diplomatic efforts in Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, the Trump administration is “dealing with a lot on its global plate” and may leave India and Pakistan on their own, at least in the early days of the tensions.
Hussain Haqqani, a former Pakistan ambassador to the US and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, also said that there seemed to be no US appetite to calm the situation at this moment.
“India has a longstanding grievance about terrorism emanating or supported from across [the] border. Pakistan has a longstanding belief that India wants to dismember it. Both work themselves into a frenzy every few years. This time, there is no US interest in calming things down,” Haqqani said.
Ned Price, a former US State Department official under the administration of former president Joe Biden, said that while the Trump administration was giving this issue the sensitivity it deserved, a perception that it would back India at any cost may escalate tensions further.
“The Trump administration has made clear it wishes to deepen the US-India partnership a laudable goal but that it is willing to do so at almost any cost.
“If India feels that the Trump administration will back it to the hilt no matter what, we could be in store for more escalation and more violence between these nuclear-armed neighbours,” Price added.
Tensions escalate as troops continue trading fire
Pakistan and India also exchanged gunfire for a fourth night in a row across their de facto border, the Line of Control (LoC), after four years of relative calm.
“During the night of April 27-28… Pakistan Army posts initiated unprovoked small arms fire across the Line of Control”, the Indian army claimed in a statement.
 
 

There were no reported casualties, and Islamabad did not immediately confirm the gunfire.
India’s defence forces have conducted several military exercises across the country since the attack. Some of these are routine preparedness drills, Reuters quoted a defence official as saying.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.
India on April 23 unilaterally suspended the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — a water-sharing agreement that was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights. The National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad also called on India to “refrain from its reflexive blame game and cynical, staged managed exploitation of incidents like Pahalgam to further its narrow political agenda”.
 
 

On Thursday, Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to pursue the attackers to the “ends of the earth” and said that those who planned and carried out the attack “will be punished beyond their imagination”.
Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said Pakistan was “ready to cooperate” in an international probe into the Pahalgam attack, but also warned of an “all-out war” if India carried out any attack on Pakistan.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.
Hundreds arrested as Indian forces continue crackdown
Meanwhile, security forces have detained around 500 people for questioning after they searched nearly 1,000 houses and forests hunting for the attackers in India-held Kashmir, a local police official told Reuters on Monday.
At least nine houses have been demolished so far, the official added.
Previously, the Kashmir Media Service had put the number of arrests at more than 2,000. It reported that the ancestral homes of seven Kashmiris had been destroyed using explosives by Indian forces in what critics described as “collective punishment”’.
 
 

Political leaders in the state have called for caution to ensure the innocent are not harmed in the government’s actions against terrorism.
“It’s time to … avoid any misplaced action that alienates people. Punish the guilty, show them no mercy but don’t let innocent people become collateral damage,” Omar Abdullah, the territory’s chief minister said on X on Saturday.
Another former chief minister made an appeal to the Indian government “to take care that innocent people are not made to feel the brunt as alienation aids terrorists’ goals of division and fear”.

The sun casts golden shadows over the water as others offload their modest haul from ice boxes.
A small crowd gathers, murmuring with hope, asking for fish to take home. But the replies come tinged with disappointment, echoing in Balochi: “Mahee ady jend nest” (there’s no fish today). Still, a few kaashuk-loojar (sardines) are handed out, small offerings from a sea that gives only just enough. The process takes over an hour, as the sparse catch is finally carted off in qingqi rickshaws to fish trading companies.
As the sun sinks lower, one of the sailors returns to Padi Zer, now seated across Waado Aani Jah — the boat makers’ point — alongside other fishermen sipping their chai ordered from a nearby teashop. The salt still clings to his skin, his clothes still carrying the scent of the sea. You wonder aloud how he’s found the time to return, barely bathed, barely rested. He offers a knowing smile and says:
“I return to remind myself — and my conscience — that we don’t turn to the sea just for a living, we belong to it. No matter the odds and challenges.”
Yet, beyond these shores, new boundaries appear. The same people who have always lived by the sea now find themselves edged out of places they once moved through freely.
 

Where Koh-i-Batil meets the Arabian Sea.

Koh-i-Batil — the heart of Gwadar’s landscape — spans vast across the landscape. From its peak, the entire city stretches out in a breathtaking panorama: sunlit waters, winding roads, the pulse of a city shaped by sea and stone. But today, this landmark is a restricted area. Visitors have to wait, present their IDs, and are often denied access altogether. Even those allowed through are confined to a single section of the mountain.
One can’t help but think: Did the indigenous people of Gwadar ever imagine that “development” would fence them out of their own heritage? Can progress truly uplift a community if it erases their access to the very spaces that gave them meaning?
Enter: CPEC
Gwadar, a dusty city along the arid coastline of the Arabian Sea, has been in the headlines for over a decade as a key player in China’s economic ambitions. Situated in Pakistan’s volatile Balochistan province near the Iranian border, it has been thrust into the spotlight as a key node in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) — a large-scale infrastructure and economic development project initiated by China in 2013. Amid barren deserts and jagged mountains, this remote city is being fantasised as the next big commercial hub, a gateway for Chinese trade and investment into the region.
Home to an indigenous Baloch fishing community, the city is home to approximately 100,000 residents whose lives are still defined by hardship. Electricity is sourced from across the border in Iran, but it’s erratic at best. And while CPEC’s vision has yet to bring tangible change to Gwadar, the city’s struggles don’t end there. More than the economic exclusion, the sea itself, seems to be slipping away. Clean water is scarce and the once-abundant sea now yields little more than scraps, picked over by industrial deep-sea trawlers before reaching local shores.
It’s no secret that Gwadar is reeling from the impact of deep-sea trawling. As fish disappear from its waters, indigenous fisherfolk are left struggling to sustain their way of life.
The 750km coastline of Balochistan — including towns and cities such as Gwadar, Pasni, Ormara, Ganz, Pishukan, Jewani, Surbandan, along with surrounding fishing villages — has long supported communities that lived in harmony with the sea. However, illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) deep-sea trawling has crippled local fish production and inflicted lasting damage on the marine ecosystem.
Saki Baksh, a fisherman from Gwadar, explained the scale of the crisis: “Even 10 days of our hard work at sea can’t match what a single trawler catches in one day.”

Fishing practices: Local fishermen vs deep-sea trawlers
Local fishermen have traditionally followed sustainable fishing practices, aligning their methods with seasonal availability. They adapt their nets based on the type of catch — for example, during the king fish season (September to November), they target only king fish, avoiding other species. The same approach applies to lobsters, shrimps, and other seafood. They mostly use eco-friendly nets with large holes and minimal plastic, allowing vulnerable marine species to escape, thereby preserving the marine ecosystem.
In recent years, however, some local fishermen have begun using harmful gear such as fine plastic mesh nets, small-holed nets, encircling nets, and wire nets — locally known as gujja. These practices pose a serious threat to marine biodiversity and contribute to the depletion of fish production. Hence, such nets are prohibited under the Balochistan Fisheries Ordinance, 1971.
Nako Chakar, an 80-year-old former fisherman, no longer goes to sea but still walks the Gwadar shoreline, listening to the fishermen as they unload their catch. Their conversations tell a different story now — of vanishing fish, changing nets, and a sea no longer as generous.
“When your livelihood depends on something, you treat it with care,” he reflected. “For us, the sea was sacred. I remember waiting for my father’s return with the day’s catch. My sons once waited for me the same way. Now I watch them return frustrated, cursing the trawlers that swept away the fish from their nets.”
“We used to catch fish with ease, each season bringing its own bounty,” he reflected. I would ride a camel to nearby towns to sell our catch. But when the trawlers arrived, we didn’t realise what was coming. We just saw big boats — never imagining they’d end up destroying our coast.“
Local fishermen operate in small, single-engine boats that allow them to navigate carefully without disrupting others or risking collisions. In contrast, deep-sea trawlers — large vessels with around 40 crew members — move at high speeds, often crashing into these smaller boats and causing significant damage.
While local fishermen work 12-hour shifts, trawlers operate around the clock. Equipped with three engines, generators, diesel fuel, and ice storage, they tow massive nets that sweep both surface and deep-sea fish. Their fine-mesh plastic nets, also known as gillnets, trap even the smallest fish, pushing certain species toward extinction.

Unsurprisingly, the actions of deep-sea trawlers have become rather brazen today; they frequently detain, attack, and intimidate local fishermen. On May 28, 2024, an incident in Gwadar saw a trawler crew murder a local fisherman and abduct another. In response, fishing communities and local activists launched protests, blocking major highways. Outraged by the unchecked violence and looting, they decried that deep-sea trawlers operate with impunity under the protection of powerful authorities and remain above the law.
According to one fisherman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, encounters with trawler crews can be dangerous. “They are often armed. If a local boat crosses their path, they don’t hesitate to fire warning shots,” he said.
Aziz Peer Baksh, CEO of Atlantic Seafood Company, a locally owned enterprise in Pasni, also pointed to the destructive practices of large trawlers operating in the region. He said that the trawlers transport their catch to Karachi, where it is processed for export. “They often capture massive bycatches — including turtles, dolphins, sharks, whales, and squid — which they sell to seafood companies at low prices,” he claimed.
According to Baksh, the production of key species such as sardines, Indian mackerel, green mussels, pomfret, mud crabs, sole fish, shrimp, and prawns has plummeted. “This sharp decline has pushed our incomes to the brink of collapse and endangered marine life,” he added. “Local fishermen and sailors who once supplied fish across Balochistan and Karachi are now struggling. The reason is clear: they are bringing in fewer fish than ever before.”
Where does the rest of the world stand?
International legal instruments such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), 1982, United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions (61/105, 64/72, 66/68, 71/123), and international guidelines on fishing by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) call for urgent action to conserve and manage vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) in the high seas.
Moreover, Goal 14 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calls for the sustainable management and protection of marine ecosystems. As a result, several countries, including the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, have either banned or regulated commercial fishing by deep-sea trawlers in vulnerable areas.
Ellie Hooper, an oceans campaigner at the Greenpeace Aotearoa — one of New Zealand’s largest environmental organisations — explained in an article that bottom trawlers use various types of nets indiscriminately, regardless of the fish’s seasonal availability. This approach threatens marine life, as species are caught regardless of their breeding seasons. Trawlers drag large and heavy nets across the sea floor, plowing through biologically rich and diverse ecosystems, crushing corals, sponges, various aquatic species and their habitats as they go.
For this reason, bottom trawling has a large bycatch impact, with many non-target species being fished in the process. The article further stated that “dragging heavy nets across the seabed disturbs marine sediments, which is the world’s largest carbon sink”, highlighting the practice’s significant contribution to climate change.
In 2021, a groundbreaking study published in Nature, an international journal, revealed that fishing boats using heavy nets to trawl the seafloor — often at great depths — release as much carbon dioxide as the entire aviation industry.
Moreover, according to the Second World Ocean Assessment (WOA II), “fishing, especially bottom trawling, constitutes the greatest current threat to seamount ecosystems”.

The official stance
As per the Balochistan Sea Fisheries Ordinance of 1971, the Secretary of Fisheries and Coastal Development has imposed a ban on all types of fishing in Balochistan’s territorial waters from June 1 to July 31 each year, to protect marine life during the breeding season.
Ahmad Nadeem, an official from the Marine Fisheries Department in Balochistan, explained that fishing is strictly prohibited during this period to allow fish populations to breed and replenish. “However, even during this period, many fishermen continue to sneak into the waters, and one month is simply not enough for the sea to recover,” he added.
Overfishing has led to a sharp decline in fish populations, with many fish being caught before reaching maturity. “Like all living creatures, fish need time to grow, but they’re often caught at the larval stage,” he explained.
He noted that fishing practices have drastically changed over time. In the past, small-scale fishermen would spend only three to four hours at sea, while larger boats stayed out for seven to 10 days. Today, smaller boats are staying out for as long as eight hours, with some even making multiple trips within a 24-hour window.
“The pressure to earn quick profits has placed an immense burden on the sea,” he added.
According to him, fishing techniques have also changed significantly, with modern nets featuring smaller mesh sizes and stretching over much longer distances — ranging from five to 30 kilometres (km) — compared to the larger, shorter nets used in the past. He added that previously, fishermen targeted specific species based on season and demand. Today, they catch whatever they can find, driven by market needs. “Every size and type of fish is now bought, further worsening overfishing,” Nadeem said.
“Deep-sea trawlers are to be blamed for the use of fine mesh nets, rampant overfishing, increasing number of boats, destructive fishing techniques, and the disregard for seasonal restrictions. These practices have caused irreversible damage,” the official acknowledged.
Though legal frameworks such as the Sindh Fisheries Ordinance of 1980 and the Balochistan Sea Fisheries Ordinance of 1971 are in place to protect vulnerable marine species — including various types of sharks — their enforcement remains largely ineffective. For instance, the Marine and Fisheries Department in Gwadar confirmed that the Karinj (Mobula) is now extinct, with only 17 recorded sightings between 2021 and 2022. The sawfish has disappeared entirely.

The impact on Gwadar’s fisheries and fisherfolk
Shamsi, a resident of Gwadar, sat cross-legged with a small pile of sardines in her lap. Her trembling, wrinkled hands moved slowly as she cleaned the catch of the day.  “Sardines have lost their shape,” she muttered. “They were always tiny, full of thin, nearly invisible bones — but they had taste. Now, they’re even smaller, and when we fry them, there’s no flavour.”
Her 19-year-old son, Sameer, is a fisherman — one of the many who brave the unpredictable sea each day. “He risks his life out there,” she says, “and comes back with nothing but disappointment and a few measly fish.
Like countless other families along the coast, Shamsi’s household relies on the sea for survival. But as fish stocks shrink, the entire community is at the brink of poverty and hunger. “The fishermen return with empty nets and fading hopes,” she lamented. “Indian mackerel and Hilsa fish — locally known as Palwar — were once plentiful. Now, most of our favourite fish have disappeared. The real culprit is the deep-sea trawlers that are ruthlessly stripping our waters bare.”
Her story mirrors that of Nako Shambay, a fellow coastal dweller grappling with a similar struggle. For over 45 years, he has navigated the waters off Gwadar’s coast. As a seasoned sailor, he’s faced fierce winds and the unforgiving pull of the sea. “There were days I thought I wouldn’t make it back,” he reflected. “The reality of this life is that it’s harsh, unyielding, but the only source of income we’ve known.”
Shambay recalled his childhood, casting nets beside his father who steered the boat. “Back then, Hilsa fish were so plentiful that even children could catch them with bare hands. As the years have passed, I have gone from being a fisherman to a boat nahuda (sailor) but there’s no trace of Palwar anymore.”
He claimed that the growing number of deep-sea trawlers over time has pushed several marine species to the brink of extinction. Among those that have disappeared are the Pishik (a small shark), Soli (sole fish), Gallow (sea catfish), Soro (king soldier bream), and various shark species.
“I remember when sharks were always around,” the sailor added. “Sometimes they tore through our fishing gear. But we never hunted them — our elders taught us to respect and protect certain sea creatures. Now, even those are gone. What we see instead are massive trawlers, wrecking our boats and emptying the sea.”
Another fisherman Chakar reminisced about a simpler time when fishing was more than just an industry. “We fished according to the time of the day. We would leave at shab rech (night) and return in the morning, relaxed and content. Life was tough, but the sea was alive. We fished to feed our families, not for profit. Now, the sea feels empty.”
“Today, Palwar, Garme pagas, Kail, Guthol, Warok, Gorchok, and Kalgon are rarely seen. It’s been over 15 years since I last saw a Soleeg. Even Kir is so scarce now that catching one is considered a stroke of luck,” he added.
Deep-sea trawlers from Karachi and other parts of Sindh routinely encroach upon the Makran coast, despite not being local to the region. Their activities are not only unwelcome but also illegal. By law, they are prohibited from operating within 12 nautical miles of a country’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and larger vessels must remain at least 35 miles from the shoreline. Yet, these regulations are routinely flouted.
“There is an entire chain of officials who take bribes from the trawler mafia, turning a blind eye to these violations,” said KB Firaq, a Baloch educator and social activist from Gwadar. “Anyone standing on the shore can see trawlers openly fishing in Gwadar’s waters.”
A local fish trader Rasheed from Pasni echoed this concern, alleging that the Fisheries Department receives substantial bribes from deep-sea trawler operators, which is why they are able to operate freely without any restrictions.
Nadeem, director of the said department, acknowledged that while the department is large and it’s possible that some individuals may be involved in corrupt practices, there is no confirmed evidence to support such claims.
He further elaborated on the difficulties in enforcing fishing regulations, particularly when it comes to monitoring vast stretches of the sea. “The sea is huge — it can’t be monitored like a road. By the time we receive information and reach the spot, the deep-sea trawlers have usually fled. In today’s social media age, fishermen often post videos online instead of informing local fisheries coordinators, which delays our response. These posts sometimes alert the trawler operators as well, giving them time to escape. If we’re properly informed and fail to act, we can be held accountable,” he stated.
His words, however, hold little solace for Nahuda Khuda Dost Wajo, a sailor and president of the Mahigeer Ittehad — which fights for the fisherfolk’s rights. “The trawlers have already destroyed other seas, and now they are doing the same to ours. At this rate, we’ll have no catch left in two years.”
The impact of overfishing has also changed the economics of the industry. The value of fish — once determined by size, weight, and shine — has diminished. “Fish don’t get a chance to grow or mature anymore. Their size has shrunk, their luster has faded,” Wajo lamented.

Local grievances unheard
According to Wajo, the issue of deep-sea trawling is not new — it is a longstanding problem that continues to threaten Balochistan’s coastal communities and marine ecosystem. “In the past, international deep-sea trawlers respected the boundary,” he stated.
Hafeez Kiazai, General Secretary of Haq Do Tehreek (HDT), noted a turning point when both the Sindh and Balochistan governments began issuing licenses to Pakistani trawlers from Sindh. These vessels started encroaching into Balochistan’s territorial waters, violating the ordinance and exacerbating tensions with local fishing communities.
“When the government realised the lucrative potential of trawling, they prioritised revenue over regulation,” Kiazai alleged. “They began accepting money from trawler owners and expanded their access to the sea.”
As frustration mounted, local communities began to resist. Between 2005 and 2006, a grassroot movement called Trawler Bhagao, Choola Jalao (remove trawlers, light your stoves) emerged in protest but failed to halt illegal trawling, which has continued unchecked till date, added Khuda Dost.
The latest wave of protests began in Gwadar and has since spread to Lasbela district, underscoring the growing anger and desperation among coastal residents.
Kiazai blamed the inefficiency of the Balochistan Fisheries Department for the ongoing crisis. “The department has never taken effective action against trawlers. When a vessel is seized, its catch is sold off, but the trawler is often returned to its owners after legal action. There’s no deterrence — trawling just continues,” he explained. “Why, then, should the government even issue licenses for these larger boats to exploit the province’s waters?”
Khuda Dost voiced a deeper concern: “The law forbids trawlers from entering the 12 nautical mile zone, but our demand goes beyond that. We oppose all forms of trawling. If there is nothing left in the sea, there is nothing for the people living near it.”

The way an animated Mohammad Amir trapped Zalmi captain Babar Azam in front of the wicket as his team looked to chase 179, showed how well prepared Gladiators were for the game. If their top five batters made useful contributions, their fast bowlers, particularly Faheem Ashraf (5-33), were spot on.
The win lifted Gladia­tors, who recorded their second consecutive win of this PSL season, to third in the six-team league while Zalmi slid to fifth spot.
 


Saim Ayub’s cracking shot over cover on the very first ball of the opening over bowled by Amir signalled that Zalmi were ready and positive for the challenge. However, that was not to be.
Saim (five) was caught by wicket-keeper Kusal Men­­dis off fast bowler Faheem Ashraf in the second over as the batter tried unsuccessfully to play a fast rising delivery. Zalmi were 17-1.
Babar’s departure in the next over delivered by Amir proved a massive setback for Zalmi. The former Pakistan captain failed to negotiate a typical swinging ball from the left-armer that came in sharply. The batter opted for DRS that showed ball would have hit top of middle-stump.
When pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr disturbed the timber behind Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who missed the line of the delivery while trying to play through the onside, it made 33-3 in the fifth over. Mohammad Haris started his cameo with a six on the very first ball he faced from Amir.
A dismal 41-3 at the end of powerplay asked for a solid rescue mission by Zalmi that never came as they kept losing wickets.
Faheem jolted Zalmi further with a double strike in the eighth over.
First, he induced Haris (17 off 16) to hole out to Rilee Rossouw at long-on and two balls later forced Abdul Samad (two) to get a very faint edge as Mendis took another catch to leave Zalmi tottering at 50-5.
After reaching 76-5 in 10 overs Zalmi needed a significant boost. Though Hussain Talat and Mitchel Owen (15 off eight) added 31 off 18 balls to give their team some hope but those were ended by fast bowler Khurram Shahzad with a double blow in the 11th.
Owen was caught nicely by Wasim at sweeper cover and when Khurram on his very next ball sent Alzarri Joseph, caught down the leg-side by Mendis, back to the pavilion, a big defeat started staring Zalmi in the face. They were now 81-7.
Luke Wood (eight) hit Fah­eem for a six  in the 12th over but the batter was und­one on the very next ball.
Hussian Talat, who made a 34-ball 39, was the ninth wicket to fall, as the left-hander was caught by Rossouw off spinner Abrar Ahmed in the 15th over.
Sufyan Muqeem became Faheem’s fifth victim in the next over when Ros­souw took his fourth catch of the innings.
Khurram took 2-9 in his three overs while Amir claimed 1-18 and Wasim 1-21 in three.
Earlier, captain Saud Shakeel and Finn Allen gave Gladiators a brisk start of 46 in 4.2 overs after Zalmi invited them to bat first before the latter misjudged a short ball outside off and was caught by Saim at point off Joseph. Allen made 31 off 16 with four fours and a couple of sixes.
Incoming Rossouw (27 off 18) kept the momentum going alongside Saud as the former cracked four fours in the sixth over bowled by pacer Ali Raza to help Gladiators end the powerplay at 67-1. Rossouw, was cleaned up by Saim in the 10th over as Gladiators were now 91-2. Gladiators reached 100 in 10.2 overs.
Saud’s innings (32 off 26, five fours) was ended by Saim in the 12th over as the southpaw played a slog sweep only to be caught by Samad just inside the mid-wicket boundary. The scoreboard now read 105-3.
Mendis smashed five boundaries in his 27-ball 32 before he was caught by Haris off Joseph.
Ali’s last over, 18th of the innings, produced 17 runs for Gladiators, who in the process reached 150 in 17.3 overs, as Mark Chapman (33) collected three fours.
Faheem (one) skied a short-pitched delivery from Joseph who himself took the catch. Hasan Nawaz (eight), after being hit by a Joseph bouncer, struck him for a six. He was eventually run out in the last over bowled by pacer Wood after a mix-up with Chap­man.
Wood dismissed Chap­man who, trying to play a big shot, was caught by Owen nicely at long-on as Gladiators lost their seventh wicket at 173.
Saim gave away only 24 runs for his two wickets while Joseph claimed three wickets for 33 in his four overs. Ali conceded 48 without a wicket while left-arm wrist spinner Sufiyan remained wicket-less for 33.

The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed by 941.79 points, or 0.82 per cent, to stand at 116,411.13 from the previous close of 115,469.34 at 10:05am.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Stronger-than-expected corporate results from heavyweight companies fuelled a surge in the index at the opening.”
“Meanwhile, the absence of further escalation in tensions between Pakistan and India helped prevent panic selling in the KSE-100,” he added.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted that the country’s monthly current account remained “in a comfortable position”, in addition to corporations “posting strong profits”.
In other positive developments, Farooq added that inflation was at a record low, and the real effective exchange rate (REER) stood at 101.
“The market opened slightly higher today, supported by relief that no major escalation occurred between India and Pakistan over the weekend [following the Pahalgam attack],” he added.
“With most market participants expecting interest rate cuts ahead, there is potential for a rerating of the market’s PE [price-to-earning] multiple,” he said.
“However, a significant upward move will likely require de-escalation between India and Pakistan.”
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, also attributed the positive momentum to “dust settling down” between Pakistan and India after the Pahalgam attack, with  “no major incidents” supporting market recovery.
Last week, the April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations had unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
AKD Securities noted that the market had remained volatile last week due to escalating geopolitical tensions following the Pahalgam attack, and India’s subsequent suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan in the aftermath of the incident, undermining investor sentiment.</p><small>2025-04-28 06:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602174-pm-summons-cci-meeting-today-on-sindhs-request-as-protests-persist' target='_blank'><strong>PM summons CCI meeting today on Sindh's request as protests persist</strong></a><br><p>

Previously, the military-backed Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI) had become a political flashpoint, with protests escalating across Sindh.  
Critics have warned that the canal projects threaten ecological stability, violate interprovincial water agreements, and risk displacing communities, all without sufficient consultation or safeguards. It is not only the farmers and the people who are affected; it affects all living creatures associated. 
“This is not a people-centred initiative. It’s a for-profit scheme for cash crop irrigation,” says Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Jr., an environmental activist. He emphasised that when river water stops reaching the sea, it breaks the hydrological cycle. “We are the birds and trees. We depend on the land being affected.”
Environmentalists argue the Indus ecosystem has already been pushed to the brink. “We’ve destroyed natural habitats across the Indus Basin,” says Adil Mansoor, a researcher in farm economics. “The floods of 2010 and 2022 showed us that the cultivation of riverine and belt areas has severely obstructed natural water flow.”

‘The capital outlay and recurring operational costs are prohibitive — without sustained subsidies, the Cholistan canal project is unlikely to remain viable’

The GPI, a multi-billion dollar national programme, aims to cultivate desert land by irrigating state-owned wastelands through new canal infrastructure. The plan spans multiple provinces, including the Cholistan Canal in Punjab, Chashma Right Bank Canal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kachhi Canal in Balochistan, and Thar and Rainee Canals in Sindh. In theory, it promises reduced food imports, increased exports, and job creation in underdeveloped regions.
Defending the project, Major-General (retd) Shahid Nazir, Director General of GPI, framed the initiative as a national necessity in the face of rapid population growth and intensifying climate stress. “Our top priority is to produce enough wheat domestically,” he says, adding that the project also aims to boost cotton-based textile exports from over $20 billion to between $25-35bn.
Mr Nazir outlined additional goals such as reducing the $5.5bn edible oil import bill by cultivating canola, sunflower, and maise; increasing livestock production for Gulf markets; and launching community-led honeybee, trout, and sheep farming projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan. “Once crops reach the market, the exportable surplus will further benefit the economy,” he said.
He also insisted the project avoids displacing small farmers. “We are cultivating state-owned wastelands, not private farms. Provinces will retain land ownership,” he said, clarifying that the Green Corporate Initiative, registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, will manage operations. 
Land allocations include 811,000 acres in Punjab, 52,000 in Sindh, and 26,000 in Balochistan, with 170,000 acres already under cultivation. “Ninety-nine per cent of partner firms are locally owned,” he added, rejecting speculation about foreign takeovers. “Agreements have already been signed with Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan,” Mr Nazir said. “Others, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, are in process.”
However, concerns persist that such large-scale desert farming requires continuous subsidies to remain viable, an approach that has only succeeded in places like Saudi Arabia and Egypt under heavy state investment. “It may be technically executable on paper, but it is economically unsound,” says Mr Mansoor. “The capital outlay and recurring operational costs are prohibitive. Without sustained subsidies, the project is unlikely to remain viable.”
Mr Mansoor added that the Cholistan region receives minimal rainfall and that its historical rivers, Sutlej, Jhelum, and Beas, were already diverted under the Indus Waters Treaty. “This project involves lifting and channelling water from the Indus, most likely the Chenab, over 300-400km into Cholistan.”
Dismissing these notions, however, Mr Nazi said these canals would draw directly from the Indus. “There is no canal drawing water from the Indus River for these projects,” he says. “The Cholistan Canal will originate from the Salwan Headworks, built on a river carrying about 300,000 acre-feet of excess monsoon water from India, which otherwise often causes flooding and devastation in Sindh.”
Although Mr Mansoor acknowledged that the project’s request for one million acre-feet (MAF) is relatively modest compared to Pakistan’s annual 100 MAF allocation, he cautioned: “Once cultivation begins, deserts may demand more water than anticipated. Without structural safeguards, water might be redirected to politically or economically prioritised projects, undermining lower riparian protection.”
Mr Bhutto pointed to declining glacier formation and rainfall since the construction of the Tarbela and Kotri Dams in the 1970s. “Even Mangla Dam, so far upstream in Kashmir, has reached dead levels. If we don’t have water that far north, how can we expect to divert water to Cholistan and still have enough left for Sindh?”
A spokesperson for the Sindh government, Mustafa Baloch claims that in 2023–24 alone, Sindh experienced a 40pc water shortage, a continuation of a decades-long pattern. Historical data shows that from 1999 to 2023, Sindh suffered a 19.4pc water deficit compared to Punjab’s 13.7pc. Meanwhile, environmentalists argue that letting river water flow into the sea is essential, not wasteful. “When river water reaches the sea, it creates fertile coastal lands,” Mr Bhutto said. “Egypt’s Nile Delta is more agriculturally productive because fresh river water pushes seawater back, creating suitable conditions for multiple crops year-round.”
Yet historical mistrust continues to cloud federal-provincial relations. Activists argue that decisions are being made without consultation or transparency. “There’s no clarity on who the experts are or how decisions are being made. If experts were consulted, we don’t know who they are,” said Mr Bhutto.
Even within provinces, inequality persists. “Tail-end farmers in Sindh suffer far more than landlords at the canal heads,” says Mr Mansoor. “There may be enough water in the system — it’s the distribution that’s unequal. But it’s easier to blame ‘the other’: at the national level, that’s India; at the provincial level, it’s Punjab.”

Senior PPP leaders Nasir Shah, Saeed Ghani, Waqar Mehdi, Sohail Siyal and others arrived at the temporary headquarters of the MQM-P in Bahadurabad.
During the meeting, both sides discussed political cooperation, urban development issues in Karachi and future coordination between the two parties.
The session was marked by an atmosphere of goodwill with leaders on both sides recognising the importance of continued dialogue.

Nasir Shah-led delegation visits MQM-P headquarters

Later, speaking to the media after the meeting, PPP’s Nasir Shah confirmed that the party leadership had sought support for Mr Mehdi for the Senate seat that fell vacant after the death of senior PPP leader Taj Haider.
“We are thankful to MQM for their cooperation, especially on the canal issue,” he said. “We are hopeful that MQM will support our candidate in the upcoming by-election.”
MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar emphasised the need for continued political engagement. “Politics is all about dialogue. PPP is our ally in the federal government, and we were also partners during the PDM-led government,” he said.
“There should be flexibility in our approach, and we must move discussions forward,” he said.
Dr Sattar also highlighted the need to revisit the past agreements between the PPP and the MQM.
He stressed the importance of continued informal dialogue on key issues such as water scarcity, constitutional amendments and the local government act. “Karachi’s issues require collective focus, and we must sit together regularly to find solutions,” he said.
He told reporters that the MQM-P filed nominations of Nighat Shakeel and Mujahid Baig for the Senate by-election. “We have received a formal request from the PPP. Our central committee, under the leadership of Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, will deliberate and finalise this matter,” he said.
To a question, Nasir Shah said: “If the decision regarding the six canals project on the Indus River is not reversed at the May 2 meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI), the PPP will consider parting ways with the federal government.”
“We are not in the coalition with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz by choice, but out of necessity for the sake of Pakistan. The  canals issue is highly sensitive and that the party cannot back down on this matter,” he said.
He reiterated that PPP had always advocated for development and cooperation. He acknowledged the visible progress in development work.
He also thanked MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal for acknowledging that Karachi received federal funding during Asif Ali Zardari’s tenure. “This meeting is a gesture of goodwill and a step toward strengthening ties between our two parties,” he said.

• Tarar accuses New Delhi of sponsoring the attack
LONDON: As tensions between Pakistan and India rise in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Pakistani diaspora protesters came face to face with their Indian counterparts outside the missions of both countries in central London, over the weekend.
The scenes outside the Pakistan High Commission in Lowndes Square, Belgravia, on Saturday and the Indian High Commission in Aldwych on Sunday showed that emotions are running high, with both sides chanting derogatory slogans and making offensive gestures against each other.
Met Police confirmed in a statement that officers were called at 5:03am on Sunday to reports of a man smashing windows at the Pakistani High Commission and that a 41-year-old man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of criminal damage and remains in custody. Eyewitnesses said eggs and saffron dye were also thrown at the embassy walls.
On Sunday, a handful of Pakistani protesters countered a sizeable number of Indian protesters, who were also joined by pro-Israel protesters who chanted anti-Pakistan slogans.
 
 

Outside the Pakistan mission, Pakistani protesters set up a chai stall in reference to the viral line by Indian pilot Abhinandan, who in 2019 was held captive by the Pakistan army when his plane was shot down inside Pakistani territory and later repatriated. One gentleman stood on the balcony of the Pakistan mission and waved a cup of tea.
One eyewitness said that a pro-BJP group decided to initiate the anti-Pakistan protest outside the Pakistan mission, calling on scores of protesters. To counter the protest, PML-N’s UK chapter staged a counter-protest and used a sound system to drown out the anti-Pakistan slogans.
At both protests, Met Police officers stood forming a protective line between the two sides as anger and derogatory slogans were chanted. Indian protesters carried “I am Hindu” placards and waved empty water bottles, saying “do you want water”, referring to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.
Music was also blared by both sides, with the Pakistani protesters saying “Pak Fauj Zindabad” and “ISI Zindabad”. Anti-Modi and anti-Hindu slogans were also shouted, with Palestine flags and Pakistan flags waved together.
A pro-India protester was detained after making rude gestures and reportedly making racist comments. Indian protesters claimed that Met Police officers were being racist and that they pushed the protester “without listening”, adding that no one was arrested.
One Indian protester said the Met Police sides with Pakistan during the protests. Another said, “They have challenged Modi openly, now they will see the consequences.”
‘India responsible for attack’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar has accused India of being responsible for the attack on the Pakistan High Commission in London.
Speaking to reporters about the Pahalgam incident in Islamabad, Mr Tarar accused India of using its “extremist ideology” to encourage people to attack Pakistan’s foreign missions.
“A very unfortunate incident took place in London. Our high commission was attacked twice, and stones were thrown,” the minister said. “The people who are responsible are being sponsored by Indian agencies and the Indian state.”
Mr Tarar said that suspects had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police but highlighted that the incident was a product of the “kind of mindset that the Indian state has”.

At a time when external pressures threaten to compromise access to shared water resources, domestic discord, such as the infighting over the Cholistan canal project, only deepened Pakistan’s vulnerability. The nation can ill afford to be divided over water policy when the very lifeline of its people is at stake as a matter of national survival.
It’s a welcome relief that, following the meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto, the government has paused canal construction pending consensus in the Council of Common Interests (CCI).
The Cholistan canal project sparked an unnecessary political row, distracting from Pakistan’s real existential threats: a looming water crisis, crumbling irrigation systems, and escalating climate change. Ironically, experts question the logic of building canals in a desert — an impractical and unsustainable venture.

A slew of measures costing a fraction of mega‑canal budgets can be implemented immediately and unite provinces

The federal government agreed to open talks with the PPP over the contentious Cholistan canal project after tensions within the ruling coalition came to a breaking point. What began as a technical debate morphed into a political standoff, with Pakistan emerging as the ultimate casualty. 
Launched under the Green Pakistan Initiative in early 2025, the project relies on sporadic floodwaters while overlooking Sindh’s chronic water shortages, evident in Kotri Barrage’s declining average flows (14.035 million acre-feet [MAF] vs 26.807 MAF pre-1999). As of March 13, Tarbela’s reservoir was barely above dead level, and the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) has warned of up to a 35 per cent water shortfall in the final stretch of the Rabi season.
Sindh’s leadership accused the federal government of unilaterally undermining the 1991 Water Apportionment Accord. In response, PMLN leaders invoked Punjab’s traditional role as the federation’s “elder brother,” offering vague assurances that all “technical hurdles” will be “addressed and removed.” 
Yet by bypassing the Council of Common Interests, the federal leadership only intensified provincial distrust. When the Cholistan canal was inaugurated, few anticipated the risk that it could fracture Pakistan’s delicate federal balance. Within weeks, the Sindh Assembly passed a unanimous resolution condemning the project for violating the Water Accord and endangering Sindh’s lifeblood. 

While political actors clash, Pakistan as a nation is losing ground in the most existential battle of our times — water security

Bilawal BhuttoZardari has threatened to withdraw PPP support from the federal coalition. PTI MNAs joined Sindh’s protest with a National Assembly resolution as highways were blockaded, courts boycotted, and Sindh’s commerce halted.
Rather than convene the CCI — the constitutional forum for interprovincial disputes — the federal government opted for an Irsa certificate in January 2024, approved by a 4:1 majority that excluded Sindh’s dissenting member. The Sindh High Court has asked the federal government to appoint a federal member from Sindh in the Irsa, after a petition was filed in the court that appointments made to the Irsa were not being made in accordance with the law. 
However, Prime Minister’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah dismissed objections as mere “technical issues” to be “addressed and removed,” while Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari chided critics, insisting “Punjab has always played the role of an ‘elder brother’ and has never been unjust”. Such brinkmanship has politicised a vital watersharing question, turning what should be a policy dialogue into constitutional brinksmanship.
While political actors clash, Pakistan as a nation is losing ground in the most existential battle of our times — water security. Classified among the countries facing extremely high water stress, Pakistan withdraws more than 60pc of its available resources annually, far exceeding sustainable thresholds. A UNWater report places Central and Southern Asia, home to Pakistan, among regions with water stress above 25pc. The Global Climate Risk Index ranks Pakistan as the world’s fifth most climatevulnerable country, warning that rising temperatures and erratic monsoons threaten agriculture, livelihoods, and coastal communities.
Pakistan’s irrigation network — the world’s largest contiguous system of canals — loses an estimated 30–40pc of diverted water to seepage and evaporation due to poor maintenance and silting. The dilapidated minor canals forced farmers to rely on costly tubewells, deepening rural poverty, by increasing financial burdens on smallholders and exacerbating environmental issues like groundwater depletion. Yet the government’s focus is on grand new projects rather than rehabilitating existing infrastructure.
Pakistan has witnessed increasingly severe floods, prolonged droughts, and retreating glaciers. The 2022 floods affected 33m people, underscoring the increasing severity of climate change and the need for resilient solutions. By prioritising a contentious canal project, the federal government has not only alienated Sindh but also squandered political capital that could have tackled systemic issues as discussed below.
Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation can cut water use by up to 60pc while boosting yields, and it is ripe for rapid scaleup in both Punjab and Sindh.
Canal Lining and Desilting of the centuryold network could recover over 30pc of conveyance losses, improving downstream equity without new diversions.
Rainwater Harvesting and Groundwater Recharge through tubewells and recharge wells in Cholistan can sustain local communities and wildlife, reducing stress on river flows.
Biosaline Agriculture of salttolerant crops provides livelihoods on marginal lands without tapping fresh water, offering a sustainable alternative to desert irrigation.
These measures cost a fraction of megacanal budgets, can be implemented immediately, and unite rather than divide provinces.
The canal standoff has frayed trust across Pakistan. Some fret that a PPP withdrawal could topple the coalition, although others believe that the PPP would never rock the boat and go against the establishment. With the next general elections on their minds, both PMLN and PPP have treated the canal issue as a question of political survival rather than a critical national issue.
Ultimately, Pakistan’s real defeat lies in neglecting its water future. By turning the Cholistan canal into a political football, leaders have been distracted from systemic weaknesses — acute water stress, crumbling infrastructure, and a warming climate that imperils every citizen. If Pakistan hopes to stave off ecological and social collapse, it must abandon divisive megaprojects in favour of consensusdriven, sciencebased water management. 
Only through transparent interprovincial dialogue, strict adherence to the 1991 Water Acc­ord, and rapid deployment of lowcost, highimpact solutions prepared by experts and scientists can the Indus remain our shared lifeline — and Pakistan emerge as the true winner of its most urgent challenge.

The FIR accused Ms Haider of attempting to “create anxiety in the society” and “weaken the state” through the spread of misinformation.
Ms Haider, while confirming the FIR, rejected the allegations levelled against her and said she has been facing harassment since 2018 for raising her voice for human rights.
According to Ms Haider, she criticised the arrest of Dr Baloch and pointed out her organisation — BYC — has not been banned.

A senior official told Dawn that Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — a subsidiary of the power division — had been in contact with Punjab’s energy department for completion of formalities to file tariff reduction applications before the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
He said the CPPA management to the government that the case for approval of revised tariffs with Punjab’s two plants was included in the agenda of the provincial cabinet well before Eidul Fitr. “The CPPA has reported that approval from the Punjab cabinet has not come through as of April 25, despite reminders,” the official said.
Punjab government’s two LNG-based plants at Bhikki and Trimmu are among the most efficient plants with plant efficiency beyond 61pc. The 1,180MW Bhikki plant had come into operation in 2018 and its remaining 18-year term expires in 2043 while the 1,262MW Trimmu plant that started commercial operations in May 2023 can continue to operate till 2048.

The official said the power division and PM office had conveyed their displeasure to the CPPA for the ongoing delays and had also taken up with the provincial government for early clearance.

He said the task force on power producers had concluded the revised terms with all the four LNG-based plants — two plants belonging to federal and provincial governments each — about two months ago.
The centre had not only secured federal cabinet approvals but also filed tariff reduction petitions with Nepra that had already conducted public hearing last week. The federal government had expected that regulatory process for all four similar plants to conclude simultaneously if not jointly. However, the provincial approvals are still not available.
The sources said the combined savings from Bhikki and Trimmu was estimated at about Rs596bn over their remaining useful life of 18 and 23 years, respectively. The change in terms of their contracts included a ‘hybrid take-and-pay’ model instead of existing ‘take-or-pay’ model, reduction in rate of return and a cap on dollar indexation at Rs168.
The government claims a total of Rs2.162 trillion savings from six government-owned power plants which also include two above projects of the provincial government. It claims Rs1.567tr savings from four federal projects with a cumulative capacity of about 3,700MW — two LNG-based project at Balloki and Haveli Bahadurshah of around 1,220MW each, 747MW Guddu power project and 510MW Nandipur power project.
 
 

Following revised agreements secured by the taskforce, Nepra announced that it had decided to discontinue dollar-based indexations for these plants, transitioning instead to rupee-based indexations fixed for the entire useful life of the power projects.
“This strategic revision aims to curb foreign exchange exposure and reduce tariff volatility for consumers,” it said, adding that it also capped the indexation for Operations & Maintenance (O&M) costs to 70pc of rupee devaluation, down from the previous 100pc.
Additionally, the return on equity (ROE) structure has been rationalised and the plants will now receive 35pc of the ROE as fixed, with the remaining 65pc linked directly to the actual operation of the plant.
The revised O&M shall be indexed quarterly.
Under the deal, the applicants agreed to implement a ‘hybrid take-and-pay model’, whereby tariff payment to the company shall be made by the CPPA as follows: “from the effective date, prorated for remaining period of the current agreement year, and thereafter for every agreement year, the company will be entitled to 35pc of revised RoE components of tariff as part of CPP.
From the effective date, in case the despatched and delivered Net Electrical Output (NEO) of the company exceeds 35pc of the total contract capacity in terms of kWh, the company will be entitled to receive RoE components of tariff, which shall be calculated on the actual NEO exceeding 35pc of the total contract capacity in terms of kWh and the company shall claim the differential CPP accordingly.
The government claims about Rs3.5tr savings through revised power purchase agreements with 29 IPPs and GPPs over remaining useful life.

The incident occurred around 8pm local time as the Lapu Lapu Day Block Party, attended by 100,000, was wrapping up. Police said a 30-year-old man from Vancouver, known to police in prior contexts, was arrested at the scene after being apprehended by bystanders.
Authorities said the suspect drove a black SUV through a bustling section of the festival, striking numerous people before coming to a stop. Interim Police Chief Steve Rai said victims were transported to multiple hospitals, but refrained from speculating on the final injury count, citing respect for the families and the investigation.
Police said “at this time” they are confident this was not an act of terrorism and that the major crime section is leading the investigation.
Eyewitnesses described scenes of chaos as the vehicle barrelled through food stalls and vendor tents.
Videos circulated online showed emergency crews attempting resuscitation efforts on multiple victims, while debris and personal belongings lay scattered across the street.
Among the dead was at least one child, according to initial police reports. The driver’s motivations remain unclear.
Vancouver Mayor Ken Sim said he was “shocked and deeply saddened” by the tragedy.

The arrests were carried out across  multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian, and Kulgam, according to the Kashmir Media Service.
In the Islamabad district of held-Kashmir alone, cordon-and-search operations and house raids resulted in the arrest of over 175 people. The detainees have been transferred to police stations and army camps.
A police spokesperson said that 175 individuals had been detained during house raids and search operations across various areas of the district, adding that additional checkpoints had been set up and patrolling had been intensified, particularly in densely forested regions.

More than 2,000 people picked up, shifted to police stations, army camps

Following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, Indian troops and paramilitary forces escalated operations across the valley, carrying out widespread house raids and arbitrary arrests.
 
 

Indian forces have also launched a campaign of demolishing the homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris. Since Saturday, the ancestral homes of seven  Kashmiris have been destroyed using explosives by Indian forces, the Kashmir Media Service reported.
On the other hand, the houses of five more Kashmiris were demolished in what critics described as ‘collective punishment’.
The demolished houses belonged to the families of Amir Nazeer Wani, Jameel Ahmad Sher Gojri, Adnan Safi Dar, Amir Ahmed and Farooq Ahmad Tedwa. High-intensity explosives caused extensive damage to surrounding homes, leaving dozens of families homeless and in distress.
Critics accuse Indian authorities of mimicking Israeli tactics of occupation and dispossession to render Kashmiris homeless and break their resistance to Indian rule.
Abdul Rashid Minhas, a spokesman for the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), condemned the demolitions and arrests in a statement issued in Srinagar.

Speaking at a news conference, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Moha­mmed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani reported “a bit of progress”, in response to questions about reports of a meeting in Doha between Israel’s Mossad spy agency chief David Barnea and the Qatari prime minister.
“We need to find an answer for the ultimate question: how to end this war.
That’s, that’s basically, I think, the key point of the entire negotiations,“ Sheikh Mohammed added.
Qatar, alongside Egypt and the United States, brokered a truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza which came into effect on January 19 but which did not bring a complete end to the war.
 



Toll surpasses 52,000 after the deaths of nearly 700 ‘missing’ Palestinians confirmed

The initial phase of the truce ended in early March, with the two sides unable to agree on the next steps. Israel resumed air and ground attacks across the Gaza Strip on March 18 after earlier halting the entry of aid.
Sheikh Mohammed met Barnea in the Qatari capital to discuss a potential prisoner deal on Thursday, according to Israeli media.
“The meeting that took place on Thursday is part of these efforts where we’re trying to find a breakthrough,” the Qatari prime minister said without further elaborating on the details of the meeting.
Hamas is open to an agreement to end the war in Gaza that would see all Israeli prisoners released and secure a five-year truce, an official said on Saturday as the group’s negotiators met in Cairo.
The Qatari PM said efforts were focused on the “best comprehensive deal possible that ends the war, brings the Israeli prisoners out and not dividing (a deal) into other phases.” Hamas has insisted that the negotiations should lead to a permanent end to the war.
According to the Palestinian group, it rejected an earlier Israeli offer that included a 45-day ceasefire in exchange for the return of 10 living prisoners.
50 more killed in a day
According to Al Jazeera, the number of Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks since Sunday dawn across Gaza rose to at least 50 Palestinians.
The Palestinian health ministry announced on Sunday that the death toll from the war had risen to more than 52,000 people, after hundreds previously listed as missing were confirmed dead.
“An additional 697 martyrs have been added to the cumulative statistics after their data was completed and verified by the committee monitoring missing persons,” the health ministry said in a statement, giving the overall death toll of 52,243.
Several United Nations agencies that operate in Gaza have said the ministry’s data is credible.
One hospital in the Palestinian territory confirmed the data and elaborated on the process.
“The families of those initially reported missing had informed authorities of their disappearance, but their bodies were subsequently recovered — either from beneath the rubble or from areas previously inaccessible to medical teams due to the presence of the Israeli army,” said Khalil al-Daqran, spokesman for Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital.

Most headed home with more questions than answers.
Many participants in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Spring Meetings had a sense that Trump’s administration was still conflicted in its demands from trading partners hit with his sweeping tariffs.
During the whirlwind week, many finance and trade ministers sought to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other key Trump administration officials, to no avail.

Foreboding persists as financial leaders unable to meet Trump admin officials

Those that did were often told to be patient — even as the clock steadily ticks down on the 90-day pause Trump had granted on the steepest levies.
“We know that they think — that it won’t be that bad,” said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski.
“They think it’s a short-term pain, long-term gain. And I’m afraid that we’ll have short-term pain, long-term pain.”
 
 

The Trump administration’s most substantial trade negotiations during the week were with Japan and South Korea, but the results were inconclusive as Bessent cited “productive” talks with both countries.
The IMF took a slightly more optimistic view of the economic fallout from the US tariffs, slashing growth forecasts for most countries in its World Economic Outlook but stopping far short of predicting recessions — even for the US and export-dependent China.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva acknowledged that member countries were anxious about the uncertainty shock to a global economy buffeted by pandemic, inflation and wars but held out hope that trade negotiations would ease the tariff strains.
Several finance officials told Reuters that odds of recession were higher than the IMF’s 37 per cent chance, citing private sector forecasts.
Debt risk rises
Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a faith-based nonprofit group advocating debt relief, said that the IMF’s forecasts were clearly aimed at preventing market panic, even as officials in private meetings expressed concerns about new debt crises emerging.
“It was a do-nothing kind of week,” LeCompte said, adding that debt discussions were inconclusive and overshadowed by tariff talks.
Reza Baqir, a former Pakistan central bank governor who now heads sovereign debt advisory at Alvarez & Marsal, said: “For many developing countries, especially in the Global South, there is a real sense of despair that the agenda on Financing for Development is really not center-stage. And who is going to be there to champion that debate?”
World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill also sounded an alarm on rising debt levels for emerging markets, noting that tariffs had prompted a sharp slowdown in trade and foreign direct investment that are crucial to developing country growth.
No US withdrawal
Policymakers did breathe a sigh of relief when Bessent expressed US support for the IMF and the World Bank, declaring that they have “enduring value” but criticising their “mission creep” into climate, gender and equality issues.
Participants at the meetings, along with financial markets, were encouraged by Bessent’s comments early in the week that US tariffs on Chinese goods and vice versa were unsustainable, suggesting a deal to ease them could be reached soon.
But China denied Trump’s assertions that tariff negotiations were underway with Beijing, adding to the confusion over tariffs.

• Kh Asif calls for int’l probe
• No official word on Nawaz-Shehbaz huddle
ISLAMABAD: The country’s political leadership continued to engage with foreign capitals over the weekend to highlight India’s attempts to cloak its provocative actions and false accusations in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
In separate calls with leaders from China, UK and Iran, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar drew attention to the “baseless propaganda and unilateral measures” taken by New Delhi, including the decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, which is a clear violation of the country’s international obligations.
Mr Dar, who also hold the foreign affairs portfolio, spoke to his counterparts from the UK and China and stressed Islamabad’s unwavering resolve to defend its national interests, while continuing to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to the Xinhua news agency, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Mr Dar that Beijing was paying close attention to the evolving situation between Pakistan and India.
He reaffirmed China’s consistent support for Pakistan’s firm counterterrorism efforts.
 
 

“As an ironclad friend and an all-weather strategic cooperative partner, China fully understands Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and supports Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty and security interests,” Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.
“China advocates for a swift and fair investigation and believes that conflict does not serve the fundamental interests of either India or Pakistan, nor does it benefit regional peace and stability,” Wang noted.
The Chinese foreign minister, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China’s Central committee, hoped that both sides would remain restrained, move toward each other, and work together to de-escalate the situation.
In a separate call with the UK foreign secretary, Mr Dar briefed David Lammy on “India’s false accusations, baseless propaganda, and unilateral measures”, while reiterating Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to a Foreign Office readout of the call, the UK foreign secretary emphasised the imp­o­rtance of de-escalating the situation thro­ugh dialogue and peaceful resolution of issues.
Appreciating these efforts, Mr Dar conveyed Pakistan’s readiness to participate in any independent and transparent investigation to ascertain the facts.
Both leaders agreed to maintain active contact regarding the evolving situation.
Call for int’l commission
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khaw­aja Asif called on India to stop levelling baseless allegations against Pakistan.
Speaking to the media in Sialkot, he said the UN Security Council and key regional powers should investigate the Pahalgam incident, warning that if two nuclear powers collided, world peace would also be destroyed.
Calling for the formation of an international commission to investigate the incident, he said that the UN should consider including China, Russia, Iran and Arab countries in the body. Who could better understand the issue than the UK, he said, referring to the region’s colonial past.
He accused Indian PM Narendra Modi of staging a political drama to save his skin, just as he had done after the Pulwama incident in 2019.
Call with Iranian president
Speaking to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday, the prime minister shared Pakistan’s position on India’s provocative actions, adding that Pakistan desired peace in the region and would welcome it if Iran also wanted to play a role in this regard.
During their call, the two leaders exchanged views on recent developments in the region, a PM Office statement said. Both also extended invitations to each other to visit their respective countries.
Referring to India’s unilateral decision on the Indus Water Treaty, PM Shehbaz said the use of water as a weapon was unacceptable and Pakistan would defend its right at all costs.
The PM said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, reaffirming that the country had no linkage, either direct or indirect, with the Pahalgam attack, adding that Islamabad was ready for a neutral investigation into the incident.
PM Shehbaz also conveyed Pakistan’s condolences on the loss of precious lives in the tragic explosion at Bandar Abbas, which claimed dozens of the lives and left more than 500 people injured.
 
 

Pakistan stood with the brotherly people of Iran at this difficult hour and would extend all possible assistance, the PM said.
Separately, media reports suggested that PM Shehbaz Sharif had met his elder brother, PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, at Jati Umrah on Sunday to brief him on the Pahalgam attack and its aftermath.
However, there was no official word from the PM Office or PML-N circles in this regard.

• Condition applies to both contract, regular re-employment after age 60
• Move aims to curb rising pension costs under IMF requirements
• Govt pension bill estimated at over Rs1tr in current fiscal year
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has formally notified that retired public servants rejoining government service, whether on a contract or regular basis, will now have to choose between drawing a salary or receiving their pension and may no longer claim both simultaneously.
“It has been decided that henceforth, in an event where a pensioner of the federal government after the age of 60 years, is reemployed/appointed in public service after retirement whether on regular/contract or whatsoever mode of employment, the pensioner shall have the option to retain either pension or to draw the salary of said employment during the currency of that employment,” said a notification issued by the regulation wing of the Ministry of Finance.
Earlier, rehired government employees used to avail of the salary of the incumbent employment, whether on contract or regular, and pension simultaneously — and in some cases, multiple pensions. This not only had an additional financial burden on the government exchequer but also hampered the career progression of other employees.
The latest measure is part of pension reforms the government has taken in hand to contain ever-increasing pension liabilities, a key requirement of the IMF programme.
 
 

The measure was initially announced by the then finance minister Ishaq Dar in the 2022-23 budget, but it could not be implemented until reannounced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in last year’s budget before the IMF signed off a new programme.
One of the key decisions of these reforms — a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel — may be further delayed until 2026 despite a notification for its implementation with effect from June 2025, according to sources.
In September last year, the government notified the introduction of a contributory fund scheme for new entrants in the civil government and armed forces. In a notification, the Ministry of Finance said last year that federal government employees would contribute 10 per cent of their respective basic pay while the government would contribute 20pc of the basic pay of the employees.
According to the Sept 3, 2024, notification, the scheme would apply to civil servants joining after July 1, 2024, and armed forces personnel appointed after July 1, 2025. The government has allocated Rs10 billion for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget.
The scheme had been introduced on the advice of the international lending agencies, particularly the World Bank, to contain rising pension liabilities described as a “ticking bomb”. The new scheme does not apply to existing employees. The government believes the contribution pension fund would slow down the growth in pension liabilities in future budgets.
The federal government’s total expenditure for pensions has been estimated at Rs1.014 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from Rs821bn in FY24, up by almost 24pc in a single year. This included pension liabilities of the armed forces at Rs662bn for the current fiscal year, up from Rs563bn, showing an increase of about 18pc.
On the other hand, the pension expenditure of civilians has been budgeted at Rs220bn for the current year against Rs228bn last year, a reduction of 3.5pc.
Subsequently, in January this year, the government notified further pension reforms, including abolishing multiple pensions and shifting future pensionable benefit calculations to an average of the past 24 months of salaries instead of the last pay drawn before retirement.
It had been notified that “in the event where a person becomes entitled to more than one pension, such person shall only be authorised to opt to draw one of the pensions”.
This was subject to the provision that “where a federal government employee becomes entitled to a pension, such federal government employee shall not be eligible to receive such pension”.
However, certain quarters were still pushing for a salary for re-employment and one pension.

• Ports anticipate crisis; manufacturers face raw material shortages
• President wades in to resolve situation
KARACHI: Efforts to disperse protesters, who have paralysed cross-country traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh, remained futile on Sunday, with manufacturers saying they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw material, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.
The road closures in several parts of Sindh are due to continuing protests against the controversial proposal to build new canals on the River Indus.
Although the federal government and the PPP regime in Sindh have agreed to postpone the project, nationalist parties, lawyers and other civil society groups do not appear convinced by the assurance and have vowed to continue their protests until the government makes the postponement official.
According to Dawn’s correspondent in Sukkur, thousands of heavy vehicles are stuck in long queues on different roads in the Kandhkot, Kashmore, Ghotki, Sukkur and Khairpur areas.
Manufacturers and transporters are surprised by the persisting impasse, even though the provincial government has been calling on protesters to clear the roads.
 
 

On Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari met with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, where the issue of the controversial projects and its fallout also came under discussion.
Sources privy to the meeting said the chief minister expressed concern over attempts by some political parties to exploit the issue for what he termed “vested interests”, referring to the ongoing protesters, staged mainly by nationalist parties in different parts of the province.
The CM also briefed the president about measures the Sindh government was taking to address public concerns and restore normalcy in affected areas, sources said.
To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance has announced plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House at 4pm today (Monday).
Transport at a standstill
An official at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) told Dawn that export cargo was not arriving, while imported cargo was piling up and not moving out of the port due to the closure of roads in Sindh.
“We are managing this situation to avoid congestion at the port, especially with the continuous arrival of imported goods . But in case goods movement remains held up, the port will face severe congestion, the official said.
Transporters say that in addition to worrying manufacturers and exporters, their drivers and helpers are also in a dire situation. Nisar Jafry of the All Pakistan Goods Transporters Associa­tion said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded.
He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be their meant for import, export or locally produced.
Giving an estimated headcount, he said that around 90,000-100,000 drivers and their helpers have been stranded alongside their vehicles on the highways for over 10 days now. They are also facing food and water shortages.
 
 

Transporters also alleged that protesters had damaged dozens of vehicles parked on the roads, and that over 100 sacrificial animals that were part of their cargo had already died.
Mr Jafry said he had received a call from Sindh transport minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, requesting him to call off Monday’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.
In a statement on Sunday, Mr Memon called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.
Due to the closures, the public, livestock, import and export sectors, farmers, and the poor are being severely affected, he said, adding that if the sit-ins must continue, the roads should be opened so that the flow of traffic is not hampered.
Representatives of the Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Oil Companies Advisory Council and the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council have all warned that the disruptions to the logistics supply chain are creating a severe crisis.
Although around 800-1,000 oil trucks are also stranded, the OCAC representative ruled out the possibility of a fuel shortage just yet.

Between February 1 and April 20, 2025, election tribunals decided 24 petitions related to the 2024 general elections, bringing the total number of decided petitions to 136, or 36.5 per cent of the total 372 matters being heard across four provinces. Of these, 26pc relate to Nati­onal Assembly seats and 42pc to provincial assembly seats.
Of the 24 petitions decided, 21 were from Punjab, two from Baloc­histan, and one from Sindh. In Punjab, two tribunals in Lahore decided eight cases, one in Rawa­lpindi decided seven, and one in Bahawalpur decided six.
The two tribunals in Quetta disposed of one case each, while a tribunal in Karachi disposed of only one case. No petitions from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were decided during this period.
 
 

Despite an increase in the number of petitions decided in Punjab compared to previous months, the overall pace of decisions has slowed, Fafen said.
This may be because four tribunals remained largely dysfunctional during the reporting period, including two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one in Punjab, and the sole tribunal of the Islamabad Capital Territory.
To date, Balochistan’s three election tribunals have collectively decided 43 (83pc) of the total 51 petitions filed for national and provincial constituencies in the province. Punjab’s eight tribunals have decided 66 (34pc) of 192 petitions. Sindh’s five tribunals have decided 18 (22pc) of 83 petitions. KP’s six tribunals have decided nine (21pc) of 42 petitions.
Of the 136 petitions decided so far, 133 were dismissed and three were accepted. Among the 133 dismissals, 52 were dismissed on non-maintainability grounds, including 10 related to National Assembly constituencies and 42 to provincial assembly constituencies.
Petitioners
The independent candidates supported by PTI make the largest group of petitioners, with 55pc of total petitions filed by them, followed by PML-N candidates (13pc), PPP candidates (8pc), unaffiliated independent candidates (7pc) and JUI-F candidates (6pc).
As many as 16 other party candidates cumulatively account for the remaining 11pc of the petitions.
Around 56pc petitions of independent candidates, 50pc of PPP candidates, 42pc each of PML-N and JUI-F candidates, and 58pc of those by other parties have been decided so far.
The returned candidates belonging to PML-N make the largest group of defendants with 39pc of the petitions challenging their victory, followed by PTI-backed candidates (16pc), MQM-P candidates and PPP candidates (13pc each), unaffiliated independents (6pc), and JUI-F (5pc).
As many as 11 other defendant parties’ candidates cumulatively acc­o­unt for the remaining 8pc petitions.
Around 58pc petitions filed against unaffiliated independents, 45pc against PTI-backed independents, 39pc against JUI-P candidates, 36pc each against PML-N and PPP candidates, 27pc against MQM-P candidates, and 21pc against other parties’ candidates have been decided so far.
Appeals
According to the Fafen report, 54 decisions of election tribunals have been contested before the Supreme Court. Among these, three appeals were initiated by the winning candidates against whom election petitions were accepted.
Additionally, 51 appeals have been filed against the rejection of election petitions by respective election tribunals. Among these, four have been heard and dismissed by the Supreme Court. The remaining 47 appeals are still under adjudication.
Of the 51 petitions filed against the dismissal of election petitions, 11 were lodged by losing candidates of the National Assembly elections. Similarly, 40 were submitted by losing candidates of provincial assembly elections, including 24 from Balochistan, 12 from Punjab, and four from Sindh.
Among the 51 appeals filed against the rejection of election petitions, 22 have been filed by PTI-backed independent candidates, six by PPPP candidates, five by the PML-N candidates, four by JUIP candidates, three by independent candidates, and two each by the National Party, Awami National Party, and Jamhoori Watan Party candidates.
Similarly, one petition each was filed by candidates from the Hazara Democratic Party, Balochistan National Party, Balochistan National Party Awami, Khadameen-i-Sindh, and Balochistan Awami Party candidates.
In terms of the respondents, 25 appeals were filed against the winners of PML-N, six against PPP, five against independent candidates backed by the PTI, four each against the MQM-P, JUI-F, and unaffiliated independent candidates, two against National Party, and one against the winner belonging to Balochistan Awami Party.

Muhammad Farooq Naseem, Founding 
Chairman and CEO of DWP Group

 
Muhammad Farooq Naseem started his entrepreneurial journey with the establishment of a television assembly plant that has since diversified into different businesses. With a turnover of $150 million, his DWP Group now employs around 5,500 people in its four business verticals: home appliances; MEP or mechanical, electrical, and plumbing services; cement; and information technology (IT) services.
“It was our collaboration with Samsung that threw us into a bit more prominence,” the founding chairman and chief executive officer of DWP Group told Dawn in an interview, reminiscing about how his “small company was discovered” by the Korean brand he helped establish in Pakistan back in 1999.
By the time a legal dispute forced him to exit his partnership with Samsung, he had already formed a new collaboration with one of the top, globally reputed Chinese home appliance manufacturers, Gree, to locally assemble a whole suite of consumer electronics.
“In the last five years, we have invested heavily in localisation that has created a very large value addition. We have complete manufacturing facilities because we are now component manufacturers for a lot of things,” Mr Naseem noted. “It has given us a big competitive advantage over our local competitors.”

Global evolution in the energy paradigm, the rise of digital technology and automation, and the extensive use of data could make or break countries like Pakistan in the near future

That said, the journey hasn’t been without difficulties, with the most formidable challenge being Pakistan’s recurring macroeconomic upheavals. The latest round of the ‘bust cycle’ that hit the country back in 2022 has been the worst he has ever seen.
“It was a roadblock you suddenly hit without really seeing it coming when you were driving at a speed of 100 miles an hour,” he said. “I’ve seen the currency go up and down; I’ve seen Pakistan being put through nuclear tests and things of that sort. But this was way beyond that: this was a tidal wave, a tsunami that had hit you.”
The home appliances market shrank by about 40-50 per cent (due to skyrocketing prices and rapid currency depreciation that massively reduced the purchasing power of middle-class consumers). On top of that, the liquidity crunch led the government to restrict imports as the State Bank’s international reserves depleted amid fears of a sovereign default.

‘Comparing IT with the rest of the industries, the negative list is much smaller to work with and can be easily converted into exportable income for this country very quickly’

“We also had to curtail our footprint drastically. Luckily, because the company is not leveraged much, we were able to survive the downturn. As a company, I think we did a great job because we survived the crisis without losing any real money. Now that the government has managed the downturn to a certain extent and the markets are normalising, we are back and investing again into new business opportunities.”
Are the bad times behind us? “I think that’s a bigger question than DWP Group as a commercial entity, because, as you know, the real issues stem from country risks, whether they are macroeconomic imbalances or security matters which are not currently highlighted. I don’t think it’s completely over.
“But for now, fortunately, the economy is starting to pick up; our businesses are also reflecting that sentiment. We see this segment growing because home appliances are about the emergence of the middle class and the level of urbanisation. These aren’t luxury items anymore. When you talk about refrigerators, it’s about food security. When you talk about television, it’s the first level of entertainment in somebody’s home. So, if you’re going to talk about uplift or the emergence of the middle class, which other countries have experienced, then our products are right in the middle of it.”
His company is now making strides in increasing exports, especially in the IT sector. “What we’re discovering is that the products that you make are not competitive (in the world markets) because the import costs are very high. I think we’ve missed the boat there because for that you needed to invest heavily into heavy industries like steel and plastic.
“That brings you to the virtual world: the IT services. That’s where we see the opportunity for export growth. As a Pakistani company, we are investing and aligning ourselves with the competitiveness of our people and their ability to leapfrog. If you talk purely in technological terms, the world is going through multiple fronts of technological disruption,” he explained.  
As of late, the DWP group has expanded its IT operations to the Middle East and North America. “We’ve also invested in a tech fund in which we are tapping into the new talent in frontier technologies. Yes, we are lacking certain talents, but those talents can be harnessed because at the moment we have a huge cost advantage over others, including India. But it’s not something we can say will perpetuate. It could very much evaporate. At the moment, the biggest problem is the internet. You want to have an IT future as a country, and your internet speed is not up to par.”
Emphasising the importance of IT, Mr Naseem argued that the issues facing the industry are easier to fix. “When you compare IT with the rest of the industries, the negative list is much smaller to work with. It is fixable, and it can be converted into exportable income for this country very quickly. It is a low-hanging fruit. If you were to fix Pakistan’s industrial policy, it would be a nightmare, but if you were to fix Pakistan’s IT competitiveness, that is easily fixable,” he concluded.
Mr Naseem believes that in the next 10 years the world is not going to look anything like the one that we know of. The changes, like a shift in the energy paradigm — how energy is created, distributed, and stored — the rise of digital technology and automation, and the extensive use of data could help countries, like Pakistan, bridge the gap of competitiveness. Adversely, these could also widen the competitive gap if we fail to adapt to these changes.
But do we still have time and opportunity to take advantage of technology? “There is always time. The question is: are you, as a country, ready for a transformation that requires national resolve? You are a country of 250m with one of the youngest populations in the world. But, if we look at our overall policy framework, we don’t see any focused effort to move into, say, new energy like solar, wind power, etc. Neither do we see any efforts to train our human resources to become part of the digital revolution going around,” Mr Naseem observed.
Yet, he believes there is hope: “The future frontier is something that we need to plan now. And that is what we see as an opportunity.”

A mega overseas convention will be held every April to recognise the important role of the 10 million diaspora spread across 160 countries.
In an article, ‘Rethinking the diaspora’s role’, analyst Durdana Najam wrote that the state, and its various departments, view overseas Pakistanis as critical stakeholders and are ready to reset the relationship based on terms that go beyond mere transactions.
When the country’s financial health is on the line, she said, mobilising one of the most resourceful segments of Pakistanis makes strategic sense. 
The growth in remittances has far outpaced the trade deficit during this fiscal year, which underlines the critical support these flows are providing to the current account.

With foreign investment having bottomed, analysts argue that remittances should be channelled into productive sectors to boost output and exports 

Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate, which gauges the currency’s value against a basket of foreign currencies adjusted for inflation, improved to 101.62 in March 2025 from a revised 102.25 in February, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan on April 17.
Following the significant improvements in the external sector, Fitch Ratings has upgraded the long-term foreign currency issuer default rating by one notch to ‘B-’ from ‘CCC+’, with a stable outlook.
The prime minister has pledged to personally oversee the investments of overseas Pakistanis in the country. “I will be your CEO. My cabinet and our business community will ensure that your investments are protected and facilitated,” he assured them. On another occasion, he added that the government will provide facilities to them for investment in the country according to their expertise.
However, media coverage of the convention did not reveal any inclination on the part of the 1,200 participants from across the world to set up manufacturing units or invest in their motherland’s farm economy, note analysts at Dawn. 
Remittances have also been a double-edged sword, the analysts argued. They help us pay our burgeoning import bills and compensate for the dwindling foreign official and private inflows as well as stagnating exports. But they are largely responsible for the rapid increase in imported consumption, unplanned urban sprawls, currency volatility, anti-export bias, etc.
Even more significant, the dependence on remittances has had a major role in crowding out manufacturing and exports, leading to deindustrialisation over more than a decade.
The share of remittances in the country’s GDP has increased from one per cent in 2000 to around 9pc; more than the share of exports.
No doubt remittances are widely recognised for their significant role in achieving the current level of macroeconomic stability. Even critics agree.
In March 2025, remittances reached a record $4.1 billion in a single month. Over the first nine months of the fiscal year, remittances have jumped by 33pc, totalling $28.1bn.
In the same month, Pakistan’s current account recorded a surplus of $1.2bn, the highest ever on record for a single month, compared with a $363m surplus recorded in the same month a year earlier and a deficit of $97m in February 2025. 
This takes the cumulative surplus for 9MFY25 to $1.86bn, a sharp reversal from the $1.65bn deficit during the same period last fiscal year.
The State Bank now expects to receive $38bn in remittances, up from the previous projection of $35bn this year, and hopes to raise foreign exchange reserves to $14bn by the end of June 2025 despite significant debt payments this year.
But, while the overall balance of payments during July-March remained positive, it turned negative for the fifth month during the outgoing year due to weakening foreign official and private inflows among heavy debt payments. The external sector stability is not durable, analysts say, founded as it is on factors such as a controlled trade deficit, unspoken import curbs, lower global oil prices, and most importantly, a massive and unexpected surge in remittances.
In the same period, it may be pointed out, that information technology exports surged by 23pc to record earnings of $2.83bn. And textile and clothing exports rose 9.38pc to $13.62bn in July-March FY25 from $12.44bn a year ago. But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has now lowered the projection of the country’s GDP growth by 0.4pc to 2.6pc for FY25 from 3pc estimated in January.
It is relevant to quote here the advice of IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva that countries must make the best of the new multipolar world.
With foreign investment having bottomed, analysts argue that remittances should be channelled into productive sectors to boost output and exports for a durable solution to the recurring balance-of-payments crisis by the creation of a business-friendly climate, tax reforms, policy consistency, etc.
Moreover, policymakers must also recognise that while remittances bolster the economy, true prosperity can only be achieved by creating conditions conducive to retaining our best and brightest brains, says a Business Recorder editorial.

The data painted a worrying picture: the agriculture sector grew by just 1.1 per cent. The first quarter was even worse, barely registering a growth rate of 0.74pc (revised figure). That is a massive fall from FY24, when agriculture posted a robust 8.17pc and 5.82pc growth in Q1 and Q2, respectively.
Interestingly, in Q2FY25, the livestock subsector, which accounts for nearly 60pc of the agriculture sector, grew by an impressive 6.51pc — the highest for any quarter over the last 10 years. This performance appears somewhat surprising, as neither the government nor the private sector undertook any significant intervention.
Despite this surge in livestock, what is dragging the agriculture sector down? Crops — long considered the backbone of Pakistan’s agriculture — are in deep trouble. The crop subsector posted a negative growth of 6.57pc in Q1 and 5.38pc in Q2. This stands in stark contrast to last year’s double-digit positive growth in the same quarters — 16.07pc and 10.12pc, respectively.
Compared to the previous year, cotton plunged by 30.7pc, dropping from 10.22 million bales to 7.08m bales, and maize fell 15.4pc, from 9.74m tonnes to 8.24m tonnes. Likewise, rice dipped slightly by 1.4pc, sliding from 9.86m tonnes to 9.72m tonnes, while sugarcane shrank by 2.3pc, from 87.64m tonnes to 85.62m tonnes.

The wheat crisis has deepened in 2025 due to government policy failures at multiple levels, and without meaningful reforms, another year of poor growth in FY26 appears all but certain

This dramatic reversal from bumper harvests in FY24 to a worrying slowdown just a year later signals more than just statistical fluctuation. It reflects mounting stress from multiple directions. However, what primarily explains this boom and bust? The short answer: liquidity — hard cash in farmers’ hands.
In 2023, wheat, Pakistan’s principal food crop, cultivated on over 23.7m acres by more than 6m farmers, fetched Rs3,900 per 40kg. With solid returns in hand, farmers confidently reinvested in Kharif crops like rice, maize, and cotton. They purchased expensive hybrid seeds, applied optimal fertiliser doses, and operated even high-cost diesel-operated tubewells to meet irrigation water needs. The result: bumper yields.
Then came 2024. The Punjab government, despite announcing a support price of Rs3,900, failed to procure wheat. Farmers were left to sell their crop at distress prices — between Rs2,400 and Rs2,700 — well below the government’s own estimated production cost of Rs3,200. To make matters worse, in July 2024, the Punjab government imposed district-specific price caps ranging from Rs2,800 to Rs3,050 per 40kg.
This policy left farmers cash-strapped, which triggered a domino effect — a chain reaction that affected the subsequent crops. Due to liquidity issues, farmers could not apply inputs, especially fertilisers, in the required quantities at the right time. The impact is now evident in the dismal Q1 and Q2 figures of FY25. Wheat has rightly earned its title as the driving force of Pakistan’s agriculture sector and rural economy, and when it stalls, the entire sector suffers.
The wheat crisis has deepened in 2025 due to government policy failures at multiple levels. Without meaningful reforms aimed at strengthening agricultural credit, building private sector capacity, improving farmers’ grain holding capacity, and ensuring effective regulation of the commodity market, another year of poor growth in 2025-26 appears all but certain.
Crops are becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change. In 2024, the yields of maize, rice, cotton, and sesame were affected by erratic rainfall, heatwaves, and rising temperatures. Farmers lack both the capacity and access to climate-smart technologies needed to cope with the escalating threat of climate change. As a result, Pakistan’s agriculture sector has failed to adopt even basic adaptation and mitigation measures like high-yielding, climate-resilient seeds.
The widespread availability of substandard and unapproved seeds, particularly for cotton and rice, emerged as a major concern in 2024. These seeds had low germination rates and lacked resilience against pests and the growing impacts of climate change. Collectively, these factors ultimately led to lower yields.
In Q1 and Q2 of FY25, farmers faced irrigation challenges on three fronts. First, canal water availability from April 1 to Sept 30 dropped by 3.4pc — from 61.85 million acre-feet (MAF) in 2023 to 59.75 MAF in 2024. This shortfall was relatively more intense and damaging in some rice- and cotton-growing areas of Sindh. Second, rainfall between September and December 2024 was 40pc below normal, triggering near-drought conditions across much of the country. Third, the electricity tariff for tubewells — effective from July 2024 — rose to a record high, about 20pc above 2023 levels. This sharp increase further constrained cash-strapped farmers’ ability to irrigate.
This year, the water situation is even worse. With declining reservoir levels, farmers are unlikely to receive sufficient water, which will shrink crop acreage and suppress yields further. These impacts will likely be reflected in the agricultural performance of FY26.
In conclusion, Pakistan’s crop sector is gradually losing its competitiveness due to rising production costs, worsening water shortages, and a policy framework that is misaligned with the farmers’ real issues. The government’s piecemeal incentives — such as subsidised equipment — may help a few thousand but will be unable to address the deeper structural challenges of the sector. What’s urgently needed is a long-term, strategic vision aimed at boosting productivity and building a resilient agriculture sector.

India and Pakistan are struggling with rising tensions due to the Pahalgam attack; the Middle East crisis following Israel and Gaza is growing increasingly complex; and the Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated. Meanwhile, Iran has yet to finalise a nuclear deal with the United States, amid threats of force from President Donald Trump in the event of failure. President Trump’s tariff war with China also remains unresolved, as do his trade disputes with several other nations.
The situation is challenging, especially for Pakistan, where an economic recovery has only just begun and lacks sustainable improvements in the external sector. Continuation of this recovery hinges on a favourable geopolitical environment. Pakistan’s recent external economic gains have largely depended on remittances from overseas Pakistanis, particularly those residing in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and the United States.
While an adverse geopolitical environment may have a moderately negative impact on remittance inflows, it could have a more severe and lasting effect on potential foreign direct investment (FDI). Global trade is already becoming more expensive, with import costs rising and net export earnings taking a hit due to increased shipping and container charges. In this context, it is essential for Pakistan to secure some tariff concessions from the US before the Trump administration finalises new average tariffs for the country.

The government must focus on improving its foreign exchange reserves if it hopes to protect the nation’s hard-earned stability amid rising global tensions

Pakistan’s exports remain heavily reliant on food items for overall growth, as the textile sector continues to struggle — mirroring the difficulties faced by other large-scale manufacturing industries. Meanwhile, the government’s Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI) aims to revolutionise the agriculture sector and sustain the momentum in food exports.
However, making the GPI a genuine success requires greater interprovincial harmony on critical issues such as water sharing, the unrestricted movement of final commodities across provincial borders and equal treatment of all federating units by the federal government. It is encouraging to note that Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari have finally agreed to resolve the ongoing dispute over canal construction on the Indus River amicably. A meeting of the Inter-Provincial Coordination Council has been convened to address this matter.
Under the current geopolitical situation, Pakistan’s economic managers must focus on a few critical priorities simultaneously and with full vigour. The first is the stability of the external account. If tensions escalate, maintaining sufficient foreign exchange reserves and ensuring the stability of the rupee will become vital.

Pakistan must enhance food trade with neighbouring countries and explore greater opportunities in South and East Asia

The second priority — closely tied to the first — is the need to boost exports, remittances, and foreign investment. Realising the promised inflow of significant FDI from GCC countries in the near future will require making some tough trade-offs, even if the current tensions die down. In this context, building a genuine national consensus on policies aimed at attracting FDI in politically sensitive sectors such as mines and minerals, agriculture, and energy becomes urgently important.
Containing imports through tariff or non-tariff measures remains off the table, as Pakistan is still under an International Monetary Fund lending programme. However, a greater focus on agricultural and industrial development to encourage import substitution is both feasible and urgently needed. 
In 9MFY25 of the current fiscal year (July 2024 to March 2025), Pakistan’s goods export earnings rose 7.82 per cent year-on-year to $24.72 billion, while imports grew 6.6pc to $42.69bn, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. Unless export growth consistently outpaces import growth, managing the trade deficit will become increasingly difficult — especially given the rupee’s vulnerability. The currency has already come under pressure amid fears of a military clash with India.
Of the $24.7bn in exports during this nine-month period, food exports accounted for $5.75bn —more than 23pc. For a country of 245 million people, such a high share of food in total goods exports is concerning, as it risks exacerbating domestic food shortages and fuelling food inflation. 
Moreover, Pakistan must also seek new export markets and deepen its presence in existing ones. It should particularly enhance food trade with neighbouring countries such as Iran, Afghanistan, and China and explore greater opportunities in South and East Asia. 
Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, April 28th, 2025</p><small>2025-04-28 01:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/680ea83fdd936.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906971/a-road-map-for-savings' target='_blank'><strong>A road map for  savings</strong></a><br><p>Economics 101 indicates that a country with a savings rate below its investment will find it difficult to achieve sustained growth. It also states that a country with a low financial literacy rate, high inflation and high cash in circulation (cash printed but not in any bank account) will have a very low national savings rate.
Pakistan fits this diagnosis perfectly. Firstly, the official savings rate (savings in banks as a percentage of GDP) stood at 14 per cent. Secondly, although inflation has eased in the recent past, rates provided by banks for savings products were well below the inflation rate, hence providing a negative rate of return. Thirdly, we remain a cash economy; money in circulation as of March 14 stood at Rs9.1 trillion.
This perfect storm will make increasing the official savings rate very challenging. Regulators and providers must use the customer lens if they are to make a dent in our savings habit. The solution must provide a real rate of return without high risk, must be safe (no Ponzi schemes), must be easily accessible (no 10-page documentation with twenty signatures), must have an affordable ticket size and must be liquid.
Research suggests that Pakistanis save in cash, cryptocurrency, dollars, gold, real estate, stocks and animals (mostly in the rural areas). Let us look at each asset class and see what can be done to entice the savers to move from rupee savings outside the system to an asset class within the system. 

There is a major opportunity to bring trillions of rupees in circulation into one of the many asset classes provided that access and knowledge is simplified

This will not only document the economy and raise the official savings rate but potentially also allow the banks to lend more. In addition, let us also examine what Rs10,000 invested five years ago in the asset classes mentioned would be worth today.
As seen in the table, investments in cryptocurrency, gold and company shares provided a positive rate of return after adjusting for inflation, yet the biggest asset class that we save in is Pakistani rupees. While Rs34tr is within the system, banks and the national savings schemes, Rs9.1tr is in circulation, and we can assume this to be in private lockers, office vaults and under pillows. The return on Rs10,000 invested five years ago would, if deposited in a savings account, show a negative rate of return given the five-year inflation rate.
So, in order to attract more people to save in rupees, we need to do four things. Firstly, educate the potential savers that there are rupee instruments, like the 90-day T-bill, that provide a rate better than inflation. Secondly, the opening of an Investor Portfolio Securities account — needed to invest in capital market instruments — must be made as easy as opening a digital wallet. Thirdly, the denomination of the investment must be made palatable (the T-bill already has a Rs5,000 denomination but is not offered to customers), and lastly, the investment must be made liquid.
Cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum, has become extremely popular in Pakistan. While the figures cannot be verified directly from the exchanges, analysts suggest that the holding of crypto assets by Pakistanis ranges between $10 billion and $30bn with over 10 million people holding a crypto wallet in one or more crypto exchanges. 


*Assuming that in 2020, a uniform Rs10,000 was invested in each of the various asset classes.
Note: A three-bedroom apartment at Emaar in DHA has been used as a proxy for real estate owing to a lack of market indices. The price of a cow has been taken as a proxy for animal prices. All other asset classes are based on published values at the time of writing. Based on auhtor’s calculations

 
Unfortunately, this activity is not regulated, and these assets are acquired via institutionalised hawala systems. 
Although crypto investments can potentially be used for money laundering, are a major drain on foreign currency reserves and are speculative in nature, they are here to stay. The best immediate course of action would be to create a synthetic contract that mimics one or more cryptocurrencies and the exchange element. 
In this manner, once the ‘know your customer’ and ‘anti-money laundering’ processes have been done, customers can invest the cryptocurrencies without risks. Pakistanis also save in physical dollars. While the physical dollar is a dead asset, the charm is in the dollar’s value appreciating.
Moving on, gold is one of the most popular asset classes. Gold is not saved via financial instruments or gold bricks but in gold ornaments. It is estimated that over $10bn worth of gold ornaments exist in the country. In order to make investing in gold as easy as buying a cold drink, we must fractionise and tokenise it.
Imagine an app that allows you to buy gold worth Rs100; it allows you to pay from your digital wallet and/or credit card, always provides a bid-offer spread so that you can buy or sell at any time, and offers the option of getting physical gold once you reach an agreed weight. The entity providing this service could be reg­u­lated and have physical gold against which it has fractionalised and tokenised the service. This can be a game changer and will start to bring in the money in circulation in the system.
Although the Pakistan stock exchange provided resounding returns over the past few years, most Pakistanis don’t invest in equities for three main reasons: they are unaware of the returns and the risks associated with equity investments; financial literacy is low, and as a consequence, individual broking accounts are less than 100,000; and opening a broking account is a very painful exercise. 
So financial literacy related to the risks and rewards of investing in company shares and the ease of opening an account must be improved if we are to see wider representation in the stock exchange.
There is a major opportunity to bring trillions of rupees from cash in circulation into one or more asset classes discussed. This will not only document the economy and improve the savings rate but also provide additional liquidity to the banks. To achieve this objective, the regulators, the existing banks and cutting-edge start-ups will need to work together.

Fifty years ago, the average Pakistani had a higher income than his South Asian peers. Today, he earns about half as much. What went wrong, and what must be done to turn things around?
The roots of Pakistan’s economic troubles go back decades. A booming population and poor economic management have combined to sap the country’s ability to save and invest. Compared to its neighbours — India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka — Pakistan’s living standards, healthcare, and education have all fallen behind.
One major issue is population growth. Pakistan’s population has quadrupled in the last 50 years, leaving the country with a much larger share of young, non-working dependents. That imbalance limits how much families can save, which in turn limits national investment. In countries like India and Bangladesh, the ratio of working-age people is much higher, supporting faster economic growth. Meanwhile, Pakistan struggles to keep up.
But demographics aren’t the only problem. Pakistan has also been plagued by chronic policy mistakes. Governments have repeatedly spent beyond their means, leading to mounting debt. Over time, interest payments have ballooned to the point where they now consume nearly 60 per cent of government revenue. This leaves little room for spending on health, education, or infrastructure.

The country’s saving rate could have been 10 percentage points higher if its working-age population ratio matched that of its neighbours

Foreign exchange shortages have triggered repeated economic crises, with Pakistan having to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) more than 20 times. The latest crisis erupted during the Covid-19 pandemic and worsened after the Russia-Ukraine war drove up oil prices. At one point, Pakistan had barely enough dollars in reserve to cover two weeks of imports.
In 2023, Pakistan secured another IMF bailout. That programme, and the subsequent one agreed last year, along with debt rollovers from international creditors and falling oil prices, helped stabilise the economy. Foreign reserves recovered somewhat, inflation cooled, and the rupee steadied. However, the IMF programme demands sharp tax increases and tight spending limits — an approach that critics say could choke growth and worsen social problems.
Instead, a different strategy is needed: one that prioritises more gradual but deeper tax reform and increased investment in health, family planning, and education — especially for women. Improving access to these services would boost productivity and help slow population growth, freeing up more resources for savings and investment. In turn, that would support faster economic growth over time.
There is no escaping the need to collect more taxes. Only one to two per cent of Pakistanis pay any income tax at all, and the government’s revenue receipts — at around 12pc of the GDP — are amongst the lowest worldwide. 
The agriculture, retail, and real estate sectors, which together constitute the bulk of the economy, are effectively outside the tax net. No country can function like this. So, tax reforms should aim to raise an extra 6pc of GDP over the next five years. Even if that is achieved, Pakistan would still rank in the lowest quarter of all countries in terms of tax receipts.
Only with more revenue can Pakistan afford to invest in key social sectors. Clawing back wasteful spending, such as subsidies for the well-to-do and the loss-making state enterprises, is a must. However, the savings from such efforts alone will not be enough to meet even basic social and infrastructure development needs.
With Pakistan also ranking among the lowest globally in terms of the government’s noninterest spending level (relative to the size of the economy), some of the tax revenue gains should be put back into the economy via spending to expand education and health access for those who lack it.
Key to this alternative strategy is international support. Without more low-cost loans (so-called “concessional financing”) from global institutions like the World Bank and countries that lend to Pakistan, the government will be forced to borrow from local and international markets at high interest rates. That would keep debt costs high and continue to crowd out private investment.
Addressing Pakistan’s population growth is critical. The country’s saving rate could have been 10 percentage points higher if its working-age population ratio matched that of its neighbours. More savings would mean more investment and faster growth. Better access to family planning, education for girls, and jobs for women could help Pakistan achieve this demographic shift, as seen in Bangladesh and other countries.
In short, Pakistan’s path to recovery requires more than just balancing budgets — it needs sustained investment in its people, smarter tax policy, and international cooperation. Without these changes, Pakistan risks being stuck in a cycle of crises for years to come. With them, a brighter economic future is possible.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), this is the highest-ever number of khwarij killed by security forces in a single engagement throughout the campaign against terrorism.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
“On night 25/26 and 26/27 April 2025, [the] movement of a large group of khwarij, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was detected by the security forces in [the] general area [of] Hassan Khel, North Waziristan District.
“[Our] own troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, all fifty-four khawarij have been sent to hell,” the statement added.
The ISPR added that a large cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered from the slain khawarij, a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
“Intelligence reports indicate that this group of khawarij was specifically infiltrating on [the] behest of their ‘foreign masters’ to undertake high-profile terrorist activities inside Pakistan”, the ISPR statement read.
Referring to India’s “baseless accusations against Pakistan”, it added that such actions by Fitna al Khwarij — a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP — “clearly implies on whose cues FAK (Fitna al Khwarij) is operating”.
“Such actions amount to treason and betrayal against the state and its citizens,” said the press release.
Mentioning the National Security Council meeting that took place earlier this week to discuss a response to India downgrading diplomatic ties with Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, the ISPR highlighted how “distracting Pakistan’s security forces from their focus on the war against terror seems to be the strategic intent of India to allow a breathing space to FAK which is reeling from the onslaught of our Armed Forces resolute offensive against them”.
The ISPR commended “the exceptional professionalism, vigilance, [and] preparedness” demonstrated by security forces in preventing a “potential catastrophe”.
It asserted that the security forces of Pakistan “remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of terrorism.”
“Such bold and decisive actions further strengthen our collective resolve and underscore that Pakistan is winning the war against terrorism while achieving significant successes against terrorists”, the press release said.
On Saturday, the ISPR said that two soldiers were martyred and 15 terrorists killed in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
A statement said the intelligence-based operations (IBO) were conducted on Friday and Saturday, and that eight terrorists were “sent to hell” after troops engaged them at their location during an IBO in Karak district.
Four more were killed by the security forces in another IBO in North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing stated. It added that troops “successfully neutralised” three more terrorists in another encounter in the South Waziristan district’s general area of Gomal Zam.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Lance Naik Usman Mohmand (age: 28 years, resident of Charsadda district) and Sepoy Imran Khan (age: 26 years, resident of Kurram district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom,” the ISPR said.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-27 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602068-pakistan-india-standoff-islamabad-beijing-oppose-unilateralism-hegemonic-policies' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-India standoff: Islamabad, Beijing oppose ‘unilateralism, hegemonic policies'</strong></a><br><p>
