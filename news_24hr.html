Pakistan will play all their matches of the 50-over World Cup in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo when India hosts this year’s tournament from Sept 30 to November 2. Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy earlier this year, a “hybrid model” was decided upon whereby India would play all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.
The women’s national selection committee named the squad for the tournament, and announced that the same squad will also feature in a three-match ODI series against South Africa, scheduled at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore from Sept 16-22.
 






“Uncapped right-handed batter Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland, is part of the ODI squad,” PCB said.
“Fatima Sana, who represented Pakistan in the previous edition of ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, will lead the side for the first time in the mega event,” it added.
The 23-year-old had previously captained the side in the ICC Women’s CWC Qualifier held in Lahore this year, where the team maintained a 100 per cent win record to secure qualification for this year’s ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup set to take place in India and Sri Lanka, the statement added.
 
 

Six players are set to feature in their maiden ODI World Cup, namely: Natalia Parvaiz (8 ODIs, 24T20Is), Rameen Shamim (8 ODIs, 11 T20Is), Sadaf Shamas (15 ODIs, 12 T20Is), Sadia Iqbal (27 ODIs, 50 T20Is), Shawaal Zulfiqar (3 ODIs, 9 T20Is) and Syeda Aroob Shah (2 ODIs, 15 T20Is).
Moreover, 21-year-old Aroob, 20-year-old Shawaal alongside 20-year-old Eyman featured for Pakistan in the inaugural edition of ICC Women’s U19 T20 World Cup held in South Africa in January 2023.
“Additionally, two changes have been made from the 15-member squad that featured in the ICC Women’s CWC Qualifier,” PCB said.
“Eyman and Sadaf come into the squad in place of Gull Feroza and Najiha Alvi, who have been named in the five-member non-travelling reserves alongside Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani and Waheeda Akhtar.”
The 15 players alongside five reserves players will take part in a 14-day pre-South Africa series camp from August 29. “The players under the coaching staff led by Muhammad Wasim will undergo practice sessions as well as 50-over practice matches.”
South Africa women’s cricket team will arrive in Lahore on Sept 12.
15-member squad:
Fatima Sana (captain), Muneeba Ali Siddiqui (vice-captain), Aliya Riaz, Diana Baig, Eyman Fatima, Nashra Sundhu, Natalia Parvaiz, Omaima Sohail, Rameen Shamim, Sadaf Shamas, Sadia Iqbal, Shawaal Zulfiqar, Sidra Amin, Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper) and Syeda Aroob Shah.
Non-traveling reserves:
Gull Feroza, Najiha Alvi, Tuba Hassan, Umm-e-Hani and Waheeda Akhtar.
Player support personnel:
Hina Munawar (manager), Muhammad Wasim (head coach), Junaid Khan (assistant coach bowling), Tahir Khan (assistant coach bowling), Abdul Saad (fielding coach), Muhammad Rafi Ullah (media manager), Muhammad Asfand Yar (strength and conditioning coach), Waleed Ahmed (analyst), Tehreem Sumbal (physiotherapist), Kiran Shahzadi (masseuse) and team doctor (tbc).

ISLAMABAD: A unique collection of ancient artefacts representing almost the entire heritage trail of the country has left for China to be part of a show in Beijing that is hosting the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) 2025.
The exhibition, which will open at the National Museum of China, coincides with the Meeting of the Council of Heads of States of SCO, 2025, being held on August 31.
“Under the theme of ‘Respecting Diverse Civilisations, Pursuing Common Development’, the exhibition will invite national museums of SCO members to send representative objects to attend the exhibition. By doing so, the exhibition can display the diversity of culture, friendship and cooperation of the SCO family,” said a letter inviting the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM) to participate.
Pakistan is among the nine full-member states, such as Russia,  Kazakhs­tan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Iran, which are contributing  artefacts for a show titled “Collections from Museums of Shanghai  Cooperation Organisation Member States. Belarus officially joined the  SCO in July 2024, making it the tenth member.

Relics include iconic Indus bull seal, astrolabe and several pieces depicting the Buddha

Pakistan is contributing ten artefacts dating from the late Neolithic period — Mehrgarh, down to Mohenjo Daro and all the way to the Islamic period, DOAM Director Dr Abdul Ghafoor Lone told Dawn.
The items include a stunning terracotta female figurine dating back to 3,000-3,500 BCE from the Neolithic period and a 2,800-2,700 BCE painted globular pot.
 
 

The 5,000 BCE Steatite Indus Seal with a humped bull and inscription is the oldest relic to be put on display at the exhibition. The 1,600-1,800 BCE terracotta horse figurine and the Jain ritual tank adorned with birds and lamps, which dates back to 600-200 BCE, will also be put on display.
The most interesting piece, perhaps, is the stone panel depicting Apalala Jataka, 3-4 Century BCE. The relic shows Buddha commanding Naga Apalala, a water-dwelling Naga in Buddhist mythology, to stop flooding the Swat River and the valley. It is said that Apalala lived near the Swat River.
Besides the 3rd to 4th Century CE Buddha head, also on display will be the 19th Century CE Astrolabe used by sailors. In its simplest form, it’s a metal disc with perforations that allowed sailors to calculate astronomical positions precisely.

• This is not a political matter and we will address it through legal means, says elder brother
KARACHI: Chanesar Town chairman Farhan Ghani, younger brother of senior Pakistan Peoples Party leader and local government minister Saeed Ghani, was booked, arrested and remanded in a terrorism and attempted murder case for allegedly assaulting a government employee overseeing fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal.
Police got one-day remand of Farhan from a duty magistrate on Sunday. He will be produced before an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday (today).
In a statement, Saeed Ghani, who is also the president of the PPP Karachi division, said that a dispute occurred on Sharea Faisal within the remit of the Chanesar Town and a First Information Report (FIR) was registered against his brother Farhan and some others. “Soon after, Farhan and his associates voluntarily surrendered themselves to the authorities.
“This is a legal matter, not a political one, and we will address it through legal means,” the elder Ghani said.
Earlier, the Ferozabad police registered a case under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 324 (attempted murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 379 (theft), 506-B (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
Without identifying his department, complainant Hafiz Sohail Jadoon told the police that he is a “government employee” and was supervising fibre optic network laying work on Sharea Faisal on Aug 22.
He stated at around 4:47pm, around 20-25 persons, including Chanesar Town chairman Farhan, in three vehicles arrived there and asked him whether he had permission to dig up Sharea Faisal. He said he told them that he had all permissions but some of them misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately. The complainant said when he insisted that he had all required no-objection certificates, they started using smear language and beating him.
He said they dragged him at gunpoint to a room of a nearby fuel station where they kept him in illegal confinement and continued beating him. In the meantime, a police team arrived there, rescued him and took him to the police station where he lodged the FIR.
On Sunday, the investigating officer (IO) produced three suspects, including Mr Farhan, before Judicial Magistrate (East) Waseem Abbas and sought their one-day police custody.
The IO informed the court that the suspects had been arrested on terrorism charges and their custody was required to apprehend their remaining accomplices with their help and to check their criminal record.
He further submitted that since the case was registered under terrorism charges and ATCs remained closed on Sunday, he was seeking their one-day custody to produce them before the concerned anti-terrorism court for remand.
After hearing the IO, the duty magistrate granted one-day physical custody of the suspects and directed him to produce them before the administrative judge of the ATCs on Monday (today).

He was identified as Rashid and his brother Wajid had already died of severe torture marks at the spot.
The incident went viral on social media when a video clip showed some street vendors subjecting both brothers to severe torture on a road in Raiwind area two days back.
They were lying in a pool of blood and the suspected attackers holding clubs in hands were spotted torturing them at a public place with many onlookers and passersby standing around.
According to the video clip, no one from the passersby tried to rescue the two young men when they were being tortured by the attackers.
There were reports that the police traced and arrested two of the suspected attackers after lodging a case against them.
A police official said Wajid and Rashid had argued with a street vendor over the price of the fruit.  
He said the minor issue later led to the heated debate and then physical attack by the suspects.

Following the recent heavy monsoon rains, “significant erosion and damage” have been reported in the Hub Canal within the jurisdiction of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), said a statement issued by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC).
According to KWSC officials, the recent damage to the Hub Canal did not occur in the old or new Hub Canal. Instead, the damage took place in an eight-kilometre stretch that falls under the jurisdiction of Wapda.
They said that the section is managed entirely by Wapda, and after this stretch, the canal connects to the section overseen by the KWSC. The point where the canal transitions from Wapda to KWSC control is known as the “Zero Point,” they said.
In an urgent move to prevent further destruction, the statement said that Wapda has drastically reduced the flow from the dam, sending shockwaves across the city’s water distribution system.

KWSC says city receives only 40 MGD instead of 100 MGD from Hub Dam

“Karachi is currently receiving only 40 million gallons per day (MGD) from the Hub Dam, down from the usual 100 MGD,” the KWSC statement confirmed while quoting the chief engineer of bulk.
This sharp drop in supply is already being felt across the western, central, and Keamari districts, where taps have started to run dry. Residents are bracing for extended hours without water as the city struggles to cope.
Although the emergency repair work was expected to be completed by 4pm on Sunday, the water supply is unlikely to return to normal immediately.
“The repairs are expected to take until 4pm on Sunday, though it takes around 12 hours for water to travel from the dam to the Hub Pumping Station,” said the KWSC statement, confirming delays to any immediate relief while urging the public to act responsibly.
“We apologise for the inconvenience and urge citizens to use water sparingly. All available resources are being deployed to expedite the restoration process,” said the KWSC chief engineer.
MQM-P pins blame on Sindh govt, KWSC
As the city reels under the water shortage due to emergency repairs at the Hub Canal, political tempers have flared. Senior MQM-Pakistan leader and Member of the National Assembly, Syed Aminul Haque, launched a scathing attack on the Sindh government and KWSC, accusing them of “criminal negligence” and “systemic corruption” that has left citizens “thirsting for every drop.”
In a strongly worded statement, Mr Haque alleged that despite the much-publicised 100 MGD Hub Canal water supply project, the water board has failed to deliver water to large swathes of the city.
 
 

“The people in Orangi Town, Surjani Town, Baldia Town, Keamari, Korangi, Landhi, North Karachi, Malir, and Shah Faisal Colony are struggling without water,” he said.
He further accused the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Sindh government of growing mismanagement.
“Their incompetence has written a new chapter of urban failure. Even after the recent rains, areas like Orangi remain submerged in sewage water,” he said.
The MQM leader also criticised Jamaat-i-Islami, saying their role has been limited to slogans without action.
“Drainage and sanitation projects exist only on paper. Central Karachi and other districts flood every time it rains,” he added.
The MQM-P leader demanded immediate, practical solutions and accountability.
“People pay taxes, but receive garbage, sewage, and broken promises in return. Karachi needs action, not speeches,” he said.

Passengers are particularly affected as luxury bus services have been shifted to the general bus stand where there are no quality facilities provided to them such as separate waiting areas and clean bathrooms.
Meanwhile, a private bus terminal continues to run on government land that was earlier allocated for Speedo Bus Service during the term of chief minister Usman Buzdar near the general bus stand while another was forcibly shifted by the district administration to the general bus stand.
 
 

The transport owners as well as private bus terminals are not happy with the government’s move and raised questions about the transparency in shifting them from within the city to the general bus stand.
An officer who carried out the operation of shifting of terminals claims that the managers of private terminals had signed a mutual understanding document for moving their stands to the general bus stand. The owners of private terminals reject the administration’s claims, saying that the agreement was not signed by their actual representatives.
On the other hand, the district administration has so far failed to provide essential facilities such as a sewage, water supply and electricity to the private transport owners who have shifted to the GTS. As a result, the ongoing dispute between transport owners and the administration is causing troubles for the commuters.
Another related problem is the absence of intra-city transport service to approach the bus stand, which is crowded and the passengers don’t get any facility despite paying higher fare than the general bus stand passengers.
“We buy expensive tickets for safe air-conditioned luxury stay with other facilities at the bus terminal but there are no such facilities at the general bus stand,” bemoans a passenger.
He suggests to the district government that limited operation from the city should be allowed until the shifting of all private stands at a properly developed site.
Deputy Commissioner Usman Khalid says private bus stands couldn’t operate in the city that’s why the government shifted them to general bus stand.

The meeting, attended by the chief engineers of Wasa and the Irrigation Department, as well as representatives of the Pakistan Red Crescent and other officials, reviewed the worsening shortage of clean drinking water in the provincial capital.
Officials briefed the meeting that underground water levels in Quetta had dropped to alarming depths due to over-extraction and wasteful consumption.
They proposed several measures, including introducing a metering system, reviving traditional karez channels, installing rooftop rainwater harvesting systems in government buildings, sealing illegal tube wells and establishing recharge points to replenish groundwater.
Commissioner Kakar described Quetta’s water shortage as a “dangerous stage” requiring urgent intervention. He stressed the need for a comprehensive water policy to guarantee the supply of clean water while curbing misuse. He also urged public awareness campaigns to encourage responsible consumption.

Illegal connections to be cut, private suppliers to be regulated

He warned that strict action would be taken against those involved in illegal water extraction and directed Wasa to repair damaged pipelines without delay. Legal measures would also be enforced against those found wasting water.
“Water survival depends on our collective responsibility,” he emphasised, urging citizens, institutions and authorities to play their part in conserving the resource.

Orphaned at a young age, White fought in World War I, and eventually finished his doctorate from Harvard at age 40. Despite the late start, White’s crowning achievement came at the Bretton Woods Conference when he succeeded in placing the US dollar at the centre of the post-World War II international financial system. In the decades that followed, the dollar reigned supreme as the very foundation of global finance.
This year, however, the dollar has suffered a decline of almost 10 per cent in value, making this the greenback’s weakest performance since 1973. At least for some, this decline reflects an inflection point, marking the beginning of the end of the dollar era.
A deeper analysis of this dollar depreciation suggests that there might be some volition at play. Important voices from inside the Trump administration, like those of Stephen Miran, have argued that the dollar is structurally overvalued, making US exports uncompetitive. To remedy this, Miran has proposed a summit, the so-called Mar-a-Lago Accord, so that the US would be able to convince other major economies for a depreciation in the dollar. Miran also forwarded the idea of imposing a user fee on foreign governments’ US treasury holdings, another way through which the dollar’s value may be lowered.
 
 

In addition, President Donald Trump has pushed very strongly for lower interest rates, dubbing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell ‘Too Late’ for the supposed delay on his part. Trump has recently nominated Miran to the Fed board, in what appears to be an attempt to get lower rates as soon as possible. Trump’s visible frustration with Powell and Miran’s rising influence within the Fed show that lower interest rates, and, consequently, a lower dollar are around the corner.
Where Washington may willfully turn a blind eye towards dollar depreciation, dollar dominance — a pre-eminent role in international currency transactions and foreign reserve holdings — is quite another thing.
In terms of dominance, the dollar is undisputed king, with about 60pc of global official reserves held in dollars, while about 60pc of international currency loans and deposits are also denominated in dollars. The US remains the world’s largest investment destination, with FDI totalling some $12.8 trillion. At the same time, it appears that US policymakers are willing to do their utmost to ensure the dollar’s dominance in the international financial system, not least because of the immense geopolitical leverage it offers.

At the moment, there’s no real challenger to the dollar’s dominance.

The US has repeatedly frozen foreign governments’ dollar-denominated assets in order to force them to the negotiating table. In 1979, president Carter froze $12 billion worth of Iranian assets to convince Tehran for negotiations. In the decades since, sanctions have become an oft-used tool of US foreign policy. As economic warfare becomes the new normal in the emerging global order, the very success of US foreign policy hinges on the dollar’s dominance.
 
 

At the moment, there’s no real challenger to the dollar’s dominance. The US offers a deep and liquid market for a most desirable single asset, namely the US treasuries. Neither the EU nor China have anything similar. Even if China were to try to offer something, it would have to run trade deficits, something that goes against the agenda of export-driven growth. Concurrently, the significant heft of the US economy will ensure the dollar’s dominance as, according to the IMF, the US made up 26pc of the world’s GDP in 2024, slightly up from 25pc in 1980 — an impressive feat, especially with China’s growth during that time.
Still, the dollar’s reign is not immune to bad policies. Though White played a seminal role, the dollar was bound to become dominant as the US was economically the most powerful country at the end of World War II. Over the next decades, the dollar also attained dominance partly because of the high quality of US institutions, democracy, checks and balances, property rights, etc. With its strong institutions, the US economic system was rightly expected to withstand extreme crises or ‘black swans’.
Now, however, there is a chance that in the haste to implement their political agenda, US policymakers might end up committing a faux pas. Some analysts have noted gravely that the so-called Overton window, or policies viewed as acceptable, is widening under the present administration.
Once considered unthinkable, public pressure on the Fed chair to lower interest rates as well as the abrupt dismissal of the commissioner of the Bureau of Labour Statistics have raised concerns about the sanctity of US institutions. In a sense, this ostensible indifference towards checks and balances has raised concerns about the future quality of US institutions, and hence the dollar’s continued dominance.
 
 

US policymakers may also want to revisit their haphazard use of sanctions. The number of individuals subject to US sanctions rose from 912 in 2000 to about 9,400 in 2021. Such extensive use of sanctions may provide increased incentives for countries to diversify away from the dollar, especially when the BRICS nations develop potential dollar alternatives in the future.
All in all, attenuation of the dollar’s dominance might not be a bad thing. Financial stability may actually increase with more international currencies, providing more safe havens during crises. In fact, the dollar’s share of global reserves has been gradually declining for the past two decades as central banks have been shifting away.
King Dollar still rules global finance, but its crown is not unassailable. Strategic depreciation may aid trade, yet reckless policies and the excessive use of sanctions risk weakening its reign. A future with rival international currencies may bring stability, but for now, the dollar’s dominance endures as long as the US upholds the strong institutions that made it king.

This generated a surge in national pride and self-confidence. Civil-military relations appear to be smooth and friction-free. Progress has also been made in achieving short-term macroeconomic stability as a result of the government’s measures. The country no longer faces an economic emergency as it did a year ago when it was teetering on the brink of sovereign debt default. Leaderless and divided, the opposition poses little threat to the government, at least for now. All this has created an aura of stability and indicates a positive near-term outlook.
While it is important to acknowledge the gains Pakistan has recently made on various fronts, caution is warranted as the foundation for longer-term political and economic stability remains to be built. This requires addressing structural issues and dealing with the country’s enduring fault lines. It is a task waiting to be done.
 
 

Take the case of the economy. An IMF bailout programme and implementation of several of its conditionalities have helped to stabilise the economy. But economic recovery remains fragile and the country still has to make the transition from stabilisation to growth and investment. Moreover, stabilisation has yet to involve building sufficient capacity to repay loans without resorting to more borrowing at a time when debt levels are unsustainable and external financing needs are large in the coming years. Constant requests for loan rollovers to lenders indicate the persisting lack of repaying capacity.
The country remains mired in a low-growth, low-investment, high-debt equilibrium trap. There is no escape from this unless structural issues are tackled. This requires bold, wide-ranging reforms that deal with the sources of chronic internal and external financial imbalances. It involves first and foremost, tax reform to make the regime simple and equitable. The tax base remains extremely narrow with several (politically significant) sectors either untaxed or lightly taxed. The export base is also narrow; little surprise that exports have fallen to eight per cent of GDP from 16pc a decade ago.
There has been no movement on privatising loss-making state-owned enterprises which are such a drain on the exchequer. Among other structural issues that need to be resolved are the energy sector’s circular debt, a heavy, burdensome regulatory regime and the state’s inordinately large presence in the economy that discourages investment. Private investment is stagnant. At 13pc of GDP, investment is the lowest among regional peers.
Lack of investment in human capital also constrains economic growth and contributes to the country’s economic weakness. Failure to invest in people has relegated Pakistan to the bottom of global human development rankings. Key indicators of literacy, education, health and other aspects of human welfare have deteriorated in recent years with poverty rising to 44pc. Underinvestment in education has meant 40pc of Pakistanis remain illiterate while 26 million school-age children are out of school, which is a national scandal. This enduring fault line has serious consequences for Pakistan’s long-term stability, one that suffers from neglect.

Building durable stability requires addressing structural problems and overcoming fault lines.

On the political front, the PML-N-led government began its tenure with questionable legitimacy after a disputed election. It has now all but neutralised the main opposition party, PTI through a combination of electoral chicanery, legal manoeuvres, crackdowns, arrests, repressive measures, and, of course, by confining Imran Khan to jail. This has enabled the government to keep the opposition at bay, muzzle dissenting voices and rule virtually unhindered.
This may establish temporary ‘calm’ but is a recipe for instability ahead. The opposition represents a large section of society, has a significant parliamentary presence and runs the KP government. Efforts to marginalise it, far from contributing to political stability, detracts from it. It deepens polarisation in the country and fuels uncertainty.
The marked drift to authoritarianism, also reflected in a slew of laws that undermine judicial independence and criminalise free speech, is in fact a threat to stability. The way to build lasting political stability is not by autocratising the country but by strengthening constitutional democracy and rule of law and accommodating the opposition rather than suppressing it. Intolerance of opposition and criticism may have a long pedigree in the country’s history but it is a fault line that needs to be overcome.
 
 

Civil-military relations are tension-free today because the government has ceded unprecedent­ed space to the military in the so-called hybrid system. The military’s role in governance is the most expansive under any civilian government. But this doesn’t guarantee stability. It could arguably do so if the military acted as a transformational agent committed to reform. But the status quo orientation of the managers of the hybrid arrangement does little for long-term stability or for economic development. Hybrid government distorts the political system, involves power without responsibility and creates a disconnect with both democratic principles and public aspirations, which expect those they have elected to run the government.
The internal security situation continues to pose a threat to the country’s stability despite determined efforts by the army and other law- enforcement personnel. There have been notable counterterrorism successes. But the alarming deterioration in security, driven by militant violence across KP and Balochistan, has yet to be reversed. This made last year the deadliest in a decade in casualties suffered by security forces.
Balochistan, of course, presents a special case as the underlying sources of long-standing public disaffection need to be addressed. Insurgents have to be isolated and the trust of the local community won. But in conflating militants with Baloch nationalists and casting every dissident group and political leader as traitors and abettors of terrorists, state policy contradicts the fundamental principle of fighting militancy, which is not to multiply the number of adversaries.
 
 

Engaging with the grievances that militants and foreign powers exploit is essential for an effective counter-insurgency strategy. This means law enforcement must be accompanied by political, economic and social measures to win hearts and minds. Without that, restoring stability to the province will remain elusive.
These different challenges require reframing the stability paradigm so that policies are crafted to deal with structural problems which stand in the way of achieving durable stability. This needs, above all, a break from the business-as-usual, muddle-through approach of the past.

• Warns against foreign powers seeking to create internal rifts
TEHRAN: Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday called for a united national front to confront what he described as US efforts to subjugate the Islamic republic.
The remarks, delivered at a mosque in the capital Tehran and published on Khamenei’s official website, come two months since fighting halted between Iran and its sworn enemy Israel in a war that the United States had briefly joined, and as Tehran is engaged in talks with world powers about its nuclear programme.
The rare Israeli and US attacks in June, which targeted key nuclear sites and prompted Iranian retaliation, were designed to destabilise the Islamic republic, Khamenei argued.
He said that a day after “Iran was attacked” by Israel at the start of the war, “American agents” met in Europe “to discuss what government should rule Iran after the Islamic republic”.
Khamenei claimed that the United States was ultimately seeking to make Iran “obedient to it”.
To the leader, the country has emerged strong from the 12-day war in June, the most intense direct confrontation in its history with arch foes Israel and the United States.
“The Iranian nation, by standing firm alongside the armed forces, the government and the system, delivered a strong blow” to its enemies, Khamenei said.
The supreme leader, who has the final say on state affairs, also warned against internal divisions he said foreign powers were fomenting.
 
 

“The way forward for the enemy is to create discord” in Iran, he said, blaming “agents of America and the Zionist regime” — a reference to Israel — for seeking to sow division.
“Today, thanks to God, the country is united. There are differences of opinion, but when it comes to defending the system, defending the country, and standing up against the enemy, the people are united,” Khamenei added.
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied.
The June war broke out as Tehran and Washington were due to hold their sixth round of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, but the negotiations that had begun weeks earlier were derailed by the conflict.
Iran is due to meet on Tuesday with Britain, France and Germany for nuclear talks, as the European powers have threatened to reimpose sanctions if no agreement is reached.

The UN’s Integrated Food Security Phase Classification panel announced this grim ‘milestone’ on Friday, confirming what many had already known, thanks to the harrowing images coming out of the besieged Palestinian territory. But Israel, which is responsible for this crime, and the US, Tel Aviv’s principal foreign backer, refuse to believe this inconvenient truth, despite the fact that there is widespread consensus on who caused the Gaza famine.
 
 

The findings say that half a million people face “catastrophic hunger” in Gaza City, while famine conditions are likely to spread to other parts of the Strip. Reacting to UN officials’ statement that the famine is the result of “systemic obstruction” by Israel, the Zionist state’s prime minister has dismissed the findings as an “outright lie”. The US State Department, meanwhile, has also cast doubts over the UN body’s findings, saying that Hamas was promoting a “false narrative” regarding mass starvation in Gaza.
Although many of their elders were murdered and starved by Nazi Germany, Israel’s current rulers seem intent on replicating the repulsive tactics of the Third Reich. After all, Gaza has been transformed into a modern concentration camp, with tens of thousands of Palestinians — including innocent children — murdered by Israeli forces in much the same fashion as Hitler’s troops butchered European Jews.
Moreover, the heart-wrenching images coming out of Gaza, particularly of starving, lifeless youngsters and babies, bear a striking resemblance to the gaunt, ghostly pictures of the victims of the Holocaust. Along with imitating Nazi tactics in the form of genocide and ethnic cleansing, and manufacturing a famine in the occupied territory by severely restricting the entry of food and water, Tel Aviv and its American supporters have also seemingly mastered the Nazis’ dark art of propaganda. Denying that there is a famine when all credible international institutions say Gaza is being purposely starved is a clear example of this.
 
 

There is little doubt that genocide and starvation in Gaza are a stain on humanity’s conscience. Many states and institutions have expressed their shock over the UN panel’s findings regarding famine. However, empty rhetoric and ‘thoughts and prayers’ will not ease the Palestinians’ plight. If the international community is serious about ending Israeli crimes in Gaza, then there must be solid action.
Until Tel Aviv declares an unconditional ceasefire and lifts the Gaza siege by allowing in food, water, fuel and medicine, all UN member states should impose a trade and weapons embargo on Israel. The Arab and Muslim states must lead the way. It cannot be business as usual with Israel as long as it starves and slaughters innocent people.

An official told the BBC that the man “has been arrested for perjury”.
In early July, the middle-aged man had lodged a police complaint and appe­ared before a magistrate to record his statement.
His identity has been withheld and, so far, he has appeared in public dressed fully in black, including a hood and a face mask. In the police complaint, the man claimed he worked as a cleaner at the temple from 1995 to 2014 — and alleged that he had been forced to bury the bodies of hundreds of girls and young women who were brutally raped and murdered.
He narrated five alleged incidents where he gave specifics, and said there were many others. Some of the victims, the man alleged, were minors.
He said he had been in hiding since 2014 and had returned and spoken up to silence his nagging conscience.
The man did not name anyone, but blamed the “temple administration and its staff” — allegations the temple chief rejected as “false and baseless”.
A spokesperson for the temple said it welcomed a thorough investigation and hoped police would “bring out true facts to light”.
In the complaint, the former cleaner accused temple officials of forcing him to dispose of the bodies and told police he would name the officials if they protected him and his family.
Karnataka’s interior min­­ister Gangadharaiah Parameshwara told the state assembly last week that the protection was in place. The former cleaner said he had secretly exhumed a skeleton from one of the burial sites to prove his claims.
A special investigation team formed by the Karn­ataka government later recovered human remains from two of 16 suspected burial sites, according to two senior police officials familiar with the probe.

• Israel pounds Gaza City suburbs, vows to press on with offensive
• Forces re-enter Jabalia to strengthen control
ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar will reject Israel’s “outrageous” plan to occupy Gaza at the upcoming extraordinary session of the Organ­isation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers (OIC-CFM) in Jeddah, the Foreign Office said on Sunday.
Mr Dar will undertake an official visit to Saudi Arabia from Aug 25 to 26 to participate in the meeting, where OIC member states will “deliberate upon coordinated responses to the escalating developments in Palestine, resulting from ongoing Israeli military aggression, its proposed plans for full military control over Gaza and the continued egregious violations of Palestinians’ rights”, the FO statement said.
 






The deputy premier will “advocate for total withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Palestinian territories, reject the outrageous Israeli plan for extending full military control over Gaza and further displacement of Palestinians; emphasise the urgent need of unhindered humanitarian assistance”.
He will “reaffirm Pakistan’s unwavering support for Palestine and reiterate its principled stance” and call for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, most notably, the establishment of an independent, contiguous, and sovereign Palestinian state.
Israel pounds Gaza City
The extraordinary meeting comes as Israeli planes and tanks continue to pound the eastern and northern outskirts of Gaza City, destroying buildings and homes.
As Israeli leaders vowed to press on with a planned offensive on the city, witnesses reported the sound of explosions non-stop overnight in the areas of Zeitoun and Shejaia, while tanks shelled houses and roads in the nearby Sabra neighbourhood and several buildings were blown up in the northern town of Jabalia.
Fire lit the skies from the direction of the explosions, causing panic, prompting some families to stream out of the city. Others said they would prefer to die and not leave.
The Israeli military said on Sunday that its forces have returned to combat in the Jabalia area in recent days to strengthen control of the area. It added that the operation there enables the expansion of combat into additional areas and prevents Hamas from returning to operate in these areas.
Control of Gaza City
Earlier this month, Israel approved a plan to seize control of Gaza City, describing it as the last bastion of Hamas.
Defence Minister Israel Katz on Sunday vowed to press on with the offensive on the city where famine has been declared, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. Katz has said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas agrees to Israel’s terms.
Hamas said Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it wasn’t serious about a ceasefire. It said a ceasefire agreement was the only way to return the Israeli prisoners, holding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for their lives.
The proposal on the table calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living Israeli prisoners held in Gaza and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Once a temporary ceasefire begins, the proposal is for Hamas and Israel to begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire that would include the return of the remaining Israeli prisoners.
On Thursday, Netanyahu said that Israel would immediately resume negotiations for the release of all 50 Israeli prisoners — of whom Israel believes around 20 are still living - and an end to the nearly two-year-old war but on terms acceptable to Israel.
Famine
Around half of the Palestinian enclave’s two million people currently live in Gaza City. Thousands have already left, carrying their belongings on vehicles and rickshaws.
“I stopped counting the times I had to take my wife and three daughters and leave my home in Gaza City,” said Mohammad, 40, via a chat app. “No place is safe, but I can’t take the risk. If they suddenly begin the invasion, they will use heavy fire.” Others said they will not leave, no matter what.
 
 

A global hunger monitor said last week that Gaza City and surrounding areas are officially suffering from famine that will likely spread.
On Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said eight more people died of malnutrition and starvation in the enclave, raising deaths from such causes to 289 people, including 115 children.

Unreliable figures on total acreage and production of a specific crop have remained a persistent issue for the country.
The lack of accurate information makes it difficult for stakeholders, including government departments, to frame import and export strategies to meet national needs.
The new satellite-based system, set to be launched next year, is expected to resolve this long-standing problem.

Initiative may help streamline discrepancies between data released by crop reporting body and cotton ginners

This initiative, a brainchild of the Special Investment Faci­li­tation Council (SIFC), will involve a collaboration between China and the country’s Land Info­rmation  and Management System (LIMS), launched in 2023 to optimise agricultural production through innovative technologies, and sustainable agricultural practices.
This move is likely to help settle a major controversy, surrounding the methodology used by the Punjab Crop Reporting Service (CRS) to determine provincial cotton output, which has been dogged by allegations of inflated and misleading statistics.
CRS authorities, however, accuse cotton ginners of under-invoicing and calculating only the raw cotton arriving at the factory gate, instead of estimating harvests directly from fields.
According to its detractors, the service is allegedly estimating total cotton production using hypothetical calculations — extrapolating yields based on the number of bolls per plant across an acre or, in some districts, from small sample plots as small as eight feet by six feet.
This has exposed a long-standing discrepancy between the figures reported by CRS Punjab and those of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA), with the former consistently reporting significantly higher production.
This variance has long complicated decision-making for stakeholders in the cotton industry. While some attribute the CRS’ inflated figures to unrecorded lint sales by certain ginners, the presence of two conflicting national datasets has damaged Pakistan’s credibility in international cotton forums.
In FY25, the CRS said that seed cotton production in Punjab had reached 609,000 bales based on harvesting data recorded up to July 31. In contrast, PCGA reported only 301,000 bales, less than half the official figure.
The CRS defended its data saying the figures are derived using internationally recognised, scientifically proven methods – including randomised sampling and ground truthing techniques widely adopted for yield estimation in various countries.
CRS DG Dr Abdul Qayyum explained that the service employs GPS-enabled tools and FAO-endorsed methodologies, supported by a real-time digital dashboard that ensures transparency and facilitates evidence-based policy decisions.
He argued that the PCGA figures reflect only the cotton arriving at operational ginning factories in Punjab, regardless of its origin.
The PCGA figures also do not account for the seed cotton still held at the farm level, transferred to other provinces, or stored by stockists, he insists. “The persistent under-invoicing in recent years has also significantly undermined the accuracy of cotton reporting at ginning factories,” he added.
“We emphasise that the official record of national cotton production is based on crop reporting estimates compiled from all provinces. Therefore, comparing these figures with PCGA’s fortnightly ginning data is unjustified,” he stressed.
To avoid any confusion, the CRS official asked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to implement a foolproof mechanism at all operational ginning factories to ensure accurate and real-time reporting of the cotton received and processed.
“This step is essential for enhancing transparency, strengthening data integrity, and supporting coordinated efforts across institutions involved in cotton monitoring and policy formulation.”
APTMA ready to take over PCCC
In another development, the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) has expressed interest in taking over the Pakistan Central Cotton Committee (PCCC).
The move follows a recent meeting on cotton revival chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, during which a long-standing issue regarding billions of rupees in outstanding funds from APTMA to PCCC was resolved. Sources indicate that the PCCC has agreed to the proposal.
If the takeover goes ahead, it is expected to accelerate cotton research in the country, leading to the development of new, high-yielding, and climate-resilient varieties, said Cotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq. This, in turn, could significantly increase Pakistan’s per-acre cotton yield.
Meanwhile, recent rains across most cotton-growing regions of Pakistan have led to a shortage of high-quality cotton, pushing prices higher. Cotton prices rose by Rs200 to Rs300 per maund, reaching Rs16,400 to Rs16,600 per maund in various local markets.
Mr Haq warned that if the Pakistani rupee continues to depreciate against the US dollar, cotton prices may rise even further.

• PTI’s Muzammil Aslam says KP will seek disincentivising  population, propose prosperity and forestation as criteria for  resource distribution
• KP minister rues imbalance in Centre’s approach to smaller provinces
NATHIA GALI: For a change, the federal government led by the PML-N and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government headed by the PTI seem to be in agreement on changes to the oversized population factor in determining the share of the federation and its federating units under the new National Finance Commission (NFC), set to hold its introductory meeting later this week.
“We will demand that population and backwardness should be disincentivised for resource distribution among the provinces,” said KP Mini­ster for Finance Muzammil Aslam while speaking at the first two-day ‘Prosper Pakistan’ conference organised by the FPCCI Regional Office Peshawar in collaboration with KP’s Board of Investment and Trade.
The federal ministers, particularly development minister Ahsan Iqbal, had been publicly calling for disincentivising the population for NFC shares, although no political party in any province has ever called for the population to secure more funds from the divisible pool. However, the allegations of irregularities in the population census have cropped up in the past, which required improvement in census methodologies. The first meeting of the 11th NFC, constituted last week, has been scheduled for August 29 (Friday) to set the stage for subsequent deliberations.
The apparent converging stance of the two arch rivals — the PML-N and the PTI — is likely to put the two larger provinces, Punjab and Sindh, under immense pressure for disincentivising population as the key determinant for the distribution of divisible pool resources. The revision, however, also benefits Balochistan, the sparsely populated largest province by area.
 
 

Led by President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the political partners at the Centre and backed by the relevant quarters, it would be very challenging for junior leaderships of the ruling parties in Sindh and Punjab to resist reducing the importance of population to work out vertical shares of the federation and its federation units and then decide horizontal shares of the provinces.
Mr Muzammil said the KP government would demand changes in the formula of the horizontal resource distribution within the federating units during the upcoming NFC deliberations. He said 82pc resource distribution among the provinces was based on the population criterion and 10.6pc on the basis of backwardness, but the KP government would now stipulate reduction in population, prosperity, and forestation as criteria for the distribution of resources.
He said the new NFC had been constituted to evolve a consensus on the vertical and horizontal distribution of financial resources. The provinces currently receive 57.5pc share under the vertical formula, while the remaining amount goes to the federal government. He said the KP would demand changes in the criteria for the horizontal distribution as well.
‘Imbalance in development approach’
KP’s finance minister, who hails from Karachi, criticised the federal government, saying the National Highway Authority (NHA) was used for the road and highway projects in Punjab and Sindh, but it ignored the KP and Balochistan.
“This imbalance in the development approach has aggravated the situation in the smaller provinces”, while the planning minister Ahsan Iqbal was talking about the collapse of the federal government in five years due to its financial constraints as the development budgets of Sindh and Punjab exceeded that of the Centre.
 
 

He told the participants that 12 hydropower projects were currently under construction in KP capable of producing 1,000MW at an estimated supply cost of 8 US cents per unit. However, he said the government had increased the wheeling charges to Rs27 per unit that would block cheaper electricity from the province.
He regretted that the Left Bank Canal could not be constructed in more than three decades since the water apportionment accord was signed in 1991.
Under the 7th NFC award delivered in 2009 and still in force after 15 years instead of a five-year constitutional term, the provincial share had increased to 57.5pc from about 47pc which further increased to about 59pc given special allocations to Balochistan, KP and Sindh on different grounds and reduced the federal share to 42.5pc.
 
 

In subsequent years, the Centre imposed a petroleum levy (about Rs1.5 trillion) on petroleum products and secured about Rs1.5tr cash balances from the provinces on an annual basis, effectively reversing the financial balance to its favour. The Centre, however, has been advocating disincentivising the population factor and provincial shares to common responsibilities like dams, natural disasters, climate change and national security etc.

According to a provisional schedule shared by UN officials, Pakistan may have a strategic advantage of speaking after India, giving it a direct platform to respond to New Delhi’s narrative.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will lead a high-level Pakistani delegation, which will include Deputy Prime Mini­ster Ishaq Dar, as well as the PM’s adviser on foreign affairs, Tariq Fatemi.
 
 

The 80th UNGA officially opens on Sept 9, with the high-level general debate running from Sept 23 to 29.
Brazil will speak first, followed by the US, where President Trump will deliver his first address to the UNGA in his second term.
This year’s theme is: ‘Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights.’
According to the provisional list, India’s premier will speak in the morning, while Pakistan’s leader, along with the heads of Israel, China, and Bangladesh, is scheduled for later that day. Officials in New Delhi have indicated that their prime minister will also participate in the general debate.
Observers note that the back-to-back appearances of PM Shehbaz and Modi will underline the gulf in perspectives. While India is expected to stress sovereignty and security, Pakistan will be able to respond directly, emphasising Kashmir and regional peace as core issues.
A senior Pakistani diplomat said: “The world has seen how quickly South Asia can slide toward conflict. Without a just settlement of Kashmir, the UN’s own pro­mise of peace, development, and human rights cannot be fulfilled in our region.”
The 80th UNGA promises to be one of the busiest diplomatic seasons in years, taking place amid the Israel’s war on Gaza, the Ukraine conflict, and the lingering aftereffects of the May India-Pakistan war. For Islamabad, the message is clear: the world cannot ignore South Asia’s flashpoints, and Kashmir remains the key to lasting peace.
According to the provisional schedule, a special event on climate will be held on Sept 24, while a high-level meeting to commemorate and promote the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons will be held on Sept 26.

• NDMA says 788 lives lost to rains, floods over two months
PESHAWAR: At least 13 people were killed and 52 others injured in rain-related incidents as heavy downpours lashed several districts of Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa over the weekend.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), the death toll from floods and rains in the province has risen to 409 since Aug 15, with 251 people injured.
The PDMA report said the victims included 305 men, 55 women and 49 children. Among the injured were 183 men, 38 women and 30 children. Rains and floods have also destroyed 578 houses and partially damaged 2,954 across the province.
In Dera Ismail Khan, eight people were killed and 48 were injured after torrential rains and strong winds wreaked havoc on Saturday night. Three children lost their lives in Lower Dir when a house collapsed, while one fatality was reported in Mardan and another in Upper Kohistan.
A severe rainstorm caused widespread damage, crippling the power supply and destroying homes, solar panels and public infrastructure. Wind speeds reached up to 100 km/h, uprooting trees, toppling poles and collapsing walls and roofs. The district plunged into darkness after feeders tripped and the power system collapsed.
Officials confirmed that five of the deceased belonged to Dera tehsil and three to Paharpur tehsil. In Maryali, a wall of Jamiatul Madina collapsed, destroying a solar plant but causing no casualties.
Hospitals declared emergencies to treat the injured, while Dera Commissioner Zafarul Islam Khattak urged residents to avoid unnecessary travel during stormy weather. He directed that all available resources be deployed to provide medical assistance.
Punjab on high alert
The Punjab government is on high alert as heavy monsoon rains continue to swell rivers across the province. An official flood alert from India reported a “high flood”  level in the Tawi River at Jammu on Aug 24, prompting emergency measures  downstream.
 
 

Secretary of the Department of Emergency Services Dr  Rizwan Naseer made an emergency visit to Sialkot to inspect flood defences at the Head Marala Barrage and the Marala Flood Control Room.  Rescue operations are underway, with more than 21,000 people already evacuated from vulnerable areas.
The Chenab River basin is a particular point of concern, with key sites like Marala, Khanki, and  Qadirabad showing significant inflows. While these locations are currently within normal limits, the rising inflows at Khanki and the substantial water volumes pose a latent threat for the next 48 hours.
High flood at Indus, Chenab
Meanwhile, the Flood Fore­casting Division (FFD) warned on Sunday that the Chenab and Indus rivers are likely to reach high flood levels within 24 hours, while the Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala will remain in high flood for the next few days, subject to water releases from India.
Flash floods are expected in the nullahs of Dera Ghazi Khan and northeastern Balochistan, while medium to high flows are predicted in nullahs linked to the Ravi and Chenab. Urban flooding is forecast for Lahore, Gujranwala and Rawalpindi in the next two days.
Heavy rainfall is expected in upper Punjab, particularly over the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum catchments, from Aug 25 to 27. The Indus River is already in high flood at Guddu and medium flood at Sukkur, while the River Sutlej is in medium flood at Ganda Singh Wala.
Water levels at Tarbela and Mangla reservoirs are nearing their maximum conservation limits.
In Vehari district, floodwaters from the Sutlej River worsened after India released water, submerging rural localities. Authorities have established three tent villages in Jam Laira, Farooqabad and Sahooka to house the displaced.
According to an official handout, Deputy Com­mission­er Imrana Tau­qeer said the top priority was shifting affected people to safer locations. So far, 371 residents and 26 cattle have been moved. Seven flooded settlements have been evacuated.
 
 

In Sahiwal and adjacent districts, a medium-level flood along the Sutlej River has displaced more than 1,450 people and 450 livestock in the past 48 hours. Over 40 kilometres of the river belt from Pir Ghani to Irazi Bali Dilawar is underwater.
Rescue teams have deployed dozens of boats and over 100 personnel to evacuate stranded villagers in Pakpattan, Bahawal­na­gar and Okara. Officials warned that water discharge levels at Herikey and Ganda Singh Wala exceeded 126,000 cusecs.
Standing crops across thousands of acres have been destroyed. Locals have demanded urgent medical aid, vaccination for livestock and measures against waterborne diseases.
Former Punjab chief minister Manzoor Ahmad Khan Wattoo urged the government to declare the affected districts as calamity-hit areas. He criticised India’s release of floodwaters and described it as “water terrorism”.
In Narowal, Rescue 1122 evacuated 30 people, including women, after a sudden flood surge in Nala Auj, which merges into the Ravi River at Shakargarh. The surge submerged hundreds of acres of farmland and damaged protective embankments.
Floodwaters also entered homes and livestock enclosures in nearby villages. District officials said Section 144 has been imposed to ban bathing in rivers and drains after three villagers went missing in Nala Dek.
Nationwide toll
Since June 26, torrential rains and floods have claimed 788 lives, injured 1,018 people, damaged 6,630 houses and killed 5,548 livestock across the country, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). The deceased included 200 children, 471 men and 117 women.
Punjab recorded 165 deaths, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 469, Sindh 51, Balochistan 24, Gilgit-Baltistan 45, Azad Jammu and Kashmir 23, and Islamabad eight.

The National Disaster Management Authority said that in collaboration with the Pakistan Army and partners, it has distributed over 83,649 relief items to flood-affected communities.
Key supplies include tents, blankets, hygiene kits, ration bags, food packs, and drinking water. Additional support, such as solar panels, de-watering pumps, and generators, has been provided to aid recovery efforts.
Widespread flooding has caused extensive damage acr­oss the country, affecting at least 6,630 homes, of which 1,562 were destroyed while 5,068 sustained partial damage.
The National Disaster Management Authority has set up 564 relief and medical camps across the country. Of these, 45 medical camps have provided treatment to 3,227 individuals, while 519 relief camps have extended shelter and essential services to 29,311 people.

The Briton was in complete control throughout, breaking Shibahara’s serve routinely on her way to a 6-1, 6-2 drubbing on the Louis Armstrong Stadium showcourt.
The win was Raducanu’s first at the US Open since she made history four years ago, winning the championship as a little-known qualifier at the age of 18.
She was knocked out in the US Open first round in 2022, missed the 2023 tournament due to injury, and exited in the first round again in 2024.
“I’m very pleased to have come through that match,” Raducanu said afterwards. “First rounds are very challenging always, the nerves, and I wanted to win a match here really bad.”
Raducanu admitted that her failure to win in New York since her memorable title triumph four years ago had begun to weigh on her.
“It has been on my mind,” she said. “It’s been four years, and it’s a very special tournament for me. I did feel different coming into it this year.
“I felt like I was doing the right things day-to-day, but still, it’s in the back of your head. So I’m just very pleased to have overcome that.”
Raducanu added that a rushed start early Sunday had added to her nervousness beforehand.
“I was nervous this morning after practice. There’s not much time playing first on,” she said. “You’re kind of rushing to do things.
“After I came out of the shower, I felt like I kind of just got into the zone, got my match kit on, and that, for me, is a shift of, ‘OK, you’re going to get ready, lock in now.’ Then I relaxed.”
Raducanu, who describes the US Open as her “happy place” despite her record since 2021, said her mood is brightened by seeing familiar faces that she remembers from four years ago.
“There was this one security guard who is still here working,” she said. “Whenever I see him, he was there from the very, very start of the first round of quallies, second round, and all the way through to the final, and to see him around is really special.”
The unseeded Raducanu will face either 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova or Indonesia’s Janice Tjen in the second round.</p><small>2025-08-24 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/242318199d58127.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936910/man-utd-still-winless-after-fulham-draw-everton-win-to-open-new-stadium' target='_blank'><strong>Man Utd still winless after Fulham draw, Everton win to open new stadium</strong></a><br><p>Manchester United remain without a Premier League win this season after being held 1-1 at Fulham on Sunday, while a Jack Grealish-inspired Everton opened their new stadium with a 2-0 victory over Brighton.
Ruben Amorim’s United were left to rue Bruno Fernandes’ wayward first-half penalty as they were pegged back at Craven Cottage.
Rodrigo Muniz’s own-goal put United in front on the hour mark, but Emile Smith Rowe came off the bench to rescue a point for Fulham.
Amorim is seeking an upturn on a disastrous 15th-placed finish last season, but so far his new £200 million ($270 million) forward line of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko, who again started on the bench, has yet to fire.
Despite an encouraging performance, United lost 1-0 to title-chasing Arsenal in their season opener last weekend and will feel another two points slipped away in west London.

Fulham, though, felt the visitors got the better of two controversial calls.
United’s penalty was awarded after a VAR review for grappling by Calvin Bassey on Mason Mount.
Fernandes is normally reliable from the spot, but blasted his effort high over the bar.
When United did finally get their first goal of the season it came via a Fulham body as Muniz deflected Leny Yoro’s header into his own net.
However, the home side were furious that this time VAR did not intervene for a push by Yoro on Bassey.
Fulham still managed to rescue a point when former Arsenal midfielder Smith Rowe’s run into the box was not tracked and he turned in Alex Iwobi’s cross 17 minutes from time.
Everton’s new era
After an emotional goodbye to Goodison Park, the club’s home since 1892, Everton is hoping the move to a new 53,000-capacity stadium will rekindle their bygone glory days.
Only four clubs have won more English top-flight titles than Everton’s nine.
However, they have not won a major trophy for 30 years and spent their final seasons at Goodison battling relegation.
“We’re trying to find a way of moving the club on. I think this is a big step forward for Everton,” said manager David Moyes.

Grealish has so far been the marquee new addition to Moyes’ squad and showed glimpses of the talent that saw Manchester City pay Aston Villa 100 million for him four years ago, providing the assist for both goals.
Iliman Ndiaye scored the final goal at Goodison against Southampton in May and made more history with the first goal at Everton’s new home. Grealish was the creator with a drilled left-foot cross that Ndiaye timed his run perfectly to meet at the back post on 23 minutes.
Brighton should not have come away from Merseyside empty-handed but wasted a series of chances.
Kaoru Mitoma struck the bar and Jan Paul van Hecke’s effort came back off the post, while Danny Welbeck spooned over with the goal gaping.
James Garner doubled Everton’s lead early in the second period with a blistering strike from Grealish’s lay-off.
Brighton still had the chance to set up a nervy finale, but Jordan Pickford saved Welbeck’s poor penalty to round off a memorable afternoon for the Toffees.
Nuno no go
Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo insisted he wants to remain in charge after his side’s 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace.
Callum Hudson-Odoi rescued a point for Forest after Ismaila Sarr’s first-half opener for Palace.

Nuno said on Friday his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis had deteriorated as odds on him being the first Premier League manager of the season to be sacked were slashed.
“That is nonsense. That does not make any kind of sense,” said the Portuguese coach on whether he is trying to engineer an exit from the club.</p><small>2025-08-24 18:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/242245504ecfdb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936908/israeli-strikes-in-yemens-capital-kill-two-houthis-say' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli strikes in Yemen’s capital kill two, Houthis say</strong></a><br><p>Israel struck Yemen’s capital Sanaa on Sunday, killing at least two people, according to the country’s Houthi rebels, who have repeatedly launched missiles and drones at Israel throughout the Gaza conflict.
AFP images showed a large fireball lighting up the skies over the rebel-held Yemeni capital, leaving behind a column of thick, black smoke.
The Houthis’ health ministry reported “two martyrs and 35 wounded” in the Israeli raid.
A Houthi security source told AFP that the air raid targeted a municipal building in central Sanaa, while the group’s Al-Masirah TV channel reported that the two dead were in a strike on an oil company facility in the city.
The channel said the targets also included a power station in Sanaa’s south that was previously hit last Sunday.
The Israeli army said it had targeted Houthi military sites in Sanaa, including areas near the presidential palace, two power plants and a fuel storage facility.
“The strikes were conducted in response to repeated attacks by the Houthi terrorist regime against the State of Israel and its civilians,” the military said in a statement.
Late on Friday, the Houthis fired a missile that Israeli authorities said had “most likely fragmented in mid-air”.
Since October 2023, the Houthis have repeatedly fired missiles and drones at Israel, claiming to be acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. Most of the Houthi attacks have been intercepted, but they have prompted retaliatory Israeli air strikes on rebel targets in Yemen.
On August 17, Israel said it targeted an energy infrastructure site in Sanaa linked to the Houthis, with Al-Masirah reporting at the time the capital’s Haziz power station was hit. The latest Israeli statement said the Haziz facility was targeted again on Sunday.
A photographer working with AFP reported significant damage after the August 17 strike.
Beyond attacks on Israel itself, the Houthis have also targeted ships they say are linked to Tel Aviv in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden off Yemen.
The group broadened its campaign to target ships tied to the United States and Britain after the two countries began military strikes aimed at securing the waterway in January 2024.
In May, the rebels cemented a ceasefire with the United States that ended weeks of intense US strikes, but vowed to continue targeting Israeli ships.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said earlier this month that the Houthis would “pay with compound interest for every attempt to fire at Israel”.</p><small>2025-08-24 18:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/24173602dfa56c5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871/fm-dar-meets-bangladeshs-yunus-during-historic-visit-as-revitalising-saarc-comes-under-focus' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar meets Bangladesh’s Yunus during historic visit as ‘revitalising Saarc’ comes under focus</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday met Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus during his landmark visit to Dhaka during which the latter stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).
Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
The Foreign Office has termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.
According to a post on X by the Foreign Office (FO), Dar called on Yunus and apprised him of the developments during his trip. The pair discussed “recent developments in the region and the prospects of regional cooperation”.
“The discussion covered revival of old connections between the two countries, promoting youth linkages, enhancing connectivity, and augmenting trade and economic cooperation,” the FO wrote.
 






According to a statement issued by Yunus’s office, the Bangladesh chief adviser during the meeting highlighted the importance of revitalising all potential avenues of regional and bilateral cooperation, urging progress in bilateral trade and emphasising the role of people-to-people connections —particularly among youth.
“I encourage Saarc, and I see our relationship with Pakistan and other Saarc countries as one of the highest priorities,” he said.
 






Later today, Dar called on Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Chairperson and ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia, according to an FO statement.
The Deputy PM conveyed Pakistan’s well-wishes and lauded Zia’s services as premier, also enquiring about her health. Zia has been in declining health for years, is confined to a wheelchair with rheumatoid arthritis and also suffers from diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver.
“The memories of Begum Zia’s visit to Pakistan in 2006 were also recalled,” the statement read.

Earlier, Pakistan and Bangladesh signed six agreements in various areas of cooperation following delegation-level talks between Dar and Bangladesh Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain.
Both leaders oversaw the signing of “six instruments”, FO Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said in a statement.
These included an agreement on visa abolition for diplomatic and official passport holders, as well as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on a Joint Working Group on trade.
 
 

Paki­stan and Bangladesh had agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side last month, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.
An MoU was also signed between the Foreign Service academies of both countries, while another MoU was inked between the Associated Press of Pakistan and the Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha to further media cooperation.
In the domain of academics, an MoU was signed between the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad and Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies, while a cultural exchange programme was also agreed upon.
“These agreements will institutionalise and further strengthen the bilateral cooperation in trade and economics, training of diplomats, academic exchanges, media cooperation and cultural exchanges,” the FO statement highlighted.
 






According to Bangladesh’s The Daily Star, Dar and Hossain first held a brief one-to-one discussion before leading their respective delegations in a formal meeting at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka.
During their wide-ranging talks, both sides reviewed the “entire gamut of bilateral relations”, the FO said on X.
“The talks took place in a constructive atmosphere, reflecting the existing goodwill and cordiality between [the] two countries. Both sides agreed to work for further strengthening of bilateral relations,” the FO noted. Hossain also hosted a lunch in Dar’s honour.
Matters discussed included “high-level exchanges, trade and economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts, cultural exchanges, cooperation on education and capacity building, and humanitarian issues”.
Regional and international issues, including rejuvenation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) and resolution of Palestine and the Rohingya issues, were also discussed.
Separately, Pakistan launched “Pakistan-Bangladesh Knowledge Corridor”, a project which envisages the grant of 500 scholarships to Bangladeshi students for pursuing higher studies in Pakistan during the next five years.
“A quarter of these scholarships will be awarded in the field of medicine. Additionally, training for 100 Bangladeshi civil servants will be arranged during the same period,” the FO said in a statement.
Pakistan will also increase the scholarships allocated to Bangladeshi students under the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme from five to 25.
 






Continuing his series of meetings with Bangladeshi politicians, Dar met Jamaat-i-Islami emir Dr Shafiqur Rahman at his residence.
The deputy premier, on his and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s behalf, conveyed his best wishes for good health to Rahman, who is recovering after a cardiac surgery.
Dar also appreciated Rahman’s “life-long positive contribution in the fields of politics, education and social welfare”, the FO said.
 






Meeting with commerce adviser, trade officials
In the morning, Dar and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan had a breakfast meeting with Commerce Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, who was accompanied by various finance and trade officials, the FO said on X.
“The two sides discussed ways to promote economic and commercial cooperation, with a special focus on enhancing trade and promoting connectivity,” the post said.
Bangladesh Investment Development Authority Chairman Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun, Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Ahsan H. Mansur, National Board of Revenue Chairman Abdur Rahman Khan and Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission Chairman Moinul Khan joined the meeting as well.
Other officials attending the gathering were textile ministry secretary Md Abdur Rauf, tourism ministry secretary Nasreen Jahan, Ministry of Commerce Secretary Mahbubur Rahman, Trading Corporation of Bangladesh Chairman Brigadier Gen Mohammad Faisal Azad and High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan Iqbal Hussain Khan, according to the FO.
 






Last night, Dar and Kamal attended a reception hosted by Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider.
In his remarks at the reception, the foreign minister underscored that the people of Pakistan had fraternal sentiments towards the people of Bangladesh, the FO said on X.
“He noted that the relations between the two countries were anchored in centuries-old shared traditions, Islamic heritage, social norms and literary expressions.”
 






Wishing the people of Bangladesh a harmonious and prosperous future, Dar expressed Pakistan’s “strong desire to forge a cooperative and forward-looking relationship with Bangladesh”.
The deputy PM interacted with personalities from “different walks of life, including advisers of the Bangladeshi government, bureaucrats, leadership of political parties, vice chancellors, members of intelligentsia and think tanks, sportsmen, artists, journalists, retired generals, and others”, the FO added.
Beginning his two-day visit yesterday, Dar met with the delegations of Bangladesh’s three political parties — National Citizens Party (NCP), Jamaat-i-Islami and the BNP.
The Daily Star, quoting unnamed foreign ministry officials, said the two sides are also planning to hold the long-stalled Joint Economic Commission meeting in September or October, two decades since its last session. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb may visit Dhaka for the meeting, the report added.

The statement added that Ruet-i-Hilal Committee meetings were held in Karachi and other cities of the country.
“The weather remained cloudy in most and most cities in Pakistan. No evidence of the moon being sighted was received from any city,” it read.
Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) spokesperson Anjum Nazir Zaighum told Dawn.com that the moon had not been sighted.
Additionally, a notification from the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony announced that the moon had not been sighted.
“Therefore, the 1st Rabiul Awwal, 1447AH, shall commence from Tuesday, August 26,” the notification read.

The Islamabad sit-in began on July 16, with BYC leaders and members demanding the release of its activists. Its chief, Dr Mahrang Baloch and other activists were arrested on March 22 for allegedly attacking Quetta Civil Hospital and inciting violence, a day after police cracked down on their protest.
According to the press release, available with Dawn.com, the group, during a press conference in Islamabad, expressed its willingness to continue the ongoing sit-in in the federal capital, stating that “one day these institutions will be forced to listen to our voice”.
“This protest is not just a protest of the Baloch people, it is a protest for justice,” the press release read. “This is a fight for human dignity and truth and it is the duty of all of us to support this fight.”
 






The statement read that the demonstrators had two demands: the release of Dr Mahrang and BYC activists Beebarg Baloch, Shaji Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, among others, and the recovery of “all the forcibly disappeared persons” in Balochistan.
“We make it clear that Dr Mahrang Baloch and her associates are peaceful political activists and political prisoners, but under a systematic plan, they are being presented as terrorists so that the real voice of the Baloch nation can be suppressed,” the statement read.
“These demands are not the desire of any specific group but the voice of the collective conscience of society.”
Indirectly addressing journalists, the BYC’s statement regretted that the media and courts are “unable to fulfil their basic responsibilities”.
 
 

“The media distorts our legitimate and straightforward demands,” the statement read. “It was hoped that the courts would provide justice to the oppressed, but they are only strengthening oppression by repeatedly extending remand.”
The BYC noted that after a total of 45 days of remand, when the group’s leaders appeared in court on Friday, further remand was sought again on the same FIRs.
“Our lawyers insisted on not granting remand, on which the court rejected the remand in these FIRs and discharged them,” the statement read. “However, by bringing five new, baseless FIRs, the BYC leaders have been sent on remand for another 15 days.”
“We will continue our protest peacefully. We know that no matter how long the oppression lasts, it will not last forever,” the statement added. “We appeal to the people of the entire country, civil society, human rights institutions and the international community to stand with us.”
The BYC said it will expand its protest in the coming days, warning that it would take “strict action, the consequences of which will be the responsibility of the state itself”. Neither the action nor the consequences were elaborated upon in the statement.
“We want to make it clear that our protest is peaceful, will remain peaceful and we will not leave this place until our loved ones are released,” the BYC stated. “We stand by our demands, we will continue our struggle.”
BYC, a Baloch advocacy group active since 2018, has been campaigning against enforced disappearances.
Friday’s remand extension was the fourth time the BYC leaders have been presented before the court since their arrest. Initially, they were detained under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (3MPO). Following the expiry of their MPO detention, terrorism-related charges were filed against them.
A day earlier, Supreme Court Justice Athar Minallah elaborated on the difficulties judges faced regarding cases of missing persons and enforced disappearances in the face of non-cooperation by the state and lawmakers.
He said that when he ordered that disappearances be investigated or missing people be found, “the authorities would come and they would all say that we don’t know where they are”. At this, the judge pointed out: “The judge and the court cannot do anything when you don’t have independent investigators.”
Minallah said that during the four years he served as the Islamabad High Court’s chief justice, students from Balochistan would approach the court about disappearances in the province.
“When the Balochistan students came, I didn’t know what to do because it was out of my jurisdiction. The investigations had to take place in Balochistan. But the law did provide me with that jurisdiction.”
Earlier this year, former PPP senator and prominent human rights defender Farhatullah Babar warned against labelling Dr Mahrang, the BYC, or anyone “a terrorist” without evidence or trial, terming such statements “extremely problematic” that could “backfire”.</p><small>2025-08-24 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2416513315c0b85.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936874/8-more-killed-in-di-khan-as-rains-continue-to-batter-kp-taking-provinces-death-toll-to-406' target='_blank'><strong>8 more killed in DI Khan as rains continue to batter KP, taking province’s death toll to 406</strong></a><br><p>At least eight people were killed as heavy downpour lashed Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, taking the total rain-related death toll in the province since August 15 to 406, Rescue 1122 said on Sunday.
Record rains in KP, which started on August 15, have wreaked havoc on different parts of the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond.
On Thursday, the KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued an advisory, forecasting widespread rains in the province from August 22 to 26.
DI Khan Rescue 1122 spokesperson, in a statement, said that “torrential rains claimed the lives of eight people in DI Khan last night,” while 48 people were injured in roof collapse incidents across the city, as per a PDMA report.
According to the Rescue 1122 statement, “heavy rains and strong winds caused widespread infrastructure damage as multiple incidents of damage to trees, walls, and solar panels were reported.”
Rescue 1122 teams were “actively engaged in rescue operations in the affected areas”, said the statement, as all the injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals.
Rescue teams were working to clear out debris from the damage caused by the heavy deluge, the statement added.
Detailing rescue efforts, the District Emergency Officer Engineer Fasihullah said, “Our top priority is the protection of citizens, and we are utilising every available resource in the rescue operation”.
KP death toll since August 15 rises to 406
According to the latest data issued by KP PDMA, last night’s rains in DI Khan have taken the province’s rain-related death toll since August 15 to 406, which includes 305 men, 55 women and 46 children.
District Buner’s death toll has risen to 237, while Swabi has recorded 42 deaths due to flash floods till now, according to PDMA. Mansehra reported 25 deaths in flash floods, landslides and roof collapse incidents. Another three people lost their lives in Battagram due to flash floods.
Abbottabad and Noshwera reported two deaths each, the PDMA report said.
Mardan, Upper Kohistan, Torghar, and South Waziristan recorded one death each.
The PDMA report said that 247 people have been injured in rain-related incidents across the province, out of which 175 are men, 38 women, and 30 children. The highest number of injuries was reported in Buner at 128.
Since August 15, a total of 3,526 houses have been damaged due to rain and flash floods, including 577 that were destroyed completely.
The number of cattle that perished during the rain was 5,727, according to the report.
 
 

PDMA spokesperson has advised the public to contact the authority’s helpline at 1700 in case of any emergency or weather updates.
PDMA’s emergency operation centre remains fully functional, the spokesperson added.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking to Dawn.com on Saturday, assailed the federal government for its “inadequate support” to KP, particularly Buner.
“Centre only provided six things to Buner: 200 tents, 98 ration packages,  five generators, five dewatering pumps, 400 blankets and 500 kgs of medicine”, he claimed, saying that, “This is nothing”.
Gohar also appealed to the Centre to provide the people of KP relief from electricity bills at this “difficult time”.
In a related development, Bahrain’s Interior Minister, Lieutenant General Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, held a telephonic conversation with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi today to convey his sorrow over the loss of lives caused by rains and floods in Pakistan.
 






On Friday, the Nat­ional Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a red alert, urging provincial and district administrations to brace for pot­­ential flooding as a fresh monsoon spell has been forecasted to lash the country from Aug 23 to 29.
According to NDMA data, at least 788 people have died and over 1,000 have been injured in rain-related incidents and flash flooding since the start of the Monsoon season on June 25.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.</p><small>2025-08-24 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/241924554275f9f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1936884/gb-lake-formed-by-glacial-outburst-poses-no-danger-govt' target='_blank'><strong>GB lake formed by glacial outburst ‘poses no danger’: govt</strong></a><br><p>A lake formed by the recent glacial outburst in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Ghizer district has reduced to 40 feet and poses no danger to nearby settlements, the regional government spokesperson said on Sunday.
A glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) refers to a rush of water from a glacial lake which could lead to severe flooding downstream. A Glof occurred on early Friday morning in the Talidas village of Gupis Valley, with at least 200 people being evacuated safely thanks to a shepherd’s warning.
“For now, there is no danger from the lake,” said a statement by GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq. The lake had earlier threatened the downstream areas of Ghizer, Gilgit and Diamer.
As the Glof wreaked havoc downstream, 330 households comprising over 3,000 individuals had become internally displaced persons (IDPs) due to the incident, according to Israruddin Israr, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan’s GB coordinator.
 
 

The number of IDPs in this incident is the second-largest since the 2010 Attabad disaster, Israr noted. The residents of Talidas had been shifted to a tent settlement, Faraq said yesterday, acknowledging that the early warning system was not active in Ghizer.
Relief operations were underway for the affected residents, with GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza supervising the efforts on the site, Faraq said today.
The spokesperson further said that three shepherds who “saved 300 human lives” through their prompt alerts have been invited by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat.
“We have been told by the PM Secretariat to send the three shepherds to Islamabad. It seems that [Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif] will meet the shepherds and encourage them,” Faraq added.
One of them was Wasiyat Khan from Rawshan village, who was near the glacier and used his mobile phone to alert the community about the impending flood.

“It is also necessary to encourage Nasir, who saved about half a dozen human lives in Ghizer’s Daen [village]. Ali Ahmed, who saved the lives of about 50 volunteers in Gojal Valley’s Gulmit town, is also indispensable,” Faraq said.
Faraq told Dawn.com that the shepherds had to depart for Islamabad via flight today, but it was cancelled due to bad weather. Subsequently, they were set to travel to the federal capital by road.
GB CM Haji Gulbar Khan has also announced a cash reward for the shepherd who warned about the flood.
Locals complained that hundreds who had been rendered homeless after the Glof incident in Talidas were facing difficulties in accessing basic necessities.
In a statement, GB Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Director General Zakir Hussain said standard operating procedures had been prepared for releasing water from the artificial lake while keeping the local population and infrastructure safe.
The “comprehensive” SOPs were prepared by a technical team that visited the site on August 23 in view of the potential hazards posed by the lake.
According to the administration, work on an alternative route for the temporary restoration of Gilgit-Shandur Road in the area was underway and traffic was expected to resume in the next 48 hours.
While the National Highway Authority (NHA) has mobilised heavy machinery for the route’s permanent restoration, it is subject to the stabilisation of the mud in the area, which is being continuously monitored.
 


Former GB chief minister Hafeezur Rehman, in a statement, has expressed reservations about the Glof-II project for early warning systems, installed by the United Nations Development Programme across GB for Rs10 billion.
He alleged these funds were misused and demanded an investigation into the system’s failure.
 
 

“This project was under the federal climate change ministry, and we had suggested involving the local community. However, these funds were misused,” Rehman claimed.
Noting that the installation of early warning systems in areas without electricity and other facilities was not feasible, the former CM suggested providing satellite phones to the locals. “It is a sustainable, low-cost, manual system that is more effective than the installation of billion-rupee equipment, he contended.
Another Glof alert amid fresh rain spell
Meanwhile, a fresh rain spell started in scattered areas across GB today, creating fear of more disasters among vulnerable communities of further Glofs.
According to the district administration, Astore Valley Road has been blocked after landslides. People in affected areas faced difficulties as roads, water channels, and irrigation channels remained disconnected at multiple locations.
The K2 road in Shigar, important roads in Ghanche, Chipursan Valley and Misgar Road in Hunza, and other flood-affected roads in Ghizer remained disconnected.
 
 

Affected people in flood-hit areas also faced issues with the drinking water supply systems, while agriculture and crops were badly affected due to the unavailability of irrigation water.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued an alert about an increased risk of Glof, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It noted that a wet spell is likely to prevail from August 23 and can affect GB and KP. Scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, are expected in the two regions during this period.
The PMD advised the public to remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation.
The Gilgit-Shandur road and other link roads in Ghizer remained blocked, with people also facing challenges in accessing other areas.
With increasing Glof and cloudburst events in GB, people became more conscious, and fear prevails among residents.
Zulfiqar Ali, a Gilgit resident, is scared of even light rain. He said people have become uncertain as GB has never experienced such disasters before.

Rayan clocked 30.87 in the Men’s 50m Breaststroke to smash the previous record of 30.98 set by Abdul Aziz Chaudhry 17 years ago. To put it into perspective, the record was set before Rayan was even born. He finished 58th out of 86 swimmers in the breaststroke sprint.
Azlan can safely call himself the junior medley king after smashing the Under-16 national records in both the 200m and 400m Individual Medley.
He swam a 2:14.18 in the 200m IM to obliterate the previous record of 2:20.22 set by Ahmed Durrani, who represented Pakistan at the Paris 2024 Olympics last year. Azlan finished 47th out of 73 swimmers in the heats.
Azlan then went 4:54.68 in the 400m IM to smash the age group record of 4:57.86 set by Amaan Siddiqui in 2022.
 

Azlan Sohail swam a 4:54.68 in the 400m IM to smash the age group record of 4:57.86 set by Amaan Siddiqui in 2022.

The 16-year-old had a mammoth lineup of 10 events ranging from sprints to mid-distance, but he delivered in every single race. He clocked 26.72 in the 50m Butterfly to finish 80th out of 116 swimmers.
Compatriot Ali Mitha finished 61st in the same event with a time of 25.95. The duo battled it out in the 100m Freestyle as well, with Azlan clocking a 54.73 to finish 93rd ahead of Ali at 104th with a 55.55.
The duo, alongside Hareem Malik and Meher Maqbool, set a new national  record of 04:10.45 in the Mixed 4x100m Freestyle Relay, according to official data released by World Aquatics.
Azlan swam a 1:00.10 in the 100m Butterfly and 2:24.10 in the 200m Butterfly to finish 73rd and 45th respectively. He clocked in at 4:21.61 in the 400m Freestyle on the opening day of the week-long competition.
Ali swam a 25.06 in the 50m Freestyle to finish 81st out of 119 swimmers and a 27.38 in the 50m Backstroke: 27.38 to place 43rd out of 87 swimmers.
The 18-year-old swam a 1:01.19 in the 100m Backstroke — where he won there national title last year in 1:02.06 — to finish 52nd, while compatriot Mohid Sadiq Lone placed 71 and clocked a 1:04.43.
Lone swam a 2:24.33 in the 200m Backstroke and 2:20.78 in the 200m IM. He capped off the last of his mid-distance swims with a 2:41.02	in the 200m Breaststroke just ahead of Rayan, who clocked in 2:41.71.
Aside from breaking a nearly two-decade old record, British-based Rayan swam a 1:10.06 in the 100m Breaststroke.
Over on the women’s side, Hareem Malik has been dominating breaststroke and swam a 36.12 in the 50m event, where she holds a national record set at last year’s junior national championships.
She swam a 33.70 in the 50m Butterfly to finish 99th, while Fatima Salman,  the team’s youngest swimmer at just 14 years of age, clocked 35.52. They went head to head in the 50m Freestyle too and it was once again Hareem who came out on top with a 30.71 while Fatima finished with a 32.68.
Fatima went 1:19.93 in the 100m Butterfly and a 2:55.91 in the 200m IM.
Meher Maqbool clocked 1:10.03 and 2:28.44 in the 100m and 200m Freestyle respectively. She swam a 35.69 in the 50m Backstroke and finished just behind Raaqiah Aqeel with a 35.30. Meher then went 1:17.49 in the 100m — where she claimed the title at last year’s nationals — while Raaqiah swam a 2:53.37 in the 20m Backstroke.
The women’s quartet set two new records when they swam a 4:48.46 in the 4x100m Freestyle Relay to break the previous record of 4:49.55, and a 5:12.55 in the 4x100m Medley Relay to smash the previous mark of 5:36.37.

According to a first information report (FIR) available with Dawn.com, the complainant said he is a government employee and performing his duties on August 22 while supervising the laying of fibre optic cable near a petrol pump on Sharea Faisal.
“At around 4:47pm, around 20-25 persons travelling in three vehicles arrived there, in which the suspects and others were travelling,” the FIR stated.
“They stopped their cars near him (the complainant) and called him over, saying that “sahib (Farhan Ghani) was asking ’With whose permission are you digging the land?’”
The complainant replied by saying that he is a government employee, and this work is being carried out with a no-objection certificate from government institutions, the FIR stated.
 


“Some of them (suspects) misbehaved with him and asked him to stop the work immediately,” the FIR read. “When the complainant said this work was being done with the permission of all institutions, they started using abusive language and beating him.”
The FIR alleged that the suspects were asking “why he was not stopping the work on the directions of ‘the sahib’”. It further alleged that four or five armed suspects aimed pistols at the complainant.
“Subsequently, they dragged the complainant to a room of the petrol pump where they kept him in illegal confinement and continued beating him,” the FIR read.
Police eventually arrived at the scene and rescued the complainant, taking him to Ferozeabad police station, where he lodged the FIR against the suspects, including Farhan.
The FIR was registered at Ferozabad police station against Farhan and four other suspects under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common
object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 324 (attempted murder), 337A(i)(punishment for assault), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 379 (punishment for theft) and 506B (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the PPC, read with Section 7 (punishment for terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
Saeed Ghani took to X to address the situation, stating that Farhan and his “associates” had a “dispute” with someone who filed an FIR, as per their “legal right”.
“Farhan Ghani, along with all the individuals, will surrender themselves to the authorities and face the law, proving their innocence in court,” he wrote.
 






In a video statement uploaded to X later today, Saeed outlined that the FIR was registered against his brother and the other suspects and noted that Farhan turned himself in willingly, since the act was “unlawful and warranted an FIR”.
“This is an arrest and purely a legal issue. God willing, we will resolve it by legal means,” Ghani said, expressing gratitude to party supporters and colleagues for their messages of support.
“This is not an issue for the party workers to take to heart,” he added. “We will resolve this matter soon through legal means.”

The hosts were playing for pride, down 2-0 in the series, and responded magnificently, posting an ominous 431-2 after opting to bat — their highest ODI total on home soil.
They then dismissed the Proteas for 155 in the 25th over, with spinner Cooper Connolly taking 5-22.
Head was supreme in blazing 142 off 103 balls, ably supported by skipper Marsh (100 from 106).
Their 250-run platform at Great Barrier Reef Arena was Australia’s highest ever opening partnership against the Proteas, bettering the 170 by Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist in Durban in 2002.
Green then took over with a whirlwind 118 not out to mark the first time Australia’s top three have all scored centuries. Alex Carey was unbeaten on 50, with the 18 sixes slogged between them also a record  at home.
“A pretty crazy day, a full performance by the lads,” said Marsh.
“But full credit to South Africa, they played outstandingly well in the first two games and were too good for us.”
South Africa did themselves no favours by resting quicks Nandre Burger and Lungi Ngidi, with their second-string attack outplayed.
After Marsh won the toss, the openers made an aggressive start, driving Australia to 86 after the 10-over powerplay.
Head was in ominous touch, crunching boundaries with ease to reach his half-century off 32 deliveries.
At the other end, Marsh slammed two big sixes as he also got in the groove, going after the Proteas’ fresh new-ball pairing of Kwena Maphaka and Wiaan Mulder.
Batted beautifully
With the bowlers running out of ideas, Head cruised to a seventh ODI century, pushing Senuran Muthusamy for an easy single.
He then really let rip with a series of big hits before being caught in the deep by Dewald Brevis off Keshav Maharaj after crunching 17 fours and five sixes.
Marsh battled to three figures soon after but was out next ball, taken on the run by wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton after he skied Muthusamy.
But the onslaught was far from over with Green producing a sizzling display of power-hitting, including three giant sixes in a row off Muthusamy to post his maiden ODI century.
Only Glenn Maxwell (40 balls) has scored a faster hundred for Australia.
“The two openers, they batted beautifully so me and ‘Kez’ (Carey) could just bat with a lot of freedom,” said Green.
South Africa’s chase started badly with four wickets down for 50 inside nine overs.
Sean Abbott accounted for Aiden Markram (two) and skipper Temba Bavuma (19) while Xavier Bartlett took care of Rickelton (11) and Tristan Stubbs (one).
The visitors’ big hope was Brevis and he produced some fireworks in his 49 before Green caught him on the ropes off Connolly, who then cleaned up the tail.
“We were under the pump from the first ball and didn’t really pitch up today,” said Bavuma. “They put us under pressure and we didn’t have the answers.”</p><small>2025-08-24 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620200-jcp-sub-body-opposes-criteria-for-judges-nominations-to-constitutional-benches' target='_blank'><strong>JCP sub-body opposes criteria for judges' nominations to constitutional benches</strong></a><br><p>
