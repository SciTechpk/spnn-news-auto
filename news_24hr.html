The number of people injured in the explosion rose to more than 500, state media said. Fatalities have yet to be reported.
State television, citing emergency services, reported that “516 people have been injured as hundreds have been transferred to nearby medical centres” in the southern province of Hormozgan, where the Shahid Rajaee port is located.
The explosion was reported at around 12:30am local time (2100GMT/2am PKT) on Saturday.
The strategically important port, located in the southern Hormozgan province, lies around 15 kilometres southwest of the port of Bandar Abbas on the northern shore of the Strait of Hormuz.
 


According to the semi-official Tasnim News Agency, it could have been caused by the explosion of a fuel tank, however, there has been no official statement on it so far.
The report said rapid response teams were immediately dispatched to the site of the incident, with port operations suspended temporarily to allow security and emergency forces to restore order.
There is still no precise information on the number of casualties, but the explosion was so intense that it could have caused extensive damage, local media reported.
The semi-official Fars News Agency quoted local officials in Hormozgan as saying the explosion occurred at a section of the Shahid Rajaee Port dock, adding that efforts are underway to extinguish the fire.</p><small>2025-04-26 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26165209320dc3d.jpg?r=170537' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906717/trump-and-ukraines-zelensky-have-very-productive-meeting-in-rome-says-us-official' target='_blank'><strong>Trump and Ukraine’s Zelensky have ‘very productive’ meeting in Rome, says US official</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky had a “very productive” meeting on Saturday in Rome, a White House official said, as both leaders attended the funeral of Pope Francis at the Vatican.
Zelensky said his meeting with Trump could prove historic if a peaceful end to Ukraine’s war with Russia that they discussed is achieved.
“Good meeting. One-on-one, we managed to discuss a lot. We hope for a result from all the things that were spoken about,” Zelensky wrote in a post on social media platform Telegram.
He said those topics included “the protection of the lives of our people. A complete and unconditional ceasefire. A reliable and lasting peace that will prevent a recurrence of war.”
Zelensky added: “It was a very symbolic meeting that has the potential to become historic if we achieve joint results. Thank you, President Donald Trump!”
A spokesman for Zelensky’s office said the two leaders, in an encounter in St Peter’s Basilica that lasted about 15 minutes, had agreed to have a second meeting later on Saturday, and that their teams were working on arrangements for that.
The meeting at the Vatican, their first since an angry encounter in the Oval Office in Washington in February, comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to fighting between Ukraine and Russia.
“President Trump and President Zelensky met privately today and had a very productive discussion. More details about the meeting will follow,” said Steven Cheung, White House communications director.

Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, described the meeting as “constructive” in a post on social media.
Zelensky’s office released photographs of the Rome meeting. In one, the Ukrainian and US leaders sat opposite each other in a large marble-lined hall, around two feet apart, and were leaning in towards each other in conversation. No aides could be seen in the image.
In a second photograph, from the same location, Zelensky, Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron were shown standing in a tight huddle. Macron had his hand on Zelenskiy’s shoulder.

Trump, who has been pressing both sides to agree to a ceasefire, said on Friday that there had been productive talks between his envoy and the Russian leadership, and called for a high-level meeting between Kyiv and Moscow to close a deal.
Trump had previously warned his administration would walk away from its efforts to achieve a peace if the two sides do not agree a deal soon.
Differences over territory
After a round of shuttle diplomacy this week, differences have emerged between the position of the White House on peace talks and the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, according to documents from the talks obtained by Reuters.
 
 

Washington is proposing a legal recognition that Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014, is Russian territory, something that Kyiv and its allies in Europe say is a red line they will not cross.
There are also differences on how quickly sanctions on Russia would be lifted if a peace deal is signed, what kind of security guarantees Ukraine would have, and how Ukraine would be financially compensated.
Trump and Zelensky have had a rocky personal relationship. At their Oval Office meeting, Trump accused the Ukrainian leader of “gambling with World War Three”.
Since then, Kyiv has tried to repair relations, but the barbs have continued. Zelensky has said Trump was trapped in a “disinformation bubble” that favoured Moscow, while the US leader accused Zelensky of foot-dragging on a peace deal and making “inflammatory” statements.
But the two men need each other. Trump requires Zelensky’s buy-in to achieve his stated ambition of bringing a swift peace between Russia and Ukraine, while Kyiv needs Trump to pressure Moscow into diluting some of the more onerous conditions it has set for a truce.
At the Oval Office meeting in February, a reporter from a conservative US news network accused Zelensky of disrespecting the occasion by not wearing a suit.
Zelensky, since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, has eschewed suits in favour of military-style attire, saying it is his way of showing solidarity with his countrymen fighting to defend Ukraine.
In Rome on Saturday, Zelensky again decided against a suit, and instead wore a dark shirt, buttoned up to the neck with no tie, and wore a dark military-style jacket over the top of that.</p><small>2025-04-26 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26164136fcafa4d.jpg?r=164236' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906702/pope-francis-funeral-draws-thousands-cardinal-says-his-legacy-must-survive' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Francis’ funeral draws thousands, cardinal says his legacy must survive</strong></a><br><p>Presidents, royalty and a multitude of simple mourners bade farewell to Pope Francis on Saturday at his funeral, where a cardinal said the pontiff’s legacy of caring for migrants, the downtrodden and the environment must not die with him.
On one side of Francis’ coffin in the vast St. Peter’s Square sat US President Donald Trump, who had clashed with the pope on those issues.
“Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today’s challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time,” said Italian Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who presided over the funeral Mass.
The Argentine pope, who had reigned for 12 years, died at the age of 88 on Monday after suffering a stroke.
The crowd, who crammed the square and the roads around, broke into applause when Re spoke of Francis’ care for immigrants, his constant pleas for peace, the need for negotiations to end wars and the importance of the climate.
They clapped loudly again at the end of the service when the ushers picked up the casket and tilted it slightly so more people could see, the church bells tolling in the background.
The coffin was placed on an open-topped popemobile and driven through the heart of Rome to St. Mary Major Basilica, with thousands of people lining the route.
Francis, who shunned much of the pomp and privilege of the papacy during his 12-year reign, had asked to be buried there rather than in the crypt of St. Peter’s, which is the traditional resting place for popes.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you,” one woman in the crowd shouted.
Aerial views of the Vatican during the funeral showed a patchwork of colours — black from the dark garb of the world’s leaders, red from the vestments of some 250 cardinals, the purple worn by some of the 400 bishops and the white worn by 4,000 attending priests.
Choirs sang Latin hymns and prayers were recited in various languages, including Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese and Arabic, reflecting the global reach of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church.
The Vatican estimated more than 250,000 people attended the ceremony, which lasted two hours.
Among the heads of state who flew into Rome were the presidents of the United States, Ukraine Argentina, France, Gabon, Germany, the Philippines and Poland, together with the prime ministers of Britain and New Zealand, and many royals, including the king and queen of Spain.

Francis’ death ushered in a meticulously planned period of transition, marked by ancient ritual, pomp and mourning. Over the past three days, around 250,000 people filed past his body, laid out before the altar of the cavernous basilica.
The faithful hurried to the Vatican from the early hours while many camped out to try to secure spots at the front of the crowd.
“When I arrived at the square, tears of sadness and also joy came over me. I think I truly realised that Pope Francis had left us, and at the same time, there is joy for all he has done for the Church,” said a French pilgrim, Aurelie Andre.
Breaking tradition
 
 

Francis, the first non-European pope for almost 13 centuries, battled to reshape the Roman Catholic Church, siding with the poor and marginalised, while challenging wealthy nations to help migrants and reverse climate change.
“Francis left everyone a wonderful testimony of humanity, of a holy life and of universal fatherhood,” said a formal summary of his papacy, written in Latin, and placed next to his body.
Traditionalists pushed back at his efforts to make the Church more transparent, while his pleas for an end to conflict, divisions and rampant capitalism often fell on deaf ears.
The pope carried his desire for greater simplicity in the papacy into his funeral, having rewritten the elaborate, book-long funeral rites used previously.
He also opted to forego a centuries-old practice of burying popes in three interlocking caskets made of cypress, lead and oak. Instead, he was placed in a single, zinc-lined wooden coffin, which was sealed closed overnight.
In a further break with the past, he will be the first pope to be buried outside the Vatican in more than a century, preferring St. Mary Major, some 5.5 kilometres from St. Peter’s.
His tomb has just “Franciscus”, his name in Latin, inscribed on the top. A reproduction of the simple, iron-plated cross he used to wear around his neck hangs above the marble slab.
Italy mounted one of the biggest security operations the country has seen since the funeral of John Paul II. It closed the airspace over the city and called in extra security forces, with anti-aircraft missiles and patrol boats guarding the event.
As soon as Francis is buried, attention will switch to who might succeed him.
The secretive conclave to elect a successor is unlikely to begin before May 6, and might not start for several days after that, giving cardinals time to hold regular meetings beforehand to sum each other up and assess the state of the Church, beset by financial problems and ideological divisions.</p><small>2025-04-26 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906681/a-wise-decision' target='_blank'><strong>A wise decision</strong></a><br><p>GOOD sense seems to have finally prevailed, with the federal government deferring the planned canal projects, including the controversial Cholistan canal, for now. Following a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday, the government said it will undertake the projects only if a consensus among the provinces is achieved. A meeting of the Council of Common Interests will be convened next week regarding the issue. “…[W]e unanimously decided that no new canal will be constructed till the decision of the CCI,” Mr Sharif told a joint press conference along with Mr Bhutto-Zardari.
Given the sensitivities of interprovincial water distribution, a wiser political leadership would have pre-empted the public outcry over the canal projects by taking the contentious Cholistan scheme to the CCI for a consensus decision even before initiating the work on its feasibility. That it took months of protests across Sindh against the Cholistan canal, the complete blockade of industrial and other supply chains to and from Punjab for the last week and a half, and the PPP’s ‘threats’ of quitting the coalition before the government took a step back shows that the actual decision-making powers regarding the project lie somewhere else.
That the matter has been referred to the CCI, the highest constitutional forum empowered to decide disputes that involve the provinces, indicates that the doors to an arbitrary decision on the scheme may have been closed. So far so good. But the pause does not necessarily guarantee that the project has been cancelled altogether. Still, the canal plan is unlikely to move forward anytime soon, at least not unless a solid, independent technical study of the proposed water channel is carried out and the buy-in of all the provinces, especially Sindh, achieved.
This development should be enough to reassure the protesters who should lift the blockade of the national highway to allow smooth cargo and passenger movement between Sindh and Punjab. No doubt the episode has left a bad taste in the mouth and had added to the federation’s strain. However, the PM’s word on the issue should be respected. One also hopes that the PML-N will do better and avoid such controversies in the future.

The Punjab government had floated the idea of Air Punjab in November 2024 after the federal government’s failed attempt to sell the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, Bokhari said: “Pakistan is ready to operate its first provincial airline, Air Punjab.
“The approval for it was given by [Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz] sahiba in a meeting a few days ago,” she added.
“This service would begin in a minimum of eight months and at the most, a year.”
Sharing further details, the information minister said four aircraft will be acquired on lease immediately for Air Punjab.
Noting that airlines in Pakistan were required to operate domestically for a year before initiating international routes, Bokhari said Air Punjab would be “ready to provide its services in a few months”.
The Punjab chief minister has ordered the completion of the formalities of licensing and leasing, according to Bokhari.
“No one had even thought of launching their own provincial airline,” she added.
Bokhari noted she wanted to share two “major good” developments about Punjab with the public for many days but the recent situation in the wake of the Pahalgam attack had delayed it.
Announcing the second plan, she said, “Pakistan’s first bullet train, which will operate from Lahore to Rawalpindi, will take the [travellers there] in two hours and 20 minutes.”
The minister added that CM Maryam had accorded approval for the bullet train as well.
The Punjab government would collaborate with the Pakistan Railways for the bullet train, Bokhari elaborated.
“Chief minister sahiba has also sought a plan for a high-speed train for six other routes in Punjab, including Lahore to Shahdara and Narowal; Lahore to Raiwind and Kasur; Pakpattan to Lodhran; Sheikhupura to Shorkot; Shorkot to Sargodha via Jhang; and Lala Musa to Sargodha via Malakwal,” she explained.
“The Railway department would be completely revamped in Punjab.”
Pakistan had been looking to offload a 51-100 per cent stake in debt-ridden PIA to raise funds and reform state-owned enterprises but a sole bid of Rs10 billion for a 60pc stake — much below the government-set minimum price of Rs85bn — stalled the privatisation process.
 
 

Subsequently, on Nov 1, 2024, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government ruled by the opposition PTI said it was ready to purchase the loss-making national flag carrier.
A day later, former prime minister and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif stated his daughter, CM Maryam, had sought his counsel on whe­ther the Punjab government should acquire the PIA or establish a new airline.
Nawaz had suggested the airline could also be purchased and rebra­nded by the provincial government as Air Punjab.
However, the Punjab government had immediately clarified that it had “no intentions” of being party to the highly publicised bidding process to acquire the PIA.</p><small>2025-04-26 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26143701194ca0c.jpg?r=143814' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906707/hamas-official-says-group-open-to-freeing-hostages-five-year-truce-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas official says group open to freeing hostages, five-year truce in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Hamas is open to an agreement to end the Gaza conflict that would include the one-time release of all remaining hostages and a five-year cessation of hostilities, an official from the Palestinian group said on Saturday.
“Hamas is ready for an exchange of prisoners in a single batch and a truce for five years,” the official told AFP on condition of anonymity, as a delegation from his group was set to meet mediators in Cairo later in the day.
On April 17, Hamas, which opposes a “partial” ceasefire agreement, rejected an Israeli proposal that included a 45-day truce in exchange for the return of 10 living hostages.
The group has consistently demanded that a truce agreement must lead to the end of the conflict, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, a prisoner exchange, and the immediate and sufficient entry of humanitarian aid into the war-battered Palestinian territory.
Israel, for its part, demands the return of all hostages and the disarmament of Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza — the latter being a “red line” for the the Palestinian group.
 
 

The conflict was triggered by Hamas’s unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which resulted in the death of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP count based on official figures.
Of the 251 people taken hostage that day, 58 are still being held in Gaza, including 34 who are dead, according to the Israeli army.
A truce from January 19 to March 17 allowed the return of 33 hostages to Israel, including eight who were deceased, in exchange for the release of about 1,800 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.
According to figures published by the enclave’s health ministry, at least 2,062 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli offensive resumed on March 18, bringing the total death toll in Gaza to 51,439 since the start of the conflict.</p><small>2025-04-26 09:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26110523c5692d5.png?r=110657' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906694/pm-shehbaz-says-pakistan-open-to-neutral-transparent-probe-into-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz says Pakistan open to ‘neutral, transparent’ probe into Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said Pakistan was open to any “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack in India-occupied Kashmir this week.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.  Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
India has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.
Addressing a passing-out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, PM Shehbaz said: “The recent tragedy in Pahalgam is yet another example of this perpetual blame game, which must come to a grinding halt. Continuing with its role as a responsible country, Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent and credible investigation.”
The premier criticised India for continuing with a “pattern of exploitation, levelling baseless allegations and false accusations without credible investigation or verifiable evidence”.

Speaking on India’s recent move to suspend the IWT, PM Shehbaz said: “Water is a vital national interest of Pakistan, our lifeline […] Let there be no doubt at all [that] its availability will be safeguarded at all costs and under all circumstances.
“Therefore, any attempt to stop, reduce or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty would be responded to with full force and might. Nobody should remain under any kind of false impression and confusion,” the prime minister warned.
“Our valiant armed forces remain fully capable and prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity against any misadventures, as clearly demonstrated by our measured yet resolute response to India’s reckless incursion in February 2019,” he added, referring to ‘Operation Swift Retort’.
Expressing his “fullest confidence” in the armed forces, PM Shehbaz said, “This nation of 240 million people stands united by and behind our brave armed forces and ready to safeguard every inch of our homeland Pakistan.”
He stressed: “Peace is our preference but must not be construed as our weakness.”
During his address, the prime minister also reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination.
“As Founder of the Nation Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah rightly said, Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan. Unfortunately, this globally recognised dispute remains unresolved despite multiple UN resolutions.
“Let there be no doubt, Pakistan shall continue to support the right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people till they achieve their rights through their great struggle and sacrifices,” he added.
Among India’s aggressive measures announced on April 23 against Pakistan was the unilateral move to suspend the 1960 IWT, which was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
 
 

India also shut its borders and downgraded diplomatic ties over what its government and media claimed — without offering any evidence — was Islamabad’s alleged support for cross-border terrorism.
The next day, the National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad announced Pakistan’s response — putting all trade, bilateral pacts and flights off-limits for its eastern neighbour. It also called on India to “refrain from its reflexive blame game and cynical, staged managed exploitation of incidents like Pahalgam to further its narrow political agenda”.
The full text of the NSC statement can be read here.
As tensions rose between the nuclear powers, voices from across the world, including the United Nations, called on both countries to exercise restraint. While Saudi Arabia and Iran offered to mediate, United States President Donald Trump said he was confident that India and Pakistan would “get it figured out”.
In an interesting remark, Trump said: “There have been tensions on that border for 1,500 years so, you know, it’s the same as it has been.” Since the attack, Trump and other US officials have offered India “full support” in hunting down the perpetrators of the violent incident.
PM raises issue of terrorism from Afghan soil, stresses better ties
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz once again raised Pakistan’s concerns about cross-border terrorism with Afghanistan, emphasising the desire for improved ties.
“It is our earnest desire to live in peace with them (Afghanistan) for all times to come. Unfortunately, despite our best and sincere efforts, terrorist activities continue to emanate from Afghan territory,” he said during his address in Kakul.
Recalling Deputy PM Ishaq Dar’s recent visit to Kabul, the premier asserted: “We shall continue our efforts to have better relations and understanding with our brotherly and neighbourly country Afghanistan.
“However, we have also delivered a strong and clear message to the interim Afghan government that while we desire peaceful neighbourly relations with Kabul, this cannot happen as long as the Afghan soil is being used by Fitna-Al-Khawarij to attack Pakistanis,” he added.
 


The prime minister asserted that Pakistan had “always condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations”.
“As the world’s frontline state against terrorism, we have endured immense loss, with our 90,000 casualties and economic losses beyond imagination, exceeding $600 billion,” he highlighted.
“[…] we would not tolerate any kind of terrorism, of any hue and colour, and that has been demonstrated beyond any ray of doubt,” the premier added.
Khawaja Asif calls for international probe, warns of ‘all-out war’
PM Shehbaz’s statement comes a day after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the New York Times in an interview that Pakistan was “ready to cooperate” with “any investigation which is conducted by international inspectors”.
The minister said India had used the aftermath of the militant attack as a pretext to suspend the IWT and for domestic political purposes. India was taking steps to punish Pakistan “without any proof, without any investigation”, he added.
“We do not want this war to flare up, because flaring up of this war can cause disaster for this region,” Asif told the publication.
 
 

Asif rebutted India’s allegations by asserting that the proscribed organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was “defunct” and had no ability to plan or conduct attacks from Pakistan.
“They don’t have any setup in Pakistan,” he told the NYT.
“Those people, whatever is left of them, they are contained. Some of them are under house arrest, some of them are in custody. They are not at all active,” the minister said.
According to NYT, Asif said the attack could have been a “false flag” operation carried out by the Indian government to provoke a crisis.
The defence minister asserted that for the last decade, India had been trying to get out of the treaty, which has been a source of stability in the region.
“They were creating excuses. They were creating problems that were not there,” he was quoted as saying. “They have now found an excuse to get out of this arrangement.”
In a separate interview with Sky News, Asif had warned of an “all-out war” if India carried out any attack on Pakistan.
“If there is an all-out attack or something like that, then obviously there will be an all-out war,” Asif said, adding that the world should be “worried” by the prospect of a full-scale military conflict in the region.
 


Fire exchange at LoC for 2nd day
As ties plummeted in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, there were reports of Indian and Pakistani troops exchanging gunfire for a second straight day on Saturday across the Line of Control (LoC).
Yesterday, Syed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Azad Kashmir, had told AFP that troops exchanged fire along the line separating the two countries. “There was no firing on the civilian population,” he added.
There was no immediate comment from the Pakistani military. India’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms.
According to Reuters, the Indian army today claimed its troops responded to “unprovoked” small arms fire from multiple Pakistan Army posts that started around midnight on Friday along the 740-kilometre LoC.
No casualties were reported from the Indian side, it said.
UNSC slams Pahalgam attack, calls on members to cooperate
In a related development, the UN Security Council (UNSC) yesterday condemned “in the strongest terms the terrorist attack” in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
In a press release issued, UNSC President Jérôme Bonnafont stated: “The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security.”
The UNSC members underlined the “need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of this reprehensible act of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
 
 

They urged all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant UNSC resolutions, to “cooperate actively with all relevant authorities in this regard”.
The UNSC reiterated that “any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed”.
Extending their condolences to the bereaved families, the members reaffirmed the need for all states to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law.
The UNSC also released Pakistan’s statement issued after Wednesday’s NSC meeting, which detailed the country’s decisions taken in response to Indian measures, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad transmitted the statement to Bonnafont, the UNSC president for April, on Friday, according to APP.
“The letter has been issued as an official document of the Security Council under the Agenda Item ‘India-Pakistan Question’,” Bonnafont was quoted as telling the UNSC.
CJCSC Gen Mirza discusses regional security with SCO official
Separately, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza discussed regional security and counterterrorism with Major General Ularbek Sharsheyev, the executive director for the Regional Anti Terrorist Structure (RATS) of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, during the meeting at the Joint Staff Headquarters in Rawalpindi, CJCSC Mirza and Gen Sharsheyev “discussed evolving security dynamics in the region and collaborative measures to enhance counterterrorism cooperation”.
Gen Mirza acknowledged the efforts of SCO (RATS) in promoting regional cooperation to fight the menace of terrorism and reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment to ensuring sustainable peace at the regional and global levels.
The SCO official lauded the professionalism of Pakistan’s armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, Radio Pakistan added.</p><small>2025-04-26 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26133506bcbafd1.jpg?r=133830' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906603/pm-shehbaz-seeks-saudi-help-amid-crisis-over-private-haj-quota' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz seeks Saudi help amid crisis over private Haj quota</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday reprimanded officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs for their alleged negligence that jeopardised the departure of 67,000 potential Pakistani pilgrims this year and assured that he will take up the matter with Saudi government to resolve the issue.
The premier made the ass­urance during a meeting at PM House with fed­eral minister for religi­ous affairs, Senate stan­d­ing committee on religi­ous affairs and representatives of private Haj operators.
According to media rep­orts, private Haj operators have failed to meet Saudi Arabia’s requirements that may deprive 67,000 intending pilgrims of performing Haj this year.
However, private Haj operators have blamed the Saudi government for the delay, claiming they had sent the payments before the deadline, but the Saudi software system crashed.
 
 

The final date for issuing visas was April 18, as per the Saudi deadline, leaving the fate of the 67,000 pilgrims uncertain.
The Pakistan Ulema Council has also urged the Prime Minister Shehbaz to take notice of the issue and appeal to the Saudi government for special consideration.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Hajj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Hajj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
A source in the prime minister’s office told Dawn that the delegation  requested Mr Sharif’s assistance in sending the affected pilgrims for Haj.
Federal Minister Sardar Yousaf, Senate Committee Chairman Maulana  Ataur Rehman, and Committee Member Bushra Butt asked the prime minister  to seek permission from the Saudi government for the private quota  pilgrims.
Prime minister assured the delegation of his full cooperation on the matter.
“This  issue has caused embarrassment for the country,” the prime minister  said, according to the source. “The government will do whatever is  possible to resolve the issue. Saudi authorities will be contacted for  private scheme Haj pilgrims.”
The source said Mr Sharif also  expressed dissatisfaction over the Ministry of Religious Affairs’  performance and reprimanded its officials for not pursuing the matter  proactively with Saudi authorities.
It has been learned that the departure process for Pakistani pilgrims will begin within the next 72 hours.
PIA’s privatisation
In a separate development, amid reports that Pakistan International  Airlines (PIA) has begun generating profit after years of losses, Prime Minister Shehbaz directed authorities to ensure the national carrier’s privatisation is completed within the designated timeframe.
Chairing a meeting to review the ongoing privatisation efforts, Mr Sharif emphasised transparency in the process.
 
 

“Transparency must be central to the procedure for the privatisation of PIA,” the prime minister said, adding that future privatizations of state-owned enterprises should also be broadcast live on television and  digital platforms.
He also underscored the importance of investor engagement and roadshows as part of the outreach strategy.
Officials briefed the prime minister on the investor outreach  strategy, developed with the help of a consultant, and shared details of  the bidding criteria, timeline, and conditions for participation.
Sensitive Price Index
Earlier in the day, Mr Sharif expressed satisfaction over the  significant drop in the annual rate of the Sensitive Price Index,  which fell to -3.52 per cent in April 2025, compared to 26.94pc in the same  month last year.

Ajay Banga was interviewed by AFP at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s Spring Meetings, which have been held this year under a cloud of uncertainty about President Donald Trump’s stop-start tariff rollout.
The Bank has been advising developing countries to get a deal done quickly with the United States, and to then focus attention on cutting trade barriers and boosting regional flows of goods, Banga said.
“You need to negotiate trade systems with the US at the earliest possible (opportunity),” he said. “If you delay, it hurts everyone.”
 
 

Trump’s tariffs have roiled financial markets, sent volatility surging and spooked investors and consumers.
Since returning to office in January, the US leader has imposed a “baseline” 10 per cent tariff on most countries, with much higher duties on China, and 25pc sector-specific levies on areas including steel, aluminium, and automobiles not manufactured in the United States.
He also introduced much higher tariffs on dozens of countries — which have since been temporarily paused — accusing them of having an unfair trade balance with the United States.
Bessent ‘not wrong’ on China
Banga also addressed the criticism levelled by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the Bank earlier this week.
Bessent criticised China’s “absurd” developing country status and called on Banga and IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva to “earn the confidence of the administration”.
“I don’t think he’s wrong,” Banga said of Bessent’s comments on China.
“A country that is the size of China and the capability of China, at some point, should no longer be taking money from IBRD,” he said, referring to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development — an arm of the World Bank that lends largely to middle-income countries.
Such a move would require the support of the World Bank’s executive board, which is made up by member states.
 
 

China, Banga said, borrowed around $750 million from the IBRD last year, while paying billions of dollars to the institution in repayments and donations.
“My view is, I’ve brought it down to 750 (million), and I’m trying to figure out a way to deal with China to bring it down further,” he said. “I want to get it done. And that’s what I’m talking to the Chinese about.”
Banga said the Trump administration’s criticisms of the World Bank, which included “expansive policy overreach,” were not unusual, citing newly elected governments in countries including France, Japan and Korea.
“I keep telling people this is a perfectly constructive request, to say, tell me and show me that you guys are the kind of people that advance the interests of my taxpayer, of my country,” he said.
“I take it in that spirit,” he said. “There’s nothing wrong with it.”
Energy at ‘lowest possible cost’
Since taking the helm of the Washington-based development lender in 2023, Banga has pushed to streamline operations and encourage private sector participation, while focusing on job creation and electricity connectivity.
Among the Bank’s current priorities is a push with the African Development Bank to connect 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa to electricity by 2030 — a process that will require a vast amount of new energy to be brought online.
“You should try and get (energy) in the best, accessible way and the lowest possible cost,” Banga said, suggesting that in addition to renewable power, nuclear and gas could help provide a base load — two energy sources the World Bank is currently hesitant to finance.
The Bank’s executive board is set to discuss its energy strategy in June, Banga said, adding that funding for both nuclear and gas would likely be on the agenda.
Banga said the Bank is also pushing to encourage private sector job creation in developing countries — beyond simply outsourcing jobs from advanced economies.
“Because then you end up with challenges in (advanced economies), and you can see that people are speaking about them with their votes,” he added.</p><small>2025-04-26 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/601888-pakistan-seeks-stronger-bilateral-ties-with-bangladesh-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks stronger bilateral ties with Bangladesh: Asif</strong></a><br><p>

The offered package comes after the administration of former President Joe Biden unsuccessfully tried to finalise a defence pact with Riyadh as part of a broad deal that envisioned Saudi Arabia normalising ties with Israel.
The Biden proposal offered access to more advanced US weaponry in return for halting Chinese arms purchases and restricting Beijing’s investment in the country. Reuters could not establish if the Trump administration’s proposal includes similar requirements.
The White House and Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
 
 

A US defence official said: “Our defence relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is stronger than ever under President Trump’s leadership. Maintaining our security cooperation remains an important component of this partnership and we will continue to work with Saudi Arabia to address their defence needs.”
The US has long supplied Saudi Arabia with weapons. In 2017, Trump proposed approximately $110 billion of sales to the kingdom. As of 2018, only $14.5 billion of sales had been initiated and Congress began to question the deals in light of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
In 2021, under Biden, Congress imposed a ban on sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia over the Khashoggi killing and to pressure the kingdom to wind down its Yemen war, which had inflicted heavy civilian casualties.
Under US law, major international weapons deals must be reviewed by members of Congress before they are finalised.
A potential deal for Lockheed’s F-35 jets, which the kingdom has been reportedly interested in for years, is expected to be discussed, three of the sources said, while downplaying the chances for an F-35 deal being signed during the trip.

The attack, which left 26 men dead, has enraged India, which is now accusing neighbouring Pakistan of supporting “cross-border terrorism”, a claim that Islamabad flatly denies.
Eyewitness accounts and Indian media reports suggested the attack was a well-planned and targeted operation, designed to send a brutal message.
Holidaymakers escaping the sweltering heat of India’s lowland plains were enjoying the tranquil meadows of the Baisaran Valley on Tuesday.

Victim’s wife surprised by lack of security at tourist site

The popular site lies beneath snowcapped mountains near the town of Pahalgam, around 250km from Muzaffarabad, the capital of Azad Kashmir and some 80km southeast of Srinagar.
Indian media claimed that some of the gunmen wore body cameras to record their attack. The shooters — one of whom was identified by police as an Indian citizen — reportedly separated men from the women and children.
 
 

A witness told AFP that they “very clearly spared women and kept shooting at men”.
The cousin of one of the men killed said he was asked by the attackers if he was Muslim before they shot him in the head, but spared his wife.
“They pointed the gun… and said ’tell your government what we have done,” Shubham Dwivedi’s cousin told India Today.
Other survivors told broadcaster NDTV that if the emergency response had been quicker, the lives of some of those shot but not killed outright might have been saved.
Shital Kalathiya, whose husband was among those killed, said what happened “broke” her.
“What shocked us the most was that there was not a single security person present,” she told the Hindustan Times newspaper.
“If they knew that such risks were present at that place, they shouldn’t have let anyone go up there.”

Quetta Gladiators — placed fifth — meanwhile, stayed in the hunt for a breakthrough. And when it finally came in the form of high-flying opener Tim Siefert’s miscued a heave off pacer Mohammad Wasim caught by Rilee Rossouw at long-on in the 12th over, Gladiators ensured the Kings did not breathe again.
The next five wickets fell in the space of 33 balls, as Quetta stole the match by five runs for only their second victory this season here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday night.
Following Seifert’s ouster Shan Masood was the next to follow, with wicket-keeper  Kusal Mendis taking a flying catch off Khurram Shahzad’s bowling in the next over before a Quetta skipper Saud Shakeel’s brilliant decision to place himself at first slip for Abrar Ahmed’s leg-spin saw him take a simple catch to dismiss Khushdil Shah..
Abrar could have gone on to take yet another wicket on the very next ball had Wasim had held on to the ball after a diving attempt to take a catch off Mohammad Nabi’s drive. But the Afghan veteran didn’t stay on for too long, as Amir returned in the 16th to get him out.

Khurram returned in the 17th to see a DRS ruling confirm Abbas Afridi’s lbw dismissal and Wasim took his second by trapping Omair Bin Yousuf before Faheem Ashraf’s brilliant final over restricted Kings to 137-8 in pursuit of 142 – the lowest ever score defended in the PSL at the venue.
Kings start to the chase was decent despite veteran pacer Mohammad Amir striking in the first over to dismiss Kings captain and opener David Warner.
Seifert and James Vince hit Kings’ first two sixes off Khurram and Amir in the following couple of overs. Seifert drove Khurram for three more boundaries in the fourth over to put Kings in the driving seat.
Vince smacked Wasim through the on-side and sliced the pacer through square as Kings crossed 50 in the powerplay Seifert cleared long-off and clobbered Faheem through the same region for a boundary in the eighth over. However, he saw Vince  perish off Saud’s left-arm spin in the next over as Kings reached 82-2 at the halfway stage before Siefert’s wicket triggered a collapse..
Earlier, Gladiators were bundled out for 142 in 19.3 overs in a topsy-turvy first innings as Faheem’s explosive 43 off 27 balls, including four fours and three sixes, propped up the total after early collapses and a shaky middle-order show.
Opener Saud kicked off proceedings with a stylish four off Mir Hamza’s opening delivery, but Hasan Ali’s (3-33) fiery second over turned the tide.
He dismissed openers Saud and Finn Allen in quick succession, leaving Quetta at 8-2. Rossouw (10) briefly counterattacked with two boundaries, only to fall to Hasan, dragging one onto his stumps at 29-3 by the fourth over.
Mendis (36 off 22) provided stability, stroking five boundaries, including a deft late cut and a flicked four. However, Nabi’s arm ball accounted for Mark Chapman), reducing Quetta to 45-4 after six overs. Mendis and Hasan Nawaz (35 off 34) added 24 runs, but Mendis’ aggressive knock ended when he miscued Abbas Afridi to James Vince at long-on, leaving Quetta at 69-5.
Faheem’s arrival injected momentum. He and Hasan Nawaz added 59 for the sixth wicket, with Faheem smashing a six and a four off Hasan in a 19-run 15th over.
His flicked six off Abbas further boosted Quetta past 100. Hassan Nawaz’s gritty stand ended when he holed out to Vince off pacer Fawad Ali, and Hamza’s wicket-maiden 18th over saw Wasim cleaned up by a perfect yorker and Amir caught by Warner.
Faheem’s valiant effort was halted by a stunning one-handed catch from wicket-keeper Seifert off Abbas, and Khurram’s run-out, via Hasan’s direct hit, wrapped up the innings with a total good enough for them to win at the end.

According to the Met department, temperature in Jacobabad was 46°C, followed by Dadu, Larkana and Mithi (45°C), Mohenjo Daro, Khairpur and Sakrand (44°C), Sukkur, Paddidan, Mirpurkhas, Chhor and Rohri (43.5°C), Hyderabad (43°C), Tandojam (42.5°C) and Badin (41°C).
However, the maximum temperature in Karachi was 35°C.
The Met Office has predicted a countrywide heatwave from Saturday (today) under the influence of an approaching high pressure area.
In Sindh, which is already experiencing intense weather in most parts, this weather system will lead to a prolonged episode of the heatwave, now expected to last till May 1.
“The daytime maximum temperature is likely to remain 6-8°C above normal in Dadu, Kambar-Shahdadkot, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur, Khairpur, Naushahro Feroze, Larkana, Sukkur, Jamshoro, Matiari, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad and Badin districts.
“Similar weather conditions are likely to prevail in Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpurkhas districts with daytime temperature soaring to 4-6°C above normal,” the department’s advisory says.
Hot and humid weather is expected in Karachi tomorrow with maximum temperature ranging between 36°C and 38°C.

The Karachi commissioner has imposed a complete ban on operation of all types of rickshaws on I.I. Chundrigar Road and Sharea Faisal for a period of two months.
He also imposed similar restrictions on operation of One-Plus-Four rickshaws on nine other main roads — Shahrah-i-Quaideen (from Numaish to  Sharea Faisal Nursery), Sher Shah Suri Road (from Matric Board Office to  Nagan Chowrangi), Shaheed-i-Millat Road (from Jail Chowrangi to  Shaheed-i-Millat Expressway), Abdullah Haroon Road (from Do Talwar to  Hashoo Centre via Hoshang, Khayaban-i-Iqbal), Do Talwar to  Shahrah-i-Firdous and Abdullah Shah Ghazi Mazar, Stadium Road (from  Millennium Mall to New Town Police Station), Sir Shah Suleman Road (from  Sir Habib Ibrahim Rehmatullah Road to Hasan Square and Karsaz), Rashid  Minhas Road (from Drigh Road to Sohrab Goth), and Mauripur Road (from  Gulbai to ICI Bridge) — across the city.
On Friday, a large number of rickshaw drivers, from the platform of the All Karachi Rikshaw Ittehad Union, staged a protest demonstration at Fawara Chowk near Sindh Governor House.

Commuters face hardship amid shortage of buses; officials claim curbs will improve traffic flow in city

They parked their tri-wheelers on the main road causing suspension of vehicular traffic on the key road link for quite some time. It was their demand that the authorities withdraw the ban on all types of rickshaws on the 11 roads across the metropolis.
The disappearance of an important mode of transportation from roads amid severe shortage of public buses sparked criticism and disapproval from the people as a large number of them, mostly women, suffered due to disruption in transport facilities.
The authorities claimed that the ban was imposed to ease out traffic congestion in certain strategic tracks where public transport was available while the people said that the decision had led to a great deal of hardship for those who travelled short distances to reach their destinations by the two- or four-seater rickshaws.
The worst affected are the ones who have their offices located on the major arteries of the city, including Sharea Faisal, which has been closed for operation of both One-Plus-Two and One-Plus-Four rickshaws.
Similarly, the restriction on two-seater and four-seater rickshaws on Shaheed-i-Millat Road from Jail Chowrangi to Shaheed-i-Millat Expressway also piled miseries on people going to their offices in the neighbourhood.
Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi told Dawn that the basic reason of imposing the ban was to discourage the exponential growth of uncontrolled and unregistered rickshaws.
He claimed that operation of rickshaws was banned on only a few strategic tracks where public transport was available keeping in view the underdeveloped mass transit systems and public needs.
The ban, enforced under Section 144 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC), was recommended by the DIG-traffic and it would remain effective from April 15 to June 14.
Officials sources said that the traffic police had reported to the city administration that the number of unauthorised and self-established illegal routes and rickshaw stands in different parts of the city were the main contributors to traffic congestion on certain roads.
They said that the ban on operation of rickshaws on certain roads would help end the unauthorised and self-established illegal routes and improve the traffic flow.

In a criminal complaint, the US Justice Department said Hannah Dugan, a Milwaukee County circuit judge, hindered the immigration agents who showed up to arrest the man without a judicial warrant outside her courtroom on April 18, and that she tried to help him evade arrest by allowing him to exit through a jury door.
Agents arrested the man, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, outside the courthouse after he left with his lawyer.
Dugan appeared briefly at a federal court in Milwaukee to face charges of obstructing a government proceeding and concealing an individual to prevent arrest, records show. She was released and is scheduled to enter a plea on May 15. A crowd formed outside the courthouse, chanting: “Free the judge now.”
Dugan left the courthouse through a side door without comment.
“Judge Dugan will defend herself vigorously and looks forward to being exonerated,” a publicity firm said on her behalf.
Trump, a Republican, launched a sweeping immigration crackdown after taking office in January, and the Justice Department has directed federal prosecutors to pursue criminal cases against local officials who interfere with the effort. Such resistance was widespread during Trump’s first 2017-2021 term in office.
 
 

“No one, least of all a judge, should obstruct law enforcement operations,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
The Trump administration has been locked in an escalating confrontation with federal judges, as several have issued rulings that limit its aggressive use of presidential power in immigration and other matters. State courts have played a less significant role in that dispute.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel said on social media that agents had arrested Dugan for interfering with the arrest of Flores-Ruiz, whom he described as an “illegal alien.” He later deleted that post, made before the case against Dugan was unsealed in federal court in a possible violation of secrecy rules.
US Senator Dick Durbin, the most senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the Trump administration “continues to test the limits of our Constitution,” and that when immigration officials “interfere” with the criminal justice system it prevents witnesses and victims from coming forward.
“How does arresting a sitting judge make America any safer?” Durbin said in his statement.
Second judge charged
Federal authorities this week also arrested a former New Mexico judge and charged him with evidence tampering, court records show, after a man who authorities allege was linked to a Venezuelan street gang was found living on his property.
The former judge, Joel Cano, was charged alongside his wife Nancy after they allegedly helped the man, who faces illegal gun possession charges, destroy a cellphone believed to contain evidence of him holding firearms, according to a criminal complaint.
Joel Cano was barred by the state supreme court on Tuesday from serving as a judge in the state.
Lawyers for Joel and Nancy Cano did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In the Wisconsin case, a criminal complaint alleged Dugan became “visibly angry” and said it was “absurd” when plainclothes immigration agents arrived on April 18, saying they wanted to arrest Flores-Ruiz after he left her court, where he faced misdemeanour battery charges related to domestic abuse.
Speaking in the corridor outside, she asked the agents if they had a judicial warrant for his arrest, and they told her they did not, only an administrative warrant issued by a colleague at the Department of Homeland Security.
 
 

Dugan told the agents they needed a judicial warrant to arrest someone inside the courthouse and told them to speak with the chief judge, the complaint said.
She then returned to her courtroom and, after adjourning the hearing, directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to leave through a door which led to a non-public area of the courthouse, the complaint said. Agents outside approached Flores-Ruiz as he left the courthouse, and arrested him after a chase on foot, about 22 minutes after they first saw him arrive at court.
Carl Ashley, chief judge of the Milwaukee court, declined to comment.
The complaint said Flores-Ruiz had previously been deported to Mexico.
“Since President Trump was inaugurated, activist judges have tried to obstruct President Trump and the American people’s mandate to make America safe and secure our homeland,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “But this judge’s actions to shield an accused violent criminal illegal alien from justice is shocking and shameful.”
Dugan was first elected as a county judge in 2016 and before that served as head of the local branch of Catholic Charities, which provides refugee resettlement programs among other services. She spent much of her early career as a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, which serves poor people.
During Trump’s first 2017-2021 term, federal prosecutors brought criminal charges against a Massachusetts judge accused of impeding a federal immigration arrest of a defendant in her courtroom. Those charges were dropped in 2022, when Trump was out of office.
Barbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor now at the University of Michigan Law School, said judges have no special immunity but prosecutors should consider the impact on the US federal system, which allows states to enforce their own laws.
“This seems like a very aggressive exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” she said.</p><small>2025-04-26 04:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/26124358028c8ec.jpg?r=124409' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906663/imran-seeks-top-judges-intervention-over-jail-harassment' target='_blank'><strong>Imran seeks top judges’ intervention over jail ‘harassment’</strong></a><br><p>• Letter written by Salman Akram Raja to IHC, SC chief justices says family not allowed to meet ex-PM
• Requests hearing of bail pleas
ISLAMABAD: PTI leader and former prime minister Imran Khan was being subjected to harassment in prison while his family and party leaders were not allowed to meet him despite court orders, according to a letter written on his behalf to top judges of the Supreme Court and Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The nine-page letter, written by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, said the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP), Yahya Afridi, and IHC Acting Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar should take note of the alleged disregard by authorities of the law and Constitution.
The letter highlighted that Mr Khan, the “undisputed premier leader of the Pakistani nation”, was being kept in prison as a part of a “misguided strategy”.
It said Pakistan was facing the threat of external aggression and only Mr Khan can “bind the entire nation, from Karachi to Khyber to a common purpose”.
All that stood between Mr Khan and his liberty was decisions on his bail applications and suspension of convictions in about a dozen cases, the correspondence added.
Mr Raja also requested the IHC acting chief justice to fix different appeals — in cases involving Mr Khan — which are pending in the high court.
 
 

Except for the Al Qadir Trust case, bail has already been granted to several of the co-accused in every other case, the letter highlighted.
Mr Khan has been “entangled in over two hundred frivolous cases”, and four of his five convictions since 2022 have been overturned or suspended on appeal, revealing the flimsy foundations of the charges against him.
However, Mr Khan’s appeal in the Al-Qadir Trust case was yet to be heard by the court while other PTI leaders, including Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Dr Yasmeen Rashid, have been incarcerated for more than 600 days “without justification”.
The PTI also requested the top adjudicators to take action to restore “decency, justice, and the belief that the people of Pakistan matter”.
The letter alleged Mr Khan was facing “relentless harassment” in prison since March 20.
He has not been allowed to meet his sisters and for the past three weeks, when his sister came to meet him in prison on Tuesdays, roads leading to the Adiala Jail were blocked with trucks and other obstructions along with police contingents several miles away from the prison.
The IHC has ordered jail authorities to allow Mr Khan’s meetings with his family, lawyers and party leaders on Tuesday and Thursday every week.
These obstructions and coercion, the letter stated, were “widely reco­rded and reported by the media”.
The treatment accorded to Mr Khan in the prison continues to remain subject to the “whims of the authorities, whoever they might be”.
Despite court orders, Mr Khan was not allowed weekly telephone conversations with his sons, the letter added.
He has only been allowed to speak with his sons twice over the last four months.
Moreover, Mr Khan is also not allowed to meet his wife, also incarcerated in the Adiala Jail, as per the jail manual.
The letter alleged that books brought for Mr Khan by family and friends are not given to Mr Khan for several weeks.
His access to two newspapers in accordance with the jail manual is repeatedly interrupted “as part of a scheme of harassment” and at times, Mr Khan had been subjected to “long periods of solitary confinement in his small cell”.
Likewise, for the past two years, Mr Khan’s trial was conducted within the jail premises and not in the open court.
Access to the ad hoc court set-up in prison was provided to the family of Mr Khan and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, after the intervention of IHC.
However, the general public is still unable to witness the trial.
The letter regretted that friends and political associates were not allowed to meet Mr Khan even after the IHC order issued on March 24.
Despite their names being included in lists provided to jail authorities, they were forcefully removed, detained and humiliated, the letter alleged.
The conduct of the jail authorities reflected an “assault on the legal system of Pakistan at the core of which is obedience to court orders”.
The letter concluded the nation “needs belief in the decency of the State and the people need to be assured that they matter as human beings”.

The PMD said that a high pressure is likely to approach the upper atmosphere from April 26 and grip most parts of the country on April 27.
Under the influence of these conditions, day temperatures are likely to remain five to seven degrees Celsius above nor­mal in southern half of Sin­dh, southern Punjab and Balo­c­h­istan from April 26 to May 1.
On the other hand, day temperatures are likely to remain four to six degrees Celsius above normal in upper half of central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan from April 27 to 30.

Isolated rains forecast in first week of May

A weather system is expe­cted to enter upper parts of the country from April 30. Under the inf­luence of that system, rain-wind/thunderstorm (isolated heavy rains/hailstorm) are exp­ected in Kashmir, Isla­m­abad, Pothohar region including nor­theast Punjab, upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltis­tan from April 30 to May 1.
 
 

This system will subside the heatwave conditions in the country from May 1 onwards. It said that due to heatwave in the country, people, especially children, women and senior citizens should take precautionary measures.
Rising temperatures in northern areas may enhance snowmelt rate, especially from April 27 till May 1st.
Wind-dust storm/hailstorm and lightning may damage loose structures like electric poles, trees, vehicles and solar panels in Islamabad, Pothohar region including northeast Pun­jab and parts of Khyber Pakht­u­nkhwa on April 30 and May 1.
Meanwhile, NDMA has issued a weather outlook indicating unstable weather conditions from May 1 to 7.
Moisture influx from eastern regions and the Arabian Sea, coupled with rising temperatures and humidity, is expected to trigger moderate to heavy rainfall, windstorms, thunderstorms, lightning, and isolated hailstorms across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, AJK, upper and central Punjab, northern Balochistan and southern Sindh.

• Saudi, Iranian FMs hold calls with their Pakistani, Indian counterparts, urge de-escalation
• UN chief voices ‘concerns’, asks nuclear-armed neighbours to show ‘restraint’
• FO warns New Delhi not to antagonise Islamabad after announcing Indus treaty suspension
• Troops exchange fire across LoC; Indian minister says plans ready to curtail water supply
ISLAMABAD: Saudi Arabia and Iran on Friday offered to mediate between Pakistan and India, urging restraint as tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours escalated following an attack in India-held Kashmir, earlier this week.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.
India has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.
With both countries engaging in aggressive diplomatic, economic, and military posturing, the rapidly deteriorating relations have revived fears of a military confrontation similar to the 2019 Balakot crisis.
 
 

Amid growing international concern, Saudi Arabia and Iran, both of whom have good ties with the two countries, offered help to defuse tensions.
Saudi Foreign Minister Fai­sal bin Farhan held separate phone calls with his Pak­istani and Indian counterparts.
A statement from the Fore­ign Office said Foreign Minis­ter Ishaq Dar discussed regi­onal developments with Mr Farhan, rejecting India’s accusations and cautioning against “further escalatory moves”.
The statement said Mr Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s determination to respond firmly to any aggression and that both leaders agreed to continue consultations.
 


In a statement on X, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said he discussed the Pahalgam attack and its “cross-border linkages” with the Saudi foreign minister.
 


Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also offered mediation via a post on X.
“India and Pakistan are brotherly neighbours of Iran, enjoying relations rooted in centuries-old cultural and civilisational ties,” he wrote. He added that Tehran was ready to “use its good offices in Islamabad and New Delhi to forge greater understanding at this difficult time”.
In a late-night statement after Aragchi’s call, the Foreign Office said, “DPM [Dar] … appreciated the efforts of Iran to diffuse the situation in the region.”
Earlier, in his weekly briefing on Friday, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan had said that if any country offered mediation, Pakistan will consider it “at that point in time”.
 


UN concern
Meanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also voiced “deep concerns” over the escalating tensions and urged both countries to exercise “maximum restraint”.
He called for the dispute to be resolved peacefully through “meaningful mutual engagement” and said the UN was closely monitoring the situation, though he has not directly communicated with either country’s leadership.
 
 

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York that issues between the countries “can be and should be resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.
“We very much appeal to both the governments… to exercise maximum restraint, and to ensure that the situation and the developments we’ve seen do not deteriorate any further,” he said.
Warning to India
The Foreign Office also delivered a stark rebuke to India on Friday, warning it not to push Islamabad towards taking “extreme steps” after the Modi government notified the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
“India should not create a situation where we are constrained to take extreme steps,” Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said during the weekly briefing.
“Any attempt to dramatically alter or stop the water would be considered an act of war,” he warned.
 


“The Indus Waters Treaty is of critical importance for Pakistan’s water security and economy. Naturally, we will take all appropriate steps to preserve its sanctity and smooth implementation.”
Mr Khan criticised India for its “unlawful, unilateral, and irresponsible” suspension of the 1960 water-sharing pact.
Such actions “threaten the very foundations of the entire edifice of interstate cooperation and smooth implementation of the treaties”.
He stressed water continues to flow into Pakistan for now but said Islamabad will be closely monitoring the situation.
“We will see how it progresses, but all options are on the table for Pakistan. It is our lifeline. It is our right, sanctified by international law, customary law and bilateral treaties. We will do everything to secure this right for our people.”
 
 

The strong statements came as India doubled down on its decision to halt water flows into Pakistan.
In New Delhi, Water Resources Minister C.R. Paatil said the Indian government had prepared a detailed roadmap to block the water flow into Pakistan.
The announcement followed a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and attended by senior officials.
Mr Khan, the FO spokesperson, also addressed the retaliatory measures announced by the National Security Committee on Thursday.
He said threatening statements were made by New Delhi to create a “jingoistic and belligerent atmosphere”.
Firing at LOC
In another sign of acrimony between Pakistan and India, troops exchanged fire overnight across the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, officials said on Friday.
Syed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Azad Kashmir, told AFP on Friday that troops exchanged fire along the line separating the two countries.
“There was no firing on the civilian population,” he added.
India’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms that it said had been “initiated by Pakistan”, adding it had been “effectively responded to”.

• Says US will ‘lead the pack’ against Iran if N-talks fail
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said his administration is talking with China to strike a tariff deal and that Chinese President Xi Jinping had called him, Time magazine reported, as Beijing has so far disputed the US characterisation of talks.
The Republican president, in an interview with the magazine published on Friday, did not say when President Xi called or what the two leaders discussed. Trump said he would not call Xi.
“He’s called. And I don’t think that’s a sign of weakness on his behalf,” Trump said.
 
 

China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s statement. Before Trump’s latest remarks were published, it had urged Washington to stop “misleading the public” on bilateral tariff negotiations, a comment reiterated by Beijing’s embassy in Washington.
Trump in the interview said he has made 200 tariff deals and expected to finish negotiations in about three or four weeks, likening the United States to a department store where he sets the price. He gave no details of any such deals.
Crimea to stay with Russia
Trump also laid out his plans to make various other deals with world leaders from Russia’s war in Ukraine to the Middle East with Iran and Saudi Arabia.
Trump wants a quick end to the fighting and told reporters that he thinks they are close to a deal. He also said he had his own deadline, which he did not detail, while his special envoy met Putin on Friday.
In his comments published on Friday, Trump told Time that Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014, would remain in Moscow’s hands.
“Crimea will stay with Russia. And (Ukrainian President Volodymyr) Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it has been with them for a long time. It has been with them long before Trump came along,” he said.
Saudis to enter Abraham Accords
In the Middle East, Trump predicted that Saudi Arabia will enter the Abraham Accords, the series of normalisation agreements Trump’s administration negotiated between Israel and some Gulf countries during his first term.
“I think Saudi Arabia will go into the Abraham Accords,” he said. “That will happen.”
In reply to a question about Iran, Trump said the United States will “lead the pack” in attacking Iran if talks over Tehran’s nuclear programme do not result in a new deal. He, however, expressed the hope that such a deal could be reached.
Asked if he was open to meeting Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei or President Masoud Pezeshkian, Trump replied: “Sure.” Trump has said he will visit Saudi Arabia and the region next month.
Lawsuits at home
Trump, who promised on the campaign trail to use his term in office as “retribution”, also defended his use of presidential power domestically in targeting law firms, foreign students and former US officials.
“I’ve gotta be doing something right, because I’ve had a lot of law firms give me a lot of money,” he told Time.
 
 

He defended the revocation of student visas, saying “they can protest, but they can’t destroy the schools like they did with Columbia and others”. Asked if he would direct the US Department of Justice to disclose any evidence it had tying a Tufts University student who was arrested to militant group Hamas, Trump said he was not aware of the particular case but would look into it.
Turkish national Rumeysa Ozturk has said US immigration authorities unlawfully arrested her based on her pro-Palestinian advocacy, including co-authoring an opinion piece in Tufts’ student newspaper.

According to an official of the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health, the lab has confirmed a polio case from Bannu district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“This is the third polio case from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the eighth case from Pakistan at large this year. Earlier on April 23, lab confirmed the poliovirus case from Torghar district of KP,” he said.
Official said that as high transmission season has just started, the country may report more and frequent cases of polio during coming weeks and months. Poliovirus becomes active in high temperatures.

Third case from KP detected in Bannu

This year’s second nationwide polio campaign will continue till April 27, with the goal of vaccinating 45.4 million children under the age of five across Pakistan.
The programme has made an urgent appeal to parents to ensure children receive repeated doses of the polio vaccine to protect them from the crippling poliovirus. The ongoing polio campaign is a critical opportunity to safeguard children against this disease.
 
 

Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by the virus that invades the nervous system, and can cause paralysis or even death.
While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Each time a child under the age of five is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio free.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries which still report polio cases.

Although local police accuse the attackers of being linked to ‘Pakistani militant outfits’, the demolition of these two homes seems to contradict that claim.
Authorities have issued wanted posters with sketches of three men, identified as Indian national Adil Hussain Thoker, as well as two others — Ali Bhai and Hashim Musa — who India claims are Pakistani citizens.
However, the AFP news agency reported that police are also searching for another Indian citizen, Ashif Sheikh.

Indian authorities have issued sketches of three men, but they are actually hunting for two local suspects

Members of the two Indian men’s immediate families were detained for questioning after the attack, an officer and their relatives said.
 
 

Sheikh’s sister Yasmeena said soldiers cordoned off the area around the house, in the southern Tral area, overnight from Thursday to Friday.
“One soldier climbed over the mud compound wall of our home, and climbed back after a while,” said Yasmeena, who gave only one name.
“After some time, a big frightening blast brought the house down.
“Everything inside is destroyed,” she said, adding that no one was inside at the time. A police officer said soldiers also destroyed Tho­kar’s family home in the neighbouring Bijbe­hara area in a similar manner, early on Friday.
Police claimed they were part of the hitherto unknown group, referred to by Indian media as ‘The Resistance Front’ (TRF).
“Both have been active for three to four years, and are part of TRF,” a police intelligence officer told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity, because they were not authorised to speak to the media.
“They are wanted militants involved in earlier attacks as well on security forces,” the officer added.

• Sindh CM implores protesters to ‘end public disruptions’
KARACHI: Demonstrators in Sindh have refused to end their protest against the controversial proposal to build new canals on the Indus, despite the federal government’s decision to pause the project.
Their agitation has caused severe disruptions to the country’s supply chain, stranding thousands of goods carriers, transporters said on Friday.
Tariq Gujjar, president of the Transport Goods Association (TGA), said more than 10,000 to 15,000 trawlers, containers, trucks and oil tankers remain stuck in the Sukkur-Larkana division and around Bahawalpur due to ongoing road blockades.
“Drivers have reported that goods movement, especially from the Sukkur-Larkana region to the Bahawalpur area, is still paralyzed,” he said.
 
 

Mr Gujjar told Dawn that lawyers are still not ready to call off their protests, and are reportedly waiting for the notification on May 2 making the rollback of canal projects official.
He added that stranded vehicles were carrying sacrificial animals, import and export consignments, fruits, vegetables, coal, medicines and other essential items.
The federal government on Thursday announced that the proposed canal project would remain on hold until a consensus is reached at the Council of Common Interests (CCI) meeting scheduled for May 2.
However, a meeting between Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Advocate Aamir Warraich, who represents the protesting lawyers, was underway on Friday night. At the time of going to press, no official statement had been issued to confirm whether the demonstrations would be called off or not.
On Thursday, prior to the settlement between the government and PPP, goods carriers, in a press conference held at the Karachi Press Club, said in case the stranded vehicles were not given safe passage by noon on April 25, 2025, they would park all their vehicles, which are currently on the roadsides, in middle of the road and announce a strike.
 
 

Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has urged demonstrators to open blocked highways and allow goods movement to resume.
“Peaceful protests are acceptable, but public disruptions are not,” Mr Shah said. “Given India’s hostile actions, we must stand united rather than fall into divisive politics.”
The blockade has alarmed industry leaders who say the economy is already bearing the brunt of the prolonged unrest.
Jawed Bilwani, president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, estimated cumulative losses of over Rs500 billion ($1.8 billion) in export orders and local production over the past 10 to 12 days. This includes four days of transport delays due to a separate strike by truckers protesting new fitness certificate regulations.
“Many sacrificial animals have died en route. Textile exporters are unable to meet deadlines, and raw materials are stuck in transit,” Mr Bilwani said.
“This crisis is hurting Pakistan’s image among international buyers and may result in the shifting of orders to other countries.”
Parties wary
Not just lawyers, but other political parties are also wary of the PM’s announcement regarding the canals project, and therefore unwilling to call off their strike just yet.
Rashid Mehmood Soomro, general secretary of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Sindh, rejected the federal government’s verbal assurances.
“Without official written cancellation of the canal project, the nation will not be satisfied,” the JUI-F leader said. “Our sit-ins and resistance will continue.”
 
 

Advocate Vasand Thari, central president of Awami Tehreek, criticised the PPP for referring the matter to the eight-member CCI, where Punjab holds more weight.
“The PPP is betraying Sindh by backing Punjab’s interests,” Mr Thari said. “We reject this deception and will continue our peaceful democratic struggle.”
Former Grand Dem­ocratic Alliance  lawmaker Moazzim Abbasi dismissed the government’s pause as “a lollipop,” and said the protests would persist until a formal cancellation notification is issued.

A seasoned Indian def­ence analyst gave measu­red reasons on Friday why there could be no hot war between India and Pakis­tan over the Pahalgam tragedy, even though there would be the pretence of one for political gain.
The existing ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) could suffer and the firing from both sides could resume to disturb the peace of local farmers along the borders.
Among the reasoned and reassuring voices from the perspective of bilateral and regional peace was former Indian army officer and defence analyst Pravin Sawhney.
 
 

He gave several factors for assessing there could be no war, chief among them being the China factor.
Mr Sawhney said the Aug 2019 changes in the status of the disputed state of Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir had irked China more than Pakistan. The Galwan violence between the troops of India and China in April 2020 was an offshoot of that.
There were too many troops committed on the China border, Mr Sawhney pointed out, saying it would not be possible for India to move them immediately.
 


But that doesn’t mean the war drums would be silenced any time soon. PM Narendra Modi is a rare Indian leader to believe in keeping the pretence of war, as it suits his politics.
News portals noted that Modi was addressing an election rally in Bihar on Thursday, and did not attend the meeting with opposition parties, where the government for the first time admitted to an intelligence failure.
