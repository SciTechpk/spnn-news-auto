The commission was set up in 2011 to trace missing persons and fix responsibility on the individuals or organisations responsible for their disappearance.
In the month of June alone, a total of 27 missing persons cases were received nationwide, while 33 cases were disposed of.
The commission offered a monthly breakdown of the cases received and disposed; 26 cases were received in January and 209 disposed of; 12 new cases in February and 104 disposed of; 30 were recieved in March and 34 disposed of; 11 were reported in April and 42 disposed of; 19 were received in May and 62 disposed of.
The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
A total of 4,771 missing persons have returned home, according to the report, while 1,017 people are being held in internment centres and 705 in prisons.
According to the report, the bodies of 293 missing persons have been recovered since the commission was formed in 2011.
Since then, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recorded the highest number of missing persons received at 3,622, followed by Balochistan at 2,885, Sindh at 1,847, Punjab at 1,752, Islamabad at 405, Azad Jammu and Kashmir at 71, and Gilgit-Baltistan at 10.
 
 

KP also had the highest number of missing persons in detention centres at 855.
In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament holds the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.</p><small>2025-07-02 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02115210307e9c9.jpg?r=115226' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921605/dalai-lama-says-he-will-be-reincarnated-trust-will-identify-successor' target='_blank'><strong>Dalai Lama says he will be reincarnated, Trust will identify successor</strong></a><br><p>The Dalai Lama said on Wednesday that the 600-year-old Tibetan spiritual institution would continue after his death, reassuring Buddhist followers around the globe and saying his office “exclusively” would name his successor, even as China insisted it would.
Followers of the Dalai Lama laud his tireless campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau in China about the size of South Africa.
It is a landmark decision for Tibetans, many of whom had feared a future without a leader, as well as for global supporters who see the Dalai Lama as a symbol of non-violence, compassion and the enduring struggle for Tibetan cultural identity under Chinese rule.
According to Tibetans, Tenzin Gyatso is the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. The charismatic Nobel Peace Prize-winning Buddhist had previously said the institution of Dalai Lama would continue only if there was popular demand.
He said on Wednesday he had received multiple appeals over the past 14 years from the Tibetan diaspora, Buddhists from across the Himalayan region, Mongolia and parts of Russia and China, “earnestly requesting that the institution of the Dalai Lama continue”.
“In particular, I have received messages through various channels from Tibetans in Tibet making the same appeal,” he said in a video broadcast at the start of a meeting of religious leaders in the Indian Himalayan town where he has lived for decades.
“In accordance with all these requests, I am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,” he added, according to an official translation.
The announcement was made ahead of his 90th birthday on July 6.
‘Historic’
While China condemns him as a rebel and separatist, the internationally recognised Dalai Lama describes himself as a “simple Buddhist monk”.
Many exiled Tibetans fear China will name its own successor to bolster control over a territory it poured troops into in 1950.
But the Dalai Lama said that responsibility for identifying the 15th Dalai Lama “will rest exclusively” with the India-based Gaden Phodrang Trust, the office of the Dalai Lama.
Samdhong Rinpoche, a senior Tibetan leader from the Gaden Phodrang Trust, told reporters that the Dalai Lama was “in excellent health” and that, at this time, there were “no further instructions for succession”.
However, Rinpoche said the next Dalai Lama could be of “any nationality”, and would come from a place where there is “access to freedom”.
China said on Wednesday that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama “must be approved by the central government” in Beijing, and that it would be carried out “by drawing lots from a golden urn”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters.
That urn is held by Beijing, and the Dalai Lama has already warned that, when used dishonestly, it lacks “any spiritual quality”.
The Dalai Lama handed over political authority in 2011 to an exiled government chosen democratically by 130,000 Tibetans globally.
At the same time, he warned that the future of his spiritual post faced an “obvious risk of vested political interests misusing the reincarnation system”.
In 1995, Beijing selected a Panchen Lama, another influential Tibetan religious figure, and detained a Dalai Lama-recognised six-year-old, described by rights groups as the world’s youngest political prisoner.
The Dalai Lama’s announcement about the continuation of the role was welcomed with relief by Tibetans, including by Jigme Taydeh, a civil servant with the India-based Tibetan government.
“Whilst we rejoice at this confirmation of its continuation, we stringently object to China’s interference and plans to install a puppet Dalai Lama”, he said. “Neither the Tibetans nor the world would recognise such mischief. “</p><small>2025-07-02 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/021406436118fa5.png?r=142652' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921626/chinas-alibaba-launches-e-commerce-subsidies-of-7bn-in-consumption-boost' target='_blank'><strong>China’s Alibaba launches e-commerce subsidies of $7bn in consumption boost</strong></a><br><p>The online retail platform of Chinese tech giant Alibaba announced on Wednesday that it will issue $7 billion in subsidies for certain purchases, providing a much-needed boost for a country struggling with sluggish spending.
Taobao, China’s e-commerce champion launched by Alibaba in 2003, said in a WeChat statement that the 50bn yuan ($6.97bn) would “directly subsidise consumers and merchants” over a 12-month period starting Wednesday.
The spending incentives on Taobao’s “flash purchase” feature will take the form of “red envelopes” — a digital form of traditional cash gifts — as well as discounts on products, deliveries and commissions, the statement said.
Taobao said that the subsidies will “provide consumers with preferential and convenient services and experiences, further stimulating consumption vitality”.
Beijing is battling to stave off deflationary pressure, which has threatened to dampen economic growth even as challenges elsewhere mount.
A lengthy property sector crisis and a fierce trade war with the United States this year have exacerbated concerns among Chinese households about making major purchases.
 
 

Chinese authorities have sought to allay fears, unleashing a series of aggressive policy measures aimed at boosting spending, including key interest rate cuts and various consumer goods trade-in schemes.
Results have been mixed, with retail sales in May growing at the fastest clip year-on-year since December 2023, according to official statistics, even as commercial property prices in a group of 70 key cities fell from April.
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday urged efforts to “advance the building of a unified national market” during a high-level meeting on economic policy, state news agency Xinhua said.
Leaders at the meeting also called for better management of “low-price disorderly competition” among companies.
“As China’s economy faces deflation pressures and a weak labour market, the government aims to address these challenges from the supply side,” Zhiwei Zhang, President and Chief Economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in response to Tuesday’s meeting.
“The top priority seems to be preventing over-competition,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-02 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02135838db26e41.jpg?r=135845' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921620/pakistan-and-india-likely-to-clash-on-sept-7-in-asia-cup-2025-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and India likely to clash on Sept 7 in Asia Cup 2025: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and India are expected to play against each other “likely” on September 7 in the Asia Cup 2025 — set to begin on September 4 or 5 in the UAE, according to a report by The Times of India on Wednesday.
The T-20 tournament will mark the 17th edition of the Asia Cup, beginning with a group stage and then a super-four round. The participating teams include India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and the UAE.
According to Asia Cup’s website, recent political tensions between India and Pakistan have made UAE the frontrunner to host the tournament or serve as part of a hybrid hosting model. The multi-nation tournament was initially going to be hosted solely by India.
According to the Indian media report, a 17-day window has been almost finalised by the Asian Cricket Council, where India and Pakistan are to clash on September 7. The two teams could also see a second match on September 14, depending on how the teams progress.
The report said that all the participating teams are currently in the process of getting approvals from their respective governments, adding that promotional activities for the tournament are already underway.
The recent India-Pakistan tensions briefly cast a shadow on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. The BCCI later termed the report as “speculative and imaginary”, according to the Press Trust of India.
India will host the women’s 50-overs World Cup this year, but Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement made by the International Cricket Council.
India refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy this year and played all their matches, including the March 9 final, in Dubai.
Bilateral cricket has been suspended since 2013 between the Asian neighbours, who play each other only in multi-team events.</p><small>2025-07-02 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0212160042c747f.jpg?r=123052' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921612/join-pakistans-anti-terror-efforts-bilawal-repeats-offer-to-india' target='_blank'><strong>Join Pakistan’s anti-terror efforts, Bilawal repeats offer to India</strong></a><br><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday again extended an olive branch to India, asking the neighbouring country forge a partnership to pursue peace and jointly combat terrorism.
“Pakistan is ready to forge a historic, phenomenal partnership with India to jointly combat terror,” he said while addressing an international conference on ‘Pakistan Fighting War for the World against Terrorism’ at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute.
“Not as adversaries playing a zero sum game but as neighbours who share a moral and civilisational obligation to save a billion souls from the plague of extremism.
“All it requires is from India’s leadership is to step down from the high horse heading in the abyss and pursue peace with Pakistan.”
Bilawal also called on the Indian leadership to resolve all outstanding dispute including the Kashmir and the water crisis.
“Let us resolve Kashmir in accordance with the aspirations of the people. Let us end the weaponisation of water. And instead build peace as mighty as the Himalayas.
“Let us return to our shared traditions grounded not in hatred but the ancient soil of the Indus valley civilisation. It is not weakness to extend a hand. It is wisdom.”
The PPP chairman has been repeatedly calling for India and Pakistan to engage in a dialogue to establish peace.
Talking today, the former foreign minister said terrorism is a global crisis that need to be defeated for a sustainable future. He also highlighted the threat of “digital propaganda” in counter extremism.
“Pakistan is not drifting through the storm of terrorism. We are steering the vessel,” he said, adding that the country has rendered tremendous human and economic loss in this war on terror.
“We are still fighting because the alternate is surrender. And surrender is not a word in Pakistan’s dictionary,” he exclaimed.
 






He also highlighted the rise in militant violence over the past year, saying “2024 was the deadliest year in a decade in which 685 service members embraced martyrdom in 444 separate attacks”.
Bilawal also noted the efforts made by the armed forces and security personnel in combatting terrorism.
“Over the past two decades, Pakistan’s armed forces backed by iron willed citizens have broken the backs of Al Qaeda networks, dismantled so-called caliphates such as Daesh, and driven the TTP [Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan] from the fortress to the fox hills.”
“Operation Zarb-e-Azab drained the northern swamp, Raddul Fassad uprooted the sleeper cells in our cities and elsewhere. Today operations in Balochistan sever the connection between separatism and foreign funded terror.”
‘We saved Kabul’
The former foreign minister said Pakistan supported the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, but instead faced a surge in cross-border terror attacks.
“Taliban regime was greeted as an inevitable fact. They promised the world stability, they delivered a 40 per cent surge in militant attacks on Pakistani soil, and a sanctuary for the TTP, BLA, Etim, and others.
“We saved Kabul. Sovereignty confers duty. Stop the exodus of fighters, choke the traffic of arms, and honour the blood price of the Doha accord or be judged by the company you keep.”
Bilawal said the world should learn lessons from Pakistan’s experience and achievements as the country requires development as an “antidote” against counter insurgency.
“We need equitable burden sharing. We asked for structured investment in counter terrorism and counter violent extremism, modern technology and weaponry,” he said. “No counter insurgency has achieved victory without first winning hearts and minds.”
He also delivered a message to the “merchant of hate” within the country, saying “there is no constitutional right to weaponise religion.”

“If the world demands we outlaw militias, it must also demand all that people live free from collective punishment.
“From the Kashmir valley to olive orchards of Palestine, the world must deliver a just peace.”
He said the world has changed drastically since India and Pakistan sat across the table in 2012.
“We have fought and won the most expensive counter terrorism campaign in modern history.  After our removal from FATF gray list, Pakistan stands among the most serious counter terrorism states.
“It is time India recognise this transformation, not as a concession but as an opportunity. Terrorism is a collective menace. No border fence, no nationalist rhetoric, no regional hegemony can shield one nation from a fire it may have help light on the other side.”
He stressed that terrorists have no nationality, religion, caste, or creed, and this menace respects no law. He called for collective global efforts to eliminate terrorism.</p><small>2025-07-02 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612037-hrcp-expresses-concern-over-shrinking-space-for-human-rights-work' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP expresses concern over 'shrinking space' for human rights work</strong></a><br><p>

The April 22 attack in held Kashmir’s Pahalgam sparked heavy fighting between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry as India blamed it on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
The US State Department issued a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the grouping, who met in Washington, but stopped short of naming Pakistan or blaming Islamabad.
“The Quad unequivocally condemns all acts of terrorism and violent extremism in all its forms and manifestations, including cross-border terrorism,” the ministers said in the statement.
 
 

They called on all members of the United Nations to cooperate actively with “all relevant authorities” in delivering justice to the “perpetrators, organisers, and financiers of this reprehensible act”, without any delay.
India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington’s effort to counter China’s rising influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a strong partner in counterterrorism efforts.
On May 7, Pakistan shot down six Indian jets after they bombed sites across the border that New Delhi alleged were “terrorist infrastructure”, setting off an exchange of attacks between the two countries by fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery that killed dozens until a ceasefire on May 10.
The ceasefire was first announced by US President Donald Trump on social media after Washington held talks with both sides, but India has differed with Trump’s claims that it resulted from his intervention and threats to sever trade talks.
 
 

India’s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.
On Monday, India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, restated its position that trade was not a factor in the ceasefire.
“Relationships will never be free of issues,” he said, referring to the United States, adding, “What matters is the ability to deal with it and to keep that trend going in the positive direction.”
Last week, defence ministers attending a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting failed to adopt a joint communiqué as New Delhi refused to sign the statement over the exclusion of language referring to the Pahalgam attack.
The discord was a rare outcome for the 10-member Eurasian bloc that prides itself on consensus-based decision-making.</p><small>2025-07-02 08:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/02114901722dedf.jpg?r=115037' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921534/jaishankar-again-disputes-trumps-south-asia-ceasefire-claim' target='_blank'><strong>Jaishankar again disputes Trump’s ‘South Asia’ ceasefire claim</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, currently in Washington to participate in a Quad meeting, has again publicly challenged US President Donald Trump’s assertions that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, following a military escalation between the two nuclear armed neighbours in May this year.
In an interview with Newsweek, Jaishankar firmly denied Trump’s version of events, saying: “I can tell you that I was in the room when Vice President [JD] Vance spoke to Prime Minister Modi on the night of May 9.”
“There was no linking of trade and ceasefire,” he added.
Jaishankar recalled that Vance warned Modi that Pakistan was preparing for a large-scale attack.

Tells Newsweek he was ‘in the room’ when Vance spoke to Modi, claims trade was never discussed

“We did not accept certain things,” he said, noting that Modi remained unfazed and signalled that India would respond decisively.
The next morning, he claimed, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio informed him that Pakistan was ready to talk. Later that day, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations, Major General Kashif Abdullah, directly contacted his Indian counterpart to request a ceasefire, the Indian minister asserted.
The remarks offer the first detailed Indian account of how the standoff ended — a version that contradicts Trump’s narrative. There was no official reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office until going to press.
The US president insists it was his personal intervention — via trade pressure and high-level calls — that prevented a nuclear conflict between the two South Asian neighbors.
India has publicly expressed frustration over what it sees as the Trump administration’s increasing tendency to insert itself into India-Pakistan affairs — particularly on the Kashmir issue. Trump’s repeated offers to “mediate” have drawn strong reactions in New Delhi, which has long rejected third-party involvement.
Trump has not only taken credit for defusing the May standoff but also praised Pakistan’s military leadership for its restraint — suggesting their cooperation made a peaceful resolution possible. While this framing may serve Washington’s broader diplomatic aims, it sits uneasily with New Delhi.
Islamabad, by contrast, has welcomed Trump’s acknowledgment of its role in easing the crisis. His remarks crediting an unnamed “quiet but decisive” Pakistani general are widely seen as referring to Field Marshal Asim Munir, the army chief.
The army chief’s Munir’s recent visit to Washington — which included a White House meeting — marked a significant breakthrough after years of limited military engagement.
Following the visit, Secretary Rubio made two phone calls to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, further fuelling speculation about US efforts to play a back-channel role in managing tensions in South Asia.
In remarks at a separate engagement, Jaishankar declared that India will not “yield to nuclear blackmail” while responding to alleged terrorist attacks, reaffirming New Delhi’s claim that the May 9 strikes inside Pakistan were retaliation for the Pahalgam incident.
Later, at a news briefing in Washington following a Quad meeting, Jaishankar appeared to hurl a veiled warning at Pakistan when he said: “The world must display zero tolerance [towards terrorism]. Victims and perpetrators must never be equated, and India has every right to defend its people against terrorism. And we will exercise that right. We expect our Quad partners to understand and appreciate that.”

It is stated to be one of the mega irregularities reported so far in the accounts of the health authority, raising questions about the transparency in the public exchequer.
According to the audit report (a copy is also available with Dawn), there were 32 formations in the authority, and the audit was conducted of only 12 formations.
Total expenditure and revenue of the health authority were Rs5,070m and Rs5.8m, respectively, out of which 61pc expenditure and 65pc receipts were audited.

Auditor general exposes massive financial irregularities in scrutiny of 2022-24, raising questions about transparency

During an audit of the chief executive officer (CEO) of the authority for the financial year 2023-24, it was observed that it had purchased bulk medicines for Rs138.2m.
 
 

The probe revealed that minimum three prequalified bidders did not participate in the bidding process, and accordingly purchase order was issued in violation of clarification by the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) and instructions issued by the Directorate General of Health Services Punjab. This resulted in irregular purchase of medicines worth Rs138.2m, and irregular purchase occurred due to weak financial controls, the report says.
In the audit of the financial years 2022-24, it was observed that the management had hired different batches of contingent paid staff for polio and dengue activities and paid Rs10.742m.
Scrutiny revealed that the management entered twice the same candidates with same names and CNICs in the same appointment orders/acquaintance rolls to draw double or triple salaries and embezzled the amount mentioned above. The matter was reported to the Principal Accounting Officer (PAO) in Sep 2024, reads the report.
The management claimed salary discrepancies were due to typographical errors but failed to provide supporting records, making the reply unsatisfactory.
The Special Departmental Accounts Committee (SDAC), in its meeting on Nov 19, 2024 directed an administrative-level inquiry along with recovery of overpayment.
“No compliance was shown to the audit till finalization of the report in 2025 and the audit recommends recovery besides fixing responsibility against the person(s) at fault,” reads the audit report.
During an audit of 2022-24, it was observed that the amount of Rs192.7m was drawn from the treasury on account of the salary of contingent-paid staff.
Scrutiny revealed that Rs153.5m was paid and the remaining amount of Rs39.2m was misappropriated. Audit recommends recovery and fixing of responsibility. Under the same head,
The audit found that the management had withdrawn Rs451.4m on account of the salary of 6,552 contingent-paid staff hired for 152 days. However, as per attendance register out of 6,552 employees, 3,492 employees remained absent for 16,676 days but payment of Rs15.6m was paid for the absence period. The management misappropriated the overdrawn amount.
The audit found misappropriation of Rs58.5m due to the double hiring of contingent paid staff for the same period in different towns. The matter was reported to the PAO concerned in November 2024.
The management replied that the deputy district officers health were concerned only with the staff hired and paid for their towns only and the duplication with other towns was not known.
The reply was not tenable. The Special Departmental Accounts Committee, in its meeting on Nov 19, 2024, directed an inquiry at the administrative level to fix the responsibility. No compliance was shown to audit till finalization of the report.
During the audit of deputy district officer health (DDOH) Wahga Town for the financial years 2022-24, it was observed that Dr Hafiz Naveed, after transfer on Sept 26, 2022 and charge relinquishment on Sept 27, 2022, irregularly sanctioned Rs42.5m on Sept 28, 2022.
 
 

The audit report says that he opened an unauthorised bank account with the Bilal Ganj branch of a private bank without finance department’s approval, while maintaining the existing Baghbanpura account with a public bank.
A treasury cheque for Rs42.5m was deposited with the new account and subsequently withdrawn through two cheques of Rs20m and Rs 22.5m.
Moreover, the then DDO presented the bogus hiring orders as the details of CPS hired at Wagah Town and those entered in the bill submitted to the AG Office did not match. This resulted in fraudulent cash withdrawal of staff funds on fake orders of Rs42.5m.
Similarly, the audit report also pointed out irregularities, misappropriation and embezzlement of other funds in the account of the health authority. Some of them included, Rs47.6m against unauthorised engagement of additional staff, Rs487m against non-transparent hiring of the employees, Rs45.8m against overpayment of pay and allowances, etc.

The US Department of Education said in a statement that UPenn had entered into a resolution agreement vowing to comply with Title IX, the federal law which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any educational program.
It follows an investigation by the department’s Office for Civil Rights, which found the university had violated Title IX by allowing transgender swimmer Thomas to compete in women’s competitions in 2021-2022.
US President Donald Trump, who campaigned on the issue of trans athletes, has worked to prohibit them from competing in girls’ and women’s sports since returning to office.
Trump issued an executive order in February aimed at banning transgender athletes, allowing federal agencies to halt funding to any institution that does not consider birth-assigned genders in determining sex.
US Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement on Tuesday that the resolution of the UPenn case marked a “great victory for women and girls … across our nation”.
 






“The Department commends UPenn for rectifying its past harms against women and girls, and we will continue to fight relentlessly to restore Title IX’s proper application and enforce it to the fullest extent of the law.”
Under the terms of the settlement, UPenn will restore all individual swimming records and titles to female athletes affected by Thomas’s participation.
The university will also send a “personalised letter of apology” to each swimmer impacted by the case.
The college will also be required to issue a public statement specifying it will “not allow males to compete in female athletic programmes” or use Penn Athletics facilities for women, such as locker rooms.
Thomas became a lightning rod around the debate of transgender athletes in women’s sports after competing in female collegiate competitions in 2022.
She had earlier swum on UPenn’s men’s team while undergoing hormone replacement therapy.
Her participation in women’s events sparked widespread outrage, with critics and some fellow swimmers saying she should not have been allowed to compete due to an unfair physiological advantage. Her supporters argued she should be allowed to compete as a woman.
One of Thomas’s competitors, Riley Gaines, welcomed Tuesday’s announcement.
 






Gaines has been a long-time critic of Thomas’s participation in women’s collegiate swimming, and tied for fifth place with her in the 200-yard freestyle at a national collegiate meeting in 2022.
“It is my hope that today demonstrates to educational institutions that they will no longer be allowed to trample upon women’s civil rights, and renews hope in every female athlete that their country’s highest leadership will not relent until they have the dignity, safety, and fairness they deserve,” Gaines said in a statement.</p><small>2025-07-02 07:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/021157466a3b4ed.jpg?r=115752' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921510/phc-moved-for-inquiry-into-swat-flood-deaths' target='_blank'><strong>PHC moved for inquiry into Swat flood deaths</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR/SWAT: Two petitions have been filed with Peshawar High Court in Peshawar and Mingora (Darul Qaza), seeking an inquiry into several deaths in the recent flash floods in Swat district and the fixing of responsibility for the alleged negligence.
In Swat, a bench consisting of Justice Sabitullah Khan and Justice Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah issued notices to the respondents, including the provincial government, seeking their response to a petition, which called for the court’s orders for Swat’s district administration and tehsil municipal administration of Mingora to immediately remove illegal structures along the river banks and to halt excavations therein.
The petition is jointly filed by two citizens, Fayyaz Zafar and Fazal Khaliq, requesting the high court to direct the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and Rescue 1122 to develop a formal framework for the identification, training and equipping of local volunteers, who significantly contributed to the disaster response.
Advocate Shah Faisal Khan appeared for the petitioners and highlighted the severe consequences of the recent floods in the Bypass Fizagat area, emphasising alleged administrative negligence and failure in preventive measures.
Meanwhile, a citizen on Tuesday moved the high court in Peshawar for ordering a judicial inquiry into the “circumstances” that led to the deaths of multiple people during the recent floods in Swat, as well as a probe into the alleged misuse of Rescue 1122 vehicles by the provincial government for “political purposes.”
A resident of Charsadda, Amir Alam, filed a petition seeking directives for the law-enforcement and accountability authorities to look into the alleged misuse of Rescue 1122 vehicles and resources by the provincial executive for political purposes, and to proceed strictly in accordance with the law if cognizable offences were committed.
He requested the court to order a high-level judicial or commission-based inquiry to determine the circumstances that led to the failure of the disaster response system during the Swat floods of Jun 27, fixing responsibility on the negligent officers and public functionaries.
The petitioner sought the court’s directives for the provincial chief secretary and director general of Rescue 1122 to submit a detailed report regarding the current operational status of all rescue and disaster relief vehicles/ equipment and their lawful utilisation.
He also requested directives for the respondents, including the provincial government, to cancel all mining activities, carried out through auction or otherwise, in the River Swat.
The petitioner also sought orders for an independent audit and investigation into the recruitment process and resource allocation within Rescue 1122 to ensure transparency, merit and prevent political interference in emergency situations.
The petition, filed through lawyer Babar Khan Yousafzai, includes as respondents the provincial chief minister, its chief secretary, secretaries of mines and mineral, irrigation, relief and rehabilitation, local government and culture and tourism departments, the directors general of Rescue 1122 and Provincial Disaster Management Authority and KP inspector general of police.
The petitioner said that on June 27, flash floods struck Swat district resulting in the death of at least 18 people, including tourists from Punjab.
He added that the failure of Rescue 1122 and provincial authorities to respond timely and effectively caused unnecessary and avoidable loss of lives.
The petitioner alleged that over six months ago, the Rescue 1122 vehicles and other resources were “unlawfully diverted” by the chief minister for use in a political protest in Islamabad.
He added that those vehicles were confiscated by Islamabad’s police, severely hampering disaster preparedness across the province.
The petitioner contended that the PDMA operated under the KP Disaster Management Act, 2010, under which its resources might be used for disaster preparedness and response only.

The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Erad­ication at the National Ins­titute of Health (NIH) has confirmed the latest polio case from District North Waziristan in southern KP.
“A 19-month-old boy from Union Council Mir­an­shah-3, District North Waziristan, has been confirmed as the eighth polio case from KP this year. With this latest detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 14 — including eight from KP, four from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” an official from the laboratory said.
“Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under the age of five during each campaign, along with timely completion of all essential immunisations,” he said.
“While nationwide efforts to eradicate polio continue to improve the quality of vaccination campaigns, the southern districts of KP remain a major concern due to limited access and challenges in conducting house-to-house vaccination. These obstacles result in missed opportunities, leaving thousands of children unvaccinated and vulnerable to poliovirus,” the official said.
“A special vaccination activity was conducted in six union councils of Bannu from June 23 to 28, during which 17,485 children received the Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). A similar targeted vaccination drive is being planned in 11 union councils of North Waziristan.
“Additionally, preparations are underway for a large-scale special vaccination campaign in southern KP, scheduled for August,” he further said.
“Recent polio cases in sou­thern KP are a stark reminder that children missed during vaccination campaigns rem­ain at serious risk. While the programme is making every effort to reach every child, the role of parents is critical. Ensuring every child receives every dose of the polio vaccine is not just important — it’s urgent,” he emphasised.

“The name of the institution remains ‘Jinnah Institute of Cardiology, Lahore’ and no change is under consideration. In the Punjab government’s annual development programme for the fiscal year 2025-26, funding has been allocated under the name Jinnah Institute of Cardiology,” Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said in a post on ‘X’ on Tuesday.
 






“As part of the efforts to provide world-class treatment for cardiac and other diseases, 14 new hospitals will be established in the Nawaz Sharif Medical District. The master plan for this project is near completion,” Ms Aurangzeb said and asked journalists to “verify the facts” before publishing any news.
The controversy stemmed from the speech of the chief minister in the Punjab Assembly and a subsequent statement by Punjab Health Minister Khwaja Salman Rafique.
The minister had said the Jinnah Institute of Cardiology Lahore has been renamed as ‘Maryam Nawaz Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases’.
The chief minister said on the floor of the House on Saturday last that she has decided to set up an extension of the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) as both the population and heart diseases had increased in the province.
“The Maryam Nawaz Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases will be an extension of the PIC. It is in the final stage of completion,” she said and also showed the pictures of the project site in the assembly.
Following this decision, the provincial government as well as the chief minister faced backlash on social media as even ‘pro-PML-N’ analysts and journalists started questioning the logic behind this move.
PTI senior leader and former federal minister Moonis Elahi said on X: “This is too much. The institute which was established in the name of the father of the nation has been renamed after Maryam Nawaz. This is outrageous.”
 






PPP Punjab leader Faisal Mir said: “When small people reach big positions by accident or other means, this is what exactly happens. The name of the father of the nation is being erased so that a sitting chief minister can plaster her own name there.
Former Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said: “That’s the way to go. Jinnah who? If self-entitlement and being deaf to public opinion had another name.”
 






Journalist Mona Alam said: “Sorry Maryam Nawaz sahiba, but Jinnah’s name is the red line for every Pakistani.”
Khwaja Salman Rafique on Tuesday also clarified that in the official documents, there has been no change in the name of the cardiac facility in question.

Justice Jawad Hassan of LHC, Rawalpindi Bench, issued the order on Tuesday and set a three-month deadline for the mediation process.
The dispute is over 250 kanals of land acquired by the military in the early 1980s in Shamsabad, Rawalpindi, for defence purposes. Later, the land’s status was changed to commercial and Panorama Shopping Centre was built over it.
During the proceedings on Tuesday, petitioners’ lawyer, Sardar Muhammad Ghazi, informed the court that the clients filed the case under Article 199 of the Constitution. They had sought an amicable settlement of disputes related to their acquired land, particularly the issue of fair market compensation.
He highlighted that the prolonged litigation has distressed the landowners, who were now inclined to settle the matter outside court through mediation.
 
 

The military authorities, through a letter dated June 24, had already expressed their willingness to settle the dispute out of court. He noted that one of the landowners, Chaudhary Riaz Ahmed, had already shown willingness to settle the matter out of court and had written to the Army Air Defence Command, Rawalpindi, in this regard.
The authorities, in response to the letter, said, “…the request has been considered at appropriate level and [Headquarters Command] has agreed to resolve the matter of price/compensation through out of court settlement, subject to withdrawal of all writ petitions related to Ohjri Camp land”.
During the proceedings on Tuesday, Advocate Ghazi cited Supreme Court judgments, including Messrs Mughals Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd vs EOBI (PLD 2025 SC 1) and Muhammad Naseer Butt vs Additional District Judge, Lahore, to emphasise the constitutional and statutory backing for mediation under the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017.
Justice Hassan, while disposing of the matter, acknowledged the petitioners’ decision and directed the relevant authorities to expedite the mediation process.
He ordered that meetings for dispute resolution should be held at a time and place suited to the respondents. The entire exercise must be completed strictly in accordance with the law in three months, the judge ordered.
In 2012, the LHC had directed the Ministry of Defence to either vacate the land or compensate the owners. However, the decision was not implemented.

The verdict, it seems, was foretold given the composition of the bench, which was formed after the passage of the 26th Amendment that has drastically curtailed the judiciary’s independence.
In what has been described as a clear deviation from the rules, the Bench reversed the earlier full-court decision. The controversial judgement has awarded the reserved seats to the ruling coalition parties beyond their proportional strength in the assemblies. This makes a mockery of whatever was left of the so-called democratic process. Not only has the court’s decision validated a dispensation with a questionable mandate, it has also empowered the government to amend the Constitution at will, with the additional reserved seats giving the ruling coalition a two-third majority in parliament.
It is not only about the allocation of 77 reserved seats for women and minorities in the National Assembly; it is also about seat distribution in the provinces. The reallocation of these seats will help consolidate the hold of the ruling parties in the provinces. In KP, where the ruling PTI will not receive any reserved seats, it will improve these parties’ position. (On Tuesday, the Peshawar High Court stopped oath-taking in the KP Assembly over a petition challenging the reserved seats’ allocation.)
 
 

In fact, some parties in KP will get more reserved seats than their number of elected members in the assembly. For instance, a party with one directly elected member is set to get two reserved seats. It defies all logic. The Supreme Court ruling has further distorted an already flawed political structure, and is likely to facilitate arbitrary rule and political anarchy in the country.
There are speculations that the government will soon move a ‘27th Amendment’ with its newfound absolute majority in the National Assembly. The contours of the proposed constitutional change are not clear yet but there are strong indications that the country is moving towards authoritarianism. A tamed judiciary makes it much easier for the present dispensation to further curb democratic and fundamental rights.

A tamed judiciary makes it easier to further curb democratic and fundamental rights.

We already have hybrid rule in the country, with the establishment dominating the power structure. Now, there is reportedly a move to formalise the current power arrangement, giving the military leadership a constitutional political role. There had been such suggestion in the past as well, but it never materialised because of strong political resistance.
However, with the overarching power of the establishment and a civilian political set-up with questionable legitimacy, there seems to be no effective challenge to any move to establish quasi-military rule under constitutional cover. There are also suggestions to strike down parts of the 18th Amendment and make changes to the NFC award.
It is certainly a sensitive political issue that may spark strong opposition especially in the smaller provinces. A centralised set-up dominated by the security establishment will be disastrous for the unity and stability of the federation. Political stability depends on a strong federation and a truly elected government and not on the coercive powers of the state. We have seen direct military rule in this country several times but they only weakened the state and widened the gap between the provinces and the federating units. A constitutional role for the security establishment in the power structure will increase public alienation from the state.
The roots of the current political instability lie in last year’s rigged elections that brought to power a government with a questionable mandate. Despite the ban denying the PTI its electoral symbol, people came out to vote for it. But the people’s mandate was stolen. The full bench of the Supreme Court that awarded the PTI its share in the reserved seats by a majority vote in July 2024 had also acknowledged its status as a parliamentary party and said that being denied of its electoral symbol had no bearing on its right to participate in elections. The allocation of reserved seats would have made the PTI the largest party in the National Assembly.
But the ruling of the country’s highest court was never implemented by the Election Commis­sion. The government also rejected the ruling. There is little precedent for state institutions and the executive in Pakistan defying the apex cou­rt’s orders.
Dissenting judges, including the then chief justice Qazi Faez Isa, also indicated it was not binding on institutions to implement the ruling. This can be seen as a breach of the rules and violation of judicial ethics. There is hardly any precedent in the country of judges being seen as condoning non-implementation of a court order. Ironically, two of the judges were part of the 10-member constitutional bench that last week reversed the previous full court judgement.
 
 

It was apparent that the establishment and the ruling coalition would have never allowed the PTI to emerge as the single largest party in the House to threaten the dispensation. It was then the government decided to clip the powers of the apex court through the 26th Amendment. It also established a separate Constitutional Bench that would hear the review petition on the reserved seats. The government made sure that the bench was packed with pliant judges. So, that’s how a favourable ruling was managed.
Seemingly the establishment-backed coalition government is now in a comfortable position. The two-third majority it will enjoy has given the government greater room for manoeuvre. The ruling has also come as a huge setback to the PTI, which appears to be in a state of complete disarray, with its main leaders behind bars for the past two years. Yet there is no sign that it is losing its mass support base across the country.
The coercive use of state power cannot silence the voices of resistance. The country is now witnessing creeping authoritarianism facilitated by a pliant judiciary.

A subcommittee of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Federal Education met at IBCC with MNA Sabheen Ghoury in the chair and discussed the issue of recent paper leak of O/A Level exam.
The committee showed its concerns over the leak of question papers of the exam conducted by Cambridge Assessment International Education (CIE).
A CIE official told the committee that three partial papers were leaked and affected students would be given compensated grade. The committee was also told that students who appeared in the three papers had the option of retaking the papers in November without paying any fee.
The committee directed that in case of any paper leak in future, a third-party investigation would be carried out. During the meeting, the issue of tax was also discussed and the British Council informed the committee that the CIE exams were held in Pakistan under a general government-to-government framework.
IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah said that soon IBCC will call a meeting of all foreign boards to finalise a strategy and framework. He said IBCC was entrusted with the standardisation and regulation of academic assessment practices across Pakistan and it was mandated to develop and promote national and international linkage.
“We have already sent a letter to foreign boards for upcoming meeting,” he told the committee.
In its official statement issued on June 30, Cambridge University stated: “Update about June 2025 question paper leak allegations in Pakistan.We are now sharing further details about the support available for students who sat one or more of the three affected papers: Cambridge International AS & A Level Mathematics Paper 12, Cambridge International AS & A Level Mathematics Paper 42, and Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science Paper 22.
The results for these syllabuses will be released as normal. To support affected students, we are offering free syllabus entry resits in the upcoming November 2025 exam series for candidates who sat one or more of the three affected papers in the June 2025 exam series. Resits are optional, and we will share further information with schools on how to make resit entries for these syllabuses after we release results for the June 2025 exam series. Private candidates will receive guidance from the British Council on how to submit their entries.“

This marks the lowest inflation rate since FY16, when it stood at 2.9pc — a nine-year low.
Pakistan is currently experiencing disinflation, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), average cumulative inflation over the past 53 months has risen by 83pc, significantly affecting retail prices of consumer goods. Despite the recent decline in inflation, the cost of living remains elevated.
The State Bank of Pakistan has revised its inflation target for FY25 to a range of 5-7pc, down from the government’s initial projection of 12pc. The International Mon­etary Fund has also lowered its inflation forecast for the same period to 9.5pc, compared to its earlier estimate of 12.7pc. For FY26, the government has set an inflation target of 7.5pc.
The inflation rate in June recorded a growth of 3.2pc, slightly eased from 3.5pc recorded in May. This decline was mainly contributed by a slight decrease in the prices of food items during the month under review.
 
 

The headline inflation, measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased by 0.2pc in June on a month-on-month basis, according to data released by the PBS on Tuesday.
The annual inflation, however, fell short of the projected targets. Analysts attributed the decline to lower global commodity prices, stable exchange rates, higher base effect and better agricultural outputs.
Over the past 12 months, the average monthly inflation has shown fluctuations.
The inflation rate in June 2025 was the lowest mainly due to the high base effect from the previous year (June 2024 — 12.6pc).
The CPI inflation dropped to 9.6pc in August 2024, marking the first single-digit figure in over three years, and the downward trend continued in the following months.
Food inflation for June recorded a positive growth of 4.2pc in urban areas and 2.4pc in rural areas, whereas non-food inflation was 2.2pc in urban areas and 4.7pc in rural areas.
The food prices rebounded to a positive trend after a decline in four consecutive months.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was recorded at 6.9pc in urban areas and 8.6pc in rural areas in May.
In urban areas, the food items whose prices saw the month-on-month increase in June included tomatoes (57.33pc), potatoes (25.74pc), onions (15.26pc), eggs (8.82pc), gur (2.75pc), rice (1.67pc), wheat flour (1.53pc), sugar (1.52pc), fresh fruits (1.38pc), milk powder (0.78pc), milk fresh (0.40pc) and milk products (0.35pc).

• Industrialists demand end to peak, off-peak charges; decry denial of promised ‘sizeable relief’
• No change in rates for first two slabs of domestic consumers; relief ranges between 3pc and 10pc depending on usage
ISLAMABAD: As the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) decided on Tuesday to reduce the national average power tariff by Rs1.14 per unit, the move was criticised by industrialists and businesspersons from Karachi as being “too minuscule”.
The decision to reduce the tariff was taken at a public hearing presided over by Nepra members Maqsood Anwar and Rafique Shaikh.
The government team, led by the Power Division additional secretary, Mehfooz Bhatti, said the regulator had determined national average tariff — excluding all taxes, surcharges and duties — at Rs34 for FY2025-26, down Rs1.50 per unit from Rs35.50 per unit last year.
 
 

After subsidies and cross-subsidies, the government has worked out the tariff to be Rs31.59 per unit, as compared to Rs32.73 per unit last year, a reduction of Re1.14 per unit.
The official said the same rate would apply to K-Electric consumers under the government’s uniform tariff policy.
A formal notification of the new tariffs will be issued within this week. The new rates will take effect from July 1.
Rushed process
Karachi-based representatives of the FPCCI, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Korangi Association of Trade and Industry and Surjani Town businesses criticised the government and the Nepra for rushing through the approval process and not allowing their requests for time to understand and review the government’s petition.
They said the Power Division filed the petition on June 28. It was approved a day later by the federal cabinet and made public on June 30 for a hearing on July 1.
They said the process violated the law that provided at least seven days after the publication of petition to hold a public hearing.
Peak, off-peak billing
The industrialists criticised the government for a nominal reduction of Rs1.14 per unit in the tariff after promising “sizeable relief”.
“Even after the reduction of Rs1.14 per unit, the effective tariff would be about Rs5 per unit higher than last year when the industry paid on average Rs30 per unit”, said one of the businessperson.
 
 

The government team insisted the effective average tariff during the new fiscal year would be around Rs40.43 against Rs47.89 per unit in FY2025 after taking into account all taxes, surcharges, duties and quarterly adjustments and the removal of PTV fee and electricity duty.
They said the government efforts, coupled with improved exchange rate, helped reduce capacity payments by Rs1.27 per unit on average from 30.88 to Rs29.61 per unit when compared to the outgoing year.
The average transmission and distribution losses of Discos, they claimed, had dropped to 11.03pc from 11.43pc.
Industrial consumers also demanded an end to peak and off-peak rates, enabling the industry to operate round-the-clock instead of shutting down during peak hours due to higher rates.
New tariff
The Rs1.15 per unit reduction in tariff would apply to consumers in almost all categories, except lifeline domestic consumers.
There would be no change in electricity rates for first two lifeline slabs of domestic consumers, as they are already over-subsidised.
The per unit rate for lifeline consumers with up to 50 units per month would remain unchanged at Rs3.95, followed by Rs7.74 for those in 50 to 100 unit monthly consumption. They have to maintain their consumption threshold throughout the year.
For all other consumers and categories, the government sought a flat Rs1.15 per unit reduction for FY2025-26.
However, the relief ranges between 3 to 10pc depending on the users’ respective rates at present.
The protected consumers in 1 to 100 units would now be charged at Rs10.54 per unit, instead of Rs11.69 at present, showing a reduction of 9.8pc.
The subsequent slab in the protected category would be charged at Rs13.01 per unit instead of Rs14.16 per unit, down 8pc.
The non-protected consumers in first 100 units would be charged at Rs23.44 per unit instead of Rs23.59 per unit, down by almost 5pc.
The reduction in rates for all other categories including commercial, industrial, agriculture and bulk consumers would  vary from three to four percent but flat Rs1.15 per unit. The cheapest rate, in these categories, have been provided to the industry whose average rate would now be Rs33.48 per unit instead of Rs44.32 per unit.
Commercial consumers would be provided electricity at an average Rs45.43 per unit instead of Rs46.58 per unit. The average rate of general services would be Rs43.17 per unit instead of Rs44.32 while tariff for bulk consumers would come down to Rs41.76 per unit from Rs42.92 per unit.
However, agricultural consumers would get an even cheaper rate of Rs30.75 per unit instead of Rs31.90. The average rate would work out to be around Rs31.60 per unit from about Rs32.75 per unit at present.

“Clearly, this is a disappointing development,” said Andrew Johnson, a senior official at the New Zealand Space Agency.
“As those who work in the space sector know, space is inherently challenging, and every attempt — successful or not — pushes the boundaries of what we know and what we’re capable of.”
The Environmental Defence Fund, which led the project, said it was “difficult news” but would not be the end of its methane-tracking efforts.
MethaneSAT was designed to measure emissions of the potent greenhouse gas, which fuels climate change by trapping heat in the planet’s atmosphere.
 
 

It has proven notoriously difficult to get accurate estimates of the methane emissions belched out by oil and gas projects around the globe.
“It was one of the most advanced methane tracking satellites in space, measuring methane emissions in oil and gas producing regions across the world,” the MethaneSAT team said.
‘Remarkable’
Project lead Steven Hamburg said initial data gleaned by the satellite was “remarkable”.
“Recent measurements in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico revealed emissions three to five times higher than estimated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, while emissions observed in the South Caspian region are over 10 times higher than reported,” Hamburg wrote on LinkedIn.
MethaneSAT was launched into space in March 2024 on the back of a SpaceX rocket fired from California.
Controllers first lost contact with the satellite on June 20, the MethaneSAT team said in a statement.
They confirmed it had lost all power on Monday this week and was “likely not recoverable”.
“The engineering team is conducting a thorough investigation into the loss of communication,” MethaneSAT said. “This is expected to take time. We will share what we learn.”
Despite its shorter-than-expected lifespan, MethaneSAT hailed the mission as a “remarkable success in terms of scientific and technological accomplishment”.
The satellite eventually succumbed after overcoming a string of technical glitches.
It repeatedly entered a sleep, or stand-by, mode without prompting — forcing engineers to perform a lengthy reset each time.
One of its three thrusters also failed.</p><small>2025-07-02 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/68645703d7a6f.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921504/naqvi-wants-first-phase-of-islamabad-model-jail-ready-by-year-end' target='_blank'><strong>Naqvi wants first phase of Islamabad Model Jail ready by year end</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday issued a deadline to complete the first phase of the Islamabad Model Jail within the current year.
The minister visited the under-construction prison in H-16 along with Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry.
He inspected different sections of the jail and reviewed the progress on the construction. Work on the construction of the model jail, which had been pending for 14 years, has now been expedited.
So far, two barracks have been completed, while the checkposts and the central watchtower are nearing completion.

Says first phase of jail will accommodate 1,500 prisoners; process of appointing necessary staff should also be started immediately

Mr Naqvi issued a deadline to complete the first phase of the project within this year, stressing that all construction activities must be finished within the specified timeline through round-the-clock efforts.
He said the first phase of the jail will accommodate 1,500 prisoners. Additionally, he ordered the construction of two more barracks within 90 days. The minister emphasised the need to complete the 34-bed hospital and the main kitchen without delay.
He also instructed the DIG Islamabad police to submit a staff deployment plan for the jail. In May 2024, the chief commissioner of Islamabad, Mohammad Ali Randhawa, presided over a meeting regarding the construction of the model jail and directed all concerned departments to complete and make the facility operational within 100 days.
A delay in the construction of the jail will not be tolerated, he said at that time.
In the meeting, the commissioner was also briefed about the ongoing construction work and informed that 73 per cent of the administration block, 98 per cent of the wall and 42 per cent of the male barracks had been completed.
Later, in the same month, Mr Naqvi said the jail will be completed in six months, despite the chief commissioner’s deadline of 100 days.
Four days later, the interior minister inspected the under-construction jail and tasked the officials concerned with completing the first phase of the prison construction within six months.
He directed the commissioner and the IG Islamabad police to regularly review progress on construction activities.
The process of appointing necessary staff should also be started immediately, he ordered, adding that the provision of resources for the completion of the project will be ensured.
Work on the model jail project was started in 2016-17, but it is yet to be completed. As per the original PC-I, the project worth Rs3,920.523 million was supposed to be completed in 36 months, by July 2019.
Later, the PC-I was revised with the cost escalating to Rs18,279.498 million. According to the revised PC-I, the project was supposed to be completed in July 2024.
In the revised PC-I, the covered area was increased from 869,621 square feet to 914,329 square feet.
The PC-I was revised due to changes to the covered area, variations in scope as per actual site conditions, replacements of asphaltic roads, revision of the foundation design due to a shallow water table, service conditions, land premiums, the sewerage treatment plant, enhanced security level equipment and inflation.
The jail construction project was conceived in 2007, and a committee was formed by the Ministry of Interior comprising the ICT administration, CDA and the district judiciary for selecting an appropriate site.  The site was finalised in February 2012.
After approval from its board, the CDA allotted a 90-acre plot in H-16/2 to the ICT administration in 2013 and the land was handed over to it in 2014.

The premier had increased petroleum levy on petroleum products by Rs8 per litre and announced that the funding would be used for building and upgrading the 815km road project, formerly known as RCD highway. The government has allocated Rs100 billion in the current year budget for the project.
Progress on the N-25 project was reviewed on Tuesday at a meeting, which was presided over by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, with the representatives of the Ministry of Communications, National Highway Authority (NHA) and Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) in attendance.
During the meeting, NHA officials updated the project’s status, highlighting that the dualisation of the Hub bypass had been added to the revised PC-1 project, following the recommendation by the communication minister on June 20. The revised PC-1 is expected to be submitted on Wednesday (July 2).

Revised plan for expressway from Karachi-Chaman will be submitted today

Earlier, in line with the government directives, the NHA had invited bids from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) on June 17, with bid opening scheduled on July 2. The FWO provided an update on the project’s progress, stating that work was being carried out in four sections. Notably, 68pc of the work on the 51km stretch from Jiwa to Surab had been completed.
Calling for immediate completion of required formalities, the planning minister “directed NHA that the groundbreaking ceremony be scheduled for Aug 14, 2025”, said an announcement.
He also reviewed plans for construction of service areas along the expressway and emphasised the need for well-designed facilities catering to the needs of truckers. “Well-equipped service areas should be constructed on both sides of the expressway, providing rest areas, fuel pumps, restaurants, vehicle workshops, and other essential amenities,” he said.
The meeting decided to also take input from representatives of truck companies to determine ideal locations for these service areas. Among the mini service areas to be constructed along the expressway, some of them should be larger, offering comprehensive services to truckers, the minister said.
Expressing concern over the security, the minister stated that 42 FWO workers lost their lives during the construction of N-85 and called for strict security measures. The Balochistan government had already been conveyed that Gwadar city and N-85 — 444km Hoshab to Panjgur road built under CPEC — must be secured under all circumstances.
The meeting also decided to develop a dedicated security force for N-25, with security deployment aligned with the work schedule.
Furthermore, the minister highlighted the importance of considering potential future expansion of expressway lanes due to increased regional connectivity. “Considering flow of traffic in the next few decades, the development of this expressway must be executed in a way that it’s easier to expand it into six lanes, whenever needed in future,” he said.
Calling the N-25 a critical route for transportation between Sindh and Balochistan and a potential gateway for Central Asia, Mr Iqbal reaffirmed its potential to uplift the socioeconomic development of Balochistan. He asked the stakeholders to complete the project by August 2027.

• Hamas says US pressure essential as Israeli officials to hold ceasefire talks in Washington
• Over 170 charities call for end to Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s ‘deadly’ aid distribution system
WASHINGTON: The United States is pushing for a truce in Gaza by “sometime next week”, US President Donald Trump said Tuesday.
The Republican leader was asked by reporters if a ceasefire by Israel in its devastating war on Palestinians could be in place before a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House, set for July 7.
Trump said he is hopeful that a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ agreement can be achieved soon.
“We hope it’s going to happen, and we’re looking for it to happen sometime next week,” Trump responded as he departed Washington for Florida.
In Florida, he told the media that he would be “very firm” with Netanyahu on the need for a speedy Gaza ceasefire while noting that the Israeli PM wants one as well.
A senior Israeli official, Ron Dermer, has been in Washington this week holding talks ahead of the meeting.
Last week, the US president had signalled that an agreement involving Israel and Hamas could come as early as the current week.
“The situation in Gaza is terrible. We think, within the next week, we are going to get a ceasefire,” he told reporters at the White House on Friday.
Hamas has said it is willing to free  remaining prisoners in Gaza under any deal to end the war, while Israel  says it will only back down once Hamas is “disarmed and dismantled”.
Military escalation in Gaza
But even as Netanyahu’s confidant was in talks over a possible ceasefire, Israeli planes and tanks struck heavily in north and south Gaza on Tuesday, destroying clusters of homes.
Thousands of Gaza residents again took flight as Israel issued new orders to evacuate, while its tanks pushed into eastern areas of Gaza City in the north and into Khan Younis and Rafah in the south, residents said.
Local health authorities said Israeli gunfire and military strikes across the enclave had killed at least 112 people and wounded more than 400 in the past 24 hours, with clusters of houses reported destroyed in Gaza City’s Shejaia and Zeitoun districts, east of Khan Younis and in Rafah. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a confidant of Netanyahu, is in Washington this week to meet with officials at the White House, President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing on Monday.
Dermer would be exploring possibilities of regional diplomatic deals in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war with Iran last month, as well as ending the Gaza war, according to an Israeli official.
Ceasefire efforts stalled
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said pressure by Trump on Israel would be key to any breakthrough in stalled ceasefire efforts.
“We call upon the US administration to atone for its sin towards Gaza by declaring an end to the war,” he said.
After a six-week ceasefire at the start of this year, talks on extending the truce in the nearly 21-month war have stalled.
‘Halt GHF scheme’
Meanwhile, 171 charities in Geneva signed on the call for countries to press Israel to halt Gaza Humanitarian Foundation scheme over concerns it is putting civilians at risk of death and injury.
Over 500 people have been killed near aid distribution centres since May. “Palestinians in Gaza face an impossible choice: starve or risk being shot while trying desperately to reach food to feed their families,” the statement said.
Groups signing it included Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Amnesty International. The NGOs accused the GHF of forcing hungry and weak people to trek for hours, sometimes through active conflict zones.

• SBP reports credit-to-GDP ratio lowest in region
KARACHI: After three years of sluggish activity, private sector borrowing appears to have rebounded, reaching a three-year high in FY25.
According to the State Bank’s latest data released on Monday, the private sector borrowed Rs710 billion during FY25, compared to Rs513bn in FY24 and a mere Rs45.8bn in FY23 — the latter marking one of Pakistan’s worst economic years, as GDP growth turned negative.
In FY24, most of the borrowing was directed towards working capital requirements for industries such as sugar and rice, with little to no investment in new industrial ventures.
Bankers said this trend largely continued into FY25, with borrowing still skewed towards short-term working capital. However, they highlighted a shift in the final quarter of FY25, when a steep decline in interest rates encouraged greater borrowing activity.
Despite a significant cut in interest rates from 22pc to 11pc during FY25, the private sector response remained cautious. Borrowing levels still fell short of those seen in FY22, when the sector borrowed Rs1.33tr — marking a 17.4pc increase that year.
Analysts point to the political and economic turmoil following the change in government during FY23 as a key factor behind the collapse in private sector activity. That year saw negative GDP growth and minimal borrowing.
The private sector is widely recognised as a critical driver of economic development, fuelling investment, employment and business creation. However, its performance remains closely tied to the broader governance environment, which shapes its competitiveness and capacity for growth.
In a recent report, the State Bank observed that Pakistan’s credit-to-GDP ratio has been declining for decades and is among the lowest in the region. This has hindered growth, job creation and poverty reduction.
The SBP identified both demand and supply side constraints, including high borrowing costs, shallow financial markets, crowding out by government borrowing, and banks’ preference for lending to blue-chip corporates. Structural challenges, such as the energy crisis, also continue to weigh on credit expansion.
The SBP maintained a tight monetary policy through FY24, keeping the policy rate at 22pc to curb inflation, which ended the year at 24pc. Though inflation began ticking up again in May, analysts expect no sharp surge in the near term. However, banks’ continued preference for investing in government securities over private lending may limit the private sector’s ability to return to FY22 borrowing levels.

(LEFT to right) IHC CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, PHC CJ S. M. Attique Shah, BHC CJ Rozi Khan Barrech and SHC CJ Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.

• Receives nine votes from 16-member JCP; set to take oath in a couple of days
• Justice Rozi Barrech named BHC CJ, Justice Attique Shah becomes top judge at PHC, Justice Junaid Ghaffar appointed to head SHC
• Justice Mansoor suggests postponing JCP meeting until decision on IHC judges’ appeal
• Justice Mandokhail abstains from voting, citing his position on Constitutional Bench
ISLAMABAD: The five Islamabad High Court judges who had petitioned the Supreme Court over a seniority dispute were left with no recourse on Tuesday, as the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — in a highly-anticipated move — nominated Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar as the permanent chief justice of the high court.
The appointment of Justice Sarfraz Dogar as the new IHC chief justice was expected after President Asif Ali Zardari formally declared him the “senior-most judge” last week, following the issuance of a revised seniority list by the Ministry of Law.
Justice Dogar was transferred to the IHC from the Lahore High Court under Article 200(1) of the Constitution on Feb 1 this year.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the 16-member JCP held four different meetings, also concerning the appointments of chief justices for the Balochistan High Court (BHC), Peshawar High Court (PHC), Sindh High Court (SHC).
But the appointment of the IHC CJ was peculiar, since it had evoked much interest among the legal fraternity in view of the representation by five IHC judges, and a constitutional petition filed before the Supreme Court.
For the IHC, the JCP had three nominees under consideration: Justice Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. Justice Dogar received a total of nine votes, while Justice Aurangzeb was supported by the CJP, PTI members Barrister Syed Ali Zafar and Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as Islamabad High Court Council member Zulfikar Abbas.
Justice Mohsin Kayani received the votes of SC’s senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail did not vote for any nominee, stating that since he was a member of the Const­itutional Bench, he preferred to abstain.
Justice Dogar, however, secured the support of the remaining members: Justice Aminuddin Khan, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Ahsan Bhoon, Sheikh Aftab Ahmed, Rana Tanveer, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui and Roshan Khursheed Bharucha.
He is now expected to take oath in the next couple of days at the Presidency, as the JCP has already informed the principal secretary to the prime minister about his elevation.
As Tuesday’s session commenced, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who was connected via weblink from Tokyo (Japan), suggested postponing the meeting until the pendency of the intra-court appeal (ICA) filed on behalf of the five IHC judges against the Constitutional Bench’s June 19 judgement in the seniority dispute.
In its short order, the CB, by a majority of three to two, had held that the transfer of three judges to the IHC from three different high courts was within the framework of the Constitution.
Subsequently, discussion ensued on the suggestion, with some members stating that since the seniority dispute had already been resolved, the JCP should proceed with the appointment process for the IHC.
Meanwhile, some members suggested that the JCP, as a constitutional body, could decide to put on hold the appointment of Justice Dogar as chief justice. Others were of the view that until the ICA was finally decided, Justice Aurangzeb should be elevated as the acting chief justice of the IHC.
When the JCP commenced its proceedings, Justice Shah reiterated his earlier stance that the commission should wait until the vires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment were decided by the Constitutional Bench before addressing matters that directly flow from it.
Justice Shah also wrote a fresh letter to the JCP to highlight his point.
Earlier, the JCP also considered a letter from Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail of the Balochistan High Court, who drew the commission’s attention to the fact that the participation of retired Justice Nazir Ahmad Lango as its member would violate the mandate of Article 175A(5) of the Constitution.
However, the commission, by majority, reappointed Justice Lango as a member of the commission and, in turn, nominated Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice of the BHC. The names of Justice Mulakhail and Justice Iqbal Ahmed Kazi were also under consideration for the same post.
Justice S.M. Attique Shah was nominated as the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court. The names of Justice Ejaz Anwar and Justice Arshad Ali were also considered. PTI lawmakers and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa law minister opposed Justice Attique’s appointment.
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar was unanimously appointed chief justice of the Sindh High Court.

Federal tax collection in Karachi rose by 29 per cent year-on-year, while the Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) recorded a 29.5pc increase in sales tax on services. The city retained its status as the largest contributor to national and provincial revenue.
The SRB collects General Sales Tax (GST) on services, while five offices of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) — RTO-1, RTO-2, Medium Tax­payers Office (MTO), Corporate Tax Office (CTO), and Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) — handle income tax, sales tax on goods, and Federal Excise Duty (FED) within Karachi.
 
 

According to estimates, 80pc of SRB’s GST collection originates from Karachi, with the remaining 20pc from interior Sindh. However, even when operations are based outside the city, taxes are still collected at the company headquarters in Karachi.

LTO and SRB report historic highs in income tax and GST on services in FY25

LTO Karachi performance
The Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) Karachi collected Rs3.256 trillion in FY25, up from Rs2.515tr in the previous year — an increase of 29.46pc.
The LTO Karachi also collected record Rs184.7bn in one day with overall collection of Rs449.05bn in June, registering a growth of 48pc year on year.  The LTO chief commissioner attributed this performance to a committed and professional team.
Income tax collection reached Rs1.798tr in the outgoing fiscal year, up 32pc from Rs1.360tr a year ago.
Sales tax grew by 21pc to Rs1.235tr from Rs1.018tr, while FED rose sharply by 63pc to Rs222.2bn from Rs136.3bn.
The figures do not include taxes collected via port operations, further underscoring Karachi’s economic importance.
 
 

SRB collection
The Sindh Revenue Board collected Rs306.6bn in the fiscal year 2024-25, up from Rs236.8bn in FY24. Despite low inflation and modest economic growth, the provincial tax authority maintained double-digit growth. In June alone, SRB collected Rs40.5bn — its highest-ever monthly total — up 44pc from Rs28.1bn in June FY24 and 3pc higher than May FY25.
SRB Chairman Dr Wasif Ali Memon credited the surge to the dedication of the SRB workforce, political backing from the Sindh government, and cooperation from taxpayers.
He noted that SRB is preparing to meet new challenges in FY26, including the collection of Agricultural Income Tax (AIT) and implementation of a Negative List Tariff regime for sales tax on services, set to begin on July 1, 2025.

• Links counterterrorism to resolving root causes of conflicts
• Dar to chair three key UNSC sessions, including debate on Palestine
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has urged the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in war-ravaged Gaza, where Israeli military operations continue to claim civilian lives and exact a devastating toll on infrastructure.
“The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza defies comprehension,” said Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, during a briefing to the 15-member Council on the Middle East situation.
The Israeli military has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians — mostly women and children — since Oct 7, 2023.
The briefing came as Pakistan assumed presidency of the Security Council for July 2025, marking a significant moment in its multilateral diplomacy.
The briefing was held in line with Security Council’s Resol­ution 2334 (2016), which requires the UN Secretary-General to report on its implementation every three months. The resolution demands that Israel cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.
However, the discussion also covered the risk of famine in Gaza and a new aid mechanism conducted by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a non-UN entity backed by Israel and the United States.
In sharply worded remarks, the Pakistani envoy said the new aid distribution mechanism is not only contrary to international humanitarian law and human dignity, but it also places starving civilians in direct danger, forcing them to cross active combat zones in search of food and water.
“The result is a grotesque cycle of horror: over 500 people have been killed while trying to access humanitarian aid,” Ambassador Ahmad said. “This is a death trap.”
He added, “The failure to enforce the Council’s own decisions carries grave consequences for global peace and security and undermines the Council’s own authority and credibility.”
At the outset, UN Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East Khaled Khiari warned that the level of suffering and brutality in Gaza was unbearable, calling the continued collective punishment of Palestinians unjustifiable.
‘Deep sense of purpose’
Meanwhile, as Pakistan has assumed the UNSC presidency for the current month, the Foreign Office said in a statement that the country “undertakes this responsibility with a deep sense of purpose, humility and conviction. Our approach will continue to remain anchored in the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect for international law, and a steadfast commitment to multilateralism”.
As a country that has consistently advocated for dialogue and diplomacy, Pakistan brings to the Security Council an objective, principled, and balanced perspective shaped by its foreign policy, past experience at the Council, and its long-standing contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security, including through UN peacekeeping and peace-building efforts, it said.
The presidency will convene two high-level signature events during this month: an open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”, to be held on July 22; and a briefing on “Cooperation between the United Nations and Regional and Sub-Regional Organisations: The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)”, scheduled for July 24.
Both meetings will be chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who will also preside over the quarterly open debate on the Question of Palestine on 23 July 2025. Mr Dar will also preside over the quarterly open debate on Palestine.
“Pakistan looks forward to working closely with all Council members to promote timely and united action, in line with the Council’s Charter responsibilities and the expectations of the international community,” the Foreign Office said.
Mr Dar said Pakistan takes on this responsibility with humility, conviction, and a profound commitment to the UN Charter.
“Our presidency comes at a time of escalating conflicts and humanitarian crises across the world. We will strive to steer the Security Council towards responsive and effective action grounded in dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful dispute resolution”, he said on a post on X.
In a separate address on the future of the UN’s counterterrorism architecture, Ambassador Ahmad called for addressing the root causes of terrorism — particularly unresolved conflicts, foreign occupation and systemic injustice.
“The UN’s counterterrorism discourse must not only address the response factors but also the underlying and preventive factors,” he said.

The announcement was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Af­­fairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Tuesday. Senior ministry officials also attended the session.

To launch ferry service connecting Pakistan with GCC countries

“The initiative is part of the government’s strategy to enhance regional connectivity, boost maritime trade and position Gwadar as a major hub in the Arabian Sea,” Mr Chaudhry said. “We aim to transform Gwadar into a strategic transhipment and logistics centre, benefiting Pakistan and the wider region.”
He emphasised that with Gwadar Port now fully ope­rational, it is time to accelerate its integration into international maritime networks. He directed relevant dep­artments to pursue all necessary steps to increase the port’s commercial activity and unlock its full potential.
 
 

He said additional shipping lines will be connected to Gwadar to facilitate greater movement of goods, promote transit trade with Central Asia and the Middle East, and support Pakistan’s growing role in the regional logistics landscape.
“The new routes will reduce pressure on existing ports and ensure faster, more efficient cargo handling,” Mr Chaudhry stated.
In addition to enhancing cargo operations, the maritime ministry has also planned to launch a ferry service from Gwadar to GCC countries. The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.
“The ferry service will strengthen people-to-people ties, boost tourism and provide a new economic lifeline for Balochistan,” the minister said. “It will create local employment, improve supporting infrastructure and attract private sector participation, especially in the areas of ship services, hospitality and transportation.”

• Commission adjourns disqualification case against Omar Ayub
ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday failed to reach a decision over the distribution of reserved seats after the Supreme Court’s verdict, sources told Dawn.
A senior official of ECP said the commission’s meeting remained inconclusive as the law wing was unprepared. He added some applications on this matter filed by PML-N, JUI-F and other individuals were still pending.
The official dispelled reports that the meeting could not reach a decision in the absence of the judgement’s copy.
The ECP received the copy on Saturday, a day after the Constitutional Bench dismissed petitions filed by PTI, declaring the party ineligible for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies.
He said the Commission would meet again on Wednesday (today)and hoped a decision would be taken on the issue.
In a 7-3 majority ruling, the Constitutional Bench, on Friday, overturned the Supreme Court’s July 12, 2024, judgement in the reserved seats case, effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures.
The decision overturned the majority judgement by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.
The bench restored the March 25, 2024, order of the Peshawar High Court which had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council, the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024 polls, of reserved seats.
The Constitutional Bench’s decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.
Therefore, the 77 reserved seats of the national and provincial assemblies will be allocated among the parliamentary parties present in the respective assemblies, since they cannot be kept vacant.
In light of the decision, the distribution of 22 reserved seats of NA would be: 15 for PML-N, four for PPP and three for JUI-F, according to legal experts.
After this process, the ruling coalition will ach­ieve a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag­ic number required to at­­tain a two-thirds majority is 224.
Disqualification case
Separately, the ECP has adjourned the hearing of disqualification reference against PTI leader Omar Ayub till July 15 after a court order to halt the proceedings.
A three-member bench of the ECP, headed by member from Sindh Nisar Ahmed Durrani, heard the reference on Tuesday.
Mr Khan’s lawyers submitted a stay order against the proceedings issued by the Peshawar High Court.
The ECP member from KP, retired Justice Ikram­ul­lah, noted the high court has not specified a new date in the order. The bench directed the commission’s legal team to seek clarification from the PHC. It emphasised the re­­­ference forwarded by the National Assembly spea­­ker against Mr Khan must be decided within 90 days.
Omar Ayub was also asked to submit a response in the assets declaration case filed over alleged discrepancies in his nomination papers and data provided to the RO.
The NA speaker forwar­ded the disqualification case on the plea filed by ex-MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Mr Khan in the 2024 election from Haripur’s NA-18 constituency.

The outage had resulted in a significant shortfall of over 360 million gallons of water during the past four days, exacerbating the city’s existing water crisis.
Though the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) started pumping water from the Dhabeji pumping station after the restoration of electricity, the crisis will persist for at least another day as it takes over 18 hours to fully charge the main pipelines of the distribution network.
According to a KWSC spokesman, the power was restored in the morning and the water supply to the city had resumed as usual. Due to the power outage, the city faced a shortage of 360 million gallons of water, he added.
The power breakdown at the pumping station had occurred on June 26 at 10 pm.

India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence.  The treaty allocates the Indus Basin’s six rivers between the two countries: India gets the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej), while Pakistan receives nearly 80 per cent of the water from the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab).
Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in Hague also ruled India cannot unilaterally suspend or hold the IWT in abeyance.
During a visit to the National Emergencies Operations Centre today, the prime minister referred to the PCA’s order, emphasising that India had no authority to suspend the IWT unilaterally.
“But the enemy has certain evil designs against Pakistan and wants to take steps against the waters treaty. For that, the government has decided that we will build our water storage.”
He said the government would build a “non-controversial water storage capacity” by utilising resources such as the Diamer Bhasha dam and others.
PM Shehbaz said there was a clear clause in the 1991 water accord between the provinces to build on water capacity.
“We will build this capacity with our own resources in the next few years. There is a critical role of the National Disaster Management Authority in this.”
 


The prime minister directed that weather warnings and calamity threats should be regularly issued through phone messages in collaboration with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.
The prime minister recounted the disastrous impacts of the catastrophic floods in 2022. He said that Pakistan was unfortunately among the countries on the world map which could be hit by natural disasters such as cloudbursts, even though it had hardly any contribution to the greenhouse effect.
During the year 2022, Pakistan had suffered more than any country in the world, he noted. More than 1,700 lives were lost, vast stretches of farmland were washed away, homes and infrastructure were damaged, and the national exchequer suffered losses of Rs30 billion, according to government estimates.
The prime minister further said that glacial melting due to heat waves also demanded the highest level of preparedness.
“What happened in Swat in which precious lives were lost, engulfed the entire nation in a pall of gloom,” he said and stressed that the stakeholders in the matter should take an honest review of the incident, directing for a formulation of a comprehensive mechanism in collaboration with the provinces to prevent such occurrences in the future.
The prime minister also ordered a report in this regard.
He opined that in the aftermath of the floods of 2022, the relevant ministers negotiated the grants and public-private partnerships for building resilient infrastructure in the country.
The prime minister appreciated the National Emergencies Operations Centre and expressed hope that the relevant authorities would fully utilise the resilient platform for the progress of the country’s economy and social sectors.
He also assured the government’s complete support in strengthening the institute and its capacity building.
The prime minister hoped that the facility would be connected with the provinces and could convey real-time information with interventions such as an early warning system.
During his visit, he was given a briefing by NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik over the current monsoon season, the flood situation and the precautionary measures taken in this regard.</p><small>2025-07-01 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611940-khawaja-asif-hints-at-ppp-joining-federal-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif hints at PPP joining federal govt</strong></a><br><p>
