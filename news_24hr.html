A highly-placed source confirmed to Dawn that the government has given approval to change the Punjab police high command.
The source said that a summary has been submitted to the prime minister for final approval.
It added that Anwar’s posting as the FIA DG was likely on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, reports suggested that the provincial government has prepared a panel of three candidates for the role of the Punjab police chief.
Lahore Capital City Police Officer Bilal Siddique Kamyana, Punjab Counter Terrorism Department Additional Inspector General Wasim Sial and Special Branch Additional Inspector General Rao Abdul Kareem are among those under consideration.
As per reports, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed is also in the race.
Dr Anwar was appointed Punjab IG during a large reshuffle by the Punjab caretaker government in January 2023. He was performing his duties with the National Highways and Motorway Police before being appointed Punjab’s police chief.
He was posted at the Punjab Counter Terrorism Department while he served as the Faisalabad senior superintendent of police (operations) and the Rawalpindi chief traffic officer.
Dr Anwar also performed duties in the Prime Minister’s Office in Islamabad. He also served as the district police officer in Okara and Sargodha as well as with the Telecommunications and Elite Police.</p><small>2026-02-02 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/021313306c67650.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970596/in-meeting-with-cm-afridi-pm-emphasises-need-for-cooperation-between-centre-kp-govt' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with CM Afridi, PM emphasises need for cooperation between Centre, KP govt</strong></a><br><p>In his first meeting with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday emphasised the need for cooperation between the Centre and the KP government.
The two leaders met at the PM House in Islamabad. During the meeting, which CM Afridi said was held at the premier’s invitation, the two discussed issues related to KP’s finances and counterterrorism.
According to a statement reported by state broadcaster PTV News, the prime minister stressed the need for cooperation between the Centre and the provincial government for the progress and prosperity of KP’s people.
“Close and effective communication between the Centre and the provinces is indispensable for national progress and public service,” the premier was quoted as saying.
PM Shehbaz assured CM Afridi of the Centre’s cooperation as per its jurisdiction for KP’s development projects, infrastructure improvement, education, health and job opportunities.







The prime minister termed the KP government’s cooperation in establishing peace in the province as “unavoidable”.
“There is a need to improve the provincial government’s efforts to establish law and order,” he said, urging the KP government to strengthen provincial departments to counter terrorism.
Affirming that both the Centre and the provincial government would continue their efforts to combat militancy, PM Shehbaz said the KP administration should fulfil its constitutional duties to ensure peace and public welfare.
“The provincial government is empowered. Steps should be taken for the health and education of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s people. The federal government has always been striving for the betterment of the KP’s people,” he was quoted as saying.
Noting that KP was an “important unit” of the federation, PM Shehbaz assured CM Afridi that the Centre would “continue its full efforts in accordance with its jurisdiction” for the public’s prosperity.
Highlighting that the federal government was determined to work with all provinces, the prime minister said, “The targets of national unity, stability and prosperity can be achieved effectively through mutual consultation and collaboration.”
Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam were also present during the meeting.
Pending funds among other issues discussed: KP CM
Speaking to the media after their interaction, CM Afridi termed the meeting a “demand of his role”.
Noting that the premier had invited him, the chief minister said he expressed his condolences over the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan and condemned the terrorist act.
“We have always condemned terrorism wherever it has taken place and we will also condemn it in the future,” he asserted.
Asked about a “clarity” in his condemnation of the Balochistan attacks, the KP CM affirmed he had always had that clarity.
“Terrorism has no province or country or religion, and whoever carries out terrorism, we all should condemn it as a Pakistani,” he said.
“Issues concerning our province — whether it is the NFC (National Finance Commission), the CRBC (Chashma Right Bank Canal), NHP (Net Hydel Profit payments) or our other pending funds due on the Centre — were discussed,” Afridi said.

 

He further said that a “joint course of action” to combat terrorism was also discussed.
The PTI leader said no discussions were held regarding him being denied meetings with party founder Imran Khan, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail.
“There were no talks on anything political,” he said.
The chief minister asserted that the KP government had provided Rs26bn from its fund in the merged districts under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP).
Afridi said PM Shehbaz issued directives to Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal to meet Adviser to the KP CM on Finance Muzzammil Aslam later on Monday and make “every possible effort to solve these issues”.
“After this, two to three more meetings will be held,” the PTI leader said, adding that “one to two” meetings would be convened on counter-terrorism as well. “When decisions will be taken, they will be made public to you.”



“Perhaps as a political worker, I would never have sat there. But I deemed it appropriate for my people and my province, where the conditions are getting serious — whether financially or due to decisions made in closed rooms,” he said, adding that the meeting was necessary.
Asked whether the issue of displacement in Tirah or the Rs4bn corruption allegations made against his government were discussed, the KP CM alleged that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had issued a “charge-sheet” against the federal government for corruption to the tune of Rs5,300 billion, referring to its report issued in November.
“Rs4bn is a small amount. They are nothing compared to the sacrifices that my people in Tirah, Kurram and Bajaur are giving,” the chief minister said, adding that objecting to that amount was akin to “dismissing those sacrifices”.
In a post on X shortly after 12pm, PTI’s North Punjab chapter confirmed that CM Afridi had reached the PM House.







Excellent coordination needed between Centre, KP: Muqam
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Muqam welcomed the meeting. “Better late than never,” he quipped.
Noting that the KP CM was also invited previously but he did not come, the minister underscored the need for “excellent coordination” between the Centre and the province.
According to Muqam, it was agreed during the meeting that such communication should be maintained. He further said the point that “speaking against institutions was not right” was also brought up.
Pointing out that the people of KP were badly affected by terrorism, he called for politics to be kept aside and a “collective stance” adopted against militancy.
On CM Afridi’s complaints regarding pending funds, the minister said the federal government had paid all such amounts but if there were differences, they should be sorted out through talks.
Muqam further said it was agreed that there should be consensus between the Centre and KP. The minister also said no political matter, including Imran, was discussed.



Sanaullah divulges details of meeting
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said that the meeting between the premier and CM Afridi was held in a “good manner”.
“PM Shehbaz gave Sohail Afridi a very warm welcome,” he said, saying: “Both sides reviewed and exchanged views on law and order, terrorism, and the counter-terrorism department (CTD) in KP.”
According to Sanaullah, PM Shehbaz said that civil law enforcement agencies must play an equal part with the armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
“CM Afridi assured that the provincial government will play its role in the fight against terrorism, and shared his plans for expanding CTD and funds approved for it,” he added.
Sanaullah said that PM Shehbaz responded to some of CM Afridi’s questions regarding the funds for his province and then directed Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal to sit with chief minister’s team and resolve the matter.
“PM Shehbaz said the amount agreed between both teams will be immediately transferred,” Sanaullah said.
According to Sanaullah, PM Shehbaz had made it clear at the beginning of the meeting that they were sitting for Pakistan and their constitutional roles, setting political affairs aside.
“CM Afridi didn’t request a meeting with Imran Khan, nor did he ask for anything else, which was a good gesture,” he said.
KP CM’s attitude must change: Tallal Chaudhry
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that the meeting between the prime minister and CM Afridi should have happened before.
He emphasised that without coordination between the Centre and a province, the people of that province suffer.
“Better late than never,” Chaudhry remarked, adding: “It was good that they (PM Shehbaz and CM Afridi) met.”
Asked whether the KP CM’s attitude towards the Centre should change, the minister replied in the affirmative.
“It should, otherwise the people of his province would grab his collar. In 13 years of your government in the province, what have you given them? Slogans, songs? Nothing else,“ he remarked.
Responding to another query, the state minister said the National Assembly speaker’s office was open for talks, and a special committee formed for that purpose was also present.
He noted that the opposition had previously abandoned the talks one-sidedly.
When asked about the possibility of allowing Imran — who recently underwent a procedure for an eye ailment — to travel abroad for medical treatment, Chaudhry denied the need for it, saying the PTI founder was “absolutely fine”.
‘Outstanding dues’
Since becoming the chief minister in October last year, CM Afridi has repeatedly accused the federal government of stalling the release of funds allocated for KP.
The meeting comes a week after the KP CM wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz over what he dubbed the Centre’s “persistent failure” to release “constitutionally guaranteed” funds allocated for KP, particularly those committed for the merged districts under the NFC.
Contending that the lack of funds had “now translated into an acute fiscal and governance crisis for the province”, Afridi had demanded the “full and unconditional” release of all outstanding federal dues.
The KP CM maintained that his province was entitled to receive Rs658.4 billion under the NFC, but it had received just Rs604bn so far, leading to a shortfall of Rs54.4bn.
Addressing a jirga in Khyber on Sunday, the chief minister had said he was set to meet the premier in Islamabad on Monday to “plead the case of KP’s rights and secure our outstanding dues”.
PTI views meeting positively
Further, PTI’s joint parliamentary committee expressed the hope that the meeting between PM Shehbaz and CM Afridi would resolve issues faced by KP.
The committee held a meeting on Monday, attended by KP CM Afridi, PTI leader Amir Dogar, PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, and party leaders Asad Qaiser and Junaid Akbar, among others.
The meeting discussed the country’s overall political, security, and provincial situation and urged the federal government to immediately release all outstanding dues to KP, particularly under the NFC award, to enable practical solutions to the problems faced by the people of the province.
It also emphasised that the federation must fulfil its constitutional responsibilities in that regard.
The participants also condemned the recent terrorist attacks in Balochistan and extended their heartfelt condolences and solidarity to the families of the martyrs.
The committee expressed concerns over reports about the health of PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan, which caused widespread anxiety among people across the country.
It was demanded that Imran be given immediate and unhindered access to his personal physicians and that meetings with him be restored without delay.
Additionally, the meeting endorsed the decisions of the KP jirga and called upon all relevant institutions to play an active role in establishing sustainable peace in the tribal districts and ensuring the effective resolution of public issues.
Moreover, to ensure the effectiveness of the shutter-down and wheel-jam strike scheduled for February 8, the meeting decided to further intensify the street movement.
The committee reiterated that the public mandate was stolen during the general election on February 8, 2024, and that people across the country will close their businesses and record their protest.
They also condemned the arrests of party workers and raids on their homes in Sindh and Punjab, stating that such tactics were a blatant violation of democracy, the Constitution and fundamental human rights, deeming them unacceptable.

In a post on social media platform Truth Social, the US president said that he and the Indian premier spoke about “many things”, including trade and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.
Trump added that “out of friendship and respect” for Modi, the US would lower its reciprocal tariff rate from 25 per cent to 18pc, while India would reduce tariffs on US goods to zero.
“He (Modi) agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela,” Trump wrote, adding that this would “end the war” between Russia and Ukraine.







The US president, calling Modi “one of my greatest friends, and a powerful and respected leader of his country”, said that he agreed to “buy American” at a much higher level.
Trump added that India would buy, “over $500 billion of US energy, technology, agricultural, coal, and many other products”.
Later, Modi took to X to hail the discussion and express his happiness with the reduced tariffs.
“Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement,” he wrote.
“When two large economies and the world’s largest democracies work together, it benefits our people and unlocks immense opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation,” Modi said.
The Indian prime minister called Trump’s leadership is “vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity”, adding that New Delhi fully supports his efforts.
“I look forward to working closely with him to take our partnership to unprecedented heights,” Modi said.







The United States is effectively overseeing Venezuelan oil exports since toppling the South American country’s leader Nicolas Maduro in a military operation in January.
Trump hit India, the world’s most populous nation, with 25pc reciprocal levies during his waves of “Liberation Day” tariffs last year. He then stacked another 25pc on top of that over India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Modi was one of the first leaders to visit the White House after Trump’s inauguration for his second term in January 2025, but that has not stopped difficult trade negotiations over the past year.
Trump also said in October that Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil, but an agreement did not materialise at the time.</p><small>2026-02-02 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/022246219bb9e48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970620/nuclear-talks-between-us-and-iran-slated-for-friday-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Nuclear talks between US and Iran slated for Friday: officials</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkiye, Iranian and US officials told Reuters on Monday, while a regional diplomat said representatives from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt would participate.
US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will meet in Istanbul in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war.
Turkiye and other regional allies have sought de-escalation.
“Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Egypt, as well as some other countries, will attend the Istanbul meeting. There will be bilateral, trilateral and other meetings,” the diplomat said.
Earlier today, the Iranian news agency Fars reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian ordered the start of nuclear talks with Washington.
“President Pezeshkian has ordered the initiation of nuclear negotiations with the United States,” the agency reported, citing an unnamed government source.
“The source said Iran and the US will hold talks strictly within the framework of the nuclear issue,” Fars added.
The report was also carried by the government newspaper Iran and the reformist daily Shargh.
Iran said it was working on a method and framework for negotiations that would be ready in the coming days, with messages between the two sides relayed through regional players.
“Several points have been addressed and we are examining and finalising the details of each stage in the diplomatic process, which we hope to conclude in the coming days,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said, without giving details on the content of any negotiations.
US Naval buildup near Iran
Tensions are running high amid a US naval buildup near Iran, following a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month, the deadliest domestic unrest in Iran since its 1979 revolution.
US President Donald Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded that Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast.
He said last week Iran was “seriously talking”, while Tehran’s top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were underway.
Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.
Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.
Preparations for potential US-Iran talks
Baqaei said Tehran was considering “the various dimensions and aspects of the talks”, adding that “time is of the essence for Iran as it wants the lifting of unjust sanctions sooner”.
A Turkish ruling party official told Reuters that Tehran and Washington had agreed to re-focus on diplomacy and possible talks this week, in a potential reprieve for potential US strikes.
Witkoff was expected to visit Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel’s military chief, two senior Israeli officials said separately on Monday.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was in Turkiye last week and held further calls with his Egyptian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts, he said on Telegram.
“President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal,” Araghchi told CNN on Sunday. “Of course, in return, we expect sanctions lifting. So, that deal is possible. Let’s not talk about impossible things.”
Baqaei said the rallying of neighbouring states around a diplomatic solution demonstrated a fear that any US attack would drag the region into conflict, echoing Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who warned on Sunday that a US attack would trigger a “regional war”.
‘Ball in Trump’s court’
The Iranian official said, “Diplomacy is ongoing. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kilogrammes of highly enriched uranium, accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution”.
However, he added, for the start of talks, Tehran wanted US military assets moved away from Iran.
“Now the ball is in Trump’s court,” he said.
Satellite imagery shows repair work at Iranian sites
Tehran’s regional sway has been weakened by Israel’s attacks on Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq, as well as by the ousting of Iran’s close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
In June last year, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.
Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings.
No other rebuilding was visible, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.
Washington-based think tank Institute for Science and International Security said satellite images from late January showed construction work on tunnel entrances at Isfahan that could “indicate a preparation for additional military strikes”, as was seen ahead of last year’s US raid.
It could also signal the movement of assets from other facilities, it added.
Nuclear talks standoff
After five rounds of talks that have stalled since May 2023, several hard-to-bridge issues remained between Tehran and Washington, including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.
The UN nuclear watchdog has called on Iran repeatedly to say what happened to the highly enriched uranium stock since the June attacks.
Western countries fear Iran’s uranium enrichment could yield material for a warhead. Iran says its nuclear programme is only for electricity generation and other civilian uses.
The Iranian sources said Tehran could ship its highly enriched uranium abroad and pause enrichment in a deal that should also include the lifting of economic sanctions.
Ambassadors summoned
The supreme leader also likened the recent protests to a “coup” attempt.
Authorities have said the protests, which were sparked by economic strain and exploded in size and intensity over several days in early January, were “riots” inflamed by its arch foes, the United States and Israel.
Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday, the presidency published the names of 2,986 people out of the 3,117 whom authorities said were killed in the unrest.
Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”.</p><small>2026-02-02 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/022225254e9bb08.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970639/son-of-gangster-rehman-dakait-arrested-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Son of gangster Rehman Dakait arrested in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The son of slain Lyari gangster Abdul Rehman alias Rehman Dakait was arrested in Karachi, police said on Monday.
“Kalakot police have apprehended Jibran s/o Abdul Rehman alias Rehman Dakait and recovered one illegal pistol from his custody,” a statement by police said.
The statement added that the suspect held was a “habitual criminal” who had been arrested and sent to prison in several cases in the past.
There were two First Information Reports (FIRs) against him registered at Lyari’s Kalakot police station between the years 2023 and 2024.
Rehman Dakait was killed in 2009 by Karachi police, along with three of his accomplices.
He was reportedly involved in more than 80 criminal cases and was a central figure in the gang wars of Lyari — one of the most populous and oldest localities of Karachi.
In 2024, another one of his sons was shot dead in an alleged encounter in Karachi.
According to the police, he was organising a gang of criminals in Lyari. Police also said he was previously involved in drug trafficking and kidnapping for ransom cases.</p><small>2026-02-02 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/022158074131096.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970637/4-punjab-districts-allowed-to-manufacture-kite-flying-material-to-meet-basant-demand' target='_blank'><strong>4 Punjab districts allowed to manufacture kite-flying material to meet Basant demand</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday gave approval for the manufacture of permissible kite-flying material in four more districts of the province owing to the increasing demand and soaring prices of these commodities ahead of the much-anticipated Basant festival in Lahore.
Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, albeit under tight curbs, following the Punjab government’s move to lift the ban on the festival after a hiatus of 18 years. Celebrations, however, will remain restricted to the provincial capital, which until now was the only district where the manufacture of permissible kite-flying material was allowed.
According to a February 1 letter by the Punjab Home Department to deputy commissioners (DC) concerned, the provincial cabinet has given approval for manufacturing the kite-flying material in Faisalabad, Kasur, Multan and Sheikhupura as well.
The letter, seen by Dawn, said that the manufacturers should register themselves with the relevant DCs and through the Punjab government’s e-Biz digital portal and manufacture only “permissible kite-flying material”.
According to the Punjab government’s instructions, only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying on Basant whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited.
Under the code of conduct, the sizes for a 1.5 Tawa Gudda (width 40 inches, length 34 inches) and a 4.5 Guddi Kite (width 35 inches, length 30 inches) have been fixed, and the manufacturing or flying of kites larger than these will not be permitted at all.
The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party.
The Home Department’s letter also said that registered manufacturers in Faisalabad, Kasur, Multan and Sheikhupura should only sell their products to sellers and traders registered with the Lahore DC “for use in the district of Lahore on Feb 6, 7 and 8, 2026 […] and not in any other district”.
“Sale of permissible kite-flying material by registered manufacturers of these four districts to any person or entity, other than the registered traders and sellers in Lahore, shall be strictly prohibited,” the letter read.
Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told Dawn that the provincial cabinet gave the approval in light of soaring prices and to bridge the demand-supply gap.
In addition to manufacturing, traders and sellers in Lahore had also been allowed to procure “permissible” kite flying material from other provinces, he further said, adding that material was already being procured from Peshawar, Haripur and Abbottabad.
The traders and sellers, however, are required to get permission from the Lahore DC to procure these items from other provinces.
In a post on X, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said every pinna (twine ball) would be QR-coded, “allowing it to be tracked from the manufacturer to the seller, and ultimately to the buyer”.
“All manufacturers are registered with the government and are fully compliant with approved safety regulations and specifications. In view of the increased demand for kites and strings, supplies from outside Punjab have been permitted strictly for products that meet the prescribed safety standards,” she said.







Ban around Lahore Airport
Qazi also told Dawn that the provincial cabinet had approved the exclusion of several areas, identified by the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA), from kite-flying during Basant.
He added that the Lahore DC would notify Section 144 for those areas under Section 6(1) of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Act 2025.
The PAA had written a letter to the Punjab additional chief secretary last month, requesting that a complete ban on kite-flying be imposed in certain areas during Basant for the safety of flight operations.
The PAA had requested that the Nadrabad, Gulshan Ali Colony, Nishat, Bhatta Chowk and DHA’s R, S, P and Q blocks be declared no kite-flying zones, as they fall in the aircraft approach path at the Allama Iqbal International Airport.
Similarly, the PAA had sought a ban on kite-flying in Al-Faisal Town, Joray Pul, Canal Bank Road and Tajpura, located along the aircraft take-off path.
The PAA further requested, “Impose Section 144 in the identified areas to ban kite flying on the rooftops of houses, as kites and kite-strings can be ingested into aircraft engines or strike critical aircraft surfaces, leading to potentially catastrophic consequences”.</p><small>2026-02-02 17:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/021853465756333.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970628/nobody-in-pakistan-will-be-allowed-to-rationalise-violence-says-asif-after-attacks-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Nobody in Pakistan will be allowed to rationalise violence,’ says Asif after attacks in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the state’s bottom line was that “nobody in Pakistan will be allowed to rationalise violence”.
“When you try to rationalise violence or dress it up as a freedom movement — it is not acceptable because it is not true. This is a cover to legitimise criminal activities,” he said while addressing the National Assembly.
Asif made these remarks while briefing the House on the security situation in Balochistan, where terrorists carried out a large-scale coordinated attack on Saturday. According to the military’s media affairs wing, more than 150 terrorists have been killed in retaliatory action.
After Speaker Ayaz Sadiq asked him for a briefing, he began his address by recalling that the restoration of peace in Balochistan had been “disrupted” several times over the decades. However, he maintained that there had been long spells of peace in the province as well, and development work was also carried out in Balochistan.
The defence minister said during the initial decades following Pakistan’s independence, the “overtones of this disturbance had a so-called political colour to them”.
Moreover, he said some grievances also existed.
“Without going into details of whether they were right or wrong, but some grievances also had [undertones] of a nationalistic fervour,” he said.
The minister said elements supported by India were operating as “proxies” in Balochistan, adding that Afghan soil was also used in fanning the flames of terrorism in the province.
“The terrorists’ leadership is based in Afghanistan, and they receive support from there,” he said.
Asif alleged that the “political element in this movement was hijacked by smuggling in the recent, or slightly distant past”.
“Billions and trillions of rupees were being lost to smuggling, mainly oil smuggling. This criminal mafia […] began supporting the movement. And their leadership now comprises these elements,” he said.
The minister added that commodities destined for Afghanistan or elsewhere through transit trade would return to Pakistan and were sold in markets here.
“Our government took strict action to curb this. You may recall that a protest on the Chaman border went on for long. Likewise, in other areas of Balochistan where this facility was available and being exploited, protests erupted.
“The members of this movement would call it a nationalistic movement, but it turned into a movement of criminals and smugglers. They began funding it,” he said.
The defence minister said an opinion existed that talks should be held with terrorists or members of a national movement. He said negotiations with political entities had been held in other countries as well, even with the ones that became violent.
“But this movement, or these people among whom 170 criminals were killed, has no political or nationalistic identity. And their fake covers of being nationalistic or political entities, or a movement for human rights, do not exist anymore and a movement of criminals has emerged,” he said.
He said this movement was being run to make up for financial losses.
“For example, this network of corruption was selling Iranian oil worth Rs60 per litre for Rs200 per litre in Karachi. Those who are running this movement are earning Rs4 billion in profit daily through oil smuggling, which has been curbed. This is why peace has been disrupted there (Balochistan).
“It has turned into a nexus. It has turned into a nexus of the bureaucracy, tribal leadership and criminal elements.”
The defence minister pointed out that Balochistan was the largest province of Pakistan in terms of area, where a single person was residing every 35 kilometres.
“Controlling this is way more difficult than a populated city or area, and there is a need for the deployment of our forces on a massive scale. Our forces are deployed there and taking action against them, but there is a physical handicap when it comes to guarding and patrolling such a large area,” he added.
Asif alleged that the political leadership had exploited development funds in Balochistan along with the bureaucracy.
He said 177 terrorists had been killed, 17 personnel — including 10 of police, six of Frontier Corps and one Levies — had been martyred and 33 civilians had lost their lives, mainly in Gwadar, in a span of two days.
He insisted that Balochistan had seen development over the years since Pakistan’s independence. He claimed that a narrative was concocted about a sense of deprivation in Balochistan, sharing details about the province’s share under the National Finance Commission, per capita budget and its share under the Public Sector Development Programme. But, a narrative of deprivation was spun regarding Balochistan, he said, adding that smuggling in the province was not possible without the patronage of politicians and bureaucracy.
The minister said the system of feudalism and fiefdom had ended elsewhere but persisted in Balochistan. “The province’s resources have been looted under this system. And this reaction is coming from those same people, it is the same nexus that tried to hamper Balochistan’s progress,” he said.
The minister claimed that no other province had more airports than Balochistan, adding that “we are making those among them operational that are not”.
He dismissed the “narrative of missing persons”, alleging that the names of terrorists who were being killed were in missing person lists.
“This narrative has been concocted […] I also used to support this cause and protest over it on the Constitutional Avenue. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.
Turning his attention back to Balochistan’s area, he said managing such a big province was a gigantic task.
Asif said militant elements in Balochistan had a rifle worth Rs2 million. “We don’t have that rifle,” he said, adding that they also had thermal weapon sights worth $4,000-$5,000. The total gear that have was worth close to $20,000, he said, questioning, “Who is providing funds for it?”
The minister recalled that passengers had been boarded off buses and killed after their identity cards were checked. “From where has this discrimination been planted?” he questioned.
Asif added that the military wing of criminals involved in smuggling was the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which provided criminal elements protection.
The BLA, he continued, had been activated to guard a criminal ideology.
“They are involved in mischief in the world (fasad-ul-ard) […] and talks cannot be held with them.”
The minister added, “It is the bottom line of the state of Pakistan that nobody will be able to rationalise violence. When you try to rationalise violence or dress it up as a freedom movement — it is not acceptable because it is not true. This is a cover to legitimise criminal activities.”
Asif warned that an entire generation was being poisoned, but at the same time, he highlighted that there was no place in Balochistan where terrorist elements had established their writ.
“I want to assure on behalf of the government that no negotiations will be held with these people. The way they are employing brutal force, so much so that they don’t even spare civilians, women and children, the response to them will be made with the full force of the state,” the minister assured.
He said a message of solidarity with security and law enforcement personnel should be sent by the House, keeping all differences aside.
“It should not be the case that a political element does not even offer funeral prayers for their political interests. This attitude is anti-national and anti state,” he said.
Asif appealed that the entire nation should be united on not allowing any criminal gang spin a narrative to disguise their criminal activities and sanctify those acts.
The defence minister stressed the need for the House to unite on the issue of terrorism, adding that not just the armed forces, but the people would also have to play their role on this front.
“Passing resolutions and making speeches is not enough. We must demonstrate solidarity with the boys,” he emphasised. The minister added,
“This is a wake-up call. One hundred and seventy-seven terrorists have been killed,” he said, adding: “Let this House play some role in this crisis. Otherwise, we, who are not much relevant anyway, will become even more irrelevant.”
Meanwhile, the NA opposition leader, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, called Balochistan a “blind spot” for Pakistan and noted that the only way to bring the country together was to strengthen the House.
“I believe Balochistan is a blind spot for all of Pakistan,” Achakzai said. “No one, regardless of education or if they’re from the Foreign Office, knows what Balochistan is.”
He further said, “The only way to bring Pakistan together is by strengthening the House.”</p><small>2026-02-02 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02210530dae9437.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970635/fire-at-mobile-market-in-karachis-saddar-brought-under-control' target='_blank'><strong>Fire at mobile market in Karachi’s Saddar brought under control</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A large fire that erupted on Monday evening at Saddar’s mobile market was brought under control, according to police and rescue officials.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the fire broke out on the 7th floor parking of the Al Najeeb mobile market at around 07:45pm.
He said the fire had erupted in a parking area located on the 7th floor of a high-rise building. He said that three cars were damaged in the blaze. He said the fire had been controlled while cooling work was ongoing.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that two persons were adversely affected due to suffocation, who were rescued and provided first medical aid on the spot.
He said the fire had erupted due to a short circuit failure in an electronic vehicle parked at the scene, which spread and engulfed two other vehicles.
He said four fire tenders and one snorkel managed to control the blaze, however, cooling work was ongoing.

 


Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said the situation was “under control so far” and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) fire tenders and snorkels were present on the ground to tackle the situation.
“People are being evacuated as we speak. Will keep everyone posted,” he said.







He also urged the crowd to “stay back” so that rescue work could be carried out. He also shared a video of a large crowd surrounding a fire truck.







A statement by his office said he had taken immediate notice of the fire and directed the fire brigade to reach the site immediately.
“Ensure the safety of people’s lives and assets at any cost and speed up the rescue operation,” he directed. He also instructed officials to be on standby.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, meanwhile, contacted the Karachi mayor, commissioner and the inspector general, according to a statement issued by his office.
“Our first priority is to safely rescue the people stuck inside the building,” he directed. He also directed the police to manage the crowd at the scene so that the rescue operation would run smoothly.
He also directed that water be supplied to the fire brigade through the bowsers in a timely manner.
The incident comes a little over two weeks after a huge fire erupted at Karachi’s Gul Plaza, which claimed the lives of 73 people on January 17.</p><small>2026-02-02 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02213948303230f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970627/govt-rules-out-talks-with-terrorists-as-senate-condemns-spate-of-attacks-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt rules out talks with terrorists as Senate condemns spate of attacks in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday ruled out talks with terrorists as the upper house of Parliament unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the spate of terrorist attacks in Balochistan, while also urging the government to ensure a transparent investigation into the incidents.
Speaking in the Senate, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah ruled out talks with terrorists.
He urged all political forces to adopt a unified national stance against terrorism, fully support law enforcement agencies and the armed forces, and honour the sacrifices of martyrs and their families.
Responding to the points raised by opposition leader Raja Nasir Abbas, he said: “No one is angry in Balochistan; there is no issue of rights. They are taking action against Pakistan on the instructions of the enemy.”
He said that terrorists should be called terrorists without any ifs or buts and that action should be taken against them without any ambiguity. He pointed out that the enemy was humiliated during Marka-i-Haq and these terrorists would also face a similar fate.
He went on to say that criminal and terrorist activities could be carried out anywhere by small armed groups, even in relatively secure areas, but the pattern of violence witnessed in Balochistan reflected organised terrorism rather than isolated criminal acts.
Sanaullah said terrorists in Balochistan had repeatedly stopped passenger buses, checked travellers’ identity cards and executed innocent citizens in front of their families, including women and children.
He said such brutality had also been witnessed in attacks on trains, including the Jaffar Express.
“These are acts of extreme savagery that no sane human being can justify,” he said, questioning the narrative that such groups were merely “disgruntled”.
He said the terrorists were acting as the operatives of a hostile country, seeking to avenge the defeat suffered by enemy forces during Marka-i-Haq.
He said security forces had thwarted attempts to breach the Quetta Red Zone and neutralised the terrorists wherever they attempted to operate. “They could not withstand direct engagement with the forces and were forced to flee back to their hideouts,” he added.
He rejected any linkage between terrorism and political demands such as elections, saying the terrorists had no public mandate, no political agenda and no belief in the democratic system.
Meanwhile, in his speech, the Senate opposition leader called for moving toward the rule of law to steer the country out of crisis. He also called for initiating dialogue and taking everyone on board.
“We should have talked to the angry people; Those who talk about the Constitution, talk about Pakistan, hold sit-ins — their words are not heard. And, when their women come to Islamabad, they are treated badly,” he noted.
He said most of the sitting lawmakers were not true representatives of the people and therefore cannot represent them.
Referring to the attacks in Balochistan, he said, “They (terrorists) freely moved around for three or four hours, and security was breached. Banks were blown up … no one stopped them.”
He questioned whether anyone had resigned in the wake of the incidents. He said Rs 80 billion were spent annually on security in the province but regretted there was no government writ at night. He said that those responsible should be held accountable.
Meanwhile, PTI’s parliamentary leader Ali Zafar rejected attempts to create the impression that the party was siding with terrorists, declaring that the enemies of Pakistan were also the enemies of the party.
He said those who kill, set the national flag on fire and damage state property were enemies of the country and should be treated as terrorists. He, however, said the PTI supported all peaceful movements for rights.
He noted that people’s support was essential to effectively tackle the menace of terrorism, for which incarcerated party founder Imran Khan must be taken on board. He regretted that the government was labelling the PTI as a terrorist organisation and was not ready to give political space to it.
“You will meet the fate of failure if you do not include the PTI in your national plan. You need us because we have the true public mandate”, he remarked.
Senate passes resolution
Meanwhile, the Senate passed a resolution condemning the attacks in Balochistan. Moved by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the resolution urged the government to ensure a transparent, swift and conclusive investigation into the incidents, and bring the perpetrators, facilitators, and local and international sponsors of terrorism to justice in accordance with the law.
It also called upon the federal and provincial governments to further strengthen intelligence coordination, border security, and counter-terrorism mechanisms, with a special focus on Balochistan.
The resolution condemned the attacks and offered condolences to the families of the martyrs. It also lauded the courage and sacrifices of the security forces and law enforcement agencies, and reiterated the nation’s resolve to foil terrorist attempts.
“The unity of the state and the will of the people will prevail over all forces of violence, extremism, and terrorism,” the resolution said.
It also reaffirmed the Senate’s commitment to peace, development and political inclusion in Balochistan, recognising that “sustainable security is inseparable from socio-economic progress, good governance, and respect for constitutional rights”.
As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that at the “behest of their foreign masters, these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the lives of the local populace and the development of Balochistan”. It said that said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the spate of attacks.
Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.”
He said that authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.</p><small>2026-02-02 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648653-pakistani-workers-set-to-regain-jobs-in-kuwait-labour-ties-strengthened' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani workers set to regain jobs in Kuwait; labour ties strengthened</strong></a><br><p>

The reading comes a week after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) held its policy rate at 10.50pc, saying inflation could exceed its 5pc to 7pc medium-term target range for a few months this year, even as growth gains momentum and imports push the trade deficit wider.
The reading from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PSB) compared with 5.6pc in December, when prices fell on a monthly basis due to lower perishable food costs.
On a month-on-month basis, inflation increased by 0.4pc in January.
The SBP said it viewed the real policy rate as sufficiently positive to stabilise inflation over the medium term, even as it flagged stronger domestic demand and external pressures as upside risks to prices.
The finance ministry had projected inflation would remain within a 5pc to 6pc range in January.
An International Monetary Fund staff report has cautioned against premature monetary easing under the $7 billion loan programme, urging policymakers to remain data-dependent to anchor inflation expectations and rebuild external buffers.</p><small>2026-02-02 15:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02172528608424c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970625/pakistan-team-lands-in-sri-lanka-for-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan team lands in Sri Lanka for T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan cricket team on Monday arrived in Sri Lanka for the T20 World Cup, which is set to begin on February 7.
In a post on X, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said that a 15-player squad had arrived in the country.







“The 15-player national squad includes Captain Salman Ali Agha, Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Mohammad Naeef, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usman Khan, and Usman Tariq,” the PCB said in an earlier post, the informed of the squad’s department for the global event’s venue.







In the latest update about the aquad’s arrival in Colombo, the board said the team would rest on Monday and Tuesday.
“The team will play a warm-up match against Ireland on Feb 4,” PCB added.
The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to begin on Feb 7.
On Sunday, the government gave the go-ahead for Pakistan’s participation in the tournament, but barred it from playing against arch-rival India on February 15.
The announcement came amid uncertainty regarding a possible boycott of the tournament over Bangladesh’s withdrawal following tensions with India.
A government source told Dawn that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.</p><small>2026-02-02 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648648-fire-breaks-out-at-karachis-mobile-market' target='_blank'><strong>No casualties as fire brought under control at Karachi's mobile market</strong></a><br><p>

“We have grounded said aircraft and are involving the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) to get the pilot’s concerns checked on a priority basis,” the airline said, adding that the matter has been communicated to India’s aviation regulator.
Boeing and India’s civil aviation ministry, which houses the aviation regulator, did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.
The Tata Group and Singapore Airlines-owned carrier has faced intense scrutiny since a Dreamliner crash in June last year killed 260 people.
Air India said on Monday it had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the regulator last year, and had found no issues.
A cockpit recording of dialogue between the two pilots of the June 12 Air India flight suggested that the captain cut the flow of fuel to the plane’s engines, a source briefed on US officials’ early assessment of evidence told Reuters last year.</p><small>2026-02-02 15:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648644-cdf-munir-libyan-military-chief-discuss-security-professional-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Munir, Libyan military chief discuss security, professional cooperation</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Libyan Arab Armed Forces Commander-in-chief Field Marshal Khalifa Abu-al-Qasim Haftar and Deputy Commander-in-chief Lieutenant General Saddam Khalifa Haftar called on CDF Munir at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi.
“During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on security dynamics in respective regions and professional cooperation,” the statement said.







“The discussion underscored the importance of continued engagement and collaboration between the armed forces of Pakistan and Libya,” it said.
CDF Munir welcomed the distinguished guests and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening bilateral relations with Libya, it said.
“He emphasised Pakistan’s support for peace, stability, and institutional development in Libya,” it added.
“The meeting was held in a cordial and constructive atmosphere, reflecting the longstanding friendly relations between Pakistan and Libya,” the statement said.
Earlier, upon his arrival at Noor Khan Airbase, Field Marshal Haftar was received by CDF Munir, it added.
“The dignitary also paid homage to shuhada and laid wreath at martyrs memorial at GHQ,” it added.
In December, Pakistan had signed a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell conventional military equipment to the Libyan army.

New files related to Epstein published by the US Justice Department on Friday included extensive email correspondence between Mette-Marit and Epstein after he was found guilty of child sex crimes in 2008.
On Saturday, Mette-Marit, the spouse of the heir to the throne Haakon, apologised for maintaining contacts, saying she showed poor judgement. On Monday, Stoere agreed with her.
“I am really using her own words. She says she has showed bad judgement. I agree and I think it is worth saying that when I am asked my opinion about this,” Stoere told reporters.
Asked whether he had been in contact with the royal palace about the matter, Stoere said he had not.



The prime minister added that Mette-Marit, and other prominent Norwegians who were named in the latest Epstein documents published, should provide more details about their involvement with Epstein.
“We have seen that the information that has emerged has shed more light on the matter than what has been said before,” Stoere said.
“It may perhaps be reasonable to say that they should explain the extent of the contacts that have taken place.”
‘I deeply regret this’
The publication of the new Epstein documents comes at a time of multiple challenges for the royal family, with Mette-Marit’s son, Marius, from a relationship prior to her marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, facing trial on rape and domestic violence charges.
The case starts on Tuesday.
“I must take responsibility for not having investigated Epstein’s background more thoroughly, and for not realising sooner what kind of person he was,” Mette-Marit said in a statement to Reuters via the royal palace.
“I deeply regret this, and it is a responsibility I must bear. I showed poor judgement and regret having had any contact with Epstein at all. It is simply embarrassing.”

 

The generally low-key monarchy is popular among Norway’s 5.6 million inhabitants.
Some 70 per cent of Norwegians support the monarchy as an institution, according to a Norstat poll for public broadcaster NRK published on Friday and conducted among 1,030 people in January.
The poll was published before the publication of the latest Epstein documents.
Facing multiple problems
The Nordic country is a constitutional monarchy in which the king is the formal head of state, while political power rests with parliament and the government.
Its royal family has faced several problems in recent years.
King Harald, 88, Europe’s oldest living monarch, cut back activity in 2024 after being hospitalised to treat an infection and later receiving a pacemaker.
Mette-Marit herself is in need of a lung transplant after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018, a chronic disease that causes scarring in the lungs and leads to a reduced oxygen uptake.
Meanwhile, King Harald’s daughter, Martha Louise, stepped down from official royal duties in 2022 to allow her to more freely pursue her own business ventures, and said both she and her husband, an American self-styled shaman, would refrain from using her title as princess in a commercial setting.
They both received criticism last year for starring in a Netflix documentary chronicling their daily lives, including their wedding, and for being critical of the king and queen.</p><small>2026-02-02 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02115301170251b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970595/pti-moves-shc-against-alleged-detention-of-workers-in-sindh-under-mpo-seeks-immediate-release' target='_blank'><strong>PTI moves SHC against alleged detention of workers in Sindh under MPO, seeks immediate release</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: PTI on Monday challenged in the Sindh High Court (SHC) the alleged detention of over 180 party workers during raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh under the controversial Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance.
On Sunday, the PTI alleged that the Sindh police carried out pre-dawn raids on the houses of its workers and leaders and picked up around 180 of them. The provincial government has denied the allegations of detention.
A two-member constitutional bench comprising Justice Muhammad Saleem Jessar and Justice Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro took up the plea for hearing on Monday. Advocate Ali Tahir appeared as the petitioners’ counsel.
However, Justice Bhanbro recused from hearing the case.
Subsequently, the bench ordered the registrar’s office to fix the hearing for Tuesday as the “counsel pleads urgency”, according to a short order available with Dawn.
The case will now be fixed before another two-member bench of the SHC.
The petitioners — PTI Sindh General Secretary Mansoor Ali and Insaf Lawyers Forum President Faisal Mughal — contended that the order issued under the MPO, dated February 1, be declared impugned and sought the immediate release of the party workers.
The petition — a copy of which is available with Dawn — named 14 respondents, including the provincial chief secretary; the additional chief secretary; the inspector general (IG); the Karachi additional IG; the deputy IGs of Karachi’s East, West and South zones; and the SSPs of Karachi’s East, West, South, Central, Malir, Korangi, and Keamari districts.
The petitioners requested the court to declare the MPO orders “unconstitutional, illegal, without lawful authority, void ab initio, coram non judice, and of no legal effect”.
The party alleged in the petition that law enforcement agencies conducted “hundreds of illegal raids, storming into private homes without warrants, often in the dead of night, and abducting citizens without due process”.
It further alleged that during the raids, police personnel “[broke] down doors, vandalised property, and looted personal belongings” in the 180 “documented cases”.
The petition stated that the orders were given without “any disclosed or lawful decision, approval, or satisfaction of the provincial cabinet”, which it said stood in direct violation of Articles 4, 9, 10, 15, 16, 17, 19, and 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.”
The petitioners sought that the court declare the “impugned orders constitute a mala fide, colourable, arbitrary and politically motivated exercise of power, issued for an extraneous and collateral purpose, namely the suppression of political opposition and peaceful democratic activity, and not for the genuine maintenance of public order as contemplated by law”.
The petition also stated that the PTI, as a registered and recognised political party, “is constitutionally entitled ot organise, participate in, and carry out peaceful political activity, including meetings, protests, strikes, and political expression”.
It further prayed that the court “set aside the impugned orders in their entirety and suspend their operation forthwith”.
It added that the respondents should be restrained from taking “any action whatsoever pursuant to, in reliance upon, or in furtherance of the said impugned orders”.
The petitioners also requested the court to direct the immediate release of “all persons who have been arrested, detained, restrained, or otherwise deprived of liberty pursuant to the impugned orders, if not required in any other case”.
It further asked that “no fresh detention, arrest, or coercive action be taken against them on the basis of the same allegations, intelligence, or grounds”.
The petition prayed that the court declare the actions taken in relation to the orders “illegal, unconstitutional, without lawful authority, and violative of fundamental rights.”
The petitioners alleged that actions taken against the workers included “warrantless raids, home invasions, arrests, detentions, harassment, intimidation, and the detention of minors, women, and elderly citizens”.
It also sought that the respondents should present before the court the “complete original record, including all summaries, intelligence reports, recommendations, approvals, notes, and decision-making documents allegedly relied upon for issuance of the impugned orders, including any purported approval or consideration by the provincial Cabinet”.
The petitioners requested the court to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the additional chief secretary (home) and declare that he “has acted in willful disobedience and defiance of binding judgments of this honourable court passed in earlier MPO matters, and that the repeated issuance of identical unlawful orders amounts to disregard of judicial authority and prima facie contempt of court”.
They requested the court to ensure that no preventive detention order under the MPO Ordinance should be issued in Sindh without “strict compliance with constitutional requirements, individualised satisfaction, and demonstrable approval of the provincial Cabinet”.
The petitioners asked the court to issue orders “restraining respondents from misusing” provisions under the MPO, particularly, as a “substitute for ordinary criminal law or as a tool for political suppression”.
“Declare that the existence of any alleged alternate remedy under the MPO Ordinance does not bar the constitutional jurisdiction of this honourable court in matters involving deprivation of liberty and mass unlawful detention,” the petition read.
It further said that the court should “grant any consequential, incidental, or ancillary relief necessary to fully restore and protect the fundamental rights of the affected citizens, including protection against re-arrest on the same or similar grounds”.
‘Repression, deception, and abuse of power’
Meanwhile, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh assailed the government for the “arrests”, stating that, “180 PTI office-bearers and workers were arrested and sent to jail under MPO-3 for one month, not for violence, but for announcing a peaceful, voluntary strike on February 8.”
In a post on X, Sheikh claimed that while the government ministers “publicly denied arrests and MPO orders till late night, the detention orders were quietly issued the same night, and detainees were shifted to jail”.
“This is not governance; it is repression, deception, and abuse of power,” he added.







On Sunday, the Sindh government had categorically rejected PTI’s claims, calling them “completely false and misleading”.
Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Memon, who also holds the portfolio of information, said no mass arrests or detentions under MPO had taken place.
He told Dawn the PTI statement was based on incorrect information and aimed at creating unnecessary political hype.
“Where’s the list of those arrested? It’s a blatant lie. The PTI is spreading false narratives to build momentum and gain political sympathy for its announced protest planned for February 8,” Memon said.
He added: “The provincial government has not issued any blanket detention orders against PTI leaders or workers and that law enforcement agencies are acting strictly within the law.”</p><small>2026-02-02 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/021409347c03c2f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970610/pm-shehbaz-appreciates-partnership-support-from-world-bank-in-meeting-with-president-banga-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz appreciates partnership, support from World Bank in meeting with President Banga in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: World Bank Group (WBG) President Ajay Banga called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday as Pakistan acknowledged the group’s valuable support, which has been instrumental in advancing the country’s economic development and reforms.
According to the PM Office, the prime minister welcomed Banga for his first official visit as the president of the WBG.







The premier appreciated the group for its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and its commitment to supporting the development priorities of the country, especially through the 10-year WBG Country Partnership Framework (CPF).
Shehbaz also appreciated Banga’s leadership in transforming the WBG into a more impactful development partner.
He said that the government of Pakistan was vigorously working on an economic reform agenda, with a multi-pronged, comprehensive, structural, homegrown programme aimed at sustainable economic stability.
The prime minister also appreciated the support of the global financial institution in resilient infrastructure, agribusiness, digital development, energy, human capital, fiscal reforms, and increasing productive private investment for job creation and growth.
PM Shehbaz and Banga reiterated the need to fast-track implementation and ensure strong oversight to deliver impact at speed and scale on Country Partnership Framework (CPF)-aligned priorities. These measures would duly assist the prime minister’s initiative to address and resolve implementation bottlenecks in development projects.
PM Shehbaz also expressed the government’s commitment to structural reforms that would unlock job-rich growth and further strengthen investors’ confidence.
Speaking on the occasion, Banga expressed his gratitude to the prime minister for his reception and hospitality in Pakistan. He commended the government’s ongoing reform efforts and reaffirmed his commitment to deepening cooperation through a One World Bank Group approach.
He said that greater leverage of private resources, in addition to strong coordination with development partners, was necessary to meet the ambition of the government’s reform agenda.</p><small>2026-02-02 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648618-kazakhstan-president-to-discuss-trade-connectivity-on-maiden-pakistan-visit-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakh president to discuss trade, connectivity on maiden Pakistan visit today</strong></a><br><p>

The nationwide drive is being held from February 2 to February 5 in most cities, while Sindh is conducting a week-long campaign until February 8. Strict security measures have been taken in various districts, keeping in view past attacks on polio teams.
First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, in a post on X, said: “The first nationwide polio vaccination drive of 2026 is underway, with health workers going door to door.”
“This campaign is a vital step towards protecting our children and eliminating polio once and for all,” she stressed.
The first lady encouraged all parents with children aged five years or below to ensure their kids receive the vaccine every time it is offered, pointing out that this was the “only way to eliminate polio for good”.







Speaking at the formal inauguration of the drive in Karachi, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah noted that the campaign aimed to vaccinate 10.5 million children in the province.
CM Murad said 80,000 frontline workers would visit all neighbourhoods and added that they would be supported by more than 21,000 law enforcement personnel, including over 1,000 female police constables.
“It is my request to all parents that they administer polio drops to their children aged below five and save them from this debilitating disease,” the chief minister said.
CM Murad went on to urge parents to visit their nearest basic health unit if a polio team did not come to their house. They could also alert the assistant or deputy commissioner that a team had not visited, he added.







“It is a cause of shame for us that there are only two countries in the world where this disease can be found — Afghanistan and Pakistan,” he said.
However, he added, vaccination was the only way to get rid of it.
The Sindh CM also requested those “who have any kind of influence over others”, such as teachers, elected representatives at the town, municipality, or assembly levels, and politicians.
The chief minister also requested religious scholars to play their role in shoring up public confidence in polio vaccination.
“The World Health Organisation (WHO) has certified that these drops do not cause any disease,” Murad pointed out.
“This disease is so contagious that it can spread from one place to another if not eradicated. That is why the entire world has its eyes on Pakistan and Afghanistan,” he added.







The campaign in Sindh will cover 1,490 union councils across 30 districts during which oral polio vaccine drops will be administered to a total of 10.5 million children, including 8.9m children under the age of five years.
In a meeting last week, the CM was informed that the country reported 74 polio cases in 2024, 31 in 2025, and zero cases so far in 2026. Meanwhile, Sindh recorded 23 cases in 2024 and nine in 2025.
State-run APP, citing a press release issued by the Karachi commissioner’s office, said the polio vaccination campaign in the metropolis aimed to vaccinate over 2.1m children.
The report further said 22,000 polio workers, 2,700 area in-charges and 267 UC medical officers have been deputed for the drive in Karachi. To beef up security, over 7,000 security personnel will also be deployed.
Strict security measures
Polio vaccination drives were also launched in other parts of the country on Monday.
In Islamabad, health teams aim to vaccinate 466,000 children across the federal capital, APP reported.
Stringent security measures were taken in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where terrorists have often targeted polio teams.
In the Abbottabad district, 1,768 police officers and personnel were deployed, according to APP.
In addition to providing security to vaccination teams, police will also conduct search operations and establish effective checkpoints in the city and sensitive areas to maintain law and order, the report added.
The Tank district also saw personnel deployed across all areas to provide foolproof security during the campaign.

 

Continuous monitoring, field visits, and close coordination with other law enforcement agencies had been ensured to maintain a safe environment throughout the vaccination drive, APP quoted a police spokesperson as saying.
The Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) also conducted a thorough sweep of sensitive locations.
Last week, when a high-level delegation from the Gates Foundation visited Islamabad, the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme reiterated its resolve to achieve the Roadmap to Zero Polio 2026.
Meeting the delegation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had affirmed that the government was implementing a “comprehensive strategy and taking practical actions” to eradicate polio.</p><small>2026-02-02 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02155537367fe22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970607/militant-violence-surges-in-january-after-december-lull-picss' target='_blank'><strong>Militant violence surges in January after December lull: PICSS</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After a noticeable decline in violence in December 2025, the first month of the new year witnessed a renewed surge in anti-state violence, leading to higher fatalities among militants, civilians and security personnel, according to official statistics.
Data released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) shows that combat-related deaths in January 2026 rose by 43 per cent compared to December 2025.
During the month, 242 militants were killed, while 73 civilians and 46 security force personnel lost their lives. Twelve militants were injured, while at least 71 civilians and 52 security personnel were also wounded.
PICSS reported that January saw 87 militant attacks nationwide, marking a 28pc increase from the 68 attacks recorded in December 2025. Of these, 38 attacks took place in mainland Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 20 in the province’s tribal districts (erstwhile Fata), 27 in Balochistan and two in Punjab.
Balochistan emerged as the primary theatre of militant activity as well as security operations. The province reported the highest monthly militant toll since the current wave of militancy began there in 2001.
Although Balochistan experienced relative calm for much of the month, violence escalated sharply during the final two days. Simultaneous attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) on at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security force operations, brought the province into sharp focus.
The month recorded at least three suicide attacks, two of them in Balochistan and claimed by the BLA. The province witnessed the deaths of at least 172 terrorists, most of them during the final two days of January.
Compared to the previous month, civilian deaths increased by 143pc, militant deaths by 35pc and security force fatalities by seven per cent.
Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals.
Punjab reported only two militant attacks; however, security forces carried out a coordinated crackdown across central Punjab, including Lahore, Sahiwal, Pakpattan and Mianwali.
At least 53 suspected militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore. Analysts say these arrests likely disrupted a major militant buildup aimed at targeting the city.
No militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad or Gilgit-Baltistan.</p><small>2026-02-02 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648582-mqm-founder-altaf-hussain-hospitalised' target='_blank'><strong>MQM founder Altaf Hussain hospitalised in London after 'health deteriorated'</strong></a><br><p>

On Saturday, the military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan. 18 civilians and 15 personnel of security forces were martyred in the attacks on Saturday.
In a statement, posted on X, the TTAP condemned the attacks and expressed sorrow with the martyrs. It noted that “a terrorist attack in the province on such a large scale was a failure on the part of the provincial government and LEAs”.







The opposition alliance stated that the series of attacks showed the “extent to which the rule of law has become limited in the province and the lack of concern for the lives and property of citizens.”
“For how long will we turn a blind eye to the fact that the provincial government — which does not have the public’s support — is only interested in prolonging its time in power,” TTAP said.
The opposition alliance maintained that “only governments whose own moral standing was not under question were capable of combating terrorism”.
TTAP reiterated its demand for “free and fair elections” in reference to the 2024 General Elections.
It further stressed that “representative governments were the only solution to the problems, not rulers and systems imposed against the will of the public”.
During the early morning hours on Saturday, multiple terrorist cells attacked more than 10 cities and towns in Balochistan. The targets were primarily security and government installations.
Suicide bombers, including female attackers, were part of the assault force. Security forces engaged the terrorists in gun battles across the province.
During the skirmishes, 15 security personnel were martyred and 18 civilians lost their lives. As the attacks subsided, security forces launched a series of cordon-and-sweep operations to clear towns, cities, and the countryside of terrorist presence.</p><small>2026-02-02 10:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02140455c5af504.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970602/security-forces-kill-22-more-terrorists-in-balochistan-taking-48-hour-total-tally-to-177' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 22 more terrorists in Balochistan, taking 48-hour total tally to 177</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 22 more terrorists during the ongoing security sweeps in Balochistan, taking the tally of terrorists killed over the past two days to 177, said security officials.
Terrorists carried out a large-scale coordinated attack in the province on Saturday. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed more than 150 terrorists.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The terrorists were killed overnight as security sweeps continued across the province following Saturday’s attack, with security officials adding that the “noose is tightening”.
Mobile internet services remain suspended
Residents of Quetta and other cities in Balochistan continued to face difficulties on Monday as mobile internet services remained suspended for the third day in a row.
Mobile phone data was suspended in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Khuzdar, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan and other cities on Saturday.
Balochistan’s Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn that the services would remain suspended today, but were expected to be restored tomorrow.
This is not the first time that the government has suspended internet services in Balochistan for security reasons: in November, it suspended mobile internet services in all 36 districts of the province for about a week.

Addressing the media on Sunday, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti expressed firm resolve to eliminate terrorists. Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that peace has been established in Balochistan after Saturday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”.</p><small>2026-02-02 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648571-rawalpindi-court-issues-aleema-khans-arrest-warrant-in-nov-26-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi court issues Aleema Khan's arrest warrant in Nov 26 protest case</strong></a><br><p>

The reopening of the Rafah border crossing will be limited, with Israel demanding security checks for Palestinians entering and exiting. Israel and Egypt were expected to impose caps on the number of travellers.
Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war that was brought to a tenuous halt by an October ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump.
Rafah’s reopening was an important requirement under the first phase of Trump’s broader plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas.
An Israeli security official said that European monitoring teams had arrived at the crossing, which “has now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit.”
Foreign Journalist barred from Gaza
In the first nine months of Israel’s assault in Gaza, launched after the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on southern Israel, Palestinians were generally able to flee to Egypt through the Rafah crossing.
Palestinian officials say about 100,000 Palestinians have fled Gaza since the war began, most of them during the first nine months. Some were sponsored by aid groups. Others paid bribes to parties in Egypt to secure permission to leave.
Israel closed the Rafah crossing after its forces swept into the area and also closed the Philadelphi corridor that runs the length of Gaza’s border with Egypt.
The closure cut off an important route for wounded and sick Palestinians to seek medical care outside Gaza. A few thousand have been allowed out to seek medical treatment in third countries via Israel over the past year, though thousands more are in need of care abroad, according to the United Nations.



Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, who have been banned from Gaza since the start of the war, which has caused widespread destruction and laid waste to swathes of territory.
Gaza’s about 2 million Palestinians mostly live in makeshift tents and damaged homes, surrounded by the ruins of their destroyed cities.
Israel’s Supreme Court is considering a petition by the Foreign Press Association that demands foreign journalists be allowed to enter Gaza from Israel. Government lawyers have said that letting journalists into Gaza could pose risks to Israeli soldiers, while also highlighting potential risks to reporters.
The FPA rejects this, saying the public is being deprived of a vital source of independent information. It also points to the fact that many aid and United Nations workers have been allowed to enter the enclave since the war started.
Trump’s plan for Gaza, now in its second phase, foresees governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while it is rebuilt.
Israel has cast doubt on the prospect of Hamas laying down its arms and some officials say the military is preparing for a return to war.
Since the October deal was struck, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians, health officials say.
On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense air strikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday.</p><small>2026-02-02 08:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648545-burns-or-suffocation-what-caused-deaths-in-gul-plaza-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Burns or suffocation: What caused deaths in the Gul Plaza fire?</strong></a><br><p>

Mandelson, who was dismissed by Starmer as Britain’s ambassador to the United States last year after previous revelations about his connections to Epstein, said he did not wish to cause “further embarrassment” to Labour, the reports said.



“I have been further linked this weekend to the understandable furore surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and I feel regretful and sorry about this,” Mandelson said in a letter to the Labour Party reported by the BBC and other news organisations, which Reuters was not immediately able to obtain.
Mandelson said he believed allegations about financial payments to him by Epstein, which appeared in British media based on files released by the US Department of Justice, were false and he would investigate them.
“While doing this, I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party,” the letter said.
Mandelson was key to the Labour Party’s electoral success when Tony Blair was prime minister starting in the 1990s.
He came under scrutiny last year after US lawmakers released documents, including a letter in which he called Epstein “my best pal”, leading to his dismissal as Britain’s envoy in Washington.
Mandelson also had a turbulent earlier career in domestic politics. In 1998, he resigned as trade minister over a loan he received from a fellow minister to buy a house amid questions over conflict of interest.
A second stint in the Cabinet also ended in a resignation in 2001 when he was forced out over his alleged involvement in a passport scandal involving an Indian billionaire. He was later cleared of acting improperly.
Mandelson, a former European Union trade commissioner, is on leave of absence as a member of the House of Lords.
Separately, Starmer said on Saturday that Britain’s former Prince Andrew should testify before a US congressional committee, following new revelations about his links to Epstein.</p><small>2026-02-02 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648526-bolton-market-fire-station-stalled-for-over-18-months-fire-tender-deployed-for-bilawal-house-security' target='_blank'><strong>Bolton Market fire station stalled for over 18 months</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on Sunday night, the party said doctors had conducted a medical examination of the MQM leader and admitted him to the hospital.
Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.







“Mr Altaf Hussain was taken to the hospital on Sunday evening due to ill health, where after an initial examination, the doctors have admitted him to the hospital,” said the post on X.
The party elaborated that doctors “administered an injection to him, and started an IV drip in view of weakness in his body”.
Doctors will conduct a detailed examination of the party founder on Monday, added the post.







The party founder was also “administered a blood transfusion on Sunday night on the advice of doctors,” a subsequent post on the party’s X handle said on Monday.
In a post on X, London-based senior MQM leader Mustafa Azizabadi said Hussain’s ill health was caused by “severe mental stress and staying engaged in organisational work day and night for 18 to 20 hours”.







Last year, the MQM founder was hospitalised on two occasions within a span of a month.
He was admitted to a hospital in London on July 10 due to “severe illness” and was discharged on July 23 after undergoing multiple tests and blood transfusions.
Hussain was again hospitalised on August 8 and was allowed to leave the next day. Doctors had diagnosed him with severe flu and a chest infection.
The MQM founder had also remained in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021.
Hussain’s political journey
Hussain was born on Sept 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi’s Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality where he spent his early years and his youth.
He later enrolled at the University of Karachi (KU) to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979.
His political career began during his student years at KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO).
Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time.
Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third largest party in the country.
In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi.

 

The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.
Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context.
However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an incendiary speech in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis­tan but also called the country “a cancer for the entire world”. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the ARY News office in Kara­chi.
Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech, and the MQM’s Karachi headquarters and Hussain’s residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain’s own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution.
In October 2019, Hussain was charged with “encouraging terrorism” by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail.
After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‘encouraging terrorism’.
The jury found Hussain not guilty on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006.</p><small>2026-02-02 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/02085206277d293.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970528/india-unveils-record-85bn-defence-budget' target='_blank'><strong>India unveils record $85bn defence budget</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: India will spend a record amount on infrastructure and defence, the finance minister said in her national budget speech on Sunday, with plans for high-speed rail, submarines and fighter jets.
New Delhi plans to spend $133 billion on infrastructure and $85 billion on defence, a respective rise of around nine and 15 percent compared to last year’s budget.
Data centres, artificial intelligence, and the mining and processing of rare earths will also receive government support, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told parliament.



She said public spending on infrastructure had increased dramatically from around $21 billion (2 trillion rupees) in 2014-15 and that it was now at an “all-time high”.

Rajnath says armed forces would be equipped with fighter jets, drones, ships, submarines and critical hardware

The defence spending hike comes after a four-day conflict with Pakistan last May that killed at least 70 people, and saw both sides make extensive use of drones as well as intense missile and artillery barrages.
‘Best interest’
Defence minister Rajnath Singh described the spending as “unprecedented” and said it would help equip India’s armed forces with fighter jets, drones, ships, submarines and other critical hardware. “It is in the best interest of the nation,” he added. New Delhi is in the midst of negotiating defence contracts with domestic and international suppliers, including France, the United States and Germany.
The world’s most populous country sees massive infrastructure spending as key to sustaining its high growth rate by boosting domestic manufacturing and creating millions of new jobs.
“India is not content with simply being the fastest-growing economy,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after the budget. “India wants to become the world’s third-largest economy.” This year’s budget presents an ambitious roadmap to give new momentum to domestic manufacturing and self-reliance.
Sectors including textiles, pharmaceuticals, electronics and chemicals are primary targets to boost exports, Sitharaman said.
She promised the development of business parks for textiles and chemicals and said $5 billion would be spent on boosting domestic electronics manufacturing.
