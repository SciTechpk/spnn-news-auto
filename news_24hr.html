<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915942/detention-law' target='_blank'><strong>Detention law</strong></a><br><p>CITIZENS will be presumed guilty until proven innocent. At least that is the message the political leadership of Balochistan has sent to the people of the province. The Anti-Terrorism (Balochistan Amendment) Act, 2025, adopted last Wednesday by the Balochistan Assembly, states that any individual “suspected of offences enshrined in the anti-terrorism law may be held in preventive detention for up to three months for the purpose of inquiry”. It was passed without any real resistance from the parties present, ostensibly because the province’s elected leadership has run out of ideas about how its violent sociopolitical crisis may be addressed. There is no denying that the state faces immense law-and-order challenges in the province, but will such sweeping legislation solve problems, or merely complicate them by adding more fuel to the fire?
The Balochistan Assembly seems to have made the amendments to provide legal cover to the state, which routinely detains citizens from the province without any formal charge. The vague legal standard for ‘reasonable suspicion’, the absence of judicial checks, the formalised involvement of military forces in policing civilians, and Balochistan’s history of political targeting all but guarantee that this law will be abused, and in turn fuel more of the same anger and discontentment that even today make Balochistan’s problems seem intractable. Even aside from the host of legal and moral issues with the law, if the state really needed these powers, it could have at the very least respected some long-standing Baloch grievances while it was being drafted. For example, it should have said that each detention would be properly documented; that there would be continuous civilian and judicial oversight of each case so that there were no rights abuses in detention; and that the families of detainees would be kept informed of each detainee’s whereabouts and legal status so they would not keep searching for them in desperation. It would have made the law much more palatable. Perhaps it can still be reconsidered.

The British-flagged yacht Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, had departed from Sicily on June 1 and had hoped to reach Gaza later in the day, when the interception occurred, the group said on its Telegram account.
Among those on board the boat are Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament. The yacht is carrying a small shipment of humanitarian aid, including rice and baby formula.

The ministry said in a statement on X that the vessel “is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries”.
It said earlier that “the maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to unauthorised vessels under a legal naval blockade, consistent with international law”.
“Humanitarian aid is delivered regularly and effectively via different channels and routes and is transferred through established distribution mechanisms,” it added.
The FFC said earlier on Monday that Israeli soldiers had kidnapped the activists who were on the Madleen.
Israeli forces boarded the charity vessel attempting to reach the Gaza Strip in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade, the FFC had said earlier in the day.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment.
The United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has supported the FFC operation and urged other boats to challenge the Gaza blockade.
“Madleen’s journey may have ended, but the mission isn’t over. Every Mediterranean port must send boats with aid & solidarity to Gaza,” she wrote on X.
“As the Madleen was reportedly intercepted and seized by Israeli forces in int’l waters, the UK gov must urgently seek full clarification and secure the immediate release of the vessel & its crew,” she said in a separate post.
 






The Gaza Freedom Flotilla had also said that quadcopters surrounded the Madleen and were “spraying it with a white paint-like substance”, Al Jazeera reported.
Huwaida Arraf, the co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement, which is supporting the FFC, told Al Jazeera that some people on board reported that their “eyes were burning” after the white substance was dropped on the aid boat.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing the Israeli Navy communicating with the Madleen over a loudspeaker, urging it to change course, shortly before the FFC confirmed that Israeli forces had boarded the Gaza-bound aid ship.
“The maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to naval traffic as part of a legal naval blockade,” a soldier said. “If you wish to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, you are able to do so through the (Israeli) port of Ashdod.”
The organisers of the Madleen’s voyage said on Saturday that they had reached Egyptian waters and were nearing Gaza, where the Israeli invasion of Gaza entered its 21st month.
The Madleen, a sailing boat operated by the FFC, left Italy on June 1 with the stated aim of delivering humanitarian aid and breaking the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian territory.
“Israel will not allow anyone to break the naval blockade of Gaza, which is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching Hamas — a murderous terrorist group holding our hostages and committing war crimes,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
“Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or support terror groups — by sea, air or land,” he added.
The coalition responded in a statement on X, saying it expected “interception and an attack from Israel at any moment” and calling for the governments of those on board to protect them.
The post added that the Madleen is 160 nautical miles from Gaza and that jamming “briefly disrupted our location, but our tracker is functioning again”.
 






Meanwhile, activists aboard the vessel have said they will continue their journey “until the last minute”.
“We’ll stay mobilised until the last minute — until Israel cuts the internet and networks,” European parliament member Rima Hassan told AFP from the boat. “There are twelve of us civilians on board. We are not armed. There is only humanitarian aid.”
Hassan voiced concern over the lack of official response from countries whose citizens are part of the crew.
“No state has responded. The message being sent is that Israel is being allowed to act with impunity, without any guarantee of protection for us,” she added.
In a post on X, Hassan said that the activists have “less than 24 hours” before they are detained by Israeli authorities.
“When we are no longer able to communicate with you, I’m counting on you to continue the mobilisation that has been so valuable to us throughout this journey,” she wrote.
 






Nationals of Germany, France, Brazil, Turkey, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands are on the boat.
“We’re not scared of them,” said German human rights activist Yasemin Acar, also on board. “The message they have been sending us, that we cannot come closer, is not making us step back.”
On Sunday, French Minister for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad Laurent Saint-Martin said that France was obliged to ensure “consular protection” for its nationals aboard the Madleen.
“The six French citizens on this boat are entitled to consular protection,” he told a state TV channel.
On May 27, Israel began implementing a controversial plan to distribute aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, bypassing UN oversight. Palestinians have denounced the move as a coercive tactic to force displacement from northern to southern Gaza.
Gaza’s Government Media Office said the death toll from the American-Israeli aid distribution sites had risen to 125, with 736 wounded and nine missing since May 27.
According to the office, 13 people were killed and 153 injured on Sunday alone in two separate incidents near those locations.
On Sunday, the health ministry in Gaza said that the overall toll for the Gaza invasion had reached 54,880, the majority being civilians. The UN considers these figures reliable.
The conflict was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.</p><small>2025-06-09 05:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09095130aabc434.jpg?r=100220' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916060/indias-80-billion-coal-power-boom-is-running-short-of-water' target='_blank'><strong>India’s $80 billion coal-power boom is running short of water</strong></a><br><p>April marks the start of the cruellest months for residents of Solapur, a hot and dry district in western India. As temperatures soar, water availability dwindles. In peak summer, the wait for taps to flow can stretch to a week or more.
Just a decade ago, water flowed every other day, according to the local government and residents of Solapur, some 400 km inland from Mumbai.
Then in 2017, a 1,320-megawatt coal-fired power plant run by state-controlled NTPC began operations. It provided the district with energy — and competed with residents and businesses for water from a reservoir that serves the area.
Solapur illustrates the Catch-22 facing India, which has 17 per cent of the planet’s population but access to only 4pc of its water resources. The world’s most populous country plans to spend nearly $80 billion on water-hungry coal plants by 2031 to power growing industries like data centre operations.
The vast majority of these new projects are planned for India’s driest areas, according to a power ministry document reviewed by Reuters, which is not public and was created for officials to track progress.
Many of the 20 people interviewed by Reuters for this story, which included power company executives, energy officials and industry analysts, said the thermal expansion likely portended future conflict between industry and residents over limited water resources.
Thirty-seven of the 44 new projects named in the undated power ministry shortlist of future operations are located in areas that the government classifies as either suffering from water scarcity or stress. NTPC, which says it draws 98.5pc of its water from water-stressed areas, is involved in nine of them.
NTPC said in response to Reuters’ questions that it is “continuously striving towards conservation of water with best of our efforts in Solapur”, including using methods like treating and reusing water. It did not answer queries about potential expansion plans.
India’s power ministry has told lawmakers in parliament, most recently in 2017, that the locations of coal-fired power plants are determined by factors including access to land and water and that state governments are responsible for allocating water to them.
Access to land is the dominant consideration, two federal groundwater board officials and two water researchers told Reuters.
India’s complex and arcane land laws have delayed many commercial and infrastructure projects for years, so power operators under pressure to meet burgeoning demand pick areas where they are likely to face little resistance, said Rudrodip Majumdar, an energy and environment professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.
“They look for areas with easy land availability — minimum resistance for maximum land — even if water is available only far away,” he said.
The federal power ministry, as well as energy and water authorities in Maharashtra state, where Solapur is located, did not respond to queries.
Delhi attempted to reduce its reliance on coal before reversing track after the Covid-19 pandemic. It has invested heavily in renewable energy sources, like solar and hydro, but thirsty thermal power will still be dominant for the coming decades.
India’s former top energy bureaucrat Ram Vinay Shahi said ready access to power was strategically important for the country, whose per-capita power consumption is far lower than its regional rival China.
“The only energy resource we have in the country is coal,” he said. “Between water and coal, preference is given to coal.”
‘Nothing’ in Solapur?
Solapur resident Rajani Thoke plans her life around water in high summer. On days with supply, “I do not focus on anything other than storing water, washing clothes and such work,” said the mother of two, who strictly polices her family’s water use.
Sushilkumar Shinde, the federal power minister who approved the Solapur plant in 2008, when the area had already been classified “water scarce,” told Reuters he helped NTPC procure the land by negotiating payments to locals.
The member of the opposition Congress party, who won the election to retain Solapur’s parliamentary seat a year after the plant’s approval, defended the operation on the grounds of NTPC’s sizable investment. The $1.34bn plant generated thousands of jobs during its construction and now provides part-time employment to about 2,500 locals.
“I made sure farmers got good money for the land NTPC acquired,” he said, adding that mismanagement by local authorities was to blame for water shortages.
Solapur municipal official Sachin Ombase acknowledged that water distribution infrastructure had not kept up with population growth, but said that authorities were trying to address the problem.
Shinde said “there was nothing” in Solapur in 2008 and that residents who received land payments had no reason to oppose the plant.
Researcher Shripad Dharmadhikary, who founded the environment advocacy group Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, said local politicians often supported splashy infrastructure projects to boost their popularity.
Any “problems come up much later,” he said.
Even before the Solapur plant started operating, there were signs of the trouble to come. The first of its two units was supposed to start generating power by the middle of 2016, but it was delayed by more than 12 months because of years of severe water shortages, according to a 2020 regulatory filing.
The absence of nearby water resources meant the station ended up drawing on water from a reservoir about 120 km away. Such distances can sharply increase costs and the risk of water theft, said Dharmadhikary and two plant sources.
As of May 2023, the station is among India’s least water-efficient, according to the latest available federal records. It also has among the lowest capacity utilisation rates of coal-fired plants, according to data from government think-tank NITI Aayog.
NTPC said its data indicates the Solapur plant has an efficiency ratio in line with the country’s norms.
Indian stations typically consume twice as much water as their global counterparts, according to the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment think-tank.
Solapur plant officials told reporters in March that capacity utilisation will improve with increasing demand, indicating that water consumption could surge in the future.
A forthcoming survey on water use in Solapur, led by state groundwater authorities and reviewed by Reuters showed that irrigation demand in the district outstrips supply by a third.
Dharmes Waghmore owns farmland a few miles from the plant and said that developing it would provide more financial security than his current casual work.
But he said borrowing money to develop the land by drilling a bore well is too risky: “What if there’s no water?”
Kuladeep Jangam, a top local official, said authorities were struggling to draw businesses to Solapur.
The lack of “water neutralises all other pull factors,” he said.
Thirst For Water
Since 2014, India has lost 60.33bn units of coal-power generation across the country — equivalent to 19 days of coal-power supply at June 2025 levels — because water shortages force plants to suspend generation, according to federal data.
Among the facilities that have struggled with shortages is the 2,920 MW Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station, one of India’s largest.
Located about 500 km northeast of Solapur but also in a water-stressed area, the plant shuts several of its units for months at a time when the monsoon delivers less rain than usual, according to NITI Aayog data.
Despite the challenges, the plant is considering adding 800 MW of new capacity, according to the power ministry list seen by Reuters and half a dozen sources at Mahagenco, which operates the station.
The document indicates the plant hasn’t identified a water source for the expansion, though it has already sourced its coal.
State-owned Mahagenco did not respond to Reuters’ questions.
The plant’s thirst for water has previously led to tensions with residents of nearby Chandrapur city. Locals protested the station during a 2017 drought, prompting officials such as local lawmaker Sudhir Mungantiwar to order it to divert water to homes.
Mungantiwar, however, says he supports the expansion of the plant, which he hopes will lead to the project retiring water-inefficient older units.
But the station has already delayed a plan to decommission two polluting and water-guzzling power units with a capacity of 420 MW by about seven years, citing instructions from the federal government, the company sources said.
The Indian government asked power companies not to retire old thermal plants until the end of the decade due to a surge in demand following the pandemic, Reuters has reported.
Chandrapur resident Anjali, who goes by one name, said she is resigned to visiting a tap installed by the station near one of its gates for drinking water.
“We’re poor, we make do with whatever we can get,” she said.</p><small>2025-06-09 05:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09095303ab3dd0f.jpg?r=095313' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916059/pakistan-economic-survey-2024-25-to-be-unveiled-today' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 to be unveiled today</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, the pre-budget document, containing the details of major socio-economic achievements during the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25, will be launched today.
The survey will be presented by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, according to a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance on Sunday.
The Economic Survey serves as a vital document ahead of the annual federal budget, offering detailed insights into the country’s socio-economic performance over the outgoing fiscal year.
According to the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), whose recommendations were endorsed by the National Economic Council (NEC), Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate for the fiscal year 2024–25 has been recorded at 2.7 per cent while the target for GDP growth in the next fiscal year has been set at 4.2pc.
The NEC also noted that remittances witnessed a strong increase of 30.9pc from July 2024 to April 2025, and for the first time, the current account balance remained in surplus during this period.
The survey will also highlight improvements in fiscal indicators, including a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 2.6pc of GDP. The primary balance recorded a surplus of 3pc of GDP, reflecting a more disciplined fiscal approach.
Owing to improved economic fundamentals and proactive monetary policy measures, the policy interest rate was gradually reduced to 11pc. Meanwhile, credit to the private sector grew significantly, with loans amounting to Rs681 billion disbursed between July 2024 and May 2025.
The survey will highlight trends, achievements, and challenges across major sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, industry, services, energy, information technology and telecommunications, capital markets, health, education, transport, and communication.
Additionally, the survey will shed light on developments in social protection programmes, environmental sustainability, and infrastructure.
The document will also present updated data on critical economic indicators such as inflation, trade and balance of payments, public debt, population growth, employment levels, and climate change impacts. By offering a consolidated view of these indicators, the survey aims to inform public debate and policy planning in the lead-up to the new fiscal year.
Meanwhile, the NEC emphasised that recent signs of “economic stabilisation” were the result of coordinated efforts by the federal and provincial governments.
It stated that the country has now moved onto a path of economic recovery and growth, with the agriculture sector played a particularly important role in strengthening national reserves and supporting economic expansion.
“A comprehensive strategy is currently being formulated to ensure a steady and sustainable increase in agricultural productivity in the coming years,” it said.
In terms of development spending, a total outlay of Rs3,483bn has been approved for the Annual National Development Programme (ANDP) for 2024–25. Of this amount, Rs1,100bn was allocated for federal development initiatives, while Rs2,383bn was utilised by provincial governments for their respective projects.</p><small>2025-06-09 04:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09091922431a736.jpg?r=092332' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916058/no-deaths-as-plane-with-20-aboard-crashes-in-tennessee-us-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>No deaths as plane with 20 aboard crashes in Tennessee: US authorities</strong></a><br><p>No one was killed, but several people were injured and taken to hospital on Sunday when a skydiving plane carrying 20 passengers and crew crashed in the US state of Tennessee, authorities said.
A twin-engine plane used for skydiving expeditions crashed shortly after midday in Tullahoma, south of Nashville, according to local and federal officials.
“There were no casualties,” city spokesman Lyle Russell said in a statement sent to AFP.
He said a total of 20 passengers and crew were onboard the DeHaviland DH-6 Twin Otter when it crashed at the Tullahoma Regional Airport at around 12:30pm (10:30pm PKT).
“Three were sent for medical treatment via helicopter and one sent by ground transport for more serious injuries to local hospitals,” he said, adding that “other minor injuries were treated by first responders on scene”.
Russell said that “no ground facilities or airport facilities were damaged and there were no injuries reported from the ground”.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating the crash, while the Tennessee Highway Patrol said on X that its troopers were assisting police at the scene.

Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassan Khan told Dawn.com that rescue officials are still at the site, trying to put the blaze out.
The fire, which erupted in a factory in the export processing zone in Landhi, caused part of a factory building to collapse, leaving five people injured.
“The injured include 45-year-old Aslam, 30-year-old Hamza, 20-year-old Ayaz, 43-year-old Sajid Mahmood and 53-year-old Mohsin,” Khan said. “They have been transported to Civil Hospital.”
Earlier, Khan told Dawn.com that the fire broke out at 4:31am, meaning that it has been burning for over 24 hours.
Speaking to Dawn.com earlier today, Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, chief operating officer at Rescue 1122 Sindh, said that the fire broke out early on Sunday morning, spreading rapidly and engulfing two other factories due to the presence of combustible material.
He said, “As soon as the information was received, the Fire and Rescue team of Rescue 1122 reached the spot.”
According to Sheikh, a total of 12 fire brigade trucks,two snorkels and two ambulances of Rescue 1122 and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) are present at the spot to provide full assistance to deal with any emergency situation.
“The rescue operation is facing difficulties due to the intensity of smoke and other difficulties, as well as the shortage of water, but Rescue 1122 is making efforts to control the fire,” he said.
Sheikh highlighted that firefighting operations were “in full swing and full efforts are being made to reduce the intensity of the fire because the intensity of the fire is very high”.
“The Rescue 1122 team is making full efforts to control this emergency situation by utilising all possible resources,” he said, adding that citizens have been requested to immediately report any emergency to 1122.
Fire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.
Thirty shops were gutted when a huge fire erupted in a commercial building in Clifton in February.
Four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation and 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.
Last year, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a fire safety audit of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.
Out of 265 buildings, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added.
Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.</p><small>2025-06-09 03:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/090020167c9abb0.jpg?r=002104' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916052/alcaraz-saves-three-match-points-to-beat-sinner-to-french-open-title' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz saves three match points to beat Sinner to French Open title</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz saved three championship points as he produced an astonishing fightback from two sets down to beat Jannik Sinner in a French Open final for the ages on Sunday.
Reigning champion Alcaraz rallied from the brink of defeat to overcome world number one Sinner 4-6, 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (10/2) to clinch his fifth Grand Slam title after five hours and 29 minutes.
The 22-year-old Spaniard is now unbeaten in five Grand Slam finals after snapping Sinner’s 20-match winning run at the majors.
Alcaraz pulled off his first-ever comeback from two sets down to stun Sinner in the longest Roland Garros final in history. It easily eclipsed the 1982 final in Paris when Mats Wilander triumphed in four sets over Guillermo Vilas in 4 hours and 42 minutes.
Alcaraz becomes the third youngest man to win five Grand Slams — after Bjorn Borg and compatriot Rafael Nadal — following an incredible duel between the two stars of a new generation.
Sinner fell agonisingly short of a third successive Grand Slam crown after last year’s US Open title and back-to-back Australian Open triumphs.
He suffered his fifth straight loss to Alcaraz in what was their first meeting in a Grand Slam final — and the first championship match at a major between two men born in the 2000s.
Alcaraz leads 8-5 overall, having also beaten Sinner to win in Rome, where the Italian returned to competition after a three-month doping ban.</p><small>2025-06-08 19:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/08215858b9db87d.jpg?r=220139' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916010/troops-sent-by-trump-reach-protest-hit-los-angeles-over-governors-wishes' target='_blank'><strong>Troops sent by Trump reach protest-hit Los Angeles over governor’s wishes</strong></a><br><p>United States National Guard troops began arriving in Los Angeles early on Sunday after being deployed by President Donald Trump, a rare deployment against the state governor’s wishes after sometimes violent protests against immigration enforcement raids.
Trump took federal control of California’s state military to push soldiers into the country’s second-biggest city, an extraordinary move not seen for decades and deemed “purposefully inflammatory” by California Governor Gavin Newsom.
Helmeted troops carrying automatic weapons and with camouflaged vehicles could be seen in the Compton neighbourhood of the California city early Sunday, ahead of more protests, including a call by organisers for a “mass mobilisation” at City Hall at 2pm local time (2100 GMT).
The development came after two days of confrontations during which federal agents fired flash-bang grenades and tear gas toward crowds angry at the arrests of dozens of migrants in a city with a large Latino population.
Republicans lined up behind Trump on Sunday to dismiss warnings by Newsom and other local officials that the protests had been largely peaceful, and that the deployment was against their wishes and would exacerbate tensions.
“I have no concern about that at all,” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told ABC’s ‘This Week’ when asked, adding that Newsom “has shown an inability or unwillingness to do what is necessary there, so the president stepped in”.
As for threats by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday to send in active-duty Marines on top of the Guard troops, Johnson said he did not see that as “heavy-handed.”
“We have to be prepared to do what is necessary,” he argued.
Federal authorities “want a spectacle. Don’t give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully,” Newsom had posted on X late on Saturday. He branded Hegseth’s threat “deranged”.
 






“We agree that if you’re being violent, you should be arrested … But this is not what’s happening,” California Congresswoman Nanette Barragan told CNN on Sunday.
“We are having an administration that’s targeting peaceful protests … The president is sending the National Guard because he doesn’t like the scenes,” the Democrat said.
Overnight, an AFP photographer saw fires and fireworks light up the streets during clashes, while a protester holding a Mexican flag stood in front of a burnt-out car that had been sprayed with a slogan against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
“It’s up to us to stand up for our people,” said a Los Angeles resident whose parents are immigrants, declining to give her name as emergency services lights flashed in the distance.
‘Zero tolerance’
Trump had signed a memorandum sending 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, the White House said on Saturday.
The National Guard — a reserve military — is frequently used in natural disasters, and occasionally in instances of civil unrest, but almost always with the consent of local authorities.
It is the first time since 1965 that a president has deployed a National Guard without a request by a state governor, the former head of Human Rights Watch, US activist Kenneth Roth, posted on X, accusing Trump of “creating a spectacle so he can continue his immigration raids”.
 






But the National Guard are “specifically trained for this type of crowd situation”, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CBS’ ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday, refusing to divulge where in Los Angeles they would be deployed.
 


Trump has delivered on a promise to crack down hard on the entry and presence of undocumented migrants — who he has likened to “monsters” and “animals” — since taking office in January.
ICE raids in other US cities have triggered small-scale protests in recent months, but the Los Angeles unrest is the biggest and most sustained against the Trump administration’s policies so far.
A CBS News poll taken before the Los Angeles protests showed a slight majority of Americans still approved of the immigration crackdown.
Masked and armed immigration agents carried out high-profile workplace raids in separate parts of Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday, attracting angry crowds and setting off hours-long standoffs.
Fernando Delgado, a 24-year-old resident, said the raids were “injustices” and those detained were “human beings just like any.”
The stand-off demonstrated “Trump’s authoritarianism in real time,” Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders posted on X on Sunday.
“Conduct massive illegal raids. Provoke a counter-response. Declare a state of emergency. Call in the troops,” he wrote, adding: “Unacceptable.”

As announced by Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad, the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 will be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey will be released a day earlier.
According to today’s statement, Sadiq approved the NA’s schedule for the budget, which will be presented in the lower house on June 10.
“There will not be any sessions in the National Assembly on June 11 and 12,” Sadiq was quoted as saying.
“The discussion on the federal budget will begin in the National Assembly on June 13 [and] parliamentary parties present … will be given time for discussion as per the rules and regulations,” he added.
 
 

According to the statement, debates on the federal budget will continue until June 21, when it will be finalised.
“There will be no meeting of the National Assembly on June 22. The necessary expenses for 2025-26 will be presented and debated in the National Assembly on June 23,” the statement added.
Sadiq was quoted as saying that on June 24 and 25, there will be debates and voting on motions for deductions and grants, while the Finance Bill 2025-26 will be finalised on June 26.
“On June 27, there will be a debate and voting on other issues, including supplementary grants,” the speaker said, with the statement adding that changes to the schedule could be made with his permission.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stated that the government’s priority in the upcoming budget is to provide relief to the common man, in addition to “the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector”.
Meanwhile, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that the government would have a Rs1 trillion development budget and hinted at an increase in defence spending.</p><small>2025-06-08 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/08200549e280a95.jpg?r=200707' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916039/ayaz-sadiq-expresses-gratitude-to-saudi-crown-prince-for-supporting-pakistan-during-difficult-time' target='_blank'><strong>Ayaz Sadiq expresses gratitude to Saudi crown prince for supporting Pakistan during ‘difficult time’</strong></a><br><p>National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Sunday met the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and expressed Pakistan’s gratitude for the kingdom’s support during “a difficult time”, a statement from the NA Secretariat read.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif embarked on a two-day state visit to the kingdom and performed Umrah on the night of Thursday and Friday, offering prayers for the country’s success in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, the government said on its X account.
During his visit, the prime minister “expressed appreciation for the kingdom’s proactive role during recent tensions between Pakistan and India, and its steadfast commitment to promoting peace and stability in the region and beyond”, according to a statement from the PM’s office.
According to the statement issued today, the Saudi crown prince expressed his commitment to addressing issues that affect the Islamic world when he met with NA Speaker Sadiq, who expressed gratitude for the kingdom’s support for Pakistan.
“Saudi Arabia has supported Pakistan in every difficult time,” Sadiq was quoted as saying. “I am grateful for the Saudi leadership’s clear stance on Pakistan. The people of Pakistan look up to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king].”
Sadiq added that he expects that ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will “further strengthen”.
 






Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who was also attending the luncheon, expressed his gratitude to the Saudi crown prince for the invitation to perform Haj as a royal guest.
“The exemplary arrangements for the pilgrims and the services to the Muslim Ummah are commendable,” Tessori wrote on X, adding that he extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan.
 






Pakistan and India engaged in a brief military confrontation last month, following the latter’s allegations that Islamabad orchestrated a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam; an allegation Pakistan strongly denied.
Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Aljubeir welcomed the ceasefire between the two countries, according to a post by the Foreign Office (FO) on X.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Turkiye for two days last month and expressed gratitude to Erdogan for Turkiye’s support during a brief military confrontation with India.
According to PTV News, a delegation-level meeting between the two nations was “warm and most cordial” and both nations “reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Türkiye, anchored in shared values, mutual respect, and a common vision for progress and prosperity”.
PTV News reported that the Turkish president made his remarks during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, where both leaders exchanged Eidul Azha greetings.
“While recalling their recent meetings in Istanbul and Lachin, the prime minister thanked President Erdogan once again for Turkiye’s strong and unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent Pakistan-India crisis,” the report read.
“He said this gesture has won the hearts of the people of Pakistan and added another glorious chapter to the history of [the] Pakistan-Turkiye brotherhood.”
 






Both leaders agreed to fast-track key decisions taken in recent meetings, which PM Shehbaz said would “help accelerate bilateral cooperation, particularly in trade and investment”, the report stated.
Erdogan and Shehbaz “reaffirmed their unflinching support to each other on their core interests. They also discussed the latest regional and global developments, including the situation in Gaza.”
“In his remarks, President Erdogan … reaffirmed Turkiye’s resolute support to Pakistan on all important issues,” PTV News added.</p><small>2025-06-08 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0813451152d5266.png?r=165315' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916022/pakistan-seeks-global-intervention-in-issues-with-india-as-diplomatic-team-lands-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks global ‘intervention’ in issues with India as diplomatic team lands in London</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for “intervention” from global powers in resolving key issues with India amid ongoing tensions, members of a high-level delegation presenting Islamabad’s stance said on Sunday after landing in London.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team has arrived in London and will also visit Brussels.
The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
“The resistance we faced is that the Americans think that since [US] President [Donald] Trump has mediated the ceasefire, there is no need for further intervention. This was exactly our mission: to make them understand that intervention is needed,” Dastgir told Geo News after arriving in the United Kingdom.
“The diplomatic delegation fulfilled its objectives,” he asserted.
The former MNA added: “Our ministers also put forward this stance that if India does not come to the table for talks again, then due to [the water issue] and India’s irresponsible behaviour — saying that it does not need evidence for a war — a war in the subcontinent is certain.”
 






Similarly, Subzwari told Geo News: “We want global powers to tell India that two neighbouring nuclear states cannot move forward in such a dangerous environment. It is not just damaging for the region but for the world’s peace.”
Noting that the delegation began its engagements with a multilateral forum, the United Nations, the senator stressed, “Despite showing our military prowess, we have come with an invitation to peace.”
Rehman, a former ambassador to the US, called the meetings “very positive”.
“They understood our points and the risks. They all also agreed that the weaponisation of water is extremely wrong,” she said, terming India-occupied Kashmir as the “largest open-air prison after Gaza”.
“Whatever the Indians do, good luck to them,” the PPP leader quipped, referring to the delegations sent by New Delhi to various countries on the matter.
Rehman highlighted: “India’s delegation does not know what its mission is, except for maligning Pakistan. [However,] we did not go [to US] to malign India, but to tell Pakistan’s story.”
Senator Butt termed the response in both New York and Washington to Pakistan’s concerns on held Kashmir and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which India unilaterally held in abeyance after a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir, as “fantastic”.
“If the Indus Waters Treaty is overlooked today, then no treaty in the future will stand any ground,” she asserted.
 
 

Summarising the delegation’s stance, former caretaker foreign minister Jilani stated: “Our message was that India committed aggression and that Pakistan is a peaceful country.”
He reiterated Islamabad’s desire for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing issues between the two nations.
Pakistan has appeared to be aiming to draw the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Trump a “man of peace”, while Bilawal said it was “reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us”.
Diplomatic contest
On June 4, the Bilawal-led delegation concluded its two-day visit to New York, where it met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, along with elected and permanent members of the UN Security Council.
It then met with several US Congress members in Washington — including chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — as well as think tanks.
 


Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, visited Moscow from June 2 to June 4. It met with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and a senior aide to President Vladimir Putin.
On its part, India had also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, as well as meet members of the UNSC, to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
On June 5, the Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance, taking advantage of his links to India.
 
 

Both delegations lobbied for their countries on Capitol Hill, meeting senior US lawmakers and chairs of various Congress committees.
The Indian delegation met members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, including senators Dave McCormick, Jacky Rosen, Jim Risch, Mark Warner, John Cornyn, and Elissa Slotkin.
The Indian delegation is led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and includes Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G. M. Harish Balayogi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, and Bhubaneswar Kalita (all from the BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), former Indian ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora.</p><small>2025-06-08 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608274-five-firefighters-hurt-as-efforts-underway-to-douse-karachi-factory-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi factory fire still raging after over 24 hours</strong></a><br><p>

Iranian state media reported on Saturday that Iranian intelligence agencies had obtained a large trove of sensitive Israeli documents. Khatib said these were related to Israel’s nuclear facilities and its relations with the United States, Europe and other countries, and to its defensive capabilities.
There was no immediate official comment from Israel.
It was not clear whether the information breach was linked to a reported hacking of an Israeli nuclear research centre last year, which Tehran is only disclosing now amid heightened tensions over its nuclear programme.
“The transfer of this treasure trove was time-consuming and required security measures. Naturally, the transfer methods will remain confidential but the documents should be unveiled soon,” Khatib said, adding that in terms of volume, “talking of thousands of documents would be an understatement.”
In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli agents had seized a huge “archive” of Iranian documents that showed Tehran had done more nuclear work than previously known.
United States President Donald Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if Tehran does not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme. But Trump in April reportedly blocked a planned Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites in favour of negotiating a deal with Tehran.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that abandoning uranium enrichment was “100 per cent” against Iran’s interests, rejecting a central US demand in talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
Western powers say Iran is refining uranium to a high degree of fissile purity close to the level suitable for atomic bomb fuel. Iran has long denied seeking nuclear weapons.</p><small>2025-06-08 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/081635117b62afb.jpg?r=163841' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916038/pope-leo-criticises-nationalist-politics-at-sunday-mass' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Leo criticises nationalist politics at Sunday Mass</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo criticised the emergence of nationalist political movements on Sunday, calling them unfortunate, without naming a specific country or national leader.
Leo, the first pope from the United States, asked during a Mass with a crowd of tens of thousands in St Peter’s Square that God would “open borders, break down walls [and] dispel hatred”.
“There is no room for prejudice, for ‘security’ zones separating us from our neighbours, for the exclusionary mindset that, unfortunately, we now see emerging also in political nationalisms,” said the pontiff.
Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected on May 8 to succeed the late Pope Francis as leader of the 1.4-billion-member Church.
Before becoming pontiff, Prevost was not shy about criticising US President Donald Trump, sharing numerous disapproving posts about him and Vice President JD Vance on X in recent years.
The Vatican has not confirmed the new pope’s ownership of the X account, which had the handle ‘drprevost’ and was deactivated after Leo’s election.
Francis, pope for 12 years, was a sharp critic of Trump. The late pope said in January that the president’s plan to deport millions of migrants in the US during his second term was a “disgrace.”
Earlier, Francis said Trump was “not Christian” because of his views on immigration.
“A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” Francis said when asked about Trump in 2016.
Leo was celebrating a Mass for Pentecost, one of the Church’s most important holidays.</p><small>2025-06-08 11:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/081428385582148.jpg?r=143031' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916032/search-underway-after-2-girls-fall-from-bridge-at-upper-dirs-gwaldai-river' target='_blank'><strong>Search underway after 2 girls fall from bridge at Upper Dir’s Gwaldai river</strong></a><br><p>A search operation was launched on Sunday after two girls fell from a makeshift bridge over the Gwaldai River in the Shahi Banda area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Upper Dir district and went missing, police said.
Zaman Shah, a sub-divisional police officer, told Dawn.com that two young girls — namely 15-year-old Samira Bibi and 12-year-old Javeria Bibi — were crossing the Gwaldai river when they fell into it and were feared to have drowned.
The official said the incident occurred within the limits of Shahi Doba’s Patrak police station, adding that the flow of water had increased recently due to glaciers melting.
Shah said that the search continues for the bodies in the river as the Rescue 1122 and locals have not succeeded yet, adding that he is present at the spot along with other officials to monitor the operation.
Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers spanning the Karakoram, Hindu Kush and the Himalayan mountain ranges, making its northern region the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the Polar Regions.
However, with striking changes in the climate, these glaciers and the habitats surrounding them are deeply troubled, with 10,000 glaciers reported to be receding.
 
 

Earlier this week, three people drowned in a canal in KP’s Malakand district, while a body was discovered in a river in Upper Dir in a separate incident.
Last month, seven people were rescued while two went missing after a boat sank in the Indus River near the province’s Kohat district.
In April, two minor sisters went missing in the Indus River in the Bisham tehsil of KP’s Shangla district.</p><small>2025-06-08 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/08165736ffe597a.jpg?r=170013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916031/indias-restive-manipur-orders-curfew-shuts-off-internet-after-fresh-violence' target='_blank'><strong>India’s restive Manipur orders curfew, shuts off internet after fresh violence</strong></a><br><p>An Indian state riven by ethnic tensions imposed an internet shutdown and curfew after protesters clashed with security forces over the arrest of some members of a radical group, police said on Sunday.
Manipur in India’s northeast has been rocked by periodic clashes for more than two years between the predominantly Hindu Meitei majority and the mainly Christian Kuki community that have killed more than 250 people.
The latest violence was triggered on Saturday after reports of the arrest of five members, including a commander, of Arambai Tenggol, a radical Meitei group.
Incensed mobs demanding their release stormed a police post, set fire to a bus and blocked roads in parts of the state capital Imphal.
Manipur police announced a curfew in five districts, including Imphal West and Bishnupur, due to the “developing law and order situation”.
“Prohibitory orders have been issued by District Magistrates. Citizens are requested to cooperate with the orders,” the police said in a statement.
Arambai Tenggol, which is alleged to have orchestrated the violence against the Kuki community, has also announced a 10-day shutdown in the valley districts.
The state’s home ministry has ordered all internet and mobile data services in volatile districts to be shut off for five days in order to bring the latest unrest under control.
 
 

Internet services were shut down for months in Manipur during the initial outbreak of violence in 2023, which displaced around 60,000 people from their homes, according to government figures.
Thousands of the state’s residents are still unable to return home owing to ongoing tensions.
Long-standing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities revolve around competition for land and public jobs.
Rights activists have accused local leaders of exacerbating ethnic divisions for political gain.</p><small>2025-06-08 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608243-karachi-braces-for-gusty-winds-amid-heatwave-forecast-in-sindh-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi braces for gusty winds amid heatwave forecast in Sindh, Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

According to the anthropologist Marcel Danesi, once people begin to believe in lies, they are unlikely to change their minds even when confronted with evidence that contradicts their beliefs. Danesi wrote, “They turn the contrasting information on its head, so as to make it fit their beliefs.”
Research in this regard shows that, once a lie is accepted, the brain becomes more susceptible to subsequent lying. So, does this mean one should be resigned to the fact that we will always be surrounded by folk who are only willing to believe what they want to believe? I’m afraid so. 
Supporters of the jailed former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan continue to exchange ‘information’ about his release. They’ve been at it for over two years now. They keep exchanging dates of his ‘triumphant’ release, which never materialises. Yet, this hasn’t dissuaded his supporters from continuing to embrace new ‘information’ about his release and then waiting for another date. 

From Pakistan’s political myth-making to India’s media-fed fantasies of war, the truth is currently struggling against a tide of comforting falsehoods

And when that date too passes without incident, this miss is spun with new ‘information’ in which, supposedly, the establishment and government are desperate to release Khan but he is refusing to come out himself, because he doesn’t want to strike any demeaning ‘deal’ with his opponents. 
Let’s take another case. On the evening of May 9, millions of Indians remained glued to their TV screens and on social media, excitedly applauding what their TV anchors were telling them was happening in Pakistan. Apparently, city after city in Pakistan was falling to the might of the Indian armed forces and a whole province had broken away to declare its independence. The government had fallen and the military chief had been removed.
Of course, this was all hogwash. Wasn’t there even a single significant Indian who bothered to check other news sources? ‘News’ was flooding in from Indian media outlets of one nuclear country effortlessly dismantling another. So didn’t anyone gasping with excitement in India bother to check BBC, CNN, Reuters, Al-Jazeera etc.? All these have correspondents in Pakistan. 
Even when evidence began to emerge that it was India that had suffered millions of dollars’ worth of losses when the Pakistan Air Force shot down at least 5 Indian jets, the Indian media began to spin this as ‘minor losses’ suffered by a ‘giant’. 
There were no apologies by those who went on a feeding frenzy on brazen ‘information’ being relayed to them by their ‘reporters’, and which they shouted out all evening in front of the cameras. 
There are several overlapping factors that are at play in the two examples that I have provided: 
(1) Conformation Bias: people tend to accept information that bolsters their existing beliefs, making them less likely to question or reject misinformation. 
(2) Motivated Reasoning: in an essay for The Washington Post, the journalist Richard Sima wrote that people’s beliefs and desires can influence how they interpret and process information, making them more susceptible to lies that align with their goals or emotions. 
If Khan is not released on the date his supports were ‘informed’ he would be, the likely truth that there was never any plan to release him is understood by his supporters as Khan himself not wanting to be released, because he’s a ‘principled’ man who doesn’t want to cut a deal with his ‘corrupt’ and ‘oppressive’ opponents. 
(3) The Illusory Truth Effect: repeated statements, even false ones, can become more believable over time due to increased familiarity. This propaganda tactic was first perfected by the Nazi regime in Germany. Recently, some Indian anchors confessed to using this ploy when they were caught spreading outright lies about Pakistan’s annihilation. 
But the thing is, their claptrap in this regard was repeated over and over again in a matter of just a few hours and not months/years that it takes for this ploy to effectively achieve its purpose. However, if the purpose was to gain an evening full of TV ratings, then this tactic did work. 
 


Misinformation, when amplified on social media, creates echo chambers, where people are revealed only that information which confirms their biases. In these chambers, people often believe information that aligns with the beliefs of their ‘social/political tribe.’ One saw this on Indian social media when, on May 9, millions of Indians got guzzled by a giant echo chamber and lost all contact with the reality that existed outside.
Truth often seems humdrum compared to a fantastical lie. Lies can trigger strong emotions. They are thus more attractive and compelling than the truth. Indians were told fanciful lies that played out like Bollywood blockbusters. The lies heightened emotions that completely overwhelmed any ability left in most Indians to apply critical thinking. This factor is especially potent if the lies have any relation to a ‘popular’ leader who is adored as a messiah of sorts. 
In India’s case, it is PM Narendra Modi and, in Pakistan’s case, it is Khan. According to the American political historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, once people bond with a populist leader, they may be inclined to dismiss any evidence that conflicts with his claims, or overlook contradictions in his messages. They may know he is lying, but they decide that they don’t care.
 
 

Khan constantly contradicts himself in his statements that are relayed through his party’s X account. Interestingly though, he seems to be petrified that a deal with his opponents will embarrass him in front of his supporters. Truth is, they are likely to spin it into meaning something noble and gallant. 
This is exactly what Modi’s most hardcore fans have also been doing when faced with increasing evidence that Modi’s gambit against Pakistan failed. Instead of believing this, they are trying to spin it as a “victory against terrorism.”
To Ben-Ghiat, investing in media literacy is essential, but so is education about the damages of populist models of power that turn leaders into infallible god-like figures with a network of lies and misinformation.
