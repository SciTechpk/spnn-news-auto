An order issued by the office of South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza stated that the five-member team was constituted for the “arrest of involved accused person(s) and impartial investigation” into the case.
“The investigation team shall make all-out and diligent efforts to arrest the accused person(s) by utilising all available resources,” the notification read.
In a first information report (FIR) of the incident, dated January 23, the Karachi police said the fire was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”.
The case was registered against unknown persons as the police have not nominated anyone in the case.

According to the Monetary Policy Statement released by the State Bank, while headline inflation was 5.6pc in December 2025, core inflation steadied around a higher level of 7.4pc. The committee also noted that the trade deficit had widened due to a substantial increase in imports and a decline in exports.
Brokerage house Topline Securities noted that this “came as a surprise” as a majority of their participants were expecting a rate cut.
Since its last meeting, the committee noted that real GDP growth was provisionally reported at 3.7pc year on year for the first quarter of the FY2026. They also noted that consumer and business confidence improved, and inflation expectations of these stakeholders eased. Furthermore, the State Bank’s forex reserves surpassed the end-December target, reaching $16.1 billion as of January 16, led by SBP’s ongoing forex purchases.
The committee also noted that the IMF had slightly upgraded Pakistan’s global growth forecast for FY2026, while highlighting risks from elevated global tariff uncertainty and volatile commodity prices.
During the last MPC meeting, the central bank revised its benchmark rate to 10.5 per cent, a 50-basis-point reduction, noting that inflation remained within the 5-7 per cent target range on average during July-November of the 2026 fiscal year, though it said core inflation proved relatively sticky.
In a poll by Reuters, analysts expected another 50- to 100-basis-point reduction in the monetary policy rate today, bringing the rate to 9.5 or 10 per cent, owing to easing inflation, rising foreign exchange reserves, and a relatively stable rupee.
Ahead of the rate cut announcement, belief had been strengthened by the government’s reduction of cut-off yields across most tenors to single digits for the first time in four years on January 21.
Local businessmen were looking for a steeper decline in the interest rate to restore investor confidence in the economy.
During the last rate cut, the business community expressed their dismay at the 50 basis point cut, with the president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce expressing that “such a token adjustment falls far short of what is urgently required to revive Pakistan’s fragile economy and restore business confidence.”

DESPITE being invited to join the ‘Board of Peace’ by President Donald Trump, India has yet to formally get involved in the process.
Conspicuous by its absence from the Davos ceremony where 20 world leaders — including Trump and Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif — signed the board’s charter, some in India are viewing New Delhi’s reluctance through the lens of the Kashmir dispute.
President Trump says the board’s goal is to make the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza permanent and oversee an interim government in the Palestinian territory.
“This is not just for America, but for the whole world. I think we can spread it to other places. Like we did successfully in Gaza,” he had said at the time.
But there seems to be concern among some circles that if India signs up for the board — which Trump envisions as a future replacement for the United Nations — it may open up the disputed territory of held Kashmir to broader international or American scrutiny.
Although Trump has repeatedly offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue, especially in the wake of the May 2025 flare-up between the two South Asian rivals, New Delhi has firmly opposed all such overtures thus far.
According to a BBC Hindi report, the ‘Board of Peace’ is being formed at a time when the US is withdrawing from several UN organisations, raising the question of whether the board aims to render the world body irrelevant.
There is also a concern among some circles that the board will only strengthen a unipolar world, a system currently dominated by the US.
In a recent editorial on the issue, The Hindu newspaper painted Pakistan’s decision to join the board as “a warning signal to India”.
The newspaper attributed its alarm to the US president’s propensity to playing the ‘peacemaker’, having already claimed to have solved multiple regional and global conflicts during his first year in office.
“…[I]f Trump decides to include the Kashmir dispute in [his] peace plans, the Peace Board will try to resolve it. Once it joins the board, it will also be difficult for India to object to the deployment of its troops in the international peacekeeping force,” the editorial noted.
Former Indian ambassador to the United Nations, Syed Akbaruddin, recently wrote in the Times of India that the Security Council resolution has determined the term of this board is until Dec 31, 2027, and that it is obliged to report to the Security Council every six months.
This is done to ensure that this temporary arrangement does not turn into a permanent global model, he noted, adding that by contrast, Trump’s peace plan seems to have no set term and “could be used outside Gaza as well”.
He said that some UN officials are also indicating that this framework can be applied to other conflict areas.
But Ranjit Roy, who was India’s ambassador to Nepal and Vietnam, believes that it won’t be easy for New Delhi to take a decision on Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’.
“India’s dilemma has increased. Whether India accepts it or rejects it, it will have an impact. I think the risks of joining the Peace Board are high. First of all, Trump is its chairman and it seems pointless to expect justice from his transactional approach,” BBC Hindi quoted him as saying.
“It is not clear whether each country will have the same status in this,” said Roy.
“Just like in the UN General Assembly, each country has only one vote. When the Security Council approved it, it was limited to Gaza, but now that there have been changes, it could extend beyond Gaza.”
The editorial in The Hindu argued that “the rift in US-India relations and the delicate situation of trade talks may also be reasons for not rejecting Trump’s invitation at this stage. Doing so could incur Trump’s displeasure, as in the case of the French president.”

All three, including the capital’s former police chief, Habibur Rahman, were tried in absentia, and their whereabouts are not known.
The verdict comes ahead of elections on February 12, the first in the South Asian country of 170 million people since Hasina’s overthrow in August 2024.
Five other ex-police officers were sentenced to varying terms.
The case concerned the killing of six protesters in Dhaka on August 5, 2024, the day Hasina fled to India as protesters stormed her palace.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.

 

“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder read to the court in Dhaka.
The court heard how Rahman sent messages to police units ordering the use of lethal force to crush the protests.
Chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said he was satisfied with the verdict against the three men, although he wanted tougher sentences for the five others found guilty who were handed prison terms.
“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told the reporters after the verdict.
In November, the same court also sentenced Hasina — who remains in hiding in India — to death for crimes against humanity. She refused to attend the trial and denies the charges.
In that case, former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was also sentenced to death in absentia after being found guilty of crimes against humanity.
Ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who was in court and had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.</p><small>2026-01-26 10:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/261520498f856f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969168/explainer-why-is-donald-trump-so-interested-in-greenland' target='_blank'><strong>Explainer: Why is Donald Trump so interested in Greenland?</strong></a><br><p>Greenland is a land of snow and ice, home to only 57,000 people. Yet Donald Trump’s desire to control it has caused protests in Greenland itself together with unprecedented tensions with European allies.
And at one point even seemed to risk military confrontation between North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) members.
The US President has now backed down from his threat of tariffs and has ruled out military action. But why is Donald Trump so interested in Greenland?
Here’s what he’s said about it himself: “We need it for strategic national security and international security. And the fact is, no nation or any group of nations is in any position to be able to secure Greenland, other than the United States.”
Greenland’s strategic military location
Greenland, a Danish territory, certainly does occupy a strategic position. It’s at one end of what’s called the G-I-UK gap, between Greenland, Iceland and the UK. Much of Russia’s navy needs to cross this gap to access the Atlantic.
Sitting near the top of the world, Greenland is also on the shortest route between the US and Russia, which could be used by missiles in case of a conflict.
“If there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it. Those missiles would be flying right over the centre of that piece of ice,” said Trump.
Canada, Russia and China in Trump’s calculations
Control of Greenland would also mean that US territory would nearly surround Canada, another country that Trump says he wants to annex.
For Trump, the main threat to Greenland comes from Russia and China. Nato’s top commander agrees they’re stepping up activity in the region.
“We certainly see Russia and China working together. We have had Chinese vessels patrolling with Russia, not only on the north coast of Russia but also north of Alaska and near Canada. And it’s not for peaceful purposes.
They’re not studying the seals and the polar bears,” said Alexus Gregory Grynkewich, the Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe.
Existing US military presence
However, the US has long had a military presence in Greenland, under a Cold War deal first signed in 1951. It still has the Pituffik Space Base, which was visited by US Vice President JD Vance in March 2025.
According to Patrick Schröder of the Chatham House think tank, the US could already have boosted its defences without antagonising its European allies.
“There are existing arrangements between the United States and Denmark that allow the United States to have military bases and facilities and deploy military within Greenland,” he said.
“There’s no need for Greenland to be part of the United States in order to do so. And in the context of Arctic security, there’s a need for close collaboration. Denmark’s foreign minister already indicated he would welcome more US troops and military cooperation to collectively boost security in the Arctic,” said Schröder.
Melting ice and new global trade routes
Another reason Trump could be interested in Greenland is global trade. With temperatures rising, the melting ice is making new shipping routes possible in the Arctic, with some opening up around Greenland.
According to Schröder, China is already actively exploring new shipping routes, which would enable shipments coming to Europe without having gone through the Suez Canal.
“This is maybe also something that President Trump had in mind when he was talking about, if we don’t take Greenland, then China and Russia will. But again, these are two separate issues: there’s no immediate threat of China or Russia taking over Greenland, but they are investing in these new shipping lanes, and this is happening,” he continued.
Rare earth minerals and the green transition
Various sites on the island are also a potential source of rare earth minerals, which may be another temptation for the US.
According to Thomas Varming, Senior Geologist and geophysicist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), many of these deposits that we have are actually crucial for doing this green transition.
“Minerals that have to go into batteries, lithium, graphite, and also elements that go into super-strong magnets that you use in wind turbines or your electric cars or if you want to electrify your trains and stuff like that,” he said. “These are super important.”
Trump denies mineral ambitions
For his part, Donald Trump has denied minerals are part of his calculus, insisting it’s all down to national security – and it’s true that huge investment would be required to make these untapped deposits viable.
The Nobel Peace Prize grievance
Finally, according to Trump himself, his actions have been partly influenced by the fact that he wasn’t awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Last year’s prize went to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. In a message to Norway’s Prime Minister, Trump wrote:
“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace”.
Greenlanders push back
As for Greenlanders themselves, most are firmly against a US takeover, with a 2025 poll showing 85 per cent opposed it.
“Of course, we are not for sale. We are a free people, we have always been free people,” said Greenland resident Aviaq Brand.
“It’s very clear that we want our own country for ourselves and we won’t receive anything from Trump, no matter what,” said another resident, Tikeraq Knudsen.
Greenland Minister for Natural Resources Naaja Nathanielsen said, “We have always welcomed collaboration with the outside world and with the US. And now we are talked about being occupied or bought. It is unacceptable.”
Where things now stand
Trump has now ruled out tariffs and military force, saying he’s reached a framework for a deal with NATO’s secretary general, Mark Rutte:“Really fantastic for the USA. Gets everything we wanted, including especially real national security and international security,” said Trump.
While the details of the deal are still to be worked out, it seems Trump has fallen short of his goal of taking over all of the Danish territory.

Spot gold was up 2.2 per cent at $5,089.78 per ounce by 6:56am GMT, after earlier touching an all-time high of $5,110.50. US gold futures for February delivery also gained the same amount to $5,086.30 per ounce.
The metal soared 64pc in 2025, its biggest annual gain since 1979, driven by safe-haven demand, US monetary policy easing, robust central bank purchases including China’s fourteenth straight month of buying in December, and record inflows into exchange-traded funds.
Prices have set consecutive record peaks over the past week and have already risen more than 18pc this year.
The latest catalyst “is effectively this crisis of confidence in the US administration and US assets, that was set off by some of the erratic decision-making from the Trump administration last week”, said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com.
US President Donald Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs on European allies as leverage to seize Greenland.
Over the weekend, he said he would impose a 100pc tariff on Canada if it followed through on a trade deal with China.
He has also threatened to hit French wines and champagnes with 200pc tariffs, in an apparent effort to pressure French President Emmanuel Macron into joining his Board of Peace initiative. Some observers fear the board could undermine the United Nations’ role as the main global platform for conflict resolution, though Trump has said it will work with the UN.
“This Trump administration has caused a permanent rupture in the way things are done, and so now everyone’s kind of running to gold as the only alternative,” Rodda added.
Meanwhile, a rising yen dragged the dollar broadly lower on Monday, with markets on alert for possible intervention in the yen and investors cutting dollar positions ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
A weaker dollar makes greenback-priced gold more affordable for holders of other currencies.
Analysts expect gold prices to climb further toward $6,000 this year on mounting global tensions as well as strong central-bank and retail demand.
“We expect further upside (for gold). Our current forecast suggests that prices will peak at around $5,500 later this year,” said Philip Newman, director at Metals Focus.
“Periodic pullbacks are likely as investors take profits, but we expect each correction to be short-lived and met with strong buying interest,” Newman added.
Spot silver advanced 4.8pc to $107.903, after hitting a record of $109.44. Spot platinum climbed 3.4pc to $2,861.91 per ounce, after hitting a record high of $2,891.6 earlier in the session, while spot palladium was 2.5pc higher at $2,060.70, having touched a more than three-year high.
Silver climbed above the $100 mark for the first time on Friday, building on its 147pc rise last year as retail-investor flows and momentum-driven buying compounded a prolonged spell of tightness in physical markets for the metal.</p><small>2026-01-26 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2613025303a291d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969161/cold-wave-continues-to-grip-country-as-another-western-disturbance-rolls-in-nwfc' target='_blank'><strong>Cold wave continues to grip country as another western disturbance rolls in: NWFC</strong></a><br><p>The country remained in the grip of a cold wave on Monday, with the National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC) saying that a new western disturbance is likely to persist in upper Pakistan until Tuesday.
The NWFC, in its daily forecast, warned of traffic disruption due to heavy snowfall, causing road closures and slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galiyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noshki, Harnai and Zhob.
It added that there was a risk of landslides and avalanches in the mountainous areas of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
“Tourists are advised to remain extra cautious and avoid unnecessary travelling during the forecast period,” it said.
The NWFC forecast rain, wind, thunderstorms and snowfall in Balochistan, KP, Kashmir and GB on Monday.
According to the forecast, heavy rain and moderate-to-heavy snowfall is also likely at isolated places in south and northeast Balochistan, Kashmir and upper KP, while rain, wind, thunderstorms and snowfall is also expected at isolated places in southern Punjab and upper Sindh.
It added that rain, wind and thunderstorms were likely in Islamabad as well as upper and central Punjab in the evening and night hours of Monday.
On Tuesday, according to the NWFC, rain and snowfall with thunderstorms and strong winds are expected in upper KP, Kashmir, GB and upper Punjab. Heavy rain and moderate-to-heavy snowfall is also likely in isolated parts of Kashmir and upper KP, it said.
“Cold and dry weather is likely in other parts of the country,” the forecast added.

 

The past 24 hours saw cold and dry weather in most parts of the country, with rain and snowfall in northeastern and western Balochistan and upper KP.
The lowest minimum temperature recorded today (as of 10:30am) was -12 degrees Celsius in Leh, followed by -08°C in Kalam and Ziarat.
Relief operations in Orakzai, Kurram
The Pakistan Army carried out relief operations in KP’s Orakzai and Kurram districts amidst heavy rains and snowfall, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Monday.
During heavy snowfall in Orakzai, the army “cleared blocked roads on an emergency basis”, it said.
Meanwhile, in Kurram, which was also severely affected by the snowfall, the Pakistan Army swiftly launched a rescue operation and restored an eight-kilometre road using heavy machinery, the outlet reported.
It said that Manato Sadda road had been completely blocked by heavy snowfall, stranding numerous vehicles.
“Pakistan Army conducted a prompt operation, safely evacuating passengers and vehicles to secure locations,” Radio Pakistan said.
PDMA put on high alert in Balochistan
Meanwhile, Balochistan’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) was put on high alert as rain and snowfall continue to affect parts of the province, state-run APP reported.
It quoted Director of Relief Operations at PDMA Mir Attaullah Mengal as saying that the disaster management authority’s teams had been “fully mobilised since the onset of snowfall and rainfall”. He further said that operations to clear the snow were being carried out even at nights to “prevent road blockages and minimise inconvenience for the public”.
“Timely and effective measures have enabled PDMA to keep all major highways operational despite severe weather conditions. Uninterrupted traffic flow and public safety remain [our] top priorities,” the official said.
He urged the people, particularly travellers and tourists, to avoid unnecessary travel, adopt precautionary measures and cooperate with PDMA and district administration teams to prevent accidents.
“The PDMA has been put on high alert across the province in view of the possibility of further snowfall and adverse weather conditions. The chief minister has directed relevant authorities to submit hourly situation reports while closely monitoring evolving conditions,” Mengal added.
He said that the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre would remain operational 24 hours in the given situation, “performing coordination, monitoring, tracking, and reporting duties, while ensuring the timely provision and effective management of relief resources”.
The director said that during the previous spell of snowfall, the PDMA had “successfully prevented” the closure of major highways and rescued several stranded individuals and vehicles. He added that the PDMA was working in coordination with district administrations and taking all possible measures to deal with any untoward situation.
The APP report further stated that PDMA personnel and machinery had been kept on standby under the supervision of the authority’s director general on the directives of Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and the provincial chief secretary, Shakeel Qadir Khan.
Cold weather predicted for Karachi: PMD
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), in its three-day weather forecast for the Karachi division, predicted partly cloudy weather with chances of light rain in Sukkur, Larkana, Kambar Shahdadkot, Jacobabad and Dadu districts today under the influence of the westerly wave.
It added that partly cloudy and cold/very cold weather were likely to prevail over most of Sindh.
The PMD predicted a high of 21-23°C and a low of 11.5°C today, with 46 per cent humidity during the daytime dropping to 15-25pc in the evening and a northeast/easterly wind.
Cold and dry weather is expected for both Tuesday and Wednesday, with relatively similar temperatures: highs of 21-23°C and 22-24°C and lows of 9-11°C and 10-12°C, respectively.
While the humidity on Tuesday is forecast to remain around 45-55pc, dipping to 20-30pc in the evening, Wednesday will see a higher humidity level of 60-70pc in the daytime and 40-50pc in the evening.
A northeasterly wind on Tuesday will turn northwest/westerly, while a northeast/easterly wind on Wednesday is predicted to turn west/southwesterly.</p><small>2026-01-26 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/26132748ad2baf6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969153/dar-myanmar-fm-hold-very-productive-talks-in-islamabad-as-pakistan-seeks-to-revitalise-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Dar, Myanmar FM hold ‘very productive’ talks in Islamabad as Pakistan seeks to revitalise ties</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Burmese counterpart Than Swe held “very productive and comprehensive” discussions in Islamabad on Monday, as both Pakistan and Myanmar seek to revitalise ties.
FM Than Swe arrived in Islamabad on a four-day official visit on the night of January 24. The Foreign Office (FO) had said the visit “aims to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries”.
Addressing a joint press conference alongside Than Swe, Dar said, “Our discussions were very productive and comprehensive.”
He highlighted that the Burmese FM’s visit reflected the “importance that both countries attach to revitalising and strengthening Pakistan-Myanmar relationship”.







Noting that their meeting went for over an hour, Dar said the discussions covered the “full spectrum of bilateral relations”.
“We also exchanged views on regional peace and security and agreed that all […] issues should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy,” the deputy prime minister added.
He stressed that both countries had historic bonds, adding, “Building on this positive foundation, we agreed to work closely to expand cooperation in all party areas.”
Dar stated that the two leaders undertook a “comprehensive review of bilateral cooperation, including political, commercial, trade and cultural areas, as well as people-to-people exchanges”.
“Both sides noted the significant untapped potential for cooperation and underscored the importance of advancing engagement through sustained, structured and results-oriented initiatives,” he added.
The foreign minister detailed that they agreed to enhance cooperation in capacity-building, development and humanitarian areas.
“The two sides also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation, to facilitate consular assistance to each other’s nationals, particularly the […] victims of scamming gangs,” Dar said, adding that the countries agreed to maintain close coordination through relevant channels to ensure “collective cooperation”.







Dar said he and Than Swe emphasised the importance of further intensifying people-to-people exchanges, closer cooperation through academic linkages, youth engagement, and cultural initiatives.
The deputy premier briefed the visiting dignitary on Pakistan’s “rich Buddhist heritage and highlighted the potential of religious tourism as a means to strengthen cultural ties and promote greater connectivity between our people”.
“Pakistan supports a peaceful, stable and prosperous Myanmar. We are confident that Myanmar can play a very positive role in creating regional reconciliation, shared prosperity and development for all,” Dar said.
He revealed that after their meeting, Islamabad and Naypyidaw signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on political consultations between the foreign offices of the two countries.
“This institutional mechanism will facilitate regular engagement and sustained dialogue on bilateral, regional and international issues,” the foreign minister explained.







FM Than Swe invites Pakistani investors to Myanmar
In his remarks, FM Than Swe highlighted that Pakistan and Myanmar have historically maintained “a very good, friendly relationship”.
“We had many, many good and fruitful discussions, very openly and frankly,” he said.
Highlighting Myanmar’s proximity to Southeast Asia, Than Swe said, “We are the centre of the biggest market of the world. That’s why we would like to invite Pakistani investors and business people to come, see and study the opportunity for cooperation between the two countries.”
The foreign minister stressed the need to enhance “all sectoral cooperation in the future”, including in trade, business, investments, military-to-military, as well as cultural and scientific areas.
“I believe that our meeting today will pave the way for our future cooperation,” Than Swe said.
Besides economic cooperation, he expressed Myanmar’s desire to sign MoUs for the promotion of trade and investments. The minister emphasised the importance of facilitating the business community.
He also took note of the rich heritage both Pakistan and Myanmar have, pointing out possibilities for tourism opportunities between the two nations.

 

During his address, FM Than Swe recalled an interaction between Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Myanmar’s founder Gen Aung San at the time of the latter’s independence.
While the minister acknowledged that Myanmar faced “some kind of conflicts and challenges”, he asserted that no foreign citizens were killed in the past five years.
“That’s why I’d like to ask you to come and see and to try to find opportunities for investment and trade,” he added.
Pakistan hopes Myanmar polls will ‘contribute to stability’
According to a statement by Myanmar’s foreign ministry, Than Swe is also scheduled to hold meetings with other high-ranking officials.
Earlier in the day, Dar welcomed Than Swe at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he highlighted the “longstanding friendship and cooperation” between the two countries.







Dar noted that there had “been a gap” in high-level exchanges, as the last visit from Myanmar’s leadership was in May 2015, while from Pakistan’s side, then-president Asif Ali Zardari had paid a visit in 2012.
“Pakistan remains committed to further strengthening our bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interest through sustained, structured engagement and practical, result-oriented initiatives,” said Dar.

 

He further stated that Pakistan “sincerely desires peace, stability and prosperity for Myanmar and hopes that the forthcoming general elections will contribute to stability, development and inclusive governance”.
Voting in Myanmar’s month-long election concluded on Sunday, with pro-military Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) on course for a landslide victory in the polls.
Noting that bilateral ties between Islamabad and Naypyidaw were “rooted in history and mutual respect”, Dar pointed out that their ambassador was the first to present his credentials to the founder of Pakistan following the country’s independence.
“Our two countries have enjoyed cordial and friendly relations. Pakistan greatly values this partnership and remains keen to further enhance the cooperation across a wide range of mutually beneficial fields,” FM Dar said.
On his part, FM Than Swe said he was “delighted” to visit Islamabad and appreciated the “valuable invitation and hospitality” accorded to him.
Expressing Myanmar’s desire to enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperation, he said, “Before I left my country, I met with many ministers to seek opportunities on how to work together […] They have a keen interest.
“We do believe that this meeting will pave the way for our future cooperation,” the dignitary said.
He further noted that both Pakistan and Myanmar had remained as part of “one country under the British colony for more than one century”.
“They closely fought the war for independence [against] the British.

Reopening Rafah, a vital entry point for aid into Gaza, forms part of a truce framework announced by US President Donald Trump in October, but the crossing has remained closed since Israeli forces took control of it during the conflict in the besieged Palestinian territory.
Visiting US envoys had reportedly pressed Israeli officials to reopen the crossing during talks in Jerusalem over the weekend.
World leaders and aid agencies have repeatedly pushed for more humanitarian convoys to be able to access Gaza, which has been left devastated by more than two years of bombardment and depends on the inflow of essential medical equipment, food and other supplies.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Monday that Israel had agreed to a reopening “for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism”.
The move would depend on “the return of all living hostages and a 100 per cent effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages”, it said on X.







It remained unclear whether the reopening would allow medical patients to leave Gaza for treatment in Egypt or other countries.
The Israeli military said it was searching a cemetery in the Gaza Strip on Sunday for the remains of the last captive, Ran Gvili.
“Upon completion of this operation, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the US, Israel will open the Rafah Crossing,” said Netanyahu’s office.
The announcement came after Gaza’s newly appointed administrator, Ali Shaath, said the crossing would open “in both directions” this week.
“For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate, it is a lifeline and a symbol of opportunity,” Shaath said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.
Israeli media had also reported that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner had urged Netanyahu to reopen Rafah during their Jerusalem talks.
Before the conflict erupted in October 2023, Rafah had been the only gateway connecting Gazans to the outside world and enabling international humanitarian aid to enter the territory, home to 2.2 million people living under Israeli blockade.
Last captive
A spokesman for Hamas’s Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, said on Sunday that the group had “provided mediators with all the details and information in our possession regarding the location of the captive’s body”, referring to Gvili.
Obeida added that “the enemy (Israel) is currently searching one of the sites based on information transmitted by the Al-Qassam Brigades”.
Except for Gvili, all of the 251 people taken captive have been returned, whether living or dead.
A non-commissioned officer in the Israeli police’s elite Yassam unit, Gvili was killed in action on the day of the attack and his body was taken to Gaza.
The first phase of the US-backed ceasefire deal had stipulated that Hamas hand over all the captives in Gaza.
Gvili’s family has expressed strong opposition to launching the second phase of the plan, which includes reopening Rafah, before they have received his remains.
“First and foremost, Ran must be brought home,” his family said in a statement on Sunday.
The Gaza war flattened much of Gaza, a territory that was already suffering severely from previous rounds of fighting and from an Israeli blockade imposed since 2007.
The two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas has left at least 71,657 Palestinians dead in Gaza, according to the territory’s health ministry, figures considered reliable by the United Nations.</p><small>2026-01-26 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/261314448e55ab0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969162/lawyers-stage-protest-outside-ihc-observe-strike-after-sentencing-of-imaan-and-hadi' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers stage protest outside IHC, observe strike after sentencing of Imaan and Hadi</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Lawyers staged a protest on Monday at the main gate of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the arrest and sentencing of lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in the controversial social media posts case.
The protest was led by IHC Bar President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani.
Senior lawyer Babar Awan and a large number of advocates from the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC), High Court Bar and District Bar also participated in the protest. They carried banners reading “Justice for Lawyers” and raised slogans against the police.
Addressing the gathering, Awan said that “state and police terrorism” was being carried out against lawyers, adding that such actions were harmful for society.
Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA), IBC and Islamabad District Bar jointly announced a strike. However, lawyers appeared in the high court only in urgent matters.
Due to the protest, strict security arrangements were made in and around the IHC, with a heavy police contingent deployed and armoured vehicles stationed outside the court premises.
The issue of the strike also came up during the hearing of a civil case before Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar. Advocate Qaiser Abbas Gondal informed the court that the bar had called for a strike due to the arrest of lawyers.
When the chief justice asked which lawyers had been arrested, Gondal replied that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha had been taken into custody. The chief justice then asked whether they were considered lawyers. No reply was given.
CJ Dogar observed that if the bar considered them lawyers, their representatives could convey their position in chambers.
Due to the lawyers’ strike, proceedings in several cases were affected.
In a separate statement, IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Jajja said lawyers were requested not to appear in court as part of the strike. He announced that lawyers would proceed to the district courts in a convoy and later gather again to record their protest.
On Saturday, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in the case.
The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad.
The NCCIA complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.</p><small>2026-01-26 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647246-gul-plaza-to-be-sealed-today-as-demolition-operation-begins' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza to be sealed today as process operation begins</strong></a><br><p>

The president, accompanied by a high-level delegation, will undertake the visit from January 26 to 29, the FO statement said.
“During the visit, the president will hold high-level meetings with the UAE’s leadership to review the full spectrum of bilateral ties, especially on the domains of trade and economic people-to-people ties.”







The discussion will also focus on regional and international issues of mutual interest, the FO added.
It highlighted that Zardari’s trip, which follows the brief visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Pakistan last month, “reflects the deep brotherly ties between the two nations and reaffirms commitment to transforming the strong friendship between Pakistan and the UAE into a mutually rewarding partnership”.
During the UAE president’s first official visit to Pakistan on December 26, the leadership of the two countries held “substantive talks” focused on further strengthening the longstanding bilateral relations.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Al Nahyan also met in Rahim Yar Khan on December 30, where they both discussed ways to enhance cooperation in a wide range of sectors.
On January 13, the two countries agreed to sign a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals visiting the Gulf country.</p><small>2026-01-26 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/261225273ce47e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969158/president-xi-says-india-china-are-friends-partners' target='_blank'><strong>President Xi says India, China are ‘friends, partners’</strong></a><br><p>China’s President Xi Jinping said Beijing and New Delhi were “good neighbours, friends and partners” as he wished Indian President Droupadi Murmu congratulations on the South Asian nation’s Republic Day, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Monday.
Xi said that over the past year, China-India relations have continued to improve and develop and are of “great significance for maintaining and promoting world peace and prosperity,” according to Xinhua.
Xi said China has always believed that being “good neighbours, friends and partners” is the right choice for both China and India.
He referred to China and India as the “dragon and the elephant dancing together,” Xinhua said.
Xi said he hoped that both sides would expand exchanges and cooperation and address each other’s concerns to promote healthy and stable relations.
The nuclear-armed Asian neighbours share a 3,800 km border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s.
Ties between the countries were shaken by a 2020 clash in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat. After that, the Himalayan border was heavily militarised by both sides.
Both countries began improving ties last year after staging a series of high-level bilateral visits.
Direct flights resumed in 2025 as both countries stepped up trade and investment flows against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s combative foreign policy.</p><small>2026-01-26 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2612383845f4a9c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969156/kse-100-crosses-191000-points-in-record-breaking-rally' target='_blank'><strong>KSE-100 crosses 191,000 points in record-breaking rally</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, was up 1,354.59 points, or 0.72 per cent, at 190,521.41 as of 12pm today, building on the previous close of 189,166.82.
Mid-session trading saw the index fluctuate within a defined range, hitting a high of 191,032.73 and a low of 189,712.78, indicating measured buying interest.
Investors appear to be positioning for a further cut in the policy rate, which stands at 10.5pc, during the State Bank of Pakistan’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting today amid easing inflation, rising foreign exchange reserves and a stable rupee.
At its treasury bills auction on January 21, the government reduced cut-off yields across most tenors to single digits for the first time in four years, strengthening the notion that the central bank is set to cut the benchmark rates.
Activity levels were strong, with 171.3 million shares changing hands by noon and market value turnover reaching approximately 23.0 billion.
With the market still open, attention will turn to afternoon flows for signals on whether the midday gains can be extended into the close.

The MV Trisha Kerstin 3 issued a distress signal around 1:50am (10:50pm PKT Sunday), a bit over four hours after it departed the Port of Zamboanga City on the southwestern tip of Mindanao, the coast guard said in a statement.
Video released by the governor of Basilan province showed barefoot survivors being wrapped in blankets and placed on gurneys, while victims of the sinking were carried past in body bags.
The triple-decker vessel went down on nearly the same route where 31 people died in 2023 after a fire aboard the Lady Mary Joy 3 ferry. Both ships were owned by locally based Aleson Shipping Lines.
At least 317 people have so far been rescued, according to the most recent tally by the Philippine Coast Guard, with 18 confirmed dead and 24 still unaccounted for amid an ongoing search-and-rescue operation.
Sheryl Balondo, a rescuer in Isabela City, one of two municipalities where survivors were being taken, said their office had received more than 100 phone calls from concerned family members.

“There’s a tug in our hearts whenever we pick up a call. Their voices sounded worried,” she said. “What we can only say is that, as of now, we don’t have the final list (of names), because the search and retrieval operation is ongoing.”
The 44-metre ferry went down about five kilometres east of Baluk-Baluk Island, part of the Basilan province chain of islands off the Zamboanga peninsula.
“Based on the account of some survivors, the waters in the area were rough at the time,” Philippine Coast Guard spokeswoman Noemie Cayabyab said in a televised interview.
Short-staffed rescuers
Basilan emergency responder Ronalyn Perez told AFP that rescuers were struggling to handle the influx of survivors.
“The challenge really is the number of patients that are coming in. We are short-staffed at the moment,” Perez said in an interview, adding that at least 18 had been brought to one local hospital.
Video released by the Philippine Coast Guard showed survivors being plucked from the water and receiving medical attention.
Some could be heard shouting for help in the dark in a live video on Facebook.
“We cannot say for now the reason of the sinking, but we were instructed to conduct a marine casualty investigation to determine the cause,” Romel Dua, a coast guard commander from southern Mindanao, told AFP. “As of now, we are focused on the rescue.”
Survivors were being brought to the coast guard stations in Zamboanga and Isabela City, he added.
In its statement, the coast guard said the ferry had not been overloaded.
“Our thoughts and hearts are with everyone who was on board,” Aleson Shipping Lines said in a statement, adding they were “working tirelessly” in close coordination with the coast guard.
The archipelago nation of 116 million has a long history of disasters involving the inter-island ferries that ply its seas.
Many rely on cheap and poorly regulated boats and ships for transport between the country’s more than 7,000 islands, despite regular accidents.
A 2015 ferry capsizing off the western coast of Leyte Island resulted in more than 60 deaths.
In 1987, the Dona Paz ferry collided with an oil tanker in a pre-Christmas accident that claimed more than 4,000 lives. It was the world’s worst peacetime disaster at sea.</p><small>2026-01-26 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/261046003b919d6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969119/lawyers-legal-experts-dissect-27th-amendment-highlight-its-issues' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers, legal experts dissect 27th Amendment, highlight its issues</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Lawyers and legal experts sat together in a session, The State of Constitution: the 27th Amendment, on the last day of Afkar-e-Taza ThinkFest to dissect the recent amendment to the Constitution.
Lawyer Asad Rahim Khan said the 27th Amendment should be seen in relation to the 26th Amendment as it was a plan to do away with another plan.
“From 2009 until 2023, or from the restoration of Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry to the retirement of Justice Umar Ata Bandial, this period is considered an era of independent judiciary whether you praise it or criticise it, the authority that was used during this period was unprecedented in the history of Pakistan. The 26th Amendment reversed it.”

 

Khan said the executive or the government used to decide appointments of judges from 1947 until the lawyers movement in the Musharraf era when it was decided the appointments would be made by the commission whose majority would consist of judges.
“As per the 26 Amendment, the majority of judicial commission consisted of non-judicial members and the government’s say was prevalent but the 27th Amendment went a step further for the Constitutional Court.”
He said after the 27th Amendment, the appellate courts could now take only rent and family cases and all basic rights like right to opinion, right to vote and right movement would be heard by the federal constitutional court, selected by the executive.







“Its objectives were stated to be to end the pendency of cases, maintain seniority of judges, and constitutional matters would be heard by the judges having expertise in the constitution,” he added that pendency in the Supreme Court was only 2.8pc.
Regarding the seniority of judges, he said, the chief justice of the federal constitution court was not the senior most, chief justice of Pakistan was also not the senior most, the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court was not the senior most and he was called from the Lahore High Court to Islamabad to make him the senior most judge. The third objective of the amendment was stated to be expertise but a majority of judges in the federal constitutional court had expertise in criminal or civil cases only.
Asad Rahim Khan said there were some cases which, though were in favour of the state, were not liked by the government like the ‘90 days case’, army courts and letter of the judges of the Islamabad High Court, the amendment was brought keeping these developments in mind.

 

“The federal constitutional court’s decisions are binding on all courts but the decisions of the supreme court are not binding on the constitutional court. You decimated the authority of the Supreme Court with just a stroke of pen,” he declared.
Lawyer Abdul Moiz Jafri said the amendment was introduced just to capture power. He endorsed the arguments of Asad, saying that on the excuse of expertise, the ‘unwanted judges’ were being transferred away from the centre, adding that the intent behind the amendment was the capture and subjugation. “They wanted to dismantle the ecosystem of democracy.”
Lawyer Reema Omer referred to the ‘revolutionary legality’ principle of Austrian jurist Hans Kelsen and in Pakistan that concept was used to give legitimacy to the martial law, which meant that after the revolution, a dictator could do anything as per his whims and it would get legitimacy.
“In Pakistan, Hans Kelsen was used for the same purpose many years back.” The idea of Kelsen is also behind the constitutional court which said that “the dogma of parliamentary supremacy must be defeated” and there should be an order beyond the parliament and executive to see whether the parliament was following the constitution.
“When 27th Amendment was passed, law minister Azam Tarar said that time’s gone when prime ministers would be hanged or sent packing but actually the constitutional court’s objective was to introduce an order to check the parliament”.

 

She said the 27th Amendment did not remove Section 62 (1) (F) that was used to remove Nawaz and Yusuf Raza Gilani from the PM office. “The same provisions could still be used to remove the current PM.” She said people were tricked that the constitutional court was being introduced for supremacy of the parliament while in fact it was a check on the parliament.
Irfan Qadir had a different view from the rest of the panel, saying that the judiciary had got what it deserved and that he had been saying for a long time that the judiciary would have to reap what it was sowing. The purpose right now was to rein in a totally free judiciary that was going beyond its limits, he said and added that it was not the objective of the constitution that the judiciary would subjugate the parliament and the executive, and remove majority of judges at will.
He said the judges were made at the will of the government and parliamentary leaders were being removed, the PMs were being sent home. He referred to the scathing statements of Ali Ahmed Kurd, Aitzaz Ahsan and Salman Raja against the judiciary. He added that earlier the judges tried to harm the practice of lawyers, including his own, and one chief justice was throwing the phone and misbehaving and lawyers were all silent.
Salman Akram Raja said after the February 2024 election, the powers that be realised the need to hide “the lie” after the election and this new law was tailor-made to do that. The earlier judiciary had the power to review the decisions and it was doing the same when military courts were introduced which were challenged and the Supreme Court also gave a verdict against them.
“After the election, there was an issue of reserved seats of women which they did not want to give to the PTI and PTI’s members were declared the independent candidates”. According to Mr Raja, election, military court and reserved seats were the reasons behind the 26th and 27th amendments and they were just an attempt to end democracy and dismantle the PTI.
Salman said every lawyer knew what happened to those judges who were fair and ensured justice. He said there was the rule of the jungle and anybody could be given any punishment while the 27th Amendment was a stamp on this era of subjugation. He declared that his party would continue its fight against this system.
Lawyer Feisal Naqvi also spoke.

Winter storm warnings were posted for most of the eastern third of the United States covering 118 million people, as the deep freeze strained energy supplies in some areas, and the National Weather Service predicted widespread, prolonged travel disruptions.







An estimated 157 million Americans were warned to bundle up against cold ranging from sub-zero temperatures along the Canadian border to below-freezing as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.
The Arctic blast was accompanied by gusty conditions that sent wind-chill conditions a measure of how cold it feels based on the rate of heat loss from the body plunging as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern Plains.
Deep snow, thick ice
Some of the heaviest snowfall, up to one foot or more since the storm developed on Friday, was measured on Sunday in parts of Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had mobilized National Guard troops in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley to assist with the state’s emergency storm response.

The onslaught of snow, ice and winds hit air travel especially hard, with major carriers forced to cancel more than 11,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday, according to an industry tracking service FlightAware.com.Ronald Reagan National Airport, located in northern Virginia just across the Potomac River from Washington, was effectively closed altogether.
Airports serving other major metropolitan areas, including New York, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina, had at least 80% of their Sunday flights canceled, FlightAware data showed.Power outages were widespread across the South, where freezing rain deposited layers of ice up to an inch thick, toppling tree limbs and transmission lines.







More than 1 million homes and businesses in eight states from Texas to the Carolinas were without electricity at the height of the storm on Sunday, according to utility data posted online. Tennessee bore the greatest brunt of energy cuts, accounting for about a third of all the outages. More than 800,000 electricity customers remained without power as of 0229 GMT, according to PowerOutage.us.
Federal, state governments declare emergencies
In parts of the mid-Atlantic, heavy snow early in the day gave way to sleet and freezing rain, adding to treacherous driving conditions and making it more difficult for street crews to safely clear road surfaces.

Heavy ice was reported by the weather service to be accumulating across the interior sections of the Eastern seaboard as far south as Atlanta, as the low-pressure system driving the storm moved through the Appalachian Mountains.
Calling the storm “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations for a dozen states, mostly in the mid-South. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia declared weather emergencies on Saturday.
The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.
On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.
While the storm system was expected to drift away from the East Coast into the Atlantic on Monday, more Arctic air was forecast to rush in behind it, prolonging bitter cold, icy conditions over the next few days, the weather service said.
“The situation with this storm is pretty unique, just because it’s going to stay cold for a period of time,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on the “Fox News Sunday Briefing” program. “This ice that has fallen will keep those (power) lines heavy, even if they haven’t gone down immediately.”</p><small>2026-01-26 05:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647213-pakistani-citizen-returns-home-after-25-years-in-indian-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani citizen returns home after 25 years in Indian jail</strong></a><br><p>

Police recovered weapons and ammunition from the killed militants.
According to police officials, the police vehicle was on routine patrol when assailants, who were lying in ambush, suddenly opened indiscriminate fire on the police party.
A heavy exchange of fire continued between the police and the terrorists for approximately twenty minutes. Additional contingents, including an armored personnel carrier (APC), Quick Response Force (QRF), and Rapid Response Force (RRF), were immediately dispatched from Police Lines Bannu to the scene.
During the subsequent search operation, the bodies of two militants were recovered and taken into police custody.
Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and District Police Officer Yasir Afridi confirmed the incident and appreciated the Domel police for their timely and effective response.
Police officials stated that operations against anti-state elements will continue unabated to ensure peace and security in the district.
A day earlier, a peace committee member in Bannu district was shot dead in a targeted killing near an Afghan refugee camp, while his cousin sustained serious injuries.
Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.</p><small>2026-01-26 04:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647199-centre-kp-trade-blame-over-tirah-evacuation-as-cm-afridi-says-people-were-forced' target='_blank'><strong>Centre, KP trade blame over Tirah evacuation as CM Afridi says people were 'forced'</strong></a><br><p>

The demonstration, staged outside Muzaffarabad Press Club under the aegis of Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK) — an organisation of post-1989 Kashmiri refugees — was aimed at drawing attention to the Indian occupation machinery’s brutal acts in the held territory and the enforcement of a slew of draconian laws.
Posters and banners depicting various forms of repression in occupied Jammu and Kashmir were displayed at the venue of the sit-in where participants raised slogans against India’s sham democracy and the continued subjugation of Kashmiris. 
Right to self-determination 
They demanded their internationally recognised right to self-determination, and also called on the United Nations (UN) to intervene.

Kashmiri refugees stage sit-in, urge international community to intervene 

“Down with India’s farcical democracy” and “UNO, wake up and come to our rescue” were among the slogans chanted.
Addressing the gathering, PHJK chairman Uzair Ahmed Ghazali said India’s decision of August 5, 2019 had not only stripped Kashmiris of their political status but had also deprived them of their all human, social and democratic rights.
He said thousands of Kashmiris demanding the inalienable right to self-determination had been killed in extrajudicial actions, while youths continued to be targeted in staged encounters.
“While Muhammad Maqbool Butt and Muhammad Afzal Guru were sent to the gallows despite their innocence, several Hurriyat leaders died in custody due to systematic torture,” he said.
‘Serious war crimes’
“India is a terrorist state and its savage military apparatus is using black laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, Public Safety Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act with impunity to collectively punish Kashmiris,” he added.
Mr Ghazali pointed out that sexual violence against women was being used as a weapon of war by Indian forces, resulting in thousands of widows and orphans, and added that mass graves were evidence of ‘serious war crimes’.
Other speakers said demographic changes, land seizures, curbs on religious and cultural expression and a prolonged media blackout had turned occupied Kashmir into an open prison, where residents were living under curfews and security restrictions amid a heavy troop presence.
The organisers urged the UN and the international community to take notice of the situation in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, seek independent investigations into grave violations and facilitate the implementation of UN resolutions granting Kashmiris the right to self-determination.
Prominent among those who participated in the sit-in were Ghulam Mehdi Dar, Usman Ali Hashim, Faisal Farooq Sheikh, Iqbal Yaseen Awan, Muhammad Fayaz Khan, Khawaja Muhammad Sadiq, Muhammad Younis Mir, Muhammad Aslam Inqalabi, Muhammad Ashfaq Kashmiri, Imtiaz Khan and Syed Khalid Shah.

LAHORE/ ISLAMABAD: Incarcera­ted former Punjab health minister Dr Yasmin Rashid has criticised the provincial government’s decision to mandate body-worn cameras for nurses and frontline hospital staff, warning the move will compromise medical confidentiality and erode patient trust.
In a message relayed from Kot Lakhpat Jail through PTI leader and lawyer Shayan Bashir on Sunday, Ms Rashid argued that introducing continuous audio-visual recording in clinical environments risks fundamentally altering the relationship between medics and patients.
“Patients disclose personal information — physical, psychological, reproductive and familial — precisely because medical spaces are protected from exposure and surveillance,” Ms Rashid said.
“Even when recordings are not misused, the knowledge that one is being recorded can change patient behaviour, suppress honest disclosure, and discourage vulnerable populations from seeking timely care.”
The Punjab government recently announced the camera initiative, framing it as a measure for transparency and accountability in response to public dissatisfaction with state hospitals.
However, Ms Rashid asserted that authorities have chosen “surveillance over reform”.
“Hospitals are not police stations,” she said. “They are spaces where people disclose their most intimate fears, illnesses and vulnerabilities.”
A gynaecologist by profession, Ms Rashid expressed particular alarm regarding the policy’s impact on women’s health services. She stated that childbirth and gynaecological care involve physical exposure and emotional fragility, arguing that recording in such settings crosses a red line.
“No circular, no SOP, no press conference can undo the damage caused when a woman feels watched instead of cared for,” she stated.
Ms Rashid also questioned the administrative execution of the decision, noting there was no meaningful consultation with nurses, doctors’ associations, or patient-rights groups.
She raised structural concerns regarding data privacy, asking who would own the footage, how long it would be stored, and whether patients could refuse recording.
“In a system where data protection is weak and political misuse of information is not hypothetical, these are not technical gaps but structural dangers,” Rashid said.

 

To illustrate the ethical weight of privacy, Ms Rashid cited the historical example of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, whose serious illness was kept confidential during the Pakistan Movement.
She noted that this was an ethical judgement rooted in the understanding that medical privacy can carry consequences far beyond the individual.
The former minister contended that cameras are being used to scapegoat staff.
She noted that issues such as staff shortages, medicine stock-outs, and broken equipment cannot be solved by surveillance. Instead, she called for patient exit interviews, independent grievance redressal, and training for paramedical staff in patient rights and de-escalation.
“Healthcare reform is slow and often invisible. Surveillance is quick and headline-friendly,” she stated. “But a government that confuses the two is not fixing healthcare. It is managing optics while trust quietly collapses.”
Mr Bashir confirmed that the message was dictated during his legal visit with the former minister. He added that the party plans to continue its agitation for the release of former PM Imran Khan.
Previously, there appeared to be agreement among healthcare workers and officials interviewed by Dawn that the policy may be unsustainable, could infringe on privacy, might be incompatible with medical professions, and potentially catastrophic.
Pakistan Medical Association President Dr Izhar Ahmed Chaudhry conveyed his incredulity to Dawn, asserting that the proposed action would be an ineffective method for healthcare improvement and will harm the government’s image.
For Young Doctors Association (YDA) Punjab President Dr Shoaib Niazi, the decision was a “useless act” for which the association was “not consulted”.
“The footage will go to the IT department, and anyone can access it without patients’ consent,” Dr Niazi said.

LAHORE: The provinces have little incentive to improve the collection of three major taxes as they continue to receive an adequate share from the federal government under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, prominent officials and economic experts said on Sunday.
“The provinces are mainly collecting three major taxes — sales tax on services, agriculture income tax and property tax,” Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said, adding that they were performing “poorly” in all these areas.
He was speaking at a session titled ‘NFC, Governance and the Crisis of Money’ on the concluding day of the ThinkFest event held here.
Former finance minister Miftah Ismail opened the session as moderator and informed the participants on the distribution of funds under the NFC award.
He said 57.5 per cent of the total federal government revenues were transferred to the provinces. In addition, the federation gives one per cent of revenues to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for combating terrorism and also supports the Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan governments financially.
He said sales tax on goods was still collected by the federation, while tax on services was the responsibility of the provinces.
FBR chief Langrial appreciated the provinces for improvements in governance, including cleanliness and other development initiatives.
However, he was critical of their performance in terms of tax collection.
“I will tell you the numbers. Of the total agriculture income tax base of Rs3.7 trillion, the provinces are collecting just Rs8.4 billion,” he said.
He said property tax collection by provinces stood at only 0.08 per cent of GDP in Pakistan, compared to 5pc in Malaysia, 3pc in Indonesia and 2pc in India.
He added that per capita property tax collection in Lahore was Rs623, against Rs1,276 in Chandigarh.
“In Karachi, the per capita tax collection amounts to just Rs111, whereas in Bangalore it stands at Rs11,233,” he said.
Mr Langrial said provinces needed to collect more taxes as their revenue gap was too much, while the federation should also minimise its expenses.
Economist Savail Hussain said transfers from the federation to provinces continued rising from 2001 to 2009, but outcomes in terms of the Human Development Index (HDI), except in Balochistan, remained below the mark.
“At present, we have a public finance crisis that can only be overcome if both the federation and provinces sit together and make the NFC performance-based,” he said.
Asad Sayeed, a member of the 2009 NFC, said all stakeholders had agreed to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to 13.5pc by 2015, but the FBR had crossed only 10pc so far.
Privatisation
In another session, speakers discussed the government’s ongoing privatisation of state-owned enterprises. The session, titled ‘Privatisation: An Easier Route or Structural Change’, was moderated by Ms Rahat Kaunain Hassan.
The speakers included Privatisation Commission Chairman Muhammad Ali and Arif Habib Group CEO Nasim Beg, while former Privatisation Commission chairman Muhammad Zubair also spoke.
Mr Beg said the consortium that recently won the bidding for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) would focus on reviving international operations and improving domestic services despite facing a massive competition.
PC Chairman Muhammad Ali dispelled the impression that valuable PIA land would be transferred to the bidder, saying only international and domestic offices would be taken over.
Mr Zubair asked why PIA was not privatised in 2023 and 2024 despite similar bid prices, and raised concerns over the recent appointment of a new chairman despite the privatisation process.

Federal agents shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, less than three weeks after an Immigration and Cus­toms Enforcement (ICE) officer killed Renee Good, also 37.
While the Department of Homeland Security said Pretti carried a pistol and ammunition, cellphone footage has challenged the government’s description.
Minnesota Gov Tim Walz called the shooting “horrific” and demanded state authorities take charge.
“The federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period,” Walz told a news conference.
Pretti’s parents described him as a “kindhearted soul” and disputed the official narrative.
“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” they said in a statement. “Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked.”
Dimitri Drekonja, a colleague at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital, said Pretti was a nurse working “to support critically ill Veterans.”
Political fallout spread to Was­hington, with Sen Bill Cassidy, a Republican, writing on X that the credibility of ICE and DHS is at stake.
“There must be a full joint federal and state investigation,” Cassidy wrote. “We can trust the American people with the truth.”







Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged President Donald Trump to end the immigration operation.
“This is a moment to act like a leader,” Frey said. “Put Min­neapolis, put America first in this moment — let’s achieve peace.”
The incident also drew condemnation at the Sundance Film Festival.
Olivia Wilde said the shooting was “unfathomable.” “I can’t bel­i­eve that we’re watching people get murdered in the street,” she told AFP at “The Invite” premiere.
“These brave Americans who have stepped out to protest the injustice of these ICE quote/unquote ‘officers,’ and watching them be murdered — it’s unfathomable. We cannot normalise it.” Natalie Portman became emotional as she described her feelings about a “horrible day”.
“What is happening in our country is just obscene,” she told AFP.
Gun rights advocates voiced concern over the administration linking Pretti’s legal gun possession to an intent to harm. After a federal prosecutor suggested shooting armed protesters is often justified, the National Rifle Association called the sentiment “dangerous and wrong”.
The Gun Owners of America added, “The Second Amendment protects Americans’ right to bear arms while protesting — a right the federal government must not infringe upon.”
Barack and Michelle Obama on Sunday forcefully condemned the killing of Pretti, saying in a joint statement it should be a “wake-up call” that core US values “are increasingly under assault.”
The former president and first lady blasted Trump and his government as seeming “eager to escalate the situation,” demanding they work with Walz and other local officials.

CAIRO: In another violation of the US-brokered ceasefire, Israeli troops killed two more Palestinians in the Tuffah neighbourhood in the northern Gaza Strip on Sunday, and an Israeli drone wounded four others in a separate incident in Gaza City, local health authorities said. On Saturday, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians, two of them teenagers, in two drone attacks in Gaza.
Medical workers said an Israeli drone exploded on the rooftop of a multi-floor building in Gaza City, wounding four Palestinians in the street nearby.
There was no comment by the Israeli military on either incident.
Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the indiscriminate Israeli bombing.
The Gaza health ministry says more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israeli fire since then.
It says that at least 480 people were killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire agreement came into effect last October.
Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory’s administration.
Meanwhile, in Khan Younis, over a hundred people attended the funeral of a person who was killed by Israeli drone attack on Saturday, after holding special prayers in front of his white-shrouded body at the morgue in Nasser Hospital.
“They are liars, there is no ceasefire,” said Fares Erheimat, a relative of the dead man, during the funeral.
Ransom case
Israeli military said on Sunday it had launched an investigation into a soldier who reportedly fabricated a kidnapping of a Palestinian detainee and demanded ransom from his family.
The Palestinian man had been detained at a holding facility when a military police guard photographed him and sent the image to his family, falsely claiming he had been kidnapped, the Times of Israel reported.
In a separate report, Israeli Army Radio said the soldier demanded the family transfer money in exchange for his release.
Confirming the case, the military said an investigation had been launched but declined to provide details.
US envoys, Netanyahu discuss Rafah
US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reopen the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt during talks in Jerusalem, Israeli media reported Sunday.
The reports came after a newly appointed administrator for Gaza said on Thursday that the crossing would be operational in both directions next week.
Israeli news site Ynet reported, citing an unnamed Israeli official, that while the meeting between Netanyahu, Witkoff and Kushner was “positive”, Witkoff pressed Israel to reopen Rafah even before Hamas returns remains of the last Israeli prisoner believed to be held in Gaza.
According to the official, Witkoff also raised the possibility of Turkiye playing a role in Gaza’s future.
“Witkoff pushed to bring our greatest rival, Turkiye, to our border,” the official was quoted as saying.
The official also accused Witkoff of acting on behalf of Doha, saying he had “become a lobbyist for Qatari interests”, according to Ynet.
US officials’ discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the second phase of President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza were constructive, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday.
“The United States and Israel maintain a strong and longstanding relationship built on close coordination and shared priorities. The discussion was constructive and positive, with both sides aligned on next steps and the importance of continued cooperation on all matters critical to the region,” Witkoff said in an X post. The talks were held on Saturday, he said.

The decision comes in the wake of recent engagements and approvals for extending the Prime Minister’s Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP), valued at about Rs40 billion, to three federally administered territories: the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), launched earlier this month.
Against this backdrop, internal proposals to include the population of Sindh’s impoverished Tharparkar district under the SSP were not supported.
It was argued during meetings of the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) and the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), on the recommendation of a special committee constituted by the prime minister, that the inclusion of a single district would open the door for similar demands from other provinces, even though health is a devolved subject, documents seen by Dawn show.

Centre asks provinces to move towards contributory health insurance

At a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister on Jan 2, the continuation of the programme beyond June 30, 2025, was approved until June 30, 2027 “for AJK, GB and ICT only”, according to a Prime Minister’s Office directive dated Jan 9, 2026.
Subsequently, the modified programme with a revised capital cost of Rs40.2bn was approved by the Ecnec “in light of the prime minister’s directive for the continuity of the programme beyond 30-06-2025 till 30-06-2027 for all permanent resident families of AJK, GB and ICT under universal health coverage (UHC) scope”.
Under an earlier decision of Ecnec of Aug 7, 2025, a special committee led by the planning minister to review the entire SSP since its inception in 2015 and way forward noted that the health programme had completed its life on June 30, 2025, after availing multiple revisions and time extensions. “There­fore, the programme should be shifted to the current budget,” the committee said.
It also directed the Ministry of National Health Services to submit a Project Completion (PC-IV) report and propose a thin structure to sustain activities and provide indoor healthcare services and protection from catastrophic health expenditures for vulnerable populations. The committee said this limited scope was in line with the programme’s original intent at the time of its launch.
The committee said that “provinces, AJK and GB should continue their own social health protection schemes for the vulnerable populations”.
The committee opposed the inclusion of “provincial districts via SSP” due to the fact that health was a devolved subject, and “if we start in one province, then there will be demand from other provinces too. Therefore, the provinces should implement their social health protection programmes for the vulnerable populations through their own budgets”.
It also cited the reduced Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), which it said was already overstretched and unable to meet even the most critical federal liabilities.
The committee, however, recommended that after conversion of the completed project to the recurrent budget, the health ministry should, with provinces, design a pilot project on an affordable basis through “claim co-payments” on the pattern of Punjab, and a roadmap towards a full-fledged Social Health Insurance (SHI) on a contributory basis should be looked into.
The original SSP was approved on Feb 7, 2018, under the Prime Minister’s National Health Programme Phase-II at a cost of Rs34bn.
It aimed to cover the entire population living below the poverty line, based on a 32.5 Poverty Means Test (PMT) score or an income threshold of $2 per day, using the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) database, with provinces contributing the secondary-care premium for their beneficiary families.
The national project exp­anded in subsequent revisions and extensions. In August 2019, all provinces except Balochistan were excluded from contributing to the priority-care treatment premium, with the federal government citing the spirit of the 18th Amendment under which both the health mandate and budgets were devolved to provinces. The programme ended on June 30, 2025.

WASHINGTON: A high-level Pakistani parliamentary delegation have urged US lawmakers this week to remove their country from a list of nations subject to str­ict immigration visa res­tri­ct­ions, calling the current classification a significant hur­dle in diplomatic relations.
Led by Senators Saleem H. Mandviwalla and Rana Mahmoodul Hassan, the delegation travelled to Washington to strengthen legislative ties and address specific bilateral concerns. Expe­rts from various sectors, inc­luding trade and business, were also part of the group.
The central focus of the dialogue was Pakistan’s inclusion among 75 nations whose citizens face heightened scrutiny and difficulties obtaining visas.
“Pakistan’s inclusion in the list of 75 countries whose nationals face visa difficulties is a serious issue,” Mr Mandviwalla said. “We hope this will soon be resolved and Pakistan’s name will be removed.”
To bolster their argument, Mr Man­dviwalla cited advice from the US amb­assador in Islamabad, who suggested clarifying to members of Congress that Pakistani Americans typically do not rely on social welfare benefits.
Dr Gholam Mujtaba, whose Pakistan Policy Institute USA organised the visit, noted that the diaspora is among the 10 most prosperous demographic groups in the United States.
“I raised this key point with the lawmakers,” Mr Mandviwalla said. “They understood our position, and after these talks, I can say with confidence that Pakistan will be removed from the list.”
The delegation met US lawmakers at the Rayburn House Office Building as part of an Inter-Parlia­mentary Group session. Rep. Estes praised the delegates for their efforts to bridge the legislative bodies. He also acknowledged Pakistan’s cooperation with peace initiatives, including early support for President Donald Trump’s Gaza Peace Board.
The delegation also met Rep. Al Green (DTX), Rep. Tom Suozzi (DNY), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (DNJ), and Rep. Laura Gillen (DNY).

 

A significant diplomatic outcome was an agreement by Green to form a Pakistan Strategic Bipartisan Cau­cus, intended to foster deeper strategic cooperation and sustained dialogue between the two nations’ legislatures.
During the meetings, the senators emphasised that their visit was strictly non-political. This distinction was made to address concerns from US officials regarding recent lobbying activities on Capitol Hill linked to supporters of former prime minister Imran Khan.
Senator Hassan noted that the delegation’s purpose was “constructive engagement, not politics”.
Beyond immigration, the officials discussed economic cooperation and Pakistan’s role in counterterrorism and regional stability. Mr Mandviwalla argued that reliance on executive channels alone is insufficient for a robust partnership.
“Relations must also thrive at the parliamentary level,” Mr Mandviwalla said. The delegation also discu­ssed economic and development cooperation, emphasising that Pakistan seeks partnership with the United States not out of weakness but as a strategic choice. The delegation concluded that these meetings mark an important step in strengthening Pakistan-US ties at the legislative level, complementing government-to-government relations and ensuring that bilateral engagement is inclusive, constructive, and sustainable.

She added that so far, 23 deceased individuals have been identified, including 16 through DNA matching, six through facial identification and one because of their CNIC.
Dr Syed stated that all DNA tests were being conducted at the Sindh Forensic DNA and Serology Lab at the University of Karachi.
She shared a list of those identified so far:

Kashif, son of Younus
Aamir, son of Sulaiman
Faraz, son of Anas

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has so far claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Over a week later, efforts to scour through the debris for the remains of the dead are still underway.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal Shaikh told Dawn that the search operation was in the final phase and would likely be completed on Sunday night.
He pointed out that five per cent of the basement was yet to be searched, which was under debris.
The Rescue 1122 COO said that the operation was halted briefly as the district administration arranged a visit from forensic experts, who collected samples.
The search efforts were resumed when the experts left the premises.

 

In a first information report (FIR) of the incident, dated January 23, the Karachi police said the fire was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”.
The case was registered against unknown persons as the police have not nominated anyone in the case.



Funerals held in Karachi, Sukkur
On Sunday afternoon, the funeral prayers of four individuals of a family — out of six who had come to Gul Plaza for shopping when the fire erupted — were offered at Eidgah Ground in Delhi Colony.
Saad, Kausar, Mariam and Misbah were among those identified, while two remained missing.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Dr Farooq Sattar, Jamaat-i-Islami’s Monem Zafar and PPP’s Syed Najmi Alam were among several politicians who attended the prayers.







Separately, the funeral prayer of one of the victims, Shees, was held near Kashti Chowk in the Garden area. It was also attended by residents and political leaders.
Meanwhile, Sukkur Mayor Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh attended the funeral of Mohammad Athar, a resident of Sukkur who lost his life in the incident.
According to the state-run APP, Athar, a father of two sons and two daughters, had gone to Gul Plaza to purchase necessary items for arranging Taraweeh prayers during Ramazan.
The Sukkur mayor announced that a special fund has been established to support the bereaved family, providing them with financial assistance.
‘I just want the body of my child’
Speaking to the media, grieving families recalled details of their near and dear ones still missing.
Among them was the mother of Imran Ibrahim, a married man who resided in Lyari’s Naya Abad area.
“I am coming to Gul Plaza daily, but being pushed away. I don’t want anything, I just want the body of my child,” said the grieving mother.
She said her son had been working at a crockery shop for the last three years.
Recalling events of the incident, the mother said she spoke to her son at around 10pm, who said he was working overtime and would return home at 2am.
She said all family members were asleep, assuming that her son might have returned, but they came to know in the morning that a huge fire had erupted at Gul Plaza.
The mother lamented that she is asked to go home when she visits Civil Hospital Karachi, and no one informs her about her, so when she comes to Gul Plaza.



Meanwhile, the father of another missing man, namely Hafiz Arif, told the media that he and family members have been visiting Gul Plaza for the last nine days, but no one has responded to their plight.
The father, a resident of Godhra Colony in the New Karachi area, wondered what steps the government was taking.
Sharing harrowing details of his son’s last call to him and his mother, the aggrieved father said Arif was uttering words, “Please Abu, Ami, (father, mother) save my life, as I cannot comprehend anything.”
The father recalled that they asked their son to recite the Kalma (declaration of faith).
He added that when they reached Gul Plaza on the night of January 17, they saw that fire had spread throughout the entire building.
“We would leave the place if any sign of our son was given, even remains,” said the grieving father.
Arif was the father of two children, including a 20-day-old son.
Governor visits bereaved family
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori also paid a visit to the bereaved family of Aftab, where he announced that he would sponsor the education for all four of his children.
Tessori further said that Khizar Tahneel, a builder who was accompanying him, had announced a plot for the family of each deceased person.
“It has been seven days today, but his brother’s body has not been found,” the governor said, referring to Aftab.
Addressing the Sindh government, he said, “You are having them make rounds to get the DNA report from so and so place, and the death certificate from so and so department. [Instead,] make a counter there.”
He urged the administration to deliver such documents at the doorsteps of the affected families.

 

Tessori raised questions about why the bodies were “not being recovered” and why DNA reports and death certificates were “not being issued”.
“Do we have the power or administration? Give it to us, then see how the city shines,” he said.
The governor wondered why the closed doors of Gul Plaza were not broken, noting that machinery was available to “demolish buildings” when needed.
Tessori calls for judicial commission
Tessori called for a judicial commission comprising Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, MPAs and others.
“If he is not at fault, I will hug the mayor,” he quipped.
“I am not saying anyone deliberately sparked the fire. I am only saying that fix responsibility for whose mistake or incapability it was, or who was inadequately equipped, and take them to justice.”



The MQM-P leader assailed the PPP-led Sindh government for terming questions and concerns raised over the fire as “politics”.
“Their aim is not to talk about it, as if what has happened has happened, leave it behind and wait for the next incident. And then again they will say ‘do not do politics on it’,” Tessori said.
He remarked, “Your statements reflect pride. Your statements show power, that no one can do anything to us.”
The governor also denied he had a protocol accompanying him when he visited Gul Plaza after finding out about the fire. “Be afraid of that day when I will bring out the suitcases filled with evidence,” he said.
Separately, speaking at the convocation of a seminary on late Saturday night, Tessori announced the launch of a free fire-safety training programme at the Governor’s House.
He said all associations and market organisations may contact the Governor’s House to benefit from this initiative.</p><small>2026-01-25 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647147-interpol-clears-shahzad-akbar-in-190m-al-qadir-trust-case' target='_blank'><strong>Interpol clears Shahzad Akbar in £190m Al-Qadir Trust case</strong></a><br><p>
