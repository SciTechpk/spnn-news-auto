The benchmark KSE-100 index increased by 990.87 points, or 0.87 per cent, to stand at 115,093.10 from the last close of 114,102.23 at 10:03am.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s decision to slash the interest rate by 100 basis points to 11 per cent defied analysts’ expectations that ongoing tensions with India might keep the central bank cautious and lead to no change in the interest rate.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said the rate cut “provided much-needed impetus to the stock market where investor confidence is deterred by India-Pakistan tensions”.
 
 

In the past few days, panicky investors have continued to reduce their holdings as Pakistan has expressed a heightened possibility of a military action by India in the wake of the latter’s allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
However, Ashraf noted that the “likelihood of a full-scale war between Pakistan and India remains low, constrained by the nuclear deterrence factor”.
“We believe, escalation at a wider scale would have severe consequences for both nations, particularly given their dependence on external financing and exposure to short-term external liabilities,” he added.
Topline Securities Ltd had observed yesterday that the benchmark index was volatile, falling by 1,036 points in early trading. However, it made a strong recovery in the second half, mainly supported by the cement sector, as investors expected a possible rate cut in the monetary policy later in the day.
 
 

Also on Monday, international rating agency Moody’s warned that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan’s growth.
It also said that escalating tensions could cause a setback to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan’s access to foreign funding flows.
On the other hand, Moody’s noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.

Four survivors rescued after the “panga “-style open fishing vessel washed ashore near Torrey Pines State Beach were transported to hospitals, and two other people found on a nearby beach were detained by authorities, according to US Coast Guard officials.
The two taken into custody were suspected to be smugglers, Coast Guard spokesperson Hunter Schnabel told Reuters.
Earlier Coast Guard accounts put the number of people missing from the overturned craft at nine, but Schnabel said the tally of those unaccounted for was revised to seven after confirmation that two individuals had been detained.

A Coast Guard cutter, an emergency response boat and a helicopter were involved in an ongoing search for the missing, among whom were two children, another Coast Guard spokesperson, Chief Petty Officer Levi Read, said.
At least some of the boat’s occupants were apparently from India, as a number of Indian passports “were found on the beach near where the panga washed up,” Read said.
Shawn Gibson, a special agent in charge of the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agency, said the incident was a “stark reminder of the dangers posed by maritime smuggling.”
“The ruthless smuggling of undocumented individuals is not only illegal, its deadly, Gibson said of the incident, which occurred about 30 miles north of the US-Mexico border. Read said ocean conditions off the San Diego County coast were rough at the time, with 7-foot (2 metres) seas reported.
Personnel from HSI, the US Border Patrol, the local fire department and law enforcement also responded to the scene, officials said.
So far this fiscal year, since October 2024, the Coast Guard has tracked 277 vessels clandestinely entering US waters from Mexico in the San Diego area, some of the boats being interdicted and others getting away, Read said. Those incidents resulted in 983 people being apprehended.
That compares with 1,354 maritime border-crossing incidents in the same region during the previous 12 months, with 561 individuals taken into custody during that period.
Of the four hospitalized survivors from Thursday’s panga capsizing, one was listed in critical condition when rescued, according to a statement from the city of Encinitas.
One survivor reported that 18 people had been aboard the vessel, and 18 life vests were located on shore, the statement said. But Read said the Coast Guard’s best information was that the boat was carrying just 16 individuals when it capsized.</p><small>2025-05-06 06:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603322-karachiites-likely-to-experience-rain-today' target='_blank'><strong>Karachiites likely to experience rain today</strong></a><br><p>

• Chambers, traders’ bodies slam govt for not taking them on board
ISLAMABAD: In what appears to be a major step to broaden the country’s narrow tax base, the government has authorised the stationing of tax officers at business premises to monitor production, stocks, supply of goods and rendering of services in the largely undocumented service sector.
On Monday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was briefed about three major amendments which address urgent legal, administrative and enforcement gaps in the tax system. These amendments were implemented through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025.
The amendment pertains to the posting of FBR officers at business premises under Section 175C and is intended to help monitor the revenue collection of high-end services and sectors operating outside the scope of the existing sales tax regime.
This section will not cover traders who are already regulated under section 40B of the Sales Tax Act 1990.
This step simply brings services into parity and ensures fair and comprehensive oversight across sectors, tackling an underground economy that is estimated to be more than 30pc of the GDP.
The measure is a response to the growing tax fatigue among the salaried class and documented manufacturers. Through enhanced documentation of the high-potential service sector, the FBR aims to create a fiscal space that could allow potential downward revisions in personal income tax rates on salaried individuals.
 
 

The service sector, which represents nearly 60pc of GDP, remains largely undocumented as over 70pc of enterprises are reportedly unregistered.
The scope of this section specifically targets high-earning yet under-documented businesses. Prominent among these are restaurants, hotels, guest houses, marriage halls, clubs, courier and cargo services, beauty parlours, clinics, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, gyms, foreign exchange dealers and photographers.
Some private hospitals are reportedly charging Rs100,000 to 200,000 per day for inpatient room occupancy — rates that exceed even those of five-star hotels. Many of these entities are underreporting revenues and do not comply with tax laws, undermining public trust and depriving the state of critical revenue needed for social services and infrastructure building.
This amendment introduces a monitoring mechanism, subject to inter-agency oversight, ensuring that FBR officers cannot act without accountability or beyond the authorised scope. All operations under this provision will be conducted transparently, under strictly defined SOPs, and in coordination with other regulatory authorities to prevent overreach or harassment.
PM’s observations
PM Shehbaz says ongoing tax reforms are aimed at reducing the burden on the common man. He said the amendments in various provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance and the Federal Excise Act will remove obstacles in tax collection.
According to a statement by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, the amendments will make the tax payment system more convenient and will not affect the rights of individuals and companies who regularly pay taxes.
The premier directed the authorities to expedite measures against tax evasion, under-invoicing and other irregularities in different sectors on priority basis.
He also directed strict legal action against buying and selling of illicit cigarettes and other items.
The meeting was briefed about steps taken against tax evasion in tobacco, cement, poultry, sugar, beverages and other industries. The prime minister was informed that work was underway on digital monitoring and the track and trace system.
The FBR has been successful in identifying irregularities in many industries through video monitoring. The meeting was told that powers to seize illicit products have also been transferred to provinces.
Tax amendments
The first amendment relates to Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A), concerning the immediate payment of tax demand even if a stay is granted or an appeal is pending. Following the recent constitutional amendment, special benches have been established in the superior judiciary to fast-track such cases under the oversight of the Chief Justice of Pakistan. Although the courts are now resolving cases promptly, a lacuna in the law previously allowed taxpayers a 30-day delay in making payments on confirmed demands — even when the matter had been conclusively decided by a court.
As a result, billions in confirmed revenue remained unrealised despite clear court verdicts. The amendment through Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A) seeks to curtail this delay and allow for swift implementation of final judgements issued by the Supreme Court and High Courts.
It is categorically clarified that this provision does not apply to orders passed by lower appellate forums such as commissioners, commissioner of appeals, or Inland Revenue Appellate Tribunals.
It is strictly limited to cases where the highest courts have already adjudicated on the matter and no stay is available. This provision does not overrule any stay granted by the Supreme Court or a high court. On the contrary, it reinforces the tax recovery order adjudicated by the Supreme Court or a high court.
The second amendment addresses the visits of FBR officers to private sector industries not currently accountable to FBR. The visits of FBR officers and officials to business premises engaged in taxable activities — whether earning taxable income or supplying taxable goods and services — are strictly regulated through a series of rules and STGOs. All such visits must be authorised through a bar-coded letter and officials are required to record proceedings on a mobile device for transparency.
Officers are provided with standardized pro forma documents, which are completed during the visit and submitted both electronically via a mobile application and in hard copy to a chief commissioner or to the FBR headquarters.
The conduct of these officers is closely monitored by civil intelligence agencies, and any instance of misconduct — whether reported by intelligence or private businesses — is promptly investigated and addressed.
KCCI, LCCI criticise move
The chief of the Karachi Chambers of Commerce and Industry opposed the insertion of Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A) in the Income Tax Ordinance because these provisions “override judgments of superior courts”.
Mohammad Jawed Bilwani said the business community was worried because the new law would make disputed tax liabilities immediately recoverable even where relief was granted by judicial forums.
Mian Abuzar Shad, who heads the Lahore Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in a statement that the business community “rejects the controversial amendments” as no stakeholders were consulted.
“These amendments are dangerous and anti-business. Therefore, we unanimously demand their immediate withdrawal or parliamentary review through proper consultation,” Mr Shad said.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari calls on PM Shehbaz Sharif.—APP

ISLAMABAD: The federal government will hand over power distribution companies to provinces in two months, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Monday.
PM Shehbaz made these remarks while meeting a delegation of PPP led by its Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
The federal government has been trying to privatise or devolve to provinces the power distribution companies (Discos) that supply electricity to homes.
Most of these Discos are suffering heavy losses due to poor recovery and transmission issues.
The prime minister made a similar announcement last month when he said the electricity price will be reduced by curtailing losses of around Rs600bn each year due to electricity theft, opening up electricity market operations and either privatising power distribution companies or handing them over to the provinces.

Meets PPP delegation; cancels Malaysia visit amid tensions with India

An official press release issued by the Prime Minister Office (PMO) after the meeting said the PM discussed the transfer of Discos with the PPP delegation.
“It was decided that within two months, the distribution companies will be handed over to the provinces,” the press release said.
The PPP delegation expressed confidence in the government’s reforms in the energy sector.
PM  Shehbaz also said the federal government has started consultations with its allies, including the PPP, for the upcoming budget.
The federal budget is likely to be announced in the first week of June.
The PPP delegation presented their proposals regarding the budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026.
On the issue of tensions with India, both allies reiterated that the entire nation stood united with the armed forces against any aggression from the neighbouring country.
They emphasised the armed forces are “always ready to confront the enemy”.
According to the PMO, PM Shehbaz emphasised that while Pakistan desired peace and stability in the region, it possessed the capability to deliver a strong and effective response in defence of its sovereignty.
Describing India’s provocative behaviour following the Pahalgam incident as “deeply regrettable”, the prime minister said Pakistan not only expressed concern over the incident but also called for an impartial and independent investigation into the killing of 26 tourists.
He firmly rejected India’s baseless attempts to link Pakistan to the incident without any evidence.
The prime minister criticised India’s unilateral and illegal suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it an act of “water aggression” which was “unacceptable” and a “red line” for the people of Pakistan.
He said Pakistan was actively pursuing diplomatic efforts to expose Indian aggression and that he had met with ambassadors from several countries to present Pakistan’s perspective.
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan will also expose India’s “nefarious designs” at the UN Security Council.
The PPP delegation said all political parties stood united for the defence and security of Pakistan.
They reaffirmed their full support for Pakistan’s brave armed forces.
The delegation also appreciated the federal government’s diplomatic efforts to highlight India’s war-mongering intentions internationally.
The PPP delegation comprised Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Naveed Qamar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
PM shelves visit
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz has postponed his official visit to Malaysia amid escalating tensions with India, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Monday.
In a statement, the Malaysian PM said he has an “understanding of the difficult circumstances Pakistan is facing” in light of recent tensions following the attack in India-held Kashmir
He hoped the situation would de-escalate swiftly.
PM Shehbaz was scheduled to arrive in Malaysia on Friday.
The PMO said the two sides spoke on Sunday night and that he “conveyed that he looked forward to paying an official visit to Malaysia later this year”.

The activists belonging to the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) and Balochistan National Party-Mengal, were detained on March 22 under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance in Quetta’s district jail.
Lawyers representing the detainees, including BYC chief organiser Dr Mahrang, had filed petitions in the Balochistan High Court challenging the detentions.
A division bench of the BHC, comprising acting Chief Justice Ejaz Ahmed Swati and Justice Muhammad Aamir Rana, heard the petitions on Monday. Lawyers Kamran Murtaza, Sajid Tareen and Imran Baloch appeared for the petitioners.
Mr Tareen told the media the hearing was postponed until Tuesday at the request of the prosecution.
He stated that the Balochistan Home Department had rescinded the MPO orders against the 150 activists.
“The prosecution will defend its plea on the detention of Dr Mahrang and six others under MPO-3,” Mr Tareen said, confirming the orders against the larger group had been withdrawn.
According to the lawyers, those whose MPO-3 detention orders remain in effect were Dr Mahrang, Beebu Baloch, Gulzadi Baloch, Sabghatullah Shah Jee, Bebarg Baloch, Sanaullah Baloch and BNP member Mama Ghaffar Baloch, who is the father of Beebu.

SITE-B SHO Sajjad Khan Afridi told Dawn that the couple and their three children were returning home in Baldia Town in the rickshaw when the heavy vehicle hit the three-wheeler. As a result, Samama, 10, died while his father, Rizwan Ahmed, 28, and mother Laraib, 33, were injured. The other two children remained unhurt.
The injured couple and the deceased were taken to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, where doctors said the condition of Laraib was critical.
The accident angered area residents, who set the dumper on fire. The mob also caught the driver and beat him, but he managed to escape, the SHO added.
Police registered an FIR on the complaint of victim Rizwan under sections 320 (punishment for qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving) and 337-G (hurt by rash or negligent driving) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

There have been calls and advice from allies and friends, to both Islamabad and New Delhi, suggesting talking instead of issuing threats and banging war drums. And not all advice can be ignored, as South Asians well know, especially from the Americans, who have a history of hand-holding South Asians through their stand-offs.
This is not all. On the Pakistani side, government officials are no longer publicly providing a countdown of when an attack is suspected, while the info minister is also boasting of victory of the bayania (a word which has made a smooth transition from the PTI-PML-N stage to the international one) in the tensions between the two neighbouring countries.
On the Indian side, too, some events suggest a de-escalation, or is being interpreted as such. The cabinet security committee meeting ended with the prime minister authorising freedom to the military to decide on the response. This was followed by another meeting which announced a caste survey, something the BJP had been resisting and the opposition party, the Congress had been asking for. Why the government would yield on such a key opposition demand, at this time, is intriguing. But this is still not reason enough to crack open the Rooh Afza on our side of the border.

The domestic fallout will prove important in the near future as the crisis plays out.

Those noticing these subtle changes still think New Delhi will respond, even though it is increasingly recognised that the decision will not be an easy one, for there is the ever-present risk of escalation as well as the peril of it ending as it did during Pulwama with the downing of an Indian plane and the capture of a pilot. And while India did spin the release of the pilot as a victory, the incident was an embarrassing one for New Delhi. But despite this, there is domestic pressure to act — and such pressure means not just kinetic action but also action which is perceived as bigger and better than Pulwama.
And this is what Pakistan expects also. Balakot plus.
At the same time, the calculus for Pakistan is no less rigorous. Whatever India does, Pakistan has to respond to it, plus more, whatever that may be. After all, this is the objective the country has set for itself after Balakot, when its plan was to strike near a military target on the other side, illustrating that it had the capacity to cause damage and didn’t. But to its good luck, it downed a plane and captured a pilot.
However, in this war of ‘retaliation’ and more, neither side wants an escalation, which is not just possible but also capable of causing great destruction. Still, the one-upmanship the two sides have prepared their domestic audiences for has bound them in varying degrees.
And this aspect — the domestic fallout — will prove important in the near future as the crisis plays out. After all, one can safely say that compared to 2019, both Islamabad and New Delhi have weaker governments. And in case of a fallout, there will be a price to pay domestically.
It is worth noting that for many analysts, Pulwama provided the then BJP government with an edge in the coming election, as national security became an important issue, even sidelining economic issues. Of course, such ‘success’ creates its own expectations which is at play this time around with the media and public opinion expecting an equally strong response. In addition, even most of the Indian opposition has asked for it, promising to back Narendra Modi. But what if the response doesn’t prove to be enough? That the Indian government is aware of this is also clear from the ‘aggressive’ steps it is taking vis-à-vis the Indus Waters Treaty, for it is something which can successfully be marketed as an act of war. But whether this will prove enough to stave off the opposition’s criticism as the elections in Bihar approach remains to be seen. As it is, a Congress leader has criticised the government by brandishing a toy jet that had lemon and green chilies attached to it, as he commented that the Rafales were in the hangers with lemon and chilies hanging off them, rather than being used.
The situation in Pakistan is no different. Pulwama ended better for Pakistan than it did for India. Indeed, few remember the public mood once Balakot had been struck. There were considerable questions about how and why enemy planes had been able to enter Pakistan. It was seen as particularly provocative because it revived memories of the Osama bin Laden raid. The resentment mitigated only when the Indian plane was downed, turning the public mood to one of jubilation, so much so that few asked if the strike by Pakistan would have proved enough domestically had the planes not engaged with each other and ended in the capture of Abhinandan.
Six years later, the government is less popular and less secure. The lack of popularity also plagues the establishment. All this will add to the sense of pressure; the government can’t afford to come across as weaker in its military prowess in comparison to a rival government. Indeed, its response, when it comes, will be compared to the previous government and judged accordingly. And if the response appears to be lukewarm, it will have domestic repercussions.
Neither will it be the first time. Conflict and war have always had an impact on domestic politics in Pakistan, shaping the latter in ways that have left a long-lasting impact. And where the wars next doors in Afghanistan have helped military dictators by extending their longevity, those with India have claimed a scalp or two. It was the 1965 war which catapulted Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to a leadership position as he criticised Ayub Khan’s handling of it. And more recently, Kargil eventually set off a series of events which ended with a military coup and later the removal of Musharraf. The costs of this impending conflict are high for the subcontinent but also for those ruling it.

In this respect, the administration did well to invite all mainstream parties to an in-camera briefing on Sunday, to apprise them of the threat perception. The meeting, which was addressed by the ISPR chief and the information minister, was attended by representatives of all major parties, except the PTI.
According to a PTI spokesman, the party skipped the “one-sided briefing”, and instead, called for a multiparty conference to discuss the crisis. However, he added that his party stood “shoulder to shoulder” with the military in case of any foreign aggression. It is unfortunate that the PTI stayed away from the conclave. While internal differences between parties and the state may persist, at a time of national crisis these should be put aside, with full focus on how the country can confront external threats. The state, on its part, should continue efforts to include the PTI in consultations to evolve a national response based on collective input.
On the external front, the state is continuing its diplomatic outreach to counter India’s warmongering, and communicate Pakistan’s views to friends and partners. As the UN Security Council prepared to meet on Monday to discuss the crisis in South Asia at Pakistan’s call, the UN chief pleaded for “maximum restraint” by both sides. UN involvement can play a major role in de-escalation.
Elsewhere, Pakistan’s prime minister and foreign minister continue to engage with foreign friends, with the result that Russia has offered its good offices to mediate “if there is mutual interest” from India and Pakistan, while the GCC has also stressed the need for dialogue and de-escalation. If India is interested in a peaceful resolution to this crisis, it should consider these rational calls.
Beyond noise and chest-thumping, India has been unable to produce any credible evidence linking Pakistan to the terrible killings in Pahalgam. It is evident that this country was blamed even before the preliminary investigations could get under way, and the tragedy was used by India to further scuttle ties and achieve long-cherished goals, such as tinkering with the Indus Waters Treaty.
Now, as it has failed to rouse the world against Pakistan, New Delhi must act responsibly and dial down the rhetoric, while working towards restoring calm in the subcontinent. Chiefly, Indian officials should stop making inflammatory statements against Pakistan, while hardliners in this country should also be countered with more rational voices. While not much can be expected from jingoistic anchors, particularly in India, respectable media outlets on both sides need to avoid alarmist coverage and report in a responsible manner.

“Netanyahu is directly MEDDLING within the US Government to DRAG it into another DISASTER in our region,” Araghchi said on X, warning against “ANY mistake against Iran”.
 






Araghchi also accused Netanyahu of “attempting to brazenly DICTATE what President Trump can and cannot do in his diplomacy with Iran”.
“The world has also learned how Netanyahu is directly MEDDLING within the US Government to DRAG it into another DISASTER in our region,” he added.

FM Araghchi says ‘lethal support for Israeli PM’s genocide’ in Gaza and war in Yemen have achieved nothing for Americans

Iran’s top diplomat cited US support for Israel in its war in Gaza against Palestinians in Gaza.
It also referred to the US retaliatory strikes against Yemen’s Houthis, whose attacks have targeted Washington’s ally Israel and Red Sea shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
“LETHAL support for Netanyahu’s Genocide in Gaza and waging WAR on behalf of Netanyahu in Yemen have achieved NOTHING for the American people,” he said.
The remarks came after the latest round of nuclear talks with the US, which were meant for May 3, were delayed with mediator Oman citing “logistical reasons”. The two countries have held three rounds since April 12, their highest-level contact since Washington withdrew from a landmark deal with Tehran in 2018, during Donald Trump’s first term as US president.
Netanyahu has called for dismantling Iran’s nuclear programme, saying a credible deal must “remove Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons” and prevent the development of ballistic missiles.
On Sunday, Trump said he would only accept “the total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme, but also signalled openness to discussing one for civilian use.
“Now, there’s a new theory going out there that Iran would be allowed to have civilian (programme) — meaning to make electricity,” he told NBC News, adding that he “would be open to hearing” the argument.
Tehran has consistently denied that it was seeking atomic weapons, insisting that its atomic programme is solely for civilian purposes.
Araghchi reiterated that if the goal was for Iran to not have a nuclear weapon, “a deal is achievable and there is only ONE PATH to achieve it: DIPLOMACY based on MUTUAL RESPECT and MUTUAL INTERESTS”.

The iconic open-sided vehicle, designed to allow the pontiff to greet crowds of well-wishers, has been transferred to Caritas Jerusalem and will head to Gaza if and when Israel opens a humanitarian corridor.
The car, a converted Mitsubishi, was used by the pope during a 2014 visit to Bethlehem and had since been on display, gathering dust and rust. It has now been repaired and refurbished as a mobile clinic.
“With the vehicle, we will be able to reach children who today have no access to healthcare — children who are injured and malnourished,” said Peter Brune, secretary general of Caritas Sweden.
Brune told AFP that Sweden’s Cardinal Anders Arborelius had asked the late pope, who died on April 21 aged 88, that the spare vehicle be put to use providing essential frontline healthcare to Palestinian children.
It will be fitted with medical equipment and a fridge for medicines and be assigned a driver and a team of doctors.
 
 

“This vehicle represents the love, care and closeness shown by His Holiness for the most vulnerable, which he expressed throughout the crisis,” said Anton Asfar, secretary general of Caritas Jerusalem.
It was not clear, however, if or when the aid agency’s hoped-for humanitarian corridor would open.

Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi  met with defence secretary Rajesh  Kumar Singh, followed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, in his  office.
The mock-drills are to begin countrywide on May 7 and likely to continue till May 9, The Hindu quoted a senior government official as saying.
Around 400,000 volunteers associated with the Direc­torate General, Civil Defence, under the home ministry will be roped in for the drill, the official told The Hindu.
Government sources confirmed to the paper that this comes in the backdrop of escalating tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The Civil Defence department was created in 1962, following India’s war with China.
The official said mock-drills are routinely performed for disasters such as earthquakes and building collapse among others but air-sirens are used to warn the public when there is an “external threat”.
“Every state including those on the western border will do the mock-exercise beginning May 7. The finer details will be shared on Tuesday. Some states are better equipped and for others we will issue guidelines,” said the official.
The official explained that camouflaging of vital installations amounts to switching off all illumination including in the vicinity of plants and vital buildings.
“We have over 400,000 volunteers associated with the Civil Defence. We will try to mobilise the maximum number for the exercise. The state police will also mobilise volunteers in their jurisdictions,” said the official.
On Sunday, police conducted a 30-minute blackout drill in the Ferozepur district of Punjab, bordering Pakistan. The Ferozepur Cantonment Board issued an advisory and residents were asked to switch off lights for half an hour.

• EU says plan ‘will result in further casualties, suffering’
• Israeli strikes kill 19 in war-ravaged territory’s north
JERUSALEM: Israel’s security cabinet approved the expansion of military operations in Gaza including the “conquest” of the Palestinian territory, an official said on Monday, after the army called up tens of thousands of reservists for the offensive.
It comes as the United Nations and aid organisations have repeatedly warned of the humanitarian catastrophe on the ground, with famine again looming after more than two months of a total Israeli blockade.
The Israeli official said the expanded operations “will include, among other things, the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories, moving the Gaza population south for their protection”.
A different senior security official said “a central component of the plan is a large-scale evacuation of the entire Gazan population from the fighting zones… to areas in southern Gaza”.
The plan, approved by the cabinet overnight, comes amid a push by Israel for Palestinians to leave the territory.
A “voluntary transfer programme for Gaza residents… will be part of the operation’s goals,” the senior security official added.
‘Political blackmail’
The European Union voiced concern and urged restraint from Israel, saying the plan “will result in further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian people”.
Hamas said on Monday the new Israeli aid framework amounted to “political blackmail”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said two Israeli air strikes killed at least 19 people in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory’s north early Monday.
“Our teams found 15 martyrs and 10 wounded, mostly children and women, after an Israeli strike on three apartments” northwest of Gaza City, said the agency’s spokesman, Mahmud Bassal.
Four other people were killed and four wounded in a strike on a house in Beit Lahiya, north of Gaza City, he told AFP.
The Israeli cabinet, which includes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several ministers, “unanimously approved” the plan aimed at defeating Hamas and securing the return of prisoners held in the territory.
The official source said the plan included “powerful strikes against Hamas”, without specifying their nature.
“I think, as an Israeli citizen, that it’s a smart move to finally address the root problem properly”, public employee Yossi Gershon, 36, told AFP.
“All the steps of backing down — we can see that unfortunately, there really isn’t peace with the other people.”
The senior security source said the troop deployment would “allow a window of opportunity” for a possible prisoner deal coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to the Middle East in mid-May.
“It is a thoughtless way of endangering more lives on both sides”, student Tamar Lazarow, 59, told AFP. “Enough innocent people have died… I do not really trust our government to make decisions coming from the right place.”
An Israeli campaign group representing the relatives of prisoners said the plan for an expanded offensive was “sacrificing” those held in Gaza.
Alongside the plan for the expansion of the war, Netanyahu “continues to promote” a proposal by Trump for the departure of Gazans to neighbouring countries, the official said.
The US president’s plan, unveiled in early February, has been rejected by Arab nations and governments around the world and the Palestinians.
Israel’s security cabinet also approved the “possibility of humanitarian distribution, if necessary” in Gaza, “to prevent Hamas from taking control of the supplies and to destroy its governance capabilities”.
A grouping of UN agencies and aid groups in the Palestinian territory has said Israel is seeking to “shut down the existing aid distribution system…
and have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military“.
The plan “contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic — as part of a military strategy”, the bodies said in a statement.

• Dar sees Pahalgam incident as ‘calculated attempt’ at escalation
• Any violation of sovereignty to be met with ‘decisive force’, vows army chief
• Kremlin following situation with ‘great concern’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday urged the global community to swiftly intervene to bring down tensions in the South Asian region and de-escalate the crisis by addressing its underlying reason: the unresolved Kashmir dispute.
Pakistan’s leadership also pledged to fiercely defend national sovereignty against any provocation in the wake of the Pahalgam attack that resulted in the death of 26 people in the held-Kashmir region. The government said that provocative rhetoric from New Delhi and baseless accusations against Pakistan were part of a pattern aimed at diverting attention from the Kashmir dispute.
In his meetings with foreign dignitaries, including Iran’s foreign minister, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated Pakistan’s offer for an “independent, tra­nsparent, neutral and credible” international inv­e­stigation into the Pahal­gam incident and invited cou­ntries, including the UK, to participate.
PM Shehbaz also raised concerns over what he termed India’s attempts to politicise international fina­ncial institutions to damage Pakistan’s economy and condemned recent actions concerning the Indus Waters Treaty, calling them “unacceptable” and a “red line”.
Iran FM visit
During their separate meetings with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, PM Shehbaz and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar highlighted their shared commitment to diplomacy.
Iran had offered to mediate between India and Pakistan, with President Pezeshkian already having spoken to leaders in both capitals and Mr Araghchi expected to travel to New Delhi on Thursday.
“The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Iran for peace, stability, and development in the region,” the PM Office said in a statement after the meeting. Foreign Minister Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to strengthening its relations with Pakistan and playing its part in bringing peace and stability to South Asia, reported state-run APP.
In his meeting with UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, the prime minister emphasised that Pakistan would not take any step that endangers regional peace. “Our priority remains economic development,” he said, urging London to use its good offices with both countries to promote peace.
‘Pakistan will defend itself’
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, at a seminar in Islamabad, said that Pakistan remained committed to regional stability but would not hesitate to defend itself if provoked.
“There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern—level accusations without evidence, incite hysteria, and use it as a pretext for aggression,” Mr Dar said.
“If aggression is imposed on us, we will exercise our inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.”
He also voiced concern over India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it a dangerous development with far-reaching implications. The foreign minister urged the global community to intervene before the situation spirals further.
“The international community must take serious note of these developments. At a time when the region requires cooperation and restraint, any tolerance for adventurism would only embolden further instability,” he emphasised.
“Being a responsible member of the international community, Pakistan remains committed to regional peace and stability. We will support all efforts towards de-escalation,” he reassured the international partners about Pakistan’s cooperation for de-escalation.
The Pakistani military reinforced the civilian leadership’s stance, with Gen Asim Munir warning that while the country sought peace, any violation of its sovereignty would be met with decisive force.
“If Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are violated, we will respond with full force to preserve national prestige and the well-being of our people,” Gen Munir said during remarks at the Balochistan National Security Workshop.
Islamabad has consistently framed the Kashmir dispute as central to the region’s volatility and reiterated its call for a resolution based on UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
The Iranian top envoy also called on army chief General Asim Munir at GHQ, Rawalpindi.  “The meeting featured constructive discussions on the geo-strategic environment, with particular focus on challenges confronted by both countries in the domain of security. The Pak-Iran border security mechanism was also reviewed as part of efforts to enhance bilateral coordination,” said a statement issued by the army’s media wing after the meeting.
Kremlin’s concern
Meanwhile, the Kremlin also called for a de-escalation on Monday, expressing the hope that both sides would work towards reducing tensions.
“We hope that the parties will be able to take measures (…) that will reduce tensions,” Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that “we are following with great concern the tense atmosphere that has developed on the border.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a phone call on Monday that the “particularly privileged partnership” between Moscow and Delhi was “not subject to external influence and continues to develop dynamically in all areas”, the Kremlin said in a statement.
Moscow last week said it was ready to mediate after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held calls with both sides last week.
“India is our strategic partner. Pakistan is also our partner. We value our relations with both Delhi and Islamabad,” Peskov said.

India took measures such as closing its airspace to Pakistan airlines, while Pakistan barred those owned or operated by its neighbour, suspended trade and halted special visas for Indians, although it let international airlines use its airspace.
Lufthansa Group’s airlines are  “avoiding Pakis­tani airspace until further notice”, it said in a statement to Reuters.
The Pakistan Civil Avi­a­tion Authority declined a Reuters request for comment.
However, flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.
British Airways and Emirates did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“The airline has decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice,” Air France said in a statement, citing the  “recent evolution of tensions” between India and Pakistan.
The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and flight plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.

• Decreased inflows at Marala will result in more water shortage for crops, Irsa warns
• Reuters report claims New Delhi plans to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects
NEARLY a week after its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, India on Monday virtually stopped water discharges from the Chenab River into Pakistan without prior notice, reducing flows in the river manifold.
Water flows in the Chenab, recorded at the Marala headworks, decreased from up to 35,000 cusecs on Sunday to about 3,100 cusecs on Monday morning.
 
 

“They have almost blocked the River Chenab flows to downstream (Pakistan) after they (Ind­ian authorities) took the dec­ision on Sunday,” a senior official of the Punjab irrigation department confirmed on Monday.
“Currently, they are using our water to fill up their dams/hydropower projects in the Chenab basin. They cannot do this since it is a grave violation of the Indus Water Treaty…,” the official deplored.
According to a document seen by Dawn, India has three major hydropower projects in the Chenab Basin. The first is the 1,000MW Pakal Dul Dam, having an 88,000 acre-feet reservoir storage capacity and a 10km head race tunnel to divert water south.
The second is the Baglihar Dam (88km from Pakal Dul upstream). This is a 900MW power generation plant, having a 321,002 acre-feet reservoir storage along with a spillway capacity of 582,692 cusecs.
The third one is Salal Dam, located 78km from Baglihar, having an installed power generation capacity of 690MW along with 228,000 acre-feet reservoir storage and spillway capacity of 792,012 cusecs.
“From Salal Dam, Marala Barrage (in Pakistan) is situated 76km away. The reason behind the massive reduction in the flows is the filling of these dams, which have a total storage capacity of over 1.2 million acre-feet. And if they keep filling their dams and avert discharging, they (India) may leave us without water for four to five days more,” the official warned.
To a question, he said that if India suddenly started discharging water downstream, there could be a flood-like situation in Chenab, putting the local population at risk.
To another question, he said Marala’s capacity was 1.1 million cusecs, whereas the total storage capacity of India’s dams in the Chenab basin was over 1.3 million acre-feet. “However, they don’t have control over the water inflows to Pakistan in the river from the Jammu-Tavi and Munawar-Tavi distributaries,” the official added.
According to the official, Chenab is very important for Pakistan’s irrigation system, as its canals, including the UCC and BRB canals, irrigate a vast tract of agricultural land in Punjab.
According to the daily water report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the water inflows in Chenab at Marala were recorded at 5,300 cusecs, whereas there were zero outflows on Monday.
The inflows and outflows in the river at Marala on Sunday were 34,600 and 25,400 cusecs, respectively.
Shortage for Kharif crops
Separately, a meeting of the advisory committee of the Indus River System Authority also expressed concerns over the unilateral Indian decision that would cause additional shortages to Kharif crops, already facing an estimated 21pc shortfall.
“…sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortages in early Kharif season,” said a statement issued by Irsa. The water regulator declared an overall shortage of 21pc for the remaining early Kharif season in case supplies in River Chenab remained normal. However, the situation would be monitored on a daily basis and if the decrease continues, the shortages would be revisited accordingly, Irsa said, adding the late Kharif shortages were expected to be 7pc.
An official told Dawn that Chenab flowed at 35,600 cusecs on Sunday at Marala headwork, but dropped to 3,177 cusecs on Monday morning, showing a reduction of almost 11 times. He said three storages — Baglihar, Dulhasti and Salal — on Chenab in Kashmir had the capacity to stop river flows.
Sindh’s concerns
Sindh representatives recorded their objections over the operationalisation of Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal by Punjab, but was explained that Punjab was using its own share. Sindh, nevertheless, insisted that the opening of the emergency link canal affected Sindh’s allocated share downstream.
Sindh was also told that its share of 76,000 cusecs was being released, which would reach its canal command areas in five to six days. Punjab’s discharges were reduced from 84,000 cusecs to 65,000 cusecs at its request.
The Irsa meeting worked out Punjab’s water availability estimate at 31.35 million acre feet (MAF) for the entire Kharif season, followed by Sindh’s 28.85MAF. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan would get 0.82MAF and 2.86MAF, respectively, during the season.
Work on Indian dams
Separately, the Reuters news agency reported that India has begun work to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects.
A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company and authorities in the occupied Kashmir, it reported.
The process initially results in sediment-laden waters being released downstream from the reservoirs, potentially causing sudden inundation, followed by a reduced flow of water as the reservoirs are refilled, one of the unnamed sources cited by Reuters said.
The report said the work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other dams launch similar efforts. There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.
“India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008/09, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work,” Reuters said, quoting sources.
The report said the Indian authorities had also asked officials concerned to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which they did from May 1. The effort was aimed at freeing dam operations from any restrictions, it added.

It’s what religion and nationalism on steroids does to a people.
Markandey Katju, the pacifist former supreme court judge, has tried every reasoned argument to seek a probe into the Pahalgam tragedy before beating the war drums against a nuclear-armed neighbour. Find the criminals to establish the masterminds, the judge says. But common sense or reason has few takers in a mob that a large part of India has turned into. 
To make the unspeakable crime more grotesque, a security search was carried out for the Pahalgam suspects in a Sri Lankan plane that arrived in Colombo from Chennai. The tip-off from India suggests the culprits may have already dodged the dragnet and fled.
Stirring the political pot was a mythological allusion by the RSS chief to the Pahalgam massacre of 25 Indian tourists. Mohan Bhagwat quoted the Ramayana to demand retribution and destruction of the stone-hearted criminals. He reminded his followers of the epic war in which Lord Rama defeated and killed the king of Lanka for deceitfully kidnapping his wife during their exile in the forests of Dandakaranya.
There are a few problems with Bhagwat’s Rama-Ravana allegory. In the context of modern warfare, not least with nuclear-armed countries like Pakistan, the tempting recourse to religious metaphors could become problematic. As many Pakistanis would remember from enjoying the Ramayana TV serial on Doordarshan, which they were able to see on their TV sets in Lahore, Rama had acquired with his spiritual prowess a powerful weapon known as the Brahmastra. And Rama needed the Brahmastra to lay low Ravana but not without a tip-off from Ravana’s estranged brother Vibhishan. 

Why does it seem a challenge to question the government to show evidence that points the finger at Pakistan?

Modi in the current re-enactment of the epic has followers who indulge his claims of divinity. But he knows he lacks Rama’s critical asset in his quiver. Bhagwat isn’t oblivious to the reality that both India and Pakistan for all the wrong reasons have nuclear weapons aimed at each other. I met Prof John Nash at Princeton in 2002, around the time A Beautiful Mind, the movie about him, was released. He was livid that Spiderman was doing better. The nuclear postures of India and Pakistan are rooted in the mathematically structured war games that Prof Nash had fabulously theorised. Any change in the tense equilibrium would result in self-harm. The theory known in military jargon as Mutual Assured Destruction, MAD, was successfully applied on the two Cold War rivals. Such is the power (and legitimate fear) of nuclear weapons that the owner of the world’s most lethal military arsenal must treat with a degree of deference the tiniest owner of the bomb. Remember Donald Trump humouring Kim Jong-un in Singapore. 
The RSS has a tradition of worshipping weapons on Dussehra every year, evidently to valorise warfare as an essential facilitator of its proposed Hindu rashtra. The RSS had called for war also after the Pulwama attack on paramilitary men in 2019. 
Modi claimed revenge at the time, saying his air force had bombed the alleged hideout of the suspects in Balakot, across the LoC. The Pakistan Air Force conducted a warning raid the next day. They shot down an Indian plane and captured its pilot. Indian forces also shot up one of their own helicopters in the confusion, killing Indian military personnel on board. Modi used the showdown to canvass votes nevertheless, and he won that election handsomely.
Bhagwat’s call for war follows an even more frightful precedent. In the wake of the terror attack on Mumbai in November 2008, K. Sudarshan, the former RSS chief, backed a nuclear attack on Pakistan, and asked the country to actually brace for a Third World War. Somehow that interview with a freelance journalist didn’t make people cringe. Fortunately, India had a sagacious leader at the helm at the time. Manmohan Singh fired his home minister for the Mumbai carnage but refused to beat any war drums. He won the 2009 elections without recourse to nationalist madness. In fact, he engaged with Pakistan in peace talks, for example in Sharm el Sheikh.
Before lynch mobs and TV channels were made the clearinghouse of Indian nationalism, the Congress party could be relied upon to rein in extremist fervour. Today, that composure in the Congress appears to have given way to a shriller nationalism, possibly to not stand out from the chorus and thus risk being accused of lagging in nationalist fervour. The Congress party’s expression of solidarity to the Modi government in whatever steps it considered necessary to respond to the Pahalgam tragedy echoed reckless bipartisanism, the kind that makes it difficult to divine a Democrat from a Republican or differentiate Labour from Tory, for example, in the invasion of Iraq. To give carte blanche on foreign policy, instead of holding the government to account for glaring intelligence failure and security lapses, makes the opposition appear feckless in a crisis. 
Opposition parties, notably including Congress spokespersons, have spoken up though against the targeting of Kashmiris and Muslims more widely after Pahalgam. So why does it seem a challenge to question the government to show evidence that points the finger at Pakistan? The foreign press has reported gaps in the Indian narrative. The New York Times, a major newspaper, has spoken of a lack of clear evidence to back India’s claim of Pakistan’s involvement in the massacre.
In the theme of Ramayana, being quoted to call for war, there was a pivotal character called Jatayu, a bird that could speak in human voice. Jatayu happened to be the sole eyewitness to Sita’s kidnapping. It was his testimony that prompted Ram to wage war on Ravana. Sadly, Jatayu’s clinching evidence is missing in the government’s transcription of the tragedy of Pahalgam from the story of Ramayana.

In the first incident, un­­known assailants planted an improvised explosive device in the Dasht Nallah area of Jiwani. The device was detonated by remote control as the Pakistan Coast Guards (PCG) pat­­rol vehicle passed, officials reported.
The blast damaged part of the vehicle and injured two PCG personnel, while three others aboard were unharmed, officials said. Security forces secured the site and transported the injured soldiers to a nearby health facility.
The injured, identified as Shah Mir and Shafqaat, were later moved to Gwa­dar for further treatmentSeparately, in Pishin’s Huramzai Tehsil, attackers targeted a Levies official travelling in his private car, Levies officials said. 
An explosive-laden mot­or­cycle was detonated near the vehicle, which sustai­ned damage, but the levies official inside was unhurt, officials confirmed.
Elsewhere, in the Wadh area of Khuzdar district, Le­­vies personnel preven­ted a potential attack by defusing a bomb plan­ted at a roadside. Officials said unknown individuals had parked an explosive-laden motorcycle by the road.
Levies men on patrol id­­entified the motorcycle as suspicious. Upon insp­­­ec­tion, an attached explosive device was discovered.
“Levies bomb disposal experts defused the 10kg explosive device,” said Assistant Commissioner Wadh Ali Akbar.

The consignment — sent in collaboration with the Al-Khidmat  Foundation — includes approximately 85 tonnes of canned food, 10 tonnes of  rice and two tonnes of powdered milk. The aid was flown from Jinnah  International Airport in Karachi to Amman, Jordan, via a chartered  flight, for onward distribution among Palestinians.
This  latest shipment brings Pakistan’s total aid dispatched for  Palestine to 1,615 tonnes since the conflict escalated. Overall, Pakistan has sent 2,142 tonnes of  humanitarian aid, which also includes 416 tonnes for Lebanon and 111 tonnes  for Syria.

The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
Iftikhar delivered a press briefing following the UNSC meeting, stating that the nation’s objectives were “largely served and achieved” by the discussion and reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to remaining peaceful and open to dialogue.
“Several [council] members recognised the imperative of peacefully resolving all issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Iftikhar said.
“There was also a clear sense that regional stability cannot be sustained through unilateralism, it requires principled diplomacy, engagement and adherence to international law.”
Iftikhar noted that peace “does not happen in a vacuum” and highlighted some of the key points discussed during the moot.
“We expressed grave concern over India’s recent unilateral measures, particularly the illegal actions of April 23, military buildup and inflammatory statements,” he said.
“These actions, alongside credible evidence of potential escalation, have dangerously raised tensions.
“Pakistan does not seek confrontation [but] we are fully prepared to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. When peace is threatened in a region home to one fourth of humanity, it becomes a global issue,” he noted.
Iftikhar highlighted that Pakistan “categorically rejected” India’s allegations that it was responsible for the Pahalgam attack, which was condemned by Pakistan and “all council members”.
“What India is claiming is nothing but recycled allegations, unsubstantiated, unverified [and] designed to serve its political interest and strategic objectives, which include trying to divert attention from repression and human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir and to undermine the legitimate Kashmiri struggle for self-determination,” he said.
Iftikhar also raised India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, which he noted was brokered by the World Bank and “upheld during wars”.
“Water is life, not a weapon,” he said. “These rivers sustain over 240 million Pakistanis. Any attempt to disrupt their flow constitutes aggression, and allowing such a precedent would endanger every lower riparian state.”
According to Iftikhar, the council was reminded that the Kashmir issue was the core contributor to instability in south Asia.
“The Kashmiri people continue to face gross human rights violations, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, demolition of homes — that we are seeing now — restrictions on expression and media and a systematic denial of their right to self-determination,” he lamented.
“Lasting peace in south Asia requires that the UNSC implements its own resolutions, which includes the holding of a UN-supervised plebiscite for Kashmiris to determine their own future,” he stated.
The ambassador added that Pakistan called out India’s “weaponisation of disinformation [and] efforts to malign Pakistan”.
“We reminded the UNSC that Pakistan has been a frontline state in the war on terror, sacrificing over 19,000 lives along with immense economic setback,” he said. “India’s attempts to distort this reality, while ignoring its own destabilising actions and involvement in terrorism abroad, including the case of Kulbushan Jadhav and extraterritorial assassinations, must be met with truth, transparency and accountability.”
Iftikhar continued: “We reiterated our commitment to peaceful, cooperative relations with all our neighbours, including India. We remain open to dialogue based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.”
The ambassador added that Pakistan reiterated its call for a “transparent, neutral and credible investigation” of the Pahalagam attack.
“While we pursue peace, we will defend our interests and safeguard our sovereignty resolutely, and at all costs. We urge the UNSC and the secretary general to remain actively engaged in peacemaking and preventative diplomacy,” he said.
“The role of the council is not just to observe conflict from afar, but to prevent it through timely and principled action. Peace must be built through dialogue, engagement and respect for international law. India’s current posture reflects none of these,” Iftikhar said.
“The burden of peace must be shared — the people of Kashmir have waited far too long for justice, and the people of Pakistan will not stand by while their rights — to water, to peace, to sovereignty — are threatened,” he added.
“In view of the gravity of the situation, the calls for dialogue, de-escalation, and peaceful resolution of disputes, such as by the secretary general and what we heard from the council members today, are the most pertinent and the way forward for lasting peace and stability in the region,” he concluded.
Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had instructed Iftikhar to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.
 
 

“Pakistan will particularly brief the UNSC on how India’s aggressive actions, repeated provocations and inflammatory rhetoric pose a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,” an FO press release issued today said.
It said that Pakistan would call upon the UNSC to “exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security by taking appropriate measures to address these concerning developments”.
“It will also highlight India’s unlawful and unilateral attempt to put the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of its international obligations,” the FO said.
The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar said Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.
Pakistan and India have fought multiple wars and remain bitter foes.
International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad to de-escalate.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack in Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “full operational freedom” to respond, and Islamabad has warned it will hit back against any aggression.
UN chief urges ‘maximum restraint’ in India, Pakistan standoff
Earlier, before the session, UN chief Antonio Guterres urged that Pakistan and India must exert “maximum restraint” and step back from the brink of war.
Relations have reached “a boiling point”, Guterres told reporters in New York, adding that they were at their “highest in years”.
He again condemned the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice through “credible and lawful means”.
“It is also essential — especially at this critical hour — to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control,” the secretary-general warned.

“Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink.”
The UN chief also called Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the prevailing security situation in South Asia, according to a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
It added that this was the second telephone conversation between the two leaders within a week.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the UN chief’s continued engagement and outreach efforts and welcomed his call for de-escalation as well as the need to avoid any confrontation.
“While reiterating his offer of an independent, transparent, neutral and credible investigation, the prime minister expressed his concern that India was yet to provide any evidence, nevertheless, it continued to resort to provocative rhetoric and warmongering,” the statement said.
The premier reiterated Pakistan’s determination to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
PM Shehbaz also expressed his serious concern at Indian attempts to politicise international financial institutions in an attempt to harm Pakistan’s economic interests.
The UN chief briefed the prime minister on his outreach efforts for peace and stability in the region, and expressed his commitment to remain engaged with all interlocutors on the issue.
NA passes unanimous resolution, condemns India’s move to suspend Indus Waters Treaty
Meanwhile, the National Assembly (NA) unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s unlawful and unilateral declaration to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in blatant violation of the treaty.
Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry presented the resolution.
The resolution said that the killing of innocent civilians was contrary to the values upheld by Pakistan, and the NA rejected all “frivolous and baseless attempts” to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack.
The lawmakers condemned the “orchestrated and mala fide campaign” by the Indian government to malign Pakistan, which “follows a familiar pattern of exploiting the issue of terrorism for a narrow political goal”.
The resolution warned that Pakistan remained fully capable and prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression, including water terrorism or military provocation and any misadventure by India would be met with a firm, swift and decisive response.
The lawmakers emphasised that the people of Pakistan remained committed to peace but would never allow anyone to transgress the country’s sovereignty, security, and interests.
The resolution demanded that India should be held accountable for its involvement in different acts of terrorism and targeted assassinations on the soil of other countries, including Pakistan, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering moral, political and diplomatic support for and commitment to the Kashmiri people’s just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.
Pahalgam attack attempt to divert attention from India’s cross-border terrorism: Dar
FM Dar said that the attack was an attempt to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.
Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges, adding that it could be “self-choreographed”.
“We believe that what has happened is to divert attention — I am talking of Pahalgam — from India’s internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,” Dar said.
“Don’t forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,” he added, referring to the upcoming polls in Bihar in October.
“This brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India’s borders,” the deputy PM warned, calling India’s actions “unilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative”.
He noted: “There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern — level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.”
In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be “sacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains”.
“This is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,” the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace: “We will support all efforts towards de-escalation.”
“Analysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,” echoing Pakistani leaders’ previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a “false flag operation”.
 


“How can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? […] Come on. Nobody’s a fool,” Dar quipped.
“International dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them — great friends — suggested to me, ‘Can you try and help the perpetrators be caught?’ I said ‘come on, do you know the distance where it happened and where’s the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.”
The deputy PM asserted: “Pakistan has exposed India’s mala fide and they are now on the backfoot. But it takes two to tango. I am telling all these dignitaries that we will show patience and will not be the first ones to attack.
“But if anybody makes any mistake and ventures into adventurism, then God knows what situation that will lead to. I hope sense prevails and they should [reflect].”
He detailed that he has directed Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations to request a meeting of the UN Security Council.
 
 

“Let’s share with them the facts and figures and the details and the evidence we showed the other day,” said Dar, referring to his press briefing with the military’s spokesperson, where they accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
“I cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties’ dictionary. The word suspension is there,” Dar said, referring to India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
UK to ‘work closely’ with Pakistan, India to reduce tensions
Separately, UK High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott assured PM Shehbaz today that her country would “work closely with Pakistan and India for maintaining regional peace and security”, the PMO said.
In his meeting with Marriott in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz urged her country to play its part in de-escalating the ongoing tensions with India.

The premier shared Pakistan’s perspective on the prevailing situation in South Asia in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident and rejected India’s attempts to link Pakistan to the incident without providing any evidence.
He also reiterated his offer for a transparent, credible and neutral international investigation into the incident and invited the UK to join it, the PMO statement added.
Noting that the UK enjoyed “good relations” with both India and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz assured Marriott that Islamabad “would never take any action that could imperil regional peace and security”.
The prime minister stressed that with the support of friendly countries, including the UK, his government’s “foremost priority remained advancing economic growth and development of the country”.
Iran FM meets with PM Shehbaz, army chief
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also met PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir today, state broadcaster PTV News said in a post on X.
FM Araghchi, who arrived in Islamabad late last night, also met with Deputy PM Dar.
 


“Key discussions held with PM Shehbaz Sharif, FM Ishaq Dar and Army Chief Gen Asim Munir,” PTV News stated, highlighting that the visit came amid “rising India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam attack”.
In his meeting with the Iranian FM, PM Shehbaz stressed that India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty was unacceptable and a red-line for Pakistan.
According to the PMO, the premier shared serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behaviour sincethe  Pahalgam incident.
He categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without sharing any evidence and said Pakistan had offered that an international, transparent, neutral and credible investigation be conducted to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident.
While stating that Pakistan had acted with maturity and responsibility, the prime minister said, “India had, on the other hand, created a media frenzy to divert the world’s attention away from Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which remained the root cause of instability in South Asia.”
Iran’s FM Araghchi conveyed warm greetings from the Iranian leadership to the prime minister and reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to strengthening its relations with Pakistan and also playing its part in bringing peace and stability in South Asia.
The meeting between the army chief and the Iranian FM at General Headquarters (GHQ) today featured constructive discussions on the geo-strategic environment, with particular focus on challenges confronted by both countries in the domain of security, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
Both sides agreed to stay engaged for enhanced bilateral cooperation while jointly working to assist in bringing positive developments in issues concerning the region, ISPR said.
The Iranian FM acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for peace and stability in the region, it added.
In their meeting, Dar and Araghchi exchanged views on the evolving situation in South Asia and the US-Iran nuclear talks, the Foreign Office said.
Both leaders also agreed that complex issues could be “resolved through diplomacy and negotiations”.
“They appreciated each other’s constructive diplomatic efforts, which demonstrate their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said. As Pak-India tensions persist, FM Araghchi is also expected to visit India later in the week.
According to an FO press release, Dar shared Pakistan’s “serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behaviour” and rejected “unsubstantiated attempts to implicate Pakistan in the incident”.

The foreign minister thanked his Iranian counterpart for making the visit at this “critical juncture”. On his part, Araghchi conveyed cordial greetings from the Iranian leadership and reaffirmed Tehran’s desire to further deepen bilateral relations with Pakistan.
Dar pointed out that Pakistan had “consistently denounced terrorism in all its forms” and underscored the country’s frontline role in the fight against terrorism.
Both foreign ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to strong Pakistan-Iran ties and agreed to boost cooperation in trade, energy, and connectivity.
They also pledged to maintain strong momentum in Pak-Iran relations, including by maintaining an increased frequency of interaction at the leadership level.
Araghchi also called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss matters of bilateral and mutual interest, regional security situation, particularly the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.
The Iranian foreign minister said that he was undertaking the visit on the instructions of the Supreme Leader Khamenei, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, expressing understanding of Pakistan’s position on the current situation and calling for restraint by both sides to de-escalate the tensions.
The president thanked the Iranian foreign minister for undertaking the visit to Pakistan at a critical juncture.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue and diplomacy, while expressing concern over India’s aggressive posture, which he said was endangering regional peace and stability.
China reaffirms ‘time-tested friendship’ with Pakistan
Earlier today, China reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India as President Asif Ali Zardari met with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong.

During today’s meeting at Aiwan-i-Sadr, Zardari expressed concern over the recent “irresponsible and aggressive rhetoric by the Indian government”, saying that such actions threaten regional peace and stability.
The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the “enduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan”, describing the relationship as one of “ironclad brothers” who have always supported each other in challenging times.
He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan’s perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.
 
 

Zardari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its “consistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times”.
On Thursday, PM thanked China’s envoy for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack. Last week, China had urged both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).
As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday spoke to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.
When war breaks out, you can’t control it: Khawaja Asif
Meanwhile, appearing on Samaa TV programme ‘Nadeem Malik Live’, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reiterated that any Indian attack would be met with a “befitting response”, adding that it would be “a level above what they do”.
“If they attack, which I can’t define right now, our response will be a step up and will not come down,” he said.
When asked about the possibility of an Indian attack on the LoC, Asif responded that there was anticipation that any Indian attack would be contained to the LoC or Sialkot sector.
“Once war starts, you cannot calibrate or control it,” he said. “Starting a war itself is something which is extremely dangerous.
“Modi is fighting a war for his own gains and for votes,” Asif added. “Political compulsions dictate their strategic policy, which is very unfortunate. Votes are more valuable than human lives or international peace.”
 


Info minister refutes claims of ‘terrorist hideouts’ during LoC visit
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India’s allegations of “terrorist hideouts” there, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the “false and baseless Indian propaganda”, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly “labelled as terrorist hideouts”.
“By witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India’s claims,” Radio Pakistan noted.
Among the group of international journalists was CNN’s International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson.
 


According to Radio Pakistan, Robertson visited a village where Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen were killed in a “fake encounter by the Indian army”.
The CNN editor interviewed both men’s bereaved families, who appealed for justice through international media, the report said. No statement by Robertson was found on his social media accounts immediately after the visit.
Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: “India is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.
“This area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,” he added.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“India’s narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India’s response and they are not able to provide evidence,” the minister said.
He asserted: “There are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].”
“Don’t resort to any misadventure,” Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.
Echoing Deputy PM Dar’s statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to “hide its internal failures”.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army again responded to unprovoked firing by the Indian army along the LoC overnight, state broadcaster PTV News reported.
According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.
The action was responded to in a befitting manner by the Pakistan Army, PTV News added. It quoted security sources as saying that the armed forces were “fully alert”.
Pakistani troops had previously responded to “unprovoked” Indian firing on April 30. Both countries have reportedly been trading small arms fire since April 25.

The test launch comes amid heightened tensions between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi’s aggressive measures in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the ISPR statement read.
 






The training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army, as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan’s strategic organisations, the military’s media wing said.
Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir congratulated the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.
“They expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of [the] Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,” the ISPR added.
President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated scientists and engineers, as well as the nation, on the successful test of the Fatah missile, according to a post on X by the PPP.
“The president appreciated the efforts of the security forces, scientists and engineers to strengthen the country’s defence.
“[He] reiterated national commitment to ensure national security and defence.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the efforts of the chairman joint chiefs of staff, the army chief, and the scientists and engineers involved in preparation for the launch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister Office.
“The success of the training launch clearly shows that Pakistan’s defence is in strong hands.
“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the professional capabilities of the Pakistan Army and its full preparedness for national defence,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the ISPR said that Pakistan had conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450km.
In May last year, the army conducted a test-launch of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400km.
The guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy’s anti-ballistic missile systems.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. Pakistan witnessed shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for a week since April 25, with the Pakistan Army responding to unprovoked Indian firing.
 
 

A day ago, ISPR Director General Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar briefed members of political parties on national security during an in-camera session in Islamabad.
“If aggression is imposed on Pakistan, then the forces are ready to give a befitting reply to the enemy,” PTV News quoted the DG ISPR as saying.
It added that during the in-camera session, the information minister also informed the political leaders about the government’s diplomatic measures and the country’s stance.
Separately, state news outlet The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that the Pakistan Navy remained vigilant, fully prepared and ever ready to respond effectively to any aggression.
“Defence sources revealed that during the night between May 4 and 5, the Pakistan Navy detected an Indian aircraft, P-8I, and kept it under continuous surveillance.”
 


India to hold civil defence drills
Meanwhile, India will conduct mock civil defence drills on Wednesday, government officials said, as fears rise of a regional conflict following the Pahalgam attack.
“The Ministry of Home Affairs has asked several states to conduct mock drills for effective civil defence,” Kanchan Gupta, a senior adviser from the information ministry, said in a statement.
Gupta said this would involve rehearsing an “evacuation plan” and the “training of civilians, students, etc, on the civil defence aspects to protect themselves in the event of a hostile attack”.
Drills will also test air raid warning sirens, prepare for blackouts and ready vital installations for camouflage.</p><small>2025-05-05 18:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603282-in-phone-call-with-un-chief-pm-reiterates-probe-offer-in-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>In phone call with UN chief, PM reiterates probe offer in Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>

The United States at the start of April imposed sweeping tariffs on most goods imported to the US, as well as much higher levies on dozens of rivals and allies alike. A week later, US President Donald Trump announced that he would pause many of his new tariffs for 90 days, even as he raised them further on imports from China.
By mid-April, the White House announced that China faced tariffs of up to 245 per cent due to its retaliatory tariffs on American goods. Asean had decided not to retaliate against the announcement of reciprocal tariffs, choosing instead to engage in constructive and forward-looking discussions to tackle emerging challenges.
Asean issued a joint statement on Sunday statement following the 28th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers’ and Central Bank Governors’ Meeting in Milan where it warned that tariffs would have a major impact on trade and economic stability in Southeast Asia.
“Escalating trade protectionism weighs on global trade, leading to economic fragmentation, affecting trade, investment and capital flows across the region,” Asean said.
“Near-term prospects may also be affected by other external risks, including tighter global financial conditions, growth slowdown in major trading partners, and reduced investment flows,” it added.
The bloc called for “enhanced regional unity and cooperation” amid growing economic uncertainty and said it would prioritise maintaining resilience while remaining flexible enough to respond to near-term challenges.
“On the fiscal front, this means rebuilding policy buffers while continuing to provide well-targeted support to sustain growth while implementing structural reforms,” the statement read. “We will also carefully recalibrate monetary policy based on domestic conditions.”
The bloc reaffirmed its commitment to multilateralism and a “rules-based, non-discriminatory, free, fair, open, inclusive, equitable, and transparent multilateral trading system”.
“We urge international organisations to uphold multilateralism and promote free trade, analyse and monitor the potential impact of trade tensions on the global economy, and support their members in providing policy advice to manage the negative shocks that may arise.”
Trump’s tariffs are increasingly clogging up the wheels of a world economy which for decades was greased by predictable and relatively free trade.
Big-name multinationals, right down to niche e-commerce players, last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.
“US tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.
“The US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,” she said of blanket US tariffs, currently set at a baseline of 10pc.</p><small>2025-05-05 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603272-un-chief-urges-india-to-avoid-military-confrontation-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>UN chief urges India to avoid military confrontation with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the forces in general area of Mir Ali in North Waziristan District.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, and resultantly, three khwarij were sent to hell,” it said, referring to the term the state uses for terrorists.
“In another IBO, conducted in South Waziristan District, two khwarij were successfully neutralized by the security forces. However, during an intense fire exchange, one brave son of the soil, Naik Mujahid Khan (age: 40 years, resident of District Kohat) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat,” the statement said.
It added that two more engagements took place between the troops and the terrorists in the Khyber and Bannu districts, resulting in the killing of three terrorists.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area against the security forces as well as target killing of innocent civilians, the ISPR said.
Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, ISPR said.
The press release added that the security forces of Pakistan were determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthened our resolve.
Late last month, security forces killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-05-05 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0520302297ef43f.png?r=204035' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908609/may-9-riots-sc-reserves-verdict-on-military-trials-case-will-announce-decision-this-week' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: SC reserves verdict on military trials case, will announce decision this week</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court’s (SC) Constitutional Bench on Monday reserved its verdict on the appeals against the decision to declare the trial of civilians in military courts null and void, saying it would announce the verdict later this week.
The development came as the CB resumed hearing a case pertaining to the military trials and the subsequent sentencing of civilians for their role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023.
The CB resumed hearing a set of 38 intra-court appeals (ICAs) moved by the federal and provincial gover­nments as well as Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the widely-praised October 2023 ruling by a five-judge bench that unanimously declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts violated the Constitution.
The bench — led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and including Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, and Shahid Bilal Hassan — is reviewing whether the trial of civilians in military courts is constitutional or not.
During the hearing, Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan appeared as the state counsel.
TV analyst Hafeezullah Niazi, father of Hassaan Niazi who was among those convicted by military courts over the riots, also attended the hearing.
As the bench reserved its verdict on the long-standing case, Justice Aminuddin said the court will issue its short order on the decision this week.
The hearing
At the outset of today’s hearing, AGP Awan said he would begin his arguments by detailing what happened on May 9, 2023.
“Our country is in a state of war almost all year round,” he said. “Army installations were attacked under a well-thought-out plan; on May 9, 49 places were attacked from 3pm onwards,” he said.
He noted that a prime minister had been hanged in Pakistan — referring to the hanging of ex-PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto — but even then, there was no such protest. “No political party had attacked the army in the past.”
The attorney general further referenced Pakistan’s political history, saying that all parties had been banned during the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD).
 
 

“The entire MRD leadership was in chains — Asghar Khan was under house arrest for three and a half years,” the AGP said. “Even during this time, no one took a step like people did on May 9.”
“Even if this was a reaction to May 9, it cannot be allowed; ours is not an ordinary country,” the AGP said. “Due to geography, we face a lot of threats.”
Justice Mandokhail remarked that the question before the court was not about whether a crime was committed, saying: “You come to the appeal, tell us about the appeal.”
As he continued his arguments, AGP Awan said that the army took departmental action for negligence in the Jinnah House attack.
“Three senior officers were retired without pension and benefits, including a lieutenant general, a brigadier and a lieutenant colonel,” he said.
“Dissatisfaction was expressed with the performance of 14 officers, dislike and distrust mean that they cannot get any further promotion,” the AGP said.
To this, Justice Mandokhail asked whether the army had initiated criminal proceedings against any army officer.
The attorney general said that criminal action would have been taken only when a crime had been committed, noting that departmental action had been taken for not stopping the incidents of May 9.
 
 

“The Army Act is clear that departmental action will also be accompanied by criminal punishment,” Justice Mandokhail replied.
AGP Awan then said that he would present arguments on May 9, as well as the July 21 decision and appeal.
“There were 23 incidents in Punjab, eight in KP, seven in Sindh and one in Balochistan. General Headquarters, Lahore, Mianwali Air Base, and ISI offices were attacked.
“All the incidents on May 9 were not accidental — the entire corps was inactive from 5:30pm to 9pm. If there was an external aggression on Lahore on May 9, it could not have been responded to,” the AGP said.
Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi remarked that at the time of Bhutto’s execution, people were making arrests and people set themselves on fire and self-immolated. “No one set property on fire at that time.”
The attorney general was in agreement, saying that his father himself had faced cases as a political activist yet it never occurred to anyone to damage the property by burning it.
Justice Hilali asked whether the gate of Jinnah House was broken open or if someone had opened it from inside. “If someone opened it from inside, it would be a crime of collusion,” she added.
The AGP said he would check about it and then apprise the court.
Justice Mandokhail asked whether what happened on May 9 was done with the intention of committing a crime.
 
 

“Was the intention to register a protest or to attack? Maybe the intention was to protest but the matter got out of hand. It should not have gone beyond the limit but it did,” Justice Mandokhail said.
“What happened on May 9 was a crime,” AGP Awan asserted.
Here, Justice Afghan told the attorney general that he had gone down the wrong path.
“We did not allow anyone to talk about the merits of the May 9 incident. Talking about the merits will affect the cases in the trial and appeal. If we go into the details of May 9, many questions will arise.
“Many questions arise that you may not be able to answer, such as whether the general who retired without pension was the Lahore Corps Commander,” Justice Afghan said.
AGP Awan responded in the affirmative that a Lahore Corps Commander was retired without pension benefits. When asked if the Lahore Corps Commander appeared as a witness before the trial court, the attorney general said the court would find out once the appeal is filed.
The state lawyer then asserted that he was not debating on the “merits of May 9” events but answering the questions raised.
 
 

At this point, Justice Mandokhail and Justice Hilali remarked that they were asking questions important for the country’s future. Upon Justice Hilali asking how many times the Army Act had been amended, AGP Awan replied that changes had been made to it “multiple times”.
“Amending the Constitution is a difficult task but the 26th Amendment was introduced. Why was the Army Act not amended? What is in the Official Secrets Act that even easy amendments are not introduced in it?” Justice Hilali asked.
AGP Awan then informed the court that so far, 86 individuals have filed appeals against their military court convictions. “Others will be given time to file an appeal,” he added.
Upon the attorney general saying that out of 45 minutes he had sought for arguments, he had allotted 20 minutes for Justice Mandokhail’s queries, the judge said: “I have no issue of my own. I am [only] thinking of the country’s future.”
Here, the AGP requested the bench to include an “observation” in its final ruling on the right to appeal of the convicted persons.
He recalled that there was a previous SC ruling advising the parliament to legislate to allow the extension in an army chief’s tenure. Justice Mazhar then pointed out that in that particular case, the parliament was given clear directions to enact the legislation within six months.
“Once a law is nullified, then the question of appeal does not arise,” Justice Aminuddin observed.
At this point during the hearing, Niazi came to the rostrum, saying he wanted to speak for five minutes.
He said: “My son Hassaan Niazi was sentenced to 10 years in prison. It was upsetting to hear praises that [defence ministry’s lawyer] Khawaja Harris did of military courts.
“Whoever violated a law should be punished,” Niazi added, recalling that the Prime Minister House, Parliament House and a radio station’s building were “attacked by mobs” in 2014.
 
 

“There was a plan to force the prime minister out of the PM House [but] those cases were heard in civilian courts,” Niazi contended.
He further argued that the crimes of the May 9 riots “could not be greater than a foreign conspiracy”. “We should have faith in our Supreme Court and civil courts,” the PTI activist’s father said, stating he wanted to see the rule of law in his country during his life.
When Niazi mentioned some Indian media reports on Kot Lakhpat jail where his son is imprisoned, Justice Hilali then assured Niazi: “Do not worry. Nothing of the sort will happen.”
Justice Mandokhail asserted, “Our (Pakistan’s) defence is strong.”
Military courts’ sentences
On Dec 13, 2024, the SC’s constitutional bench conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts of 85 civilians who were in custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.
Subsequently, on December 21, military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement. Days later, another 60 civilians were handed jail terms of a similar period over the matter.
On January 2, the mercy petitions of 19 accused were accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas have been processed to Courts of Appeal.
The sentencing of civilians by military courts was not only condemned by the PTI, but the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union also raised concerns, saying the move contradicted international laws.</p><small>2025-05-05 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603264-rain-unlikely-in-karachi-due-to-dry-winds-met-office' target='_blank'><strong>Rain unlikely in Karachi due to dry winds: Met Office</strong></a><br><p>

Sudan has dragged the UAE before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, arguing it is supplying weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been battling the Sudanese army since 2023.
The UAE denies supporting the rebels and has dismissed Sudan’s case as “political theatre” distracting from efforts to end a war that has killed tens of thousands.
The ICJ said today it “manifestly lacked” jurisdiction to rule on the case and threw out it out.
A UAE official hailed the judges’ ruling.
“This decision is a clear and decisive affirmation of the fact that this case was utterly baseless,” Reem Ketait, aeputy assistant minister for political affairs at the UAE foreign ministry, said in a statement sent to AFP.
Before the ruling, Ketait had accused Sudan of lodging the case in a “cynical attempt to divert attention from their own brutal record of atrocities against Sudanese civilians”.
When the UAE signed up to the UN’s Genocide Convention in 2005, it entered a “reservation” to a key clause that allows countries to sue others at the ICJ over disputes.
Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart by a power struggle between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
The war has triggered what aid agencies describe as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. Famine has officially hit five areas across Sudan, according to a UN-backed assessment.
The North Darfur region has been a particular battleground, with at least 542 civilians killed in the past three weeks, according to the United Nations.
The ICJ said it was “deeply concerned about the unfolding human tragedy in Sudan that forms the backdrop to the present dispute”.
“The violent conflict has a devastating effect, resulting in untold loss of life and suffering, in particular in West Darfur,” the court added.
A world away from the horrors on the ground, lawyers in robes and wigs thrashed out legal arguments in hearings last month in the panelled splendour of the ICJ’s Peace Palace.
Muawia Osman, Sudan’s acting justice minister, told the court last month, “[The] ongoing genocide would not be possible without UAE complicity, including the shipment of arms to the RSF.”
“The direct logistical and other support that the UAE has provided and continues to provide to the RSF has been and continues to be the primary driving force behind the genocide now taking place, including killing, rape, forced displacement and looting,” he added.
Responding for the UAE, top foreign ministry official Reem Ketait said Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”.
“This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE,” Ketait added.
Full reparations
In the end, legal experts had said Sudan’s case may flounder on technical jurisdictional issues.
“There is clearly no basis for the court’s jurisdiction in this case,” the UAE’s Ketait told the judges.
The UAE had called for the case to be thrown out and removed from the court’s list.
Sudan argued the UAE’s reservation was “incompatible” with the purpose of the Genocide Convention, which emphasises global collective responsibility to prevent the world’s worst crimes.
Khartoum wanted ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war.
The rulings of the ICJ, which hears disputes between states, are final and binding, but the court has no means to ensure compliance.
Judges ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine to no avail, for example, and ruled that Israel’s 57-year occupation of Palestinian land was illegal.</p><small>2025-05-05 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/051921421afe011.jpg?r=192414' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908625/us-seeks-to-weaken-global-development-finance-efforts-un-document-shows' target='_blank'><strong>US seeks to weaken global development finance efforts, UN document shows</strong></a><br><p>The United States is seeking to weaken a global deal aimed at helping developing countries struggling with the impacts of climate change and other issues, an internal United Nations document seen by Reuters showed.
The Trump administration opposes draft reforms of the world’s financial system intended to help developing countries, including around taxation, credit ratings and fossil fuel subsidies. It also wants mentions of “climate”, “gender equality” and “sustainability” stripped out.
The previously unreported document sheds light on how the Trump administration is seeking to imprint an “America First” agenda, including opposition to efforts to slow climate change and promote diversity, on the institutions at the heart of fixing global systemic crises.
The once-a-decade, 4th International Conference on Financing for Development (FFD4) in Seville, Spain, in June aims to influence the strategic direction of the world’s development finance institutions. Countries agreed at FFD3, for example, to broaden tax cooperation efforts so that developing countries could help set the rules, and as of last May, more than 140 countries were involved.
“This conference is about bringing the world’s leaders together and setting the underlying rules and priorities for financing development goals over the next decade,” Tom Mitchell, executive director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, told Reuters.
Compiled by the permanent representatives to the UN of Mexico, Nepal, Norway, and Zambia, with help from the UN secretariat, the April 11 negotiating draft is annotated with the positions of the 193 nations involved in the discussions.
With ongoing changes at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in the fight against climate change already facing pushback from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the document showed it was seeking to water down further reform efforts.
Among specific points in the text that refer to the systemic reform, the document shows the US wants to remove a reference to a “package of reforms” for sustainable development. It wants to replace a line promising to “commit to reform the international financial architecture” with a pledge to “recognise the need to enhance its resilience and effectiveness in responding to present and future challenges and crises”.
Such changes in language signal the degree of shared commitment that can then be used as support for action or inaction in future talks.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has acknowledged the need to overcome multiple challenges ahead of the conference, but urged “all countries to be at the table in Sevilla focused on solutions”, spokesperson Florencia Soto Niño said in an email to Reuters.
The White House and Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment. The State Department declined to comment.
While the US position on development has become tougher under Trump, the negotiating document shows it remains supportive of efforts that include developing countries working more closely with the private sector, and fostering innovation and financial literacy.
Climate Change
A key goal of the global reforms is to better help poorer nations cope with weather disasters, which are worsening due to climate change, and to boost economic development using low-carbon energy rather than traditional fossil fuels.
President Donald Trump has quit the UN Paris climate agreement, slashed US foreign development aid by more than 80 per cent as part of a government overhaul led by billionaire Elon Musk and embarked on a trade war that is hurting many poorer nations.
Among areas of the FFD4 document that the US objects to is a call for countries to explore “global solidarity levies” that could include taxes on highly polluting activities or on the super-rich to finance sustainable development.
If included, the levies could be taken up in UN negotiations on taxes this year and would bolster a task force led by France, Kenya and Barbados that aims to develop such taxes among smaller groups of countries.
Other countries to object include Russia, Saudi Arabia and China.
The US is also seeking to delete a paragraph calling for companies to pay tax to the countries where economic activity occurs; a paragraph on helping developing countries bolster tax transparency; and another on phasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, the document shows.
Many of the world’s poorest countries struggle with high debt and the costs of rebuilding after disastrous storms, but the FFD4 document shows the US wants to strike a paragraph on reforming the credit-rating system.
That includes a push for raters to take a more forgiving approach to poorer nations that voluntarily restructure their debt to invest in green projects, it showed.
The US also opposes a commitment to ensure countries receive “adequate and uninterrupted funding on appropriate terms of social protection and other essential social spending during shocks and crises”, the document shows.
While the US has considerable influence as the biggest shareholder in both the World Bank, which provides loans and grants to developing countries, and the International Monetary Fund, and is currently reviewing its role in both, the draft deal is likely to change further as countries continue negotiations in May, before reaching consensus on a final document in mid-June.
The US position puts pressure on other countries to accept a weaker deal, since the talks aim to adopt a deal by consensus.</p><small>2025-05-05 14:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603239-violation-of-pakistans-territorial-sovereignty-will-be-met-with-full-force-warns-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Violation of Pakistan's territorial sovereignty will be met with full force, warns COAS</strong></a><br><p>

The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in six intervals, previously stood at 12pc.
April inflation stood at a low of 0.3pc, largely due to a high base a year ago. The reduction is also primarily attributed to lower prices of key food staples such as wheat and its derivatives, onions, potatoes and certain pulses, as well as a cut in electricity and fuel charges. These items carry significant weight in the inflation basket — the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — meaning minor price changes can heavily influence the overall rate.
According to a notification issued by the SBP today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the interest rate, noting that inflation in April turned out to be lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in prices of perishable food items and electricity and fuel charges.
According to the statement, core inflation declined in April, primarily reflecting favourable base-effect amid moderate demand conditions.
“Overall, the MPC assessed that the inflation outlook has improved further relative to the previous assessment,” the statement said.
The committee viewed that the heightened global uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs and geopolitical developments could pose challenges for the economy.
“In this backdrop, the MPC emphasised the importance of maintaining a measured monetary policy stance,” it said.
The committee also noted key developments since the last meeting.
It said that the provisional real GDP growth for Q2-FY25 was reported at 1.7 per cent year-on-year whereas Q1 growth was revised up to 1.3pc from 0.9pc.
“Second, the current account recorded a sizable surplus of $1.2 billion in March, mainly due to record-high workers’ remittances,” it said.
It said that the surplus and SBP’s foreign exchange purchases partially cushioned the impact of large ongoing debt repayments on the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves.
It also said that recent surveys suggested further improvement in both consumer and business sentiments, adding that shortfall in tax collection has continued to widen.
“Global uncertainty, particularly around tariffs, has led the IMF to sharply downgrade its 2025 and 2026 growth projections for both advanced and emerging economies,” the statement said, adding that the tariff uncertainty also triggered heightened financial market volatility and a sharp decline in global oil prices.
“Considering the evolving developments and risks, the MPC viewed that the real policy rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation in the target range of 5pc to 7pc, while ensuring that the economy grows on a sustainable basis,” it said.
Separately, the statement said that headline inflation, continuing its downtrend, fell to 0.3pc y/y in April, driven primarily by food and energy prices.
“A sharp decline in wheat and allied product prices, moderation in global commodity prices and downward adjustment in electricity tariffs were the major drivers of this ease in food and energy prices,” the statement said.
“These factors also contributed to the moderation in inflation expectations of consumers,” it said.
Moreover, core inflation, after remaining sticky at around 9pc over the past few months, declined to 8.0pc y/y in April, it added.
The statement said that going forward, the committee anticipated inflation to gradually inch up in the coming months and stabilise within the target range of 5pc to 7pc.
“This outlook is, however, subject to both upside and downside risks emanating from volatility in wheat and other food prices, timing and magnitude of energy price adjustments, potential global supply-chain disruptions and uncertain commodity price outlook.”
Earlier, it noted that despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11pc, opinions on the central bank’s likely decision on the policy rate were divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.
Researchers had conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.
However, many experts believed the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some had also found reasons for a likely status quo as they feel the war-like situation between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.
This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in the face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.
The SBP’s MPC met today to set the key interest rate for the next two months. In March, the central bank delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate unchanged in the last review, disappointing the business community.</p><small>2025-05-05 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603230-russia-iran-call-for-de-escalation-in-india-pakistan-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Russia, Iran call for de-escalation in India-Pakistan tensions</strong></a><br><p>

Tensions between the two countries have spiked following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan vehemently rejected the allegation and called for a neutral probe.
A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company, the state-run NHPC and authorities in the India-occupied Kashmir, the three sources said, according to Reuters.
They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
The work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other projects launch similar efforts.
There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.
India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008-2009, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work, the sources added.
India’s NHPC and the neighbouring governments did not reply to emails from Reuters to seek comment.
The flushing operation ran for three days from May 1, the sources said.
“This is the first time such an exercise has taken place and will help in more efficient power generation and prevent damage to turbines,” one of the sources told Reuters.
“We were also asked to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which we did from May 1,” the source said, adding that the effort aimed to free the dam operation from any restrictions.
People living on the banks of the Chenab river in the India-occupied Kashmir said they noticed water had been released from both Salal and Baglihar dams from Thursday to Saturday.
Separately, Press Trust of India posted a video on its X account reporting that India has restricted the flow of water through the Balighar dam on the Chenab River.
 






‘Suspension of treaty means free will’
The flushing of hydropower projects requires nearly emptying a reservoir to force out sediments whose build-up is a major cause of decline in output.
For example, two of the sources said that power delivered by the 690-megawatt Salal project was far below its capacity, because Pakistan had prevented such flushing, while silting also hit output at the 900-MW Baglihar project.
“Flushing is not a common thing because it leads to a lot of water wastage,” said one of the sources. “Downstream countries are expected to be informed in case it leads to any inundation.”
Building both projects had required extensive back and forth with Pakistan, which worries about losing out on its share of water.
Under the 1960 treaty, which split the Indus and its tributaries between the neighbours, India had also shared data such as hydrological flows at various spots on the rivers flowing through India and issued flood warnings.
India’s water minister has vowed to “ensure no drop of the Indus river’s water reaches Pakistan”.
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately. The treaty has allowed it only to build hydropower plants without significant storage dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
The suspension means India “can now pursue our projects at free will”, said Kushvinder Vohra, a recently retired head of India’s Central Water Commission who worked on Indus disputes with Pakistan.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has sought to renegotiate the treaty in recent years, and the two countries have tried to settle some of their differences at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague.
These concerns relate to the size of the water storage area at the region’s Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants.</p><small>2025-05-05 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603221-sindh-to-impose-ban-on-plastic-bags-from-june-15' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh to impose ban on plastic bags from June 15</strong></a><br><p>
