PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed his dissatisfaction with the help provided by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to the flood-affected population of KP, stating that the authority “did not help as much as it should have”.
“I say at this forum that we will continue to be at odds with the NDMA,” Gohar said on the floor. “I said day-before-yesterday that the NDMA only gave us a few supplies in Buner, while 236 people have been killed, 120 are injured, and 1,470 shops and 875 homes have been destroyed.”
 


Gohar was then interrupted by Law and Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, before Speaker Ayaz Sadiq stepped in and offered to arrange a visit of the opposition to the NDMA’s head office.
Tarar termed Gohar’s complaint as “politics just for the sake of politics” and urged the party to focus on people’s issues.

Despite Sindh being home to the mega port city of Karachi, the financial centre of the country that sprawls along the Arabian coastline, children in rural areas just a few hours away face stark levels of wasting and stunting.
In the arid village of Sujawal, lethargic children with prominent bones wilt in the searing heat as social workers educate mothers on nutrient-rich ingredients and dispel myths around food.
“Before, we only gave our children potatoes because they were always available at home,” said Shahnaz, 25, who has radically changed the diet of her six children, weak and frequently sick, after a year of classes.
Now, convinced that children should eat a varied diet, she has introduced affordable ingredients such as lentils and semolina into her cooking, lifting her daughter out of malnutrition.
In impoverished rural Sindh, 48 per cent of children under five suffer from malnutrition and 20pc from its most severe form, wasting, according to the latest national survey on the issue conducted in 2018.
In this class, Azma, a social worker, shows mothers how to cook with semolina — easily available in the market.
“Semolina is cheap — for 50 rupees it can last a week if you’re feeding one to two spoonfuls daily to a six-month-old child,” she explained to AFP.
In Sindh, a province of 55 million people where contraception remains taboo and large families are the norm, 3,500 mothers have benefited from cooking classes developed by UNICEF.
Like many mothers in the area, Kulsoom, 23 and pregnant with her sixth child, all born prematurely and underweight, once only fed her children pieces of fried flatbread.
“One of my children died, and my youngest is extremely weak, so I was advised to take these classes,” said Kulsoom, who goes by only one name, like most women in her district.

No spices
Parents are recommended to feed babies solid foods from about six months old, but in rural Sindh, this often means adult leftovers, too spicy for young stomachs.
“The main problem is the lack of dietary diversity,” says Mazhar Iqbal, a nutritionist for UNICEF.
In Pakistan, 38pc of children eat only two or fewer of the eight food categories recommended by UNICEF.
Meat is saved for special occasions, yet inexpensive protein alternatives exist, such as chicken offal, boiled bones, lentils and beans.
As for fruit and vegetables, they are usually fried, losing their nutrients.
Bakhtawar Kareem joined the programme after her child died of anaemia.
“I have no money. Sometimes we eat, sometimes we don’t,” she lamented, scanning the swollen belly of her one-year-old daughter, who has only sparse clumps of hair.
Like 72pc of children in the village, her daughter has stunting, well above the average rate in Pakistan of 42pc — one of the highest in the world.
Stunting is most closely associated with brain development and physical growth, and can have long-term physical and mental impacts.
Vulnerable to a lack of clean water and sanitation, which contributes to malnutrition, children often also suffer from dengue fever or malaria, from vomiting, diarrhoea, or difficulty urinating, and have abnormally swollen bellies.

Women eat leftovers
But the vicious cycle of malnutrition begins with the mothers.
“With early marriages and repeated pregnancies, more than 45pc of women in Sindh are anaemic,” said the nutritionist.
“This increases the risk of having low birth weight babies, who are more likely to suffer from malnutrition.”
In Sujawal, where only a quarter of the population can read and write, myths about food also deprive women of vital nutrients.
Farrah Naz, the head of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition in Pakistan, regularly has to repeat that eggs and dried fruits do not cause women to bleed more during their periods.
Cultural norms around women serving meals to men first and eating the leftovers — despite the physical work they carry out in the fields — also contribute to poor health.
“And when food runs out, it’s their rations that are cut first.”

The startup, heavily backed by Amazon, is known for its Claude chatbot and positions itself as focused on AI safety and responsible development.
Companies based in China, as well as in countries including Russia, North Korea and Iran, are already unable to access Anthropic’s commercial services over legal and security concerns.
ChatGPT and other products from US competitor OpenAI are also unavailable within China — spurring the growth of homegrown AI models from Chinese companies such as Alibaba and Baidu.
Anthropic said in a statement dated Friday that it was going a step further in an update to its terms of service.
Despite current restrictions, some groups “continue accessing our services in various ways, such as through subsidiaries incorporated in other countries,” the US firm said.
So “this update prohibits companies or organisations whose ownership structures subject them to control from jurisdictions where our products are not permitted, like China, regardless of where they operate.”
Anthropic — valued at $183 billion — said that the change would affect entities more than 50 per cent owned, directly or indirectly, by companies in unsupported regions.
“This is the first time a major US AI company has imposed a formal, public prohibition of this kind,” said Nicholas Cook, a lawyer focused on the AI industry with 15 years of experience at international law firms in China.
“The immediate commercial effect may be modest, since US AI providers already face barriers to operating in this market and relevant groups have been self-selecting for their own locally developed AI tech,” he told AFP.
But “taking a stance like this will inevitably lead to questions as to whether others will or should take a similar approach”. An Anthropic executive told the Financial Times that the move would have an impact on revenues in the “low hundreds of millions of dollars”.
The San Francisco-headquartered company was founded in 2021 by former executives from OpenAI.
It announced this week it had raised $13bn in its latest funding round, saying it now has more than 300,000 business customers. And the number of accounts on pace to generate more than $100,000 annually is nearly seven times larger than a year ago, Anthropic said on Tuesday.
Some users in China do access US generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Claude by using VPN services.
Assumptions that the US was far ahead of China in the fast-moving AI sector were upended this year when Chinese start-up DeepSeek unveiled a chatbot that matched top American systems for an apparent fraction of the cost.</p><small>2025-09-05 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622063-new-recipes-help-pakistani-mothers-ward-off-malnutrition' target='_blank'><strong>New recipes help Pakistani mothers ward off malnutrition</strong></a><br><p>

Abbottabad police spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com, “The accident took place as the school children were crossing the road near the Lady Garden public park.”
Afzal said a first information report was registered against the driver who fled the scene. The dumper had also been seized, he added.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi said, “A rescue team was immediately dispatched to the accident site after receiving information about the incident. The bodies of the deceased, as well as the injured children, were taken to the district headquarters hospital.”
Following the incident, family members of the children and local residents staged a protest and blocked the Old Karakoram Highway, police spokesperson Afzal said.
They were demanding the arrest of the dumper truck’s driver, Afzal said, adding that the protest ended after negotiations and assurance by the police that the driver would be arrested.
Accidents involving dumpers are common in Pakistan, often linked to reckless driving, overloading, and poor vehicle maintenance, combined with weak enforcement of traffic laws. Many dumper drivers lack proper training, drive long hours without rest, or speed aggressively on congested roads, making it difficult to control such heavy vehicles.
In August, two siblings were killed and their father was injured in a road accident involving a dumper on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road.
In July, at least five people were killed in a collision between a car and a truck in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district.
A young man and a woman also died in a road accident in February in Lahore when their car collided with a dumper. Both of them suffered multiple head and neck injuries which proved fatal.</p><small>2025-09-05 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622056-senate-panel-seeks-pm-shehbazs-view-on-womens-representation-in-cci' target='_blank'><strong>Senate panel seeks PM Shehbaz's view on women's representation in CCI</strong></a><br><p>

According to it, a low-pressure system currently exists over the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and is likely to move towards west and northwest. It may travel to Rajasthan and its adjoining parts of Sindh on Sept 6.
Due to this weather system, strong monsoon currents are likely to penetrate Sindh and eastern Punjab from Sept 6 onwards.
The Met department has predicted that under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread rain and windstorm / thundershowers, coupled with scattered heavy to very heavy falls, are expected to hit Tharparkar, Islamkot, Nagarparkar, Chachro, Dhali, Diplo, Kaloi, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Matiari, Tando Allayar, Tando Mohammad Khan, Hyderabad, Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Jamshoro, Dadu, Kashmore, Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Shikarpur and Ghotki from Sept 6 (evening / night) to Sept 9 with occasional gaps.
Torrential rains may cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Mirpurkhas, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tharparkar, Khairpur, Sukkur, Larkana, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Hyderabad and Karachi from Sept 7 to 9, it said.

Sabalenka overcame Pegula 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a re-run of last year’s final and is seeking to become the first player to successfully defend the title in New York since Serena Williams in 2014.
The 27-year-old from Belarus is through to her third successive US Open final.
 






“It was a really tough match — she (Pegula) played incredible tennis as always and I had to work really hard to get this win,” said Sabalenka.
“Just super happy to be back in the final and hopefully I can go all the way again.”
Sabalenka has now made the final at four of the last five Grand Slams but has not added to her haul of three majors since winning the 2024 US Open.
She finished runner-up at the Australian Open and Roland Garros earlier this year.
“I badly wanted to give myself another opportunity, another final, and I want to prove to myself that I learned those tough lessons and I can do better in the finals,” added Sabalenka.
She landed the first blow in the sixth game against Pegula, who saved a pair of break points before the Belarusian’s persistence paid off as she surged into a 4-2 lead.
A sloppy service game from Sabalenka allowed Pegula to respond immediately.
The American then held to level at 4-4 and put the pressure right back on the top seed.
An error from Sabalenka gave Pegula another break for a 5-4 advantage and she served out to love to take the first set, to the delight of the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd.
Sabalenka reset though and roared back to reel off the first three games of the second set, an early break the difference as she sent the match to a deciding set.
A break to open the third set saw Sabalenka edge 2-0 ahead. She scrambled to save three break points and stay in control at 4-2 in and fought off another in the eighth game to close in on victory.
Pegula held and forced Sabalenka to get over the line on her own serve. She eventually converted a third match point with a crunching forehand winner to her palpable relief.
“It was too good from her today at some points,” said Pegula.
Wimbledon rematch in final
Sabalenka will try to avenge her Wimbledon semi-final loss to Anisimova on Saturday.
The eighth-seeded Anisimova reached her second major final in a row after rallying to overcome Osaka 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 in a match that stretched well past midnight in New York.
“I wasn’t sure I would make it past the finish line. I tried to dig deep.
It was a huge fight out there,” said Anisimova.
“It means the world. I’m trying to process that right now, it’s a dream come true. The hope is to be the champion but I’m in the final now and I’m excited.”
 






Osaka, seeded 23rd, was enjoying her best Grand Slam run since winning her second Australian Open title in 2021 — the last of her four major crowns.
She looked on course to go a step further after taking the first set in a tie-break, boasting a 26-1 record at this level when doing so.
Four breaks in six games to begin the second set betrayed the nerves on both sides.
Anisimova broke for third time to go 5-4 up, but as in the previous two instances then lost her own serve, double-faulting to keep Osaka in the set.
In a reversal of the first tie-break, Anisimova took charge of the second to level the contest.
Anisimova carried that momentum into the decider and broke for a 3-1 cushion as she continued to punish Osaka’s ineffective second serve.
Two comfortable service games moved Anisimova 5-2 clear. Osaka held before the American earned two match points in a dramatic final game.
Osaka saved both and carved out two break points only for Anisimova to cut short the comeback and secure victory at the third attempt.</p><small>2025-09-05 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/05105104afff3c0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939829/punjab-cm-under-fire-over-port-a-loo-gaffe' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM under fire over  ‘port-a-loo’ gaffe</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz came under fire from social media users on Thursday for sharing a two-year old image and claiming that it showed measures taken for the rehabilitation of flood victims.
“Innovated portable washrooms constructed and placed at relief camps in Chiniot,” she wrote on X, uploading a photo of a portable washroom.
But the image attached to the post — while showing a port-a-loo — also carries the date it was taken, which shows that it was taken in 2023.
Eagle-eyed social media users soon spotted that the photo did not appear to be recent, and was taken from the website of an online marketplace.
 






“Maryam should seriously consider sacking her PR & media team,” a journalist suggested on X (formerly Twitter).
Following the brouhaha over the outdated image, X accounts linked to PML-N began uploading images and videos from Chiniot, showing the actual portable washrooms that had been provided for those hit by the flood.
The account claimed that the Chiniot administration had shared the fresh video, adding that portable bathrooms are available in the field for flood victims to ensure their dignity was protected.
“The photo shared by the CM was shown as an example on a trial basis,” the account @EPropoganda1 wrote – which usually offers alternative views to posts that appear sympathetic to the PTI’s cause on social media.
A few days ago, the Punjab CM had hauled up the Mandi Bahauddin Deputy Commissioner for displaying her photograph on a mosque and ordered all departments to follow SOPs regarding the use of her likeness.

Fakhar hit an aggressive 44-ball 77 not out for his 12th T20I half century while Mohammad Nawaz smashed an undefeated 27-ball 37 to revive Pakistan from 80-5 Pakistan to 171-5 in their 20 overs.
Abrar then grabbed 4-9 in four economical overs to restrict UAE to 140-7 with opener Alishan Sharafu fighting a lone hand, scoring a steady 51-ball 68. Sharafu hit four sixes and as many fours.
 






“Fakhar and Nawaz played outstandingly well,” Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said after the match.
“Fakhar is a match-winner — he doesn’t always get the respect he deserves but he showed his (class) today.”
The win, Pakistan’s third in four games, not only took Pakistan to Sunday’s final but also ensured Afghanistan who face the hosts in the last group on Friday, would advance.
UAE’s power-hitters Mohammad Waseem fell for 19 and Asif Khan for seven as UAE suffered their third defeat in as many games.
Abrar’s previous best of 3-19 came against Bangladesh in Lahore earlier this year.
“I was watching the earlier matches and looking at the pitch conditions so I bowled accordingly,” said the bespectacled spinner. “Yes, there is a bit of extra pressure but the captain told me to be ready at any stage.”
 






Earlier, Pakistan lost five wickets for just 80 runs in 11.3 overs after they won the toss and batted.
Openers Saim Ayub scored 11 and Sahibzada Farhan made 16. Skipper Salman Agha hit seven, Mohammad Haris 14 and Hasan Nawaz four.
Fakhar and Nawaz added 91 off 51 balls for the sixth wicket to put the innings back on track.
It was Fakhar’s first half century in 14 innings since a match against Ireland at Dublin in May last year.
Fakhar’s knock contained two sixes and ten fours. Nawaz hit two sixes and three fours.
The pair launched vicious late attack, with 74 coming off the last five overs and 42 off the last two.
Nawaz smashed three fours and a six in Junaid Siddique’s penultimate over while Fakhar cracked five consecutive boundaries off Mohammad Jawadullah’s last over.
“Credit goes to Fakhar and Nawaz; they gave us those extra 20 runs,” said Salman. “We knew if we got to 170, we could defend it.”
Spinner Haider Ali was the most successful home bowler with 2-17.

“The government manipulated sugar prices by managing the supply of imported sugar verses locally produced sugar. As a result, Rs300-400 billion were taken out of the pockets of ordinary citizens and transferred into the hands of sugar mill owners,” Mr Abbasi said, addressing a news conference.
He added that government policies had provided undue benefits to sugar mill owners, while the beverages industry and other factories were forced to buy sugar at higher rates.
He claimed that even today an additional Rs1bn was going to sugar mill owners through the sale of costly sugar in the retail markets. The government, parliament and price control committees have failed to protect the consumers from this extortion.
“This is the state of governance in country,” Mr Abbasi remarked, adding, “The price of sugar has increased by 50 per cent in one year.”
 







Accuses NAB of protecting corrupt business practices instead of holding mill owners accountable

The former premier asked: “Will anyone answer for this sugar price hike?” He said that those in the government should at least admit their mistake, adding that NAB’s job seemed to be protecting corr­u­pt business practices in the country. The APP convener further said that the job of governments was to provide facilities to the people, but, successive governments had failed and caused economic hardships.
He said that the time to control markets through administrative efforts was over and added that if the price of sugar increases by just one rupee, Rs7bn are taken away from people.
 






He pointed out that there was a sugar monitoring committee of the cabinet and at least seven to eight other committees responsible for sugar price control.
“Despite so many committees, the price of sugar went up. When there was already a shortage in the country, why did the government allow its export?” he asked.
“The strange part is that while the private sector was exporting sugar, the government was importing it— and at prices higher than the international market,” he added. He concluded that sugar had not only become more expensive but had also grown scarce in the markets.

In a letter addressed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the forum said preliminary assessments indicated the loss of approximately 60 per cent of the rice crop, 35pc of cotton, and 30pc of sugarcane in central and southern Punjab.
Over 1.8 million people across the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej river basins have reportedly been severely affected, with floodwaters now moving southwards along the Indus River.
 
 

“The scale of devastation is staggering,” the letter stated, warning that key agricultural targets set for the current fiscal year may now be unattainable. It cautioned that Sindh could soon face a similar catastrophe if immediate preventive measures are not taken.
The PBF stated that losses have already run into billions of rupees, endangering rural livelihoods and placing additional stress on the broader economy. It emphasised that unless swift, coordinated action is taken, the crisis could spiral into a protracted humanitarian and economic emergency.

PBF warns 60pc of rice, 35pc of cotton and 30pc of sugarcane lost in Punjab; calls for loans, reforms to combat flood devastation

Calling the situation unprecedented, the forum proposed that the federal government officially declare an Agricultural Emergency and initiate immediate relief measures, including the provision of interest-free loans of up to Rs2 million for small and medium-sized farmers to support replantation and recovery efforts.
It also called for the launch of critical canal infrastructure projects in Punjab and Sindh to improve water management and resilience against future flooding.
While appreciating the government’s broader efforts in steering the country through various national challenges, the PBF stressed that the current agricultural crisis required a focused and urgent response. “This is no time for business as usual,” the letter read.
 
 

In addition to emergency aid, the forum recommended longer-term structural reforms. These include removing illegal encroachments along riverbanks, strengthening provincial irrigation and revenue departments, and implementing community-level water storage systems as part of a sustainable flood management strategy.
The PBF also called for the activation of district price control committees to curb hoarding and profiteering in staple food markets. Anticipating sharp supply shortages, it urged the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to authorise the import of wheat and rice through both public and private sector channels to ensure domestic price stability.
“The time for reactive planning is over,” said Khawaja Mehboob ur Rehman, President of the Pakistan Business Forum. “This crisis must be treated as a wake-up call to reform agricultural strategies. We must stop viewing floods purely as disasters and start managing them as resources.”
He added that the PBF stands ready to work closely with the government in crafting and executing a policy framework aimed at stabilising the agricultural sector and securing the country’s food future.
With floodwaters still advancing and relief efforts stretched thin, the PBF’s call reflects growing pressure on the federal and provincial governments to take decisive action to mitigate the immediate fallout and avert longer-term agricultural and economic decline.

Speaking to the Karachi Bar Association (KBA), the SC judge observed that the only way forward is through the Constitution, adding that every authority had taken an oath to abide by it.
He argued that the foundation of the Constitution is the people’s right to rule, and set out a simple test: “No institution or government officer should engage in political engineering. Public representatives must come through free and fair elections. But till today this has only remained our dream.”
In a post on his X account, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — who had famously spoken about the ‘hybrid system’ in glowing terms — responded to the Supreme Court judge’s remarks later in the day.

Praises those who stuck to their principles despite all odds; says judges ‘allowed themselves to be used’ in Z.A. Bhutto case

Asif pointed out that Mr Minallah had himself served as a provincial minister in the former NWFP government under Gen Musharraf, saying that this was also a “declared martial law”, and called for self-reflection.
It should be recalled that subsequently, Mr Minallah became one of the leading figures of the lawyers’ movement for the restoration of the judiciary.
In his remarks at ‘Independence of the Judiciary, Constitutional Governance and Access to Justice: The Way Forward’, a seminar held at the City Courts, Justice Minallah lamented the judiciary’s past failures, while praising those who upheld principles, even at great personal cost.
He singled out as his heroes five judges of the then-Sindh Chief Court who, in the landmark Maulvi Tamizuddin case, moved to restore the country’s first Constituent Assembly after it was dissolved in 1954 by governor-general Ghulam Muhammad.
“Had those five judges been taken as role models, and had that decision been upheld by the Federal Court at the time, Pakistan would not have seen 77 years of dictatorship; instead, the rule of law would have prevailed,” Justice Minallah said, lamenting that today “people hesitate even to name those judges as their role models”.
The Sindh Chief Court’s decision in favour of Maulvi Tamizuddin — the assembly’s speaker — was eventually overturned on technical grounds by the Federal Court.
Justice Minallah linked that early  precedent to subsequent episodes in which courts, in his view, failed to stand firm.
Musharraf vs SC judges
He recalled that when Gen Pervez Mus­harraf suspended the Constitution in 1999 and issued a Provisional Constitutional Order, some Supr­eme Court judges refused to take fresh oath.
“Out of those six judges, five belonged to Sindh,” he said. “Some were in line to become chief justice, but they made a principled decision in light of their oath.”
His remarks come amid strains within the Islam­abad High Court, where judges are split over the new Establ­ishment (Ap­­­p­­ointment and Con­ditions of Service) Rules, 2025. Despite resistance from senior judges, the rules were approved by a narrow majority, while a bid by Justices Babar Sattar and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan to alter the meeting’s agenda was vetoed.
“The 77-year judicial history is not a matter of pride for me,” the judge told the audience, adding that his leaders were those who led the lawyers’ movement,” referring to the nationwide mobilisation that followed the 2007 sacking of the chief justice by Musharraf.
“For the past 77 years, there has been no constitutional governance here,” he said. “In many of my high court judgements, I wrote that there is no rule of law.”
Revisiting Bhutto’s trial
Justice Minallah also revisited one of Pakistan’s most contentious judicial episodes: the 1979 execution of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
Referring to an interview by General Ziaul Haq, Justice Minallah said the army chief was asked whether judges would be under pressure during the trial of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. He added that the general replied, “No, that is not the case.” However, Justice Minallah said those very judges later admitted that they had “sent him to the gallows under pressure.”
“But even after 40 years, though the Supreme Court admitted it, no one was held accountable,” he said.
 
 

He further said that in the entire episode, judges were used because they willingly allowed themselves to be used. “Yet even then, three judges dissented,” two of whom belonged to this bar, he said, including Justice Dorab Patel.
Senior lawyer Munir A. Malik, who also spoke at the event, noted that he had the chance to share a platform with Justice Minallah after 18 years.
“I consider Athar Minallah and some judges from Islamabad as an endangered species,” he said, tongue-in-cheek.

While the department’s official name is set in law, Trump in an executive order is authorising use of the new label as a “secondary title” by his administration, a White House document said.
Defence officials are permitted to use “secondary titles such as ‘Secretary of War,’…in official correspondence, public communications, ceremonial contexts, and non-statutory documents within the executive branch,” according to the document.
It was not immediately clear when Trump planned to sign the order, but his public schedule for Friday said he would be signing executive orders in the afternoon as well as making an announcement in the Oval Office.
The president, a marketing-savvy real estate developer, has repeatedly said in recent weeks that he was mulling such a change.
Late last month, the 79-year-old Republican claimed the Defence Department’s title was too “defensive.”
The Department of War “was the name when we won World War I, we won World War II, we won everything,” he told reporters on August 25.
According to the White House document, the name change “conveys a stronger message of readiness and resolve.”
Established in the early days of US independence, the Department of War historically oversaw American land forces.
A government reorganisation after World War II brought it along with the US Navy and Air Force under the unified National Military Establishment, which in 1949 was retitled to the Department of Defense.
“Restoring the name ‘Department of War’ will sharpen the focus of this Department on our national interest and signal to adversaries America’s readiness to wage war to secure its interests,” the White House document said.
The move is the latest overhaul at the Pentagon since Trump took office in January and appointed former Fox News host Pete Hegseth to lead the sprawling department.
Hegseth, a combat veteran, has repeatedly touted the push to restore a “warrior ethos” in the department, and has lambasted prior administrations for policies he and Trump have derided as “woke.”
Hegseth notably has sought to expel transgender troops from the military and change the names of bases that honoured Confederate troops back to their original titles, after they were renamed under former president Joe Biden.
While Trump’s order could potentially be rescinded by a future president, it “instructs the Secretary of War to recommend actions, to include legislative and executive actions, required to permanently rename” the department, the White House document said.</p><small>2025-09-05 04:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68ba1c178c52b.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939762/yamuna-crosses-danger-mark-as-heavy-rains-flood-delhi' target='_blank'><strong>Yamuna crosses danger mark as heavy rains flood Delhi</strong></a><br><p>• Muddy water pours into many homes in low-lying areas
• People wade through floodwaters in areas surrounding historic Red Fort
• Crops across tens of thousands of acres destroyed in Punjab
• Torrential rain in hilly areas has swollen several rivers
NEW DELHI: Parts of Delhi and India-held Kashmir were flooded on Thursday after two rivers breached the danger mark following heavy rain in several northern areas, but weather officials forecast some respite from downpours.
A fierce monsoon season has brought immense destruction in the region this year, killing at least 130 people in August.
Torrential rain in the hilly areas of occupied Jammu and Kashmir, the Himlayan enclave of Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh has swollen many rivers, which have crossed danger levels.
Residential areas were flooded in the key city of Srinagar after a breach of the Jhelum river embankment, and authorities urged people to evacuate homes.
“The Jhelum is climbing, but at a much slower rate than was feared,” Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of held Kashmir, said in a post on X. “The administration is not going to lower its guard. We continue to monitor the situation very closely.”
 






Rescuers searched for any people trapped under debris after the rain triggered a landslide at the Ratle hydroelectric power project on the Chenab river in Drabshalla, officials said.
Indian weather officials have forecast showers to ease off on Thursday, with moderate rain expected in held Kashmir and the state of Uttarkhand.
In Delhi, the capital, the Yamuna river passed the danger mark on Tuesday, in a flow the Central Water Commission described as a ‘severe’ situation.
On Thursday, muddy water poured into many homes in low-lying areas, from which thousands had already been evacuated to safer places as a precaution.
Authorities shut the historic Loha Pul, or Iron Bridge, spanning the Yamuna in the older part of the city.
People waded through floodwaters in areas surrounding the historic Red Fort, many carrying an idol of Lord Ganesha, the Hindu god who vanquishes obstacles, for immersion in the river waters in an annual ritual.
Crops across tens of thousands of hectares have been destroyed by the rains in the breadbasket state of Punjab where 37 have died since August began.
The deluge spurred authorities to release water pent up in dams, further flooding areas in both India and Pakistan.

One can understand the sentiment. There is a certain reassurance in watching a child hunched over homework or attending an after-school tutoring session. Academic involvement at least on the surface, offers structure, purpose and a shield from the unpredictability of the outside world. A child inside the home focused on schoolwork ap­­pears safe. But this comforting illusion carries its own paradox, perhaps even its own quiet danger.
Much of this academic engagement now takes place online. Children are expected to complete assignments, do school projects or join tutoring sessions online. Parents, seeing them glued to their screens in the name of learning, may feel reassured. But the screen is porous. The very device meant for education is the same portal through which children slide into the vast and largely unregulated arena of the internet.
Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok do not immediately strike one as threatening in the way city traffic or unlit parks might. Yet they ca­r­ry their own insidious risks such as cyberbullying, exposure to inappropriate content, compulsive scrolling and the constant pressure to seek online validation. The shift from educational eng­agem­ent to digital distraction can happen in seconds. And while a bruised knee from playing outdoors may be noticed and addressed, the effects of on­­line harms including low self-esteem, anxiety or withdrawal, often remain hidden for a long time.

Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok carry their own insidious risks.

This reality challenges traditional notions of safety. The digital world is not inherently dangerous, but it is complex, sophisticated and designed to be addictive. Children still learning to regulate emotions and behaviour are particularly vulnerable to its design.
 
 

The issue, therefore, is not only the amount of screen time, but also the nature of that engagement. Are children using digital tools to explore, learn and create, or are they passively consuming content that erodes attention, self-worth and authentic connection?
There is also a broader social dynamic at play. In many households, the increase in academic pressure mirrors a growing anxiety among parents about the future. In competitive education systems, academic achievement is often seen as the most reliable path to opportunity. Add to this the heightened fears around safety in public spaces and the result is a generation of children who are over-scheduled, over-supervised and inc­reasingly disconnected from unstructured play, face-to-face friendships and outdoor exploration.
However, research consistently highlights the importance of real-world experiences, such as outdoor exploration, social interaction, and immersive play, for children’s cognitive, linguistic, emotional and physical development. Increasingly, these experiences are being displaced by screen-based activities, with growing evidence of their adverse effects. US data shows that children spending four or more hours daily on screens face a 45 per cent increase in anxiety, a 65pc rise in depression, and higher risks of conduct problems and ADHD, largely due to reduced physical activity and poor sleep.
Preschoolers with daily screen exposure are significantly more likely to develop speech disorders and nearly twice as likely to experience learning difficulties, with brain scans revealing reduced white-matter development. In India, children exceeding three hours of daily screen time reported greater anxiety, depression and weaker academic outcomes, while outdoor play was shown to buffer these effects. Excessive use of screens also raises obesity risk through sedentary behaviour and unhealthy eating. Echoing these findings, Haidt’s The Anxious Generation documents a doubling of adolescent anxiety and depression since the rise of smartphones, alongside declining face-to-face interaction and chronic sleep loss.
There is a troubling irony here. In shielding children from the messiness and unpredictability of the outside world we risk denying them the very experiences that build judgement, independence and strength. A digitally mediated, academically intensive childhood may feel safe, but it can also be narrow, lonely and emotionally stifling.
What then might a more balanced approach look like?
First, we need to broaden the conversation abo­ut what constitutes safety. It must go beyond the physical to include emotional well-being, digital literacy and mental health. Creating safe environments also means fostering open communication at home, where children can talk about what they see online, what they feel and what they need.
Second, schools and communities can play a pivotal role by reclaiming public spaces for children. Well-designed parks, community centres and walkable neighbourhoods do more than provide recreation, they signal a shared commitment to collective care and trust. When children are seen playing outside, when adults are present and engaged, a community feels safer not just in perception but also in reality.
Third, we must revisit our assumptions about academic success. Learning does not only happen behind desks or on digital platforms. It unfolds through curiosity, movement, conversation and trial and error. Valuing holistic development means making space for play, creativity and rest, recognising that these are not luxuries but essentials for a healthy childhood.
Finally, digital literacy needs to be taught early, not merely in terms of technical skills but as a critical life skill. Children should be equipped to question what they see online, understand the inf­luence of algorithms and develop the confidence to disengage when digital spaces become toxic.
In seeking to protect children we must not build cages, digital or otherwise. Instead, we must create ecosystems that offer both challenge and care, structure and spontaneity, solitude and connection.
Between books and screens, between school and the street, lies a space of balance, conversation and thoughtful design. It is in that space that a new understanding of childhood safety can begin to take root, one that prepares children not just to stay safe but to live fully and wisely.

• Achakzai says provinces, local populations must get first right over resources
QUETTA: Six opposition political parties announced a complete wheel-jam and shutter-down strike across Balochistan on September 8 to protest against the suicide bombing that targeted a BNP-Mengal pu­­blic meeting at Shahwani Stadium two days ago.
Fifteen people lost their lives, while 38 were injured in the blast that targeted a rally held to mark the fourth death anniversary of former Balochistan chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, a veteran nationalist leader and founder of the Balochistan National Party (BNP).
The strike was announced at a joint press conference on Thursday by Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Par­ty (PkMAP) Chairman Meh­mood Khan Achakzai, BNP-M Chief Sar­dar Akhtar Mengal, along with lea­ders of ANP, National Party, PTI, and Majlis Wahdat-ul-Muslimeen.
They noted that senior leaders, including Mehmood Khan Achak­zai and Sardar Akhtar Mengal, had miraculously remained safe.
They warned that such acts were an alarm bell for all political forces struggling for the rights of the people and their resources.
Mr Achakzai said that for the last two days he had been unable to understand the purpose of the attack.
If the objective was to eliminate the entire provincial leadership, what benefit would that bring to Pakistan, he wondered.
He said although the Constitution had repeatedly been violated and trampled, yet no one had ever been punished.
‘‘We will continue our democratic and political struggle for its supremacy openly and boldly. We are no one’s slaves; here there are neither masters nor servants,’’ he said.
Mr Achakzai added the first right over resources belongs to provinces and their local populations, and their share must be clearly defined.
He said finding those responsible for the attack was the duty of the state since intelligence agencies claim to be the best in the world. “If they fail to find the culprits, then the state and its institutions will be held accountable for our killings. This is our will to our people,” he declared.
Announcing the protest for September 8, Mr Achakzai said: “If we had wished to exploit public emotions that night, our workers could have set fire to all police stations and government offices in the province. Instead, we chose a peaceful, serious, and effective political response. On September 8, trains, airports, wheels, and shutters will all come to a standstill.”
The PkMAP chairman invited all political parties, including PPP and PML-N, to join the struggle and “speak with the generals” by demanding that the country be run according to the Constitution, law, and democratic principles. He said only in such a system could Pakistan become an Asian Tiger within 10 years.
Sardar Akhtar Mengal said that had the perpetrators of the March 29 incident been brought to justice, the blood of innocents would not have been spilt on September 2.
He accused the state of employing every tactic against political workers while failing to trace terrorists. He alleged that elements both within and outside official institutions may be contributing to terrorism, adding that the rulers had learned nothing from the killing of Nawab Bugti and were now targeting them as well.

The administration, which vowed to appeal, insisted its move was legally justified over Harvard’s alleged failure to protect Jewish and Israeli students amid campus protests against Israel’s war in Gaza.
Harvard denied those claims, saying Trump was instead focused on controlling the prestigious school’s hiring, admissions and curriculum.
 
 

“The Court vacates and sets aside the Freeze Ord­ers and Termination Let­ters as violative of the Fir­st Amendment,” Boston federal judge Allison Bur­roughs said in her order.
“All freezes and terminations of funding to Harvard made pursuant to the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters on or after April 14, 2025 are vacated and set aside.” The ruling also bars the administration from using the same reasoning to cut funding in the future.

• Top European official slams bloc’s inaction over ‘genocide’ of Palestinians
JERUSALEM: Israel controls 40pc of Gaza City, a military spokesperson claimed, as its bombardment forced more Palestinians from their homes and claimed the lives of at least 53 more people on Thursday.
Most of the casualties were in Gaza City, where Israeli forces have advanced through the outer suburbs and are now only a few kilometres from the city centre.
Residents said Israel bombarded Gaza City’s Zeitoun, Sabra, Tuffah, and Shejaia districts from ground and air. Tanks pushed into the eastern part of the Sheikh Radwan district northwest of the city centre, destroying houses and causing fires in tent encampments.
In the Tel al-Hawa nei­ghbourhood in Gaza City’s west, where the strike took place, AFP footage sho­wed Palestinians outside damaged tents, clearing up scattered belongings.
Further south, in the Nuseirat re­­fugee camp, Gaza civil defence said an Israeli air strike killed sev­en people including three children. At Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hosp­ital, where the dead and wounded were being received, bodies wrapped in white shrouds lay on the floor of the hospital’s morgue.
‘40pc of Gaza City’
Israeli military spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin told a news conference that the Zeito­­un and Sheikh Radwan neighborhoods were in their control. “The operation will continue to expand and intensify in the coming days.”
Defrin confirmed that army Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir told cabinet ministers that without a day-after plan, they would have to impose military rule in Gaza.
Pope raises Gaza situation
Pope Leo discussed the “tragic situation in Gaza” with Israeli President Isaac Herzog during a meeting on Thursday, calling for a permanent ceasefire in the Pales­tinian enclave, the Vatican said.
The pontiff also called for the release of remaining prisoners held by Hamas, the statement said, and reiterated the Vatican’s support for a two-state solution to the decades-long Israel-Palestinian conflict.
“A prompt resumption of negotiations was hoped for … to secure the release of all hostages, urgently achieve a permanent ceasefire, facilitate the safe entry of humanitarian aid into the most affected areas, and ensure full respect for humanitarian law,” said the statement.
‘Genocide’
Meanwhile, One of the Euro­pean Union’s most senior officials called the war in Gaza a “genocide”, ramping up criticism of Israel and slamming the 27-nation bloc for failing to act to stop it.
 
 

“The genocide in Gaza exposes Europe’s failure to act and speak with one voice,” European Com­m­i­ssion vice president Teresa Rib­era said during a speech in Paris.
Top EU officials have so far shied away from calling Israel’s actions in the territory a “genocide”.
One spokesman said it was for the courts to make a legal judgement on whether genocide was happening. The splits are also present insi­de the EU’s executive, where Spanish commissio­ner Rib­era has expre­ssed frustration over the failure to push on the issue.

• Health ministry warns of cholera, typhoid, and dengue risks from contaminated water and stagnant pools
• No immediate desert locust threat, despite ideal rain conditions: UN report
ISLAMABAD: As severe flooding devastates the northern region and Punjab, with impending threats to Sindh, the international community, including the United Kingdom and the United Nations with their partners, has stepped up to aid the flood-stricken areas by releasing funds to expedite relief efforts and enhance disaster preparedness across Pakistan.
The United Kingdom on Thursday announced an additional 1.2 million pounds to help the government’s coordinated response and assist communities in Sindh prepare before disaster strikes.
According to a press release from the British High Commission, the new funding brings the UK’s total humanitarian assistance to £2.53m, providing life-saving support to over 400,000 people.
 
 

The new funds are being deployed to non-governmental organisations in Sindh to enable early warning systems, community evacuations, pre-positioning of essential supplies and the protection of livestock.
“Sindh is in a critical window to prepare and reduce the impact of the upcoming floods,” British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said. “For every dollar spent on prevention, up to seven dollars are saved in response. More importantly, lives are saved, and destruction is avoided.”
This aid complements £1.33m announced on Aug 22 for early response and relief efforts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan. That support includes providing dry food rations, search and rescue operations, mobile medical camps and restoring irrigation channels.
Additionally, the UK has contributed £500,000 to the Start Ready Disaster Risk Financing system in Pakistan. The funds have been released to reach 20,000 people across Punjab, Sindh and KP to anticipate and mitigate humanitarian impacts from future flooding.
UN aid
The United Nations and its partners are also working closely with Pakistani authorities to assess the humanitarian impact of the floods and identify needs.
Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher has released $600,000 from the Regional Humanitarian Pooled Fund to support relief and recovery efforts, according to a statement released by the UN Information Centre in Islamabad.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his condolences and solidarity with Pakistan. He commended the Pakistani authorities for relocating more than one million people in Punjab, according to the statement attributed to his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.
Health advisories
Meanwhile, the Federal Ministry of Health has released advisories to combat the heightened risk of disease outbreaks.
The ministry’s research body, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has warned that extensive water contamination and disease-carrying vectors pose a severe threat to public safety.
The ministry stated that floodwater has contaminated supplies, raising the risk of a surge in diseases like cholera and typhoid. Additionally, vast areas of stagnant water have created ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, increasing the potential for Dengue Fever, Chikungunya and Malaria.
The advisories, available on the ministry and NIH websites, provide guidance on preventing and controlling vector-borne, food-borne, water-borne, vaccine-preventable diseases and conjunctivitis. A statement issued by the ministry urged all citizens to follow established safety protocols.
No locust threat
Separately, a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report released on Thursday states that Pakistan faces no immediate threat of locusts.
The FAO’s “Desert Locust Bulletin” sta­ted that surveys in August found no locusts in key summer breeding areas, and while very small-scale breeding may still occur, “no significant developments are expected”.

The tremor, at a depth of 10km (six miles), followed the earlier quakes that flattened villages in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, left tens of thousands homeless and injured more than 3,600 people.
Survivors have been left without shelter as aid groups warn of dwindling resources, with the United Nations and other agencies citing a critical need for food, medical supplies and shelter.
Rescue workers on Thu­rs­day pulled bodies from the rubble of homes razed in Afghanistan’s earthquakes as the confirmed death toll topped 2,200, while homeless survivors faced a bleak future with global aid agencies warning of dwindling resources.
Search operations continued in the quake-hit mountainous eastern areas, the Taliban administration said, announcing a new death toll of 2,205 with at least 3,640 people injured.
“Everything we had has been destroyed,” said Aalem Jan, whose house in the worst-affected province of Kunar was flattened by the tremors.
“The only remaining things are these clothes on our backs,” said Jan. His family sat under trees with their belongings piled next to them.
The first earthquake of magnitude 6, one of Afghanistan’s deadliest in recent years, unleashed widespread damage and destruction in the provinces of Kunar and Nan­garhar on Sunday, when it struck at a shallow depth of 10km.
 
 

A second quake of magnitude 5.5 on Tuesday cau­sed panic and interrupted rescue efforts as it sent rocks sliding down mountains and cut off roads to villages in remote areas.
More than 6,700 homes have been destroyed, authorities have said. The United Nations has warned the toll could rise with people still trapped under rubble as time runs out for survivors.
Humanitarian needs are “vast and growing rapidly”, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Soc­ieties.
“Up to 84,000 people are directly and indirectly affected, with thousands displaced,” it added, citing initial figures.
In some of the worst-affected villages in Kunar province, two out of three people had been killed or injured, while 98 per cent of buildings were either destroyed or damaged by the tremors, according to an assessment by British-based charity Islamic Relief Worldwide.
Survivors desperately searching for family members sifted rubble, carried bodies on woven stretchers and dug graves with pickaxes in the wait for aid to arrive.
Video showed trucks, some laden with sacks of flour and others carrying men with shovels, travelling to remote villages on higher slopes. Authorities also airdropped dozens of commando forces at sites where helicopters could not land.
Afghanistan is prone to deadly quakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
With homes made mostly of dry masonry, stone and timber, some families preferred to sit out in the open rather than return home as aftershocks continue at regular intervals.

• Reiterates commitment to protecting Chinese citizens, promises ‘no red tape’ for investors
• Terms skilled workforce a ‘comparative advantage’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and China on Thursday vowed to further cement bilateral trade and strategic ties, as both sides inked 21 different MoUs and joint ventures worth around $8.5 billion, besides formally launching the second phase of the China-Pakis­tan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.
The MoUs were signed between the two countries with regard to cooperation in the development of CPEC 2.0, science and technology, IT, media, investment, agriculture, etc.
On the last day of his visit to China, PM Shehbaz Sharif met his counterpart, Premier Li Qiang, and attended an investors’ conference.
According to the PM Office, PM Shehbaz and his Chinese counterpart reaffirmed to work together in a meeting that the former termed “most productive”.
“Both sides also agreed to continue working closely on the next phase of upgraded CPEC 2.0, with its five new corridors,” an official statement said.
During the meeting, the prime minister highlighted the “significant contribution” of the CPEC to  Pakistan’s socio-economic development in the past decade. He also stressed the need for early implementation of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway project, the Karakoram Highway realignment and operationalisation of the Gw­­adar Port.
“I also invited Chinese companies to enhance their investment footprint in Pakistan,” the PM wrote on X, adding that the leaders’ agreement on adv­ancing cooperation in information technology, agriculture, minerals, textiles and industry.
 
 

PM Shehbaz also shared Pakistan’s intent to float Panda Bonds, a type of debt security issued by foreign entities denominated in Chinese yuan (RMB), in the Chinese capital market soon.
He later met Chinese Min­ister for Information Techn­ology and Industry Li Lecheng and reiterated Pakistan’s vision of deepening bilateral cooperation with China in industries, agriculture, trade, ICT, mining and minerals.
Investors’ conference
Both countries have also agreed to deepen security and defence cooperation, and will work together to crack down on terrorism, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing a joint action plan agreed by the two countries.
PM Shehbaz later termed the security of Chinese businesses “paramount” to Pakistan, inviting investment into the country under the banner of CPEC-2.0.
Addressing Chinese business leaders at the Pak-China B2B conference, PM Shehbaz said, “I want to make it clear before this assembly of great leaders that the security of Chinese brothers and sisters in Pakistan is paramount for all of us.”
He invited them to “come forward and change the landscape of progress and welfare” for both China and Pakistan.
Noting delays in the formal launch of CPEC-2.0, PM Shehbaz assured the potential investors that “Pakistan will not tolerate even a second’s delay” in facilitating Chinese companies.
He acknowledged that there were delays, and things had not “moved forward as per Chinese standards”; however, he stressed that Pakistan’s doors remained open to Chinese investors, adding that “we will not keep them waiting even for a second”.
“I am here speaking to you first as the chief executive officer of Pakistan and then as the prime minister,” he added.
The prime minister also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing.
He also invited Chinese com­­­panies to consider Pak­i­stan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into special economic zones, saying that the country offered a “un­­ique comparative advantage” with a large pool of skilled and cost-effective labour, competitive input costs and strategic connectivity to regional and global markets.
After wrapping up his six-day visit, PM Shehbaz subsequently returned to Pakistan on Thursday night.

According to an ECP announcement, by-polls in five National Assembly constituencies and four Punjab Assembly constituencies have been put off in view of the flood situation.
The disqualification and sentencing of several PTI lawmakers by antiterrorism courts in connection with the May 9 cases had led the ECP to schedule by-elections in NA-66 (Wazirabad), NA-96 and NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-129 (Lahore) and NA-143 (Sahiwal). By-polls were also announced for four Punjab Assembly seats — PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), PP-97 (Faisalabad) and PP-203 (Sahiwal) — following the disqualification of PTI MPAs.
The ECP has now postponed polling in all these constituencies. The commission said a new schedule would be issued once the flood situation improves. It po­­inted out that both public and private infrastructure, including government schools and other buildings designated for polling stations and election record storage, had been damaged by the floods.
Civil administration and law enforcement age­ncies are eng­aged in rescue and relief operations, making it difficult for them to perform election-related dut­ies. The Punjab government had also req­uested postponement of the by-elections to free up staff and buildings for relief act­ivities, it said.
The ECP added that large segments of the population in the affected constituencies had been displaced by floods and heavy rains. As a result, many voters would be un­able to participate in the electoral process, risking disenfranchisement and low turnout.
Taking all these factors into account, the commission decided to postpone the by-polls until conditions improve.

• Experts fear catastrophe at Head Muhammadwala
• High flood warning for Kasur, Okara, Bahawalnagar and other cities
• Over 85 Sialkot villages cut off since Aug 26
• Fears of urban flooding as more rain expected from today
• Homes washed away, farmland destroyed in GB’s Deral valley
LAHORE: As the water level continued to rise in the Chenab River at Head Muhammadwala and Sher Shah bridges, the urban centres of Multan and Muzaffargarh were facing a grave threat due to the extremely high-level flood that had not subsided des­pite the passage of 36 hours.
The National Disaster Management Authority also issued a “high flood” warning for Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Burewala, Arifwala and Bahawal­nagar, as water levels continue to increase in the Sutlej River.
Multan Deputy Commi­ssioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that the flood level in the Chenab River was continuously rising, due to which water had reached the Akbar Flood Bund and the Sher Shah bridge, inundating several villages.
“The situation is likely to worsen due to the joining of the Ravi River and the Chenab,” DC Sindhu said, adding that the water was above 414 feet at Greywala Chowk and showing a rising trend. He said the decision to breach the dyke at Head Muhammadwala would be taken if the 417-feet threshold was crossed. The DC said that a record 400,000 people were relocated to safer areas in the district.
Multan Commissioner Amir Karim Khan said that the water gauge at Head Muhammadwala was recorded at 413.66ft — just a few feet short of the critical level of 417ft. He said the decision to breach the embankment would be based on the water flow speed, intensity, and other factors.
‘Non-technical and incorrect information’
However, the experts ap­­peared alarmed by the situation at Head Muham­madwala, claiming that the critical level was actually lower than 417 feet.
The former irrigation department experts said the technical committee, comprising the irrigation department and other de­­partments, provided non-te­chnical and incorrect in­­­­formation to the administration regarding the bre­­aching section. Accor­dingly, the water level at Head Muhammadwala was set at 417 (above sea level), based on the 1992 flood flow.
However, the bridge had not been constructed at the time and the area was an open floodplain, with no controlled area of the bridge obstructing the flood flow, they said, adding that the 417-feet thr­eshold would increase the pressure on the Nawabpur and Akbar Flood embankments.
Since the government did not reassess the critical level at this gauge following the construction of the bridge, the situation at this head was precarious. The slow discharge from Head Muhammad­w­a­­la caused flooding from Jewana Bangla to Head Muhammadwala, they said, adding that the Ravi flood flow was also stagnant at Sidhnai Head­wo­rks for the same reason.
 
 

They urged the authorities to review the critical level to save Multan bef­ore the flood moving from Chiniot towards Trimmu Head­works could merge with the current flood flow.
According to PDMA, the Chenab at Marala Head­w­orks was flowing at 117,369 cusecs. Khanki Headworks was reporting a steady flow of 248,840 cusecs, while Qa­­dirabad Headworks was steady at 385,228 cusecs. The flow at Chiniot Bridge was steady at 554,998 cusecs. The water level at Rivaz Bridge was 520.50 feet; it was rising but remained below its maximum of 526 feet. Trimmu Headworks had a steady flow of 239,545 cusecs. At Head Muhammadwala, the level was steady at 414.00 feet against a maximum of 417.50 feet. The Sher Shah Bridge level was steady at 393.40 feet against a maximum of 393.50 feet.
Indian dams threat
Addressing a press conference, PDMA chief Irfan Ali Kathia said that the water level in Indian dams was continuously rising. He said that New Delhi had issued seven warnings to Pakistan about opening dam gates and three in the last 24 hours. He said that Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab would be affected after the release of more water from Indian dams.
Mr Kathia said that the situation at Head Sindhnai along the Ravi was “problematic” as water levels continued to increase at Jassar as well as Shahdara Headworks. He attributed the increase in the water level to the ‘backwater effect’. The DG said that as many as 3.8 million people had been safely evacuated from flood-affected areas in Punjab. “Massive evacuations have been carried out in the past 24 hours, mainly in Toba Tek Singh, Pir Mahal, Kabir­wala, and Khanewal.”
Sialkot villages cut off
As many as 85 villages of Bajwat, a rural area situated near the Pak-India border, remained cut off from the Sialkot district. Flash floods and incessant rainfall in the catchment area have swept away a bridge.
The residents had been without electricity since August 26 — the day when the devastating rain of over 500mm submerged Sialkot and adjoining areas, including Bajwat, and some other villages in neighbouring Chaprar town. Though the local administration temporarily constructed a Bailey bridge to connect Bajwat with Sialkot, recent flash floods in Tavi and Chenab rivers eroded its foundations, rendering it unusable.
“…Bajwat’s 85 villages are disconnected….despite the fact we have tried hard to restore mobility of the people,” Rana Iqbal Harnah, an MPA from Sialkot, told Dawn.
Sialkot Deputy Com­missioner Saba Asghar Ali said that Bajwat has some local markets from where the people were meeting their needs to some ext­ent. She said the administration was making all efforts to help the residents, adding that they were using bikes to access the area as boats could not be used due to the uneven terrain.
A local official, on condition of anonymity, said the situation was dire, particularly due to a prolonged power outage.  Cha­­­­prar town and its three villages have also been affected by floods and rains,” said Muh­am­mad Nafees, the Chaprar union council secretary, situated near Bajwat. Mr Nafees said the supply of various items from Sialkot to Bajwat continued to be disrupted due to the situation, leading to a shortage of essentials.
Flash flood in GB
Meanwhile, a flood ravaged Deral Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district, damaging at least 20 houses and farmlands, Dawn.com reported.
Deral Assistant Com­mis­sioner Waseem Abbas told Dawn.com that the flood occurred at 6am due to heavy rains, which engu­lfed the Gamari area. “As a result of the floods, 20 houses were damaged, of which five were completely demolished,” he said. “In addition, crops and trees were also damaged.” GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq told Dawn.com that timely information was received from the villagers, which saved dozens of lives.
Another rain spell
Separately, another monsoon spell from September 6 to 9 is expected across the country, including the Punjab districts of Sialkot, Multan, and Khanewal.
In Balochistan, most districts are set to receive “rain-wind/thundershower” on Sept 7-9 with occasional gaps.
In Kashmir, rain-wind/thundershower, with isolated heavy falls, is expected from September 6 (evening) to 8 with occasional gaps, whereas Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cities will receive rainfall from Sept 7 to Sept 9.

They have just done the unthinkable.
They have won gold.
This is not the beginning of a feel-good sports movie. This is the true story of the Pakistan men’s ice hockey team, a group of diaspora athletes who, just one year after forming and without a single ice rink in their homeland, conquered the LATAM Cup Division III last month, winning all five fixtures. Their journey was a testament to love, identity, and the audacious belief that some dreams are worth chasing, no matter how impossible they seem.
It all began with a man and a question: “Why not us?”
Adnan Khan, known to everyone as Donny, is the founder of Pakistan ice hockey. He was born in Karachi, but his love for the game began as a teenager after he moved to the US.
“Ice hockey was something that I really felt connected with,” the 53-year-old Donny recalled while talking to Dawn. “It helped me kind of assimilate into American culture and society.”
That connection grew into a career. He worked for the NHL, USA Hockey and Hockey Canada, becoming a true ice hockey insider. But a piece of his heart was always in Pakistan. Now, he saw a way to use a sport that had helped him find his place in America to help represent his homeland on the world stage.

“I felt we need to represent Pakistan as a positive place in whatever way we can,” Donny said.
The spark ignited when family in Islamabad told him that the Canadian High Commission was using ice hockey to teach climate change. At the time, through his work with the NHL, he was supporting the LATAM Cup, a tournament growing to include teams beyond South America.
The stars aligned. “Why not us?” became a mission. But Donny knew this couldn’t just be a team of expats; it had to be Pakistan’s team. His years of groundwork were key.
Bridge of trust
“I’ve been in contact with the Pakistan Winter Sports Federation for a few years now,” he explained. He had sent equipment and arranged online coaching meetings for enthusiasts in the country’s northern regions. “I sent a letter last year saying I would like to have their endorsement to represent Pakistan in this tournament.”
His genuine efforts to grow the sport at home had by then built a bridge of trust.
“Because I’ve been helping the Winter Sports Federation, they were kind enough to continue to support us … they recognised that we were representing Pakistan here.”
This official endorsement was their badge of authenticity, allowing them to play under the Pakistani flag with full pride.
With that legitimacy secured, Donny jumped all in.

“I submitted the team into the tournament, started working on a logo, designing a jersey, and started finding a roster,” he said.
The first year was humbling.
“While trying to build the team, pretty much anyone I could talk to, I put on the team,” Donny recalled.
In their first tournament, last year’s LATAM Cup, Pakistan’s team was severely short-handed. Donny, who was also working as a coach in that tournament, remembered that they had only 13 skaters and one goalie — his 14-year-old son. They won just one game.
But a seed was planted.
There was also the financial reality of participating; but from the very beginning, this was a venture run on love, not money.
“We are managing everything from here, we don’t have sponsors or anything,” Donny revealed. “I’ve been covering some of the upfront costs for the startup just for the love of the game.”
The financial burden was a shared sacrifice, shouldered by everyone involved.
“We’ve been doing fundraising drives to cover the cost of jerseys and equipment,” Donny said. “And then a lot of the parents have been chipping in; people buying dinners for the team practices, things like that.”
This collective effort was the true foundation of every win. They were all volunteers, investing in a dream they believed was bigger than themselves.

Digital scavenger hunt
Building a national team from scratch in a year, however, requires more than just hope; it requires genius-level resourcefulness. That’s where the players took charge.
Zaakir Khan, a 20-year-old defenseman and the team’s co-captain, became a chief recruiter.
“After that first tournament, me and my co-captain, Tariq Khan, started looking for more diaspora players,” Zaakir told Dawn.
Their method was brilliantly simple.
“Through a website, we were able to look up common Pakistani last names who play ice hockey,” Zaakir, who played at college level for George Mason University, recounted. They scoured databases, reached out via social media, and used Google forms.
They were digital-age pioneers on a patriotic scavenger hunt.
But the call to represent Pakistan required a massive leap of faith. Players flew in from across North America and the UK, often paying their own way.

“It was such a leap of faith, right, to travel halfway across the continent to go play in a tournament with a bunch of guys you don’t really know much about,” Donny said, his voice full of gratitude.
They arrived to find a team that had barely practiced together.
“Right now we’re only able to practice before each tournament,” Zaakir explained. “We are able to get together three or four days before each tournament and we’re able to have quick practice.”
They played through injuries sustained in their brief, intense camps. They shared equipment.
They faced a unique challenge just before the LATAM Cup: their new jerseys, ordered from Pakistan to support the homeland, were stuck in shipping. The men’s team played in their old kits, lending their other set to the newly formed women’s team.
None of it mattered. They were playing for something bigger than themselves.
“It’s always special when you’re playing with people of your heritage,” Zaakir said, articulating a feeling shared by every team-mate. “To be able to play for your country is something that I never thought I’d be able to do.”

Tight-knit group
And, as Zaakir termed it, the team became a “family”.
“We are really fortunate that we were able to recruit players with whom we were able to connect and form a tight-knit group,” Zaakir said.
That chemistry was tested not just by competition, but by conflict. The tournament was non-checking, but the intensity of hockey often boils over.
In one pivotal moment during the LATAM Cup, an opponent ran into the team’s goalie. In a flash, the entire team rallied to defend their team-mate. It was an instinctual act of unity that spoke louder than any victory.
“As someone who’s watching the game and someone who’s responsible for this team, I was so proud of our guys who were standing up for each other,” Donny said. That moment proved they weren’t just a team in name; they were a family, a brotherhood willing to stand up for one another without a second thought.
This feeling of belonging is the team’s bedrock. For these young men, hockey had often been a lonely pursuit.
“Ice hockey is not a very brown dominated sport, especially not a Muslim dominated sport,” said forward Mahd Nasir while talking to Dawn. “So growing up in Vancouver, we grew up around not a lot of Muslim kids playing hockey. So being on a full team of a bunch of Pakistani kids is absolutely amazing.”
Different dynamic
It isn’t just the men’s team that made waves. The newly-formed women’s team, cobbled together from across North America, fought their way to a bronze medal at the LATAM Cup Division II — despite playing their first-ever tournament with a short-handed squad of just 12 players.
The architect behind that incredible feat is Riley Khan, the Assistant General Manager of Pakistan Ice Hockey, who took on the monumental task of building the program from scratch. For her, the mission was personal.
“I got into Pakistan Ice Hockey because last year, Adnan Khan [Donny], my father, put together the men’s team,” Riley told Dawn. “When I travelled to the tournament last year, I saw how many successful women’s teams there were and I wanted to take on the task of putting together a women’s team for Pakistan.”
The initial challenge was simply believing it was possible.

“It didn’t seem possible at the time that there were so many Pakistani women who were passionate about hockey,” she admitted, “until I started looking!”
What she and head coach Mariya Rauf built was more than a team; it was a sanctuary.
“It was surreal to be around girls with so many similar experiences,” Riley said, reflecting on the unique bond they formed. It allowed us to bond in a special way. We were able to create a dynamic that is different than other teams.”
Constant fear
That dynamic was tested by the same logistical nightmares that plagued the men’s team — players flying in from across continents, financial constraints, and the constant fear that it might all fall apart.
“There were multiple times when I was working on this team when I thought that it might not come together in time,” Riley revealed.
But through it all, Mariya was the on-ice glue that held everything together.
“Mariya was a huge part of bringing the girls together once we were at the tournament,” Riley said. “The girls… were connected by Pakistani heritage, but Mariya was a huge part of really bringing them together as a team.”
For Mariya, a NCAA Division I player for Yale, the experience was profoundly moving.
“It was really humbling. I never saw myself as someone people would follow, but knowing that some of the girls joined because of me meant a lot,” Mariya told Dawn. Her vision extended far beyond the ice. “I just hope these women realise that wearing Pakistan’s colors isn’t only about hockey, it’s about creating opportunities for the girls who come after us and showing them that Pakistani women belong in sports.”
This mission of representation was personal.
“As a Pakistani girl growing up in hockey, I never imagined something like this would ever be possible,” Mariya confessed. “I was almost always the only person of color in the locker room. To go from that to leading a team of Pakistani women on the international stage still feels surreal and is an experience that I will never forget.”
Something magical
In Florida, something magical happened. Riley and Mariya’s efforts culminated in a bronze medal and an outpouring of emotion.
It was a triumph of will over circumstance, proving that the passion for hockey and pride in their heritage knows no gender.
“The feeling was pure joy,” Mariya said, describing the locker room scene. “There was laughter, hugs and just a ton of pride. It felt bigger than us, like we had taken a step that would matter for years to come. That’s something none of us will forget.”

The men’s team, on the other hand, stormed through the Division III bracket, their chemistry defying their lack of practice time. And the people came. The few family members from the first year were joined by a legion of supporters.
“I don’t think I have seen this many Pakistani people come together to watch ice hockey. It was amazing,” Donny said.
The 22-year-old Mahd described the unforgettable scene: “People brought Pakistani flags and microphones and every time you scored and looked to the crowd there was a massive sea of Pakistani supporters, all screaming Pakistan Zindabad.”
When the final whistle blew against Peru, securing the 6-1 victory and the gold medal, it was more than a win. It was validation.
A new beginning
The goal now is to ensure this is not an ending, but a beginning. The victory earns them promotion to Division II.
With the roster now expanded to 22 players, Donny dreams of not turning players away but creating more teams.
“My hope is that rather than saying no to anybody, we can just create more teams,” Donny told. “There will be a spot open for maybe another team to come in and build their spot for Pakistan in the lower division.”
Zaakir and Mahd, meanwhile, spoke of inspiring a new generation both in the diaspora and in Pakistan itself.
“Having kids in Pakistan look up to us, it’s just huge,” Mahd said. “They can see kids from across the world… that are representing Pakistan and that are able to play hockey and fulfill representing their country. So that just gives hope to a lot of Pakistani children out there.”
It all started with a question: “Why not us?”
The answer is written in gold — proof that even the wildest dreams can find ice to skate on.

A press release from the PMD said the quake originated at 9:56pm at a depth of 111 kilometres with its epicentre in the Hindu Kush region.
It said tremors were felt in Peshawar, Mansehra, Hangu, Abbottabad, Swat, Attock, Malakand, Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
 






State broadcaster PTV News said on X that the tremors “lasted for several seconds” and caused citizens to come out of their homes.
 






A statement from the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority said it received initial reports of an earthquake from “all districts” of the province.
PDMA Director General Irfan Kathia said that the administration across Punjab was busy checking buildings and no damage had been reported so far.
“District Emergency Operation Centres across Punjab, including the provincial control room of PDMA, are on 24/7 alert. Damages due to earthquake can be reported on PDMA’s helpline 1129,” the statement said.
Today’s quake comes after the PMD said on Tuesday that tremors were felt in Peshawar, Mansehra and Islamabad after another earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan.
A PMD press release said the 5.4-magnitude earthquake had occurred at 5:30pm in southeastern Afghanistan at a depth of 22km with tremors felt all the way in Peshawar, Mansehra, Islamabad, Abbottabad and Swat.
Meanwhile, the US Geological Survey had reported it as a 5.2-magnitude earthquake 34km northeast of Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province.
The epicentre of the tremor was close to where a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Afghanistan late on Sunday night, devastating remote areas in mountainous provinces near the border with Pakistan.
The PMD had reported four more minor quakes on Tuesday: a magnitude 3 with the epicentre 24km northeast of Pattan at a depth of 46km at 7:10pm, a magnitude 4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 2:50pm at a depth of 97km, a magnitude 5.4 in China’s Xinjiang at 12:59pm at a depth of 10km and a magnitude 4.4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 12:25pm at a depth of 20km.</p><small>2025-09-04 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041650119a7e19c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939684/talk-of-hybrid-system-is-admission-of-dictatorship-justice-minallah' target='_blank'><strong>Talk of ‘hybrid system’ is admission of dictatorship: Justice Minallah</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court Justice Athar Minallah on Thursday said that the talk of a “hybrid system” prevalent in the country actually amounted to an admission to the presence of a dictatorship.
What had previously only been a term coined by analysts to describe the unique system of governance currently in vogue, is now apparently being worn as a badge of honour. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had in July spoken in glowing terms about the ‘hybrid regime’ that currently runs the country. The term is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the country’s military holds a great deal of influence on the incumbent civilian setup and has a big say in the way the affairs of the state are managed.
In remarks on the issue while addressing the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) today, Justice Minallah said: “It is something to accept that people today say there is a hybrid system, that [actually] means there is dictatorship and there is no constitutional governance.”
He blamed what he said was the “lack of constitutional governance” in the country that was responsible for elite capture over the rule of law or the Constitution.
“I had to write in many high court orders that there is no rule of law or Constitution in the country; there is elite capture,” he explained.
He said that the history of the country’s judiciary was “not something to be proud of for me”.
The judge said that his generation had passed its time, caused whatever destruction it could to the country, and should never be afraid to admit it, adding that they could not blame anyone else and that this had kept happening throughout the country’s history.
Justice Minallah said that, as per the oath, judges had to impartially decide cases in accordance with the law and defend the Constitution without fear or favour, adding that the judiciary at all levels was bound to the oath and answerable to God and the people.
He explained that if there was a lack of constitutional governance in the country and he, as a judge, did nothing about it, he would not only be violating the Constitution but also his oath.
“Unfortunately, we are taught distorted history, and no one tells us the truth. Our generation did whatever it could do; the most we can do now is to hand over the baton to you and at least tell you the truth.
“The societies in which the truth is eliminated and truth ceases to be spoken are destroyed.”
Justice Minallah further said that no lesson had been learnt from history.
“The root of the country’s split in 1971 was laid down in the dissolution of the constituent assembly by the civil-military bureaucracy,” he said, pointing out that while there had always been free and independent judges in the country’s history, “the judiciary has never played the role that it ought to have.”
He said the Constitution was the expression of the people’s will and premised on the people’s right to rule through elected representatives, adding that it demanded that no institution or political officeholder would engage in political engineering and that any representatives would be elected through fair and transparent means.
“Unfortunately, that too has remained a dream for our history.”
He said the only way forward was to abide by the Constitution and govern the country accordingly, together with the upcoming young generation.
“This idealism of the youth will bring a change in the country. We know that fundamental rights are meaningless, there is no freedom of expression, there is a restriction on political thoughts and criticism,” he said, adding that the country would not have split if there had not been a clampdown on the freedom of expression.
Responding to the judge later in the day, Asif pointed out his role as a provincial minister in the former NWFP government under the tenure of former dictator Pervez Musharraf and called for self-reflection.</p><small>2025-09-04 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621981-59-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-twin-cities-parts-of-kp' target='_blank'><strong>5.9-magnitude earthquake jolts twin cities, parts of KP</strong></a><br><p>
