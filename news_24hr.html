After Pakistan clinched the One-day International series over South Africa last weekend, Hesson had predicted that Babar would soon get a big score.
Six days later, Babar obliged by ending an 83-inning century drought across all formats by scoring an unbeaten 102 to guide Pakistan to yet another ODI series triumph as the hosts coasted to an eight-wicket victory in the second game of their series against Sri Lanka at the Pindi Cricket Stadium.
More fittingly, Mohammad Rizwan was alongside Babar as the 31-year-old sank to the ground in prostration and celebration after completing his 20th ODI ton.
 
 

The duo, who have for so long carried Pakistan’s batting, recorded their 17th 100-run partnership across all formats and their bond showed when Rizwan, who got a half-century, raised his arm in celebration as Babar completed the run that took him to the three-figure mark.
“We had planned how we were going to take the chase,” Rizwan would later say in a video released by the Pakistan Cricket Board, standing alongside Babar. “But importantly, we were planning how we could ensure that he gets to his century. He’s so very important to the team so it’s crucial he recaptured his best form.”
The crowd was in raptures as the ‘Riz-Bar’ duo helped the home side ease to the 289-run target with their first century partnership in almost a year.
Rizwan informed the duo had “subtracted one over from the equation” and were aiming to finish the game in the 49th over.
“Whenever we get a big partnership going, it becomes memorable,” reflected Babar.
During his century drought, Babar had batted 33 times in ODIs, 26 times in T20Is, and 24 times in Tests. “I was getting starts but wasn’t converting them to big scores,” he added.
At the press conference after the match, Babar spoke about keeping his self-belief.
“It was a tough time,” he said. “But I tried to back myself as much as possible. I worked on the things I felt needed improvement — my fitness, my batting, everything.
“In the end it’s about belief. As a cricketer these phases come in your life, but you have to follow your plan every single day. Eventually the reward comes.”
Even the opposition hailed his century.
“We wanted to get him out early but we couldn’t,” rued Sri Lankan batter Sadeera Samawickrama at the post-match press conference. “He got a good hundred and won the match for his team. He’s a world class player and it was a brilliant knock.”
With Babar back to his best, Pakistan will look to secure a series sweep in the third and final ODI on Sunday.
For Sri Lanka, Friday’s defeat ended their hopes of a fourth straight ODI series triumph.
“We didn’t take our chances today and we’d like to play good cricket in the last game,” Samarawickrama said.

The Dhabeji Pumping Station is a key pumping station operated by KWSC, Karachi’s sole water utility, that serves the city’s major areas. Past breakdowns at the facility have impacted supply to the East and Central districts, including areas like Nazimabad, New Karachi, Landhi and Korangi.
In a statement today, a KWSC spokesperson said the “major” power breakdown in the second phase of the Dhabeji station was reported at 6:35am.
“Due to the power suspension, line number 5 has been affected,” the KWSC official said, adding that two pumps of the second phase have been shut as a result.
“Due to the pumps’ shutdown and the line being impacted, the city could face a shortage of 100 million gallons of water,” the statement cautioned.
 
 

The KWSC official asserted that repair work of the affected line “will be completed on an emergency basis”, and assured citizens that the utility’s management was making every effort to complete the repair work in a timely manner.
“As soon as the repair work has been completed, Dhabeji Pumping Station’s system will return to routine,” the spokesperson added.
The statement recalled that the K-III Pumping House at the Dhabeji station had remained shut for 36 hours from November 5 onwards due to a cable fault.
The Dhabeji Pumping Station, which is the city’s primary water intake point, is highly dependent on uninterrupted electricity. Even brief outages result in immediate service disruptions.
The station has been facing multiple problems related to poor maintenance and technical issues for a decade, with multiple breakdowns this year alone, leaving residents in many areas grappling with a water crisis.
 
 

Karachi faced a shortfall of 100MGD in January after “two water pipelines burst due to a power outage” at the Dhabeji station. The facility also remained without electricity for at least three days in late June, causing a shortfall of 350MGD.
Last month, one pump at the Dhabeji station was taken offline for maintenance-related needs, while the North East Pumping Station already faced a power breakdown.
Due to persistent water shortages across the city, people mostly rely on water tankers. They, however, face a great deal of hardship in getting them, as the water utility receives more bookings than the quota of water reserved for each district.</p><small>2025-11-16 06:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1610433994d91f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955436/hyderabad-fireworks-blast-death-toll-climbs-to-seven-rescue-official' target='_blank'><strong>Hyderabad fireworks blast death toll climbs to seven: rescue official</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people have been reported dead after another body was pulled out from the rubble of an explosion that ripped through a firecracker factory in Hyderabad a day earlier, it emerged on Sunday.
Rescue officials confirmed to Dawn the recovery of one more body from the rubble, which was pulled out late on Saturday.
On Saturday, a statement from the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said that “a powerful explosion was reported in a firecracker factory on the banks of the Laghari Goth river, Latifabad Police Station B Section limits,” following which a fire broke out in the factory.
He said the fireworks were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence.
“We can only tell you the actual position once the rescue operation is complete. There is rubble from one room that collapsed with the boundary wall, so there are reports of some people and children who were working there; we are trying to get them out.”
The sound of the explosion was heard miles away.
‘Illegal factory’
Latifabad Assistant Commissioner Saud Lund also confirmed that the fireworks were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence.
However, the Hyderabad SSP said: “Initial findings show that the factory owner [Asad Zai] actually got a licence for some other spot, but he was manufacturing fireworks at the present location.”
He said that the owner was absconding, and details of the factory’s licence were being verified
Hyderabad Mayor Kashif Shoro also visited the site of blast and then inquired after the health of injured shifted burns ward and its high dependency unit (HDU).
The injured were identified as Shiraz, son of Sanaullah; Waqas, son of Arshad; his brother Kashif; Anas, son of Akram; Naeem, son of Yusuf’ and Mushtaq.
Three of them suffered 98 per cent burns and their condition was said to be critical.
On Saturday, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of the incident and directed officials to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.
According to a CM House spokesperson, the chief minister ordered authorities to determine the cause of the explosion and conduct a comprehensive audit of the factory’s safety measures. “Negligence in safety matters will not be tolerated, and strict action will be taken against those responsible,” he said.
Home Minister Lanjar instructed officials to immediately investigate the factory’s legal status and verify whether it held the required licence and adhered to safety regulations for manufacturing fireworks.
“Playing with people’s lives cannot be allowed. Such incidents are unacceptable,” he said.
In August, at least two people were killed and 33 were injured when a massive explosion took place inside a warehouse storing raw material used for the preparation of firecrackers, in a densely populated area near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex.</p><small>2025-11-16 06:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16104950eaf3ede.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955279/gomal-university-expels-students-for-indiscipline' target='_blank'><strong>Gomal University expels students for indiscipline</strong></a><br><p>DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Gomal University has expelled several students after a series of serious campus unrest incidents, according to an official handout issued by the varsity administration.
The statement said that on various dates in October, students along with external accomplices stormed the registrar’s office, assaulted a female student, attempted to forcefully enter the vice-chancellor’s office, attacked a police guard, and showed deliberate disrespect during the national anthem at an event. Another reported incident involved anti-Pakistan slogans during a cricket match screening.
A fact-finding committee was formed to investigate the incidents, after which the case was referred to the university’s disciplinary committee. The accused students were issued show-cause notices and given the opportunity to present their defence. Their replies were found unsatisfactory.
Under university discipline rules, the administration expelled the involved students and cancelled their admissions. Hostel rooms were vacated and sealed. Those expelled include Aman Burki, Irfanullah, Nangyal Bittani, Ehsan Mehsud, and Tariq Bittani, while former student Amir Bittani has been banned from campus for five years.
The university clarified that expelled students cannot seek admission in any other institution.
The administration stated that a small group, backed by disruptive elements, has been attempting to disturb the university’s peaceful environment. It added that despite recent improvements in academics and administration under Vice-Chancellor Dr Zafar Iqbal, certain groups tried to incite unrest through false propaganda.
The university has also sought support from district authorities and the police to maintain security on the campus.

As political scholar Joel Day observed, in the May 2025 issue of the Journal of Democracy, that voters sense a need for change but remain profoundly uncertain about what that change should be. This widespread scepticism is not only fuelling dissatisfaction with democratic outcomes but is also casting doubt on the numerous proposals aired to stall or reverse the decline.
The core issue, it seems, lies in a fundamental disconnect between the idealised version of democracy and its lived reality. For decades after World War II, the West thoroughly romanticised democracy as a largely flawless ideology, especially during the Cold War, when it was deified as the ‘champion’ fighting against Soviet communism and authoritarianism.
This sacralisation meant that, while critiques of democracy were common in authoritarian states, established democracies rarely tolerated serious internal critiques. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 was celebrated as democracy’s decisive victory.
However, disastrous economic and political outcomes in former dictatorships that adopted democracy forced a reassessment. Initially attributed to the residues of authoritarian rule, these systemic issues did not simply rot away. Instead, democracy collided with deep-seated political, economic and social monoliths, leading to the creation of ‘hybrid regimes.’ 

Across the world, romanticised expectations of democracy have collided with social realities, resulting in a pragmatic turn where stability outranks ideals

Countries such as Turkey, Russia, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia and Mexico developed hybrid forms that sometimes produced better economic and political results than the idealised form of democracy.
A convenient, yet increasingly rhetorical way to bemoan the ‘stifling of democracy’ in hybrid systems is to blame an omnipresent ‘establishment’ or ‘ruling elites.’ While these factors certainly play a role, this explanation falls short when considering the paradox of public support for forces deemed illiberal.
Why are more and more people, even in established democracies, okay with happenings that terrify ‘true democrats?’ Consider the American context: a poll by Change Research found 42 percent of Americans support an unconstitutional third term for Donald Trump. Is this a failure of democracy to come to terms with the rapidly mutating global economic landscape? 
American political scientist Cas Mudde wrote about the ‘paradox of democracy’: the inherent tension between the democratic principle of popular sovereignty (majority rule) and the liberal principle of protecting individual rights. This conflict raises awkward questions — should illiberal forces that come to power through legitimate democratic means be tolerated? Should constitutional checks exist to limit the rise of such forces? What happens when a majority of voters actively blocks reforms necessary for a country’s economic health?
 


The response lies not in policy alone, but in psychology. As American political scientists Larry M. Bartels and Christopher H. Achen argued in Democracy for Realists, “Most voters feel more than they think.” If political decisions are based on emotions and cultural dispositions rather than logical institutional propositions, then citizen discontent will not automatically translate into the acceptance of proposed procedural fixes. Social conditions, not just institutional design, are blocking reform.
In Pakistan, for example, social media and newspapers are replete with outcries against the current government and the ‘establishment’ for stifling democracy through contentious constitutional amendments. Yet, the alternatives being suggested by the critics are largely rhetorical.
The question for champions of democracy resisting these reforms must be: were the institutions that these amendments are attempting to reshape successful in evolving democracy in the country?
The answer is a resounding ‘No’.
The current institutional and political elites are proceeding with these amendments in the belief that they will provide political and economic stability by checking factors seen as a source of tensions and chaos. Unlike past experiments, this current constitutional push is not founded upon a grand ideology. If it has one, that ideology is pragmatism.
The crisis in democracy is a crisis of faith in its procedural fixes. When institutions fail to deliver tangible economic and political results for the majority, the stage is set for a pragmatic turn — a willingness to accept outcomes that prioritise stability and efficacy over the strict adherence to an idealised, yet often ineffective, democratic procedure.

Mr Musa is the main accused in a case of a domestic servant over a minor dispute at his residence in the Pir Ghani area of Pakpattan on July 17, 2025.
The judge directed the Pakpattan Saddar Police to arrest Musa Maneka and present him before the court on November 19.
A case was registered against Mr Musa at the Saddar police station after getting enraged when his 18-year-old servant, Ali Bahadur, removed bedsheets from his room without his permission.
In a fit of anger, Musa allegedly fired a 30-bore pistol at Ali, hitting him in the left knee.
The bullet passed through his leg. Witnesses claimed that Mr Musa then threatened other household servants with similar consequences if they attempted to assist the injured servant.
A call was later made to the police, prompting District Police Officer (DPO) Javed Iqbal Chadhar and a team of the Saddar police to reach the scene.
DPO Chadhar reportedly confronted Musa Maneka and took him into custody and also recovered the weapon used in the incident.
 
 

Ali Bahadur, a resident of Chak Alam Hatayka, had been employed at the Maneka residence for the past two years. After the shooting, he was transported to the Pakpattan District Headquarters Hospital by Rescue 1122.
A case was registered against Musa at Saddar Police Station on the complaint of Ali’s father, Manzoor.
Musa Maneka is also a key suspect in a Rs113.1 million corruption case alongside his father Khawar Maneka and brother Ibrahim Maneka. Ibrahim has been declared an absconder after reportedly fleeing to Spain.
The case has been under investigation at the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) regional office for the past two years.
The Maneka trio, along with Excise Inspector Allah Nawaz, Patwari Muhammad Ashraf, and Auqaf Manager Shafqat, were named in a reference filed by the then Okara deputy commissioner on August 23, 2023.

Fear that the Supreme Court would somehow free jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and even go as far as to annul the last election in which, many believed, the will of the people at the ballot box may not have reflected in the final result. The 27th Amendment takes that thought to its logical conclusion.
The move gives constitutional cover to what the defence minister has called a ‘hybrid’ system and also acknowledges and institutionalises the senior partner’s lead role which will extend beyond the term in office of the junior, civilian partner.
When critics say the superior courts will now be under the executive’s influence, even control, they mean that given the balance of powers between the civilian and the uniformed, parts of the courts will now find themselves in the vice-like grip of the establishment.
While that may be true, it is not out of place to say that what has happened has given constitutional cover to a fait accompli; except for very brief and insignificant periods of independence, the superior judiciary has rarely stood its ground in the face of establishment pressure.
Starting with the Supreme Court’s predecessor the Federal Court, chief justice Munir’s infamous verdict, which overturned the Sindh Chief Court’s ruling in favour of Moulvi Tamizuddin, the Speaker, who had challenged the dissolution of the assembly by Governor-General Ghulam Mohammed, to the present day, the superior judiciary’s crucial verdicts have reflected more the will of the power centre(s) than the rule of law, or the spirit and supremacy of the Constitution.

So far, a lot of the blame has been put on the political class for its failure to deliver.

I can rattle off events in the Ayub era to the upholding of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s ouster to his death sentence and his execution to the dismissal of many governments starting in 1988 and continuing till the military takeover in 1999. When has the Supreme Court stood its ground and stood with law, justice and the people? If the Supreme Court was actually ‘hollowed out’, it happened way before the 27th Amendment became part of the Constitution.
It sent two elected prime ministers home more recently and followed the establishment’s lead. What has happened now is seen as outrageous simply because it formalises what many justices appear to have long been comfortable with. Honourable exceptions being exceptions and nothing more. For every justice who refused to bow to the will of the gun and decided to step aside, there were, arguably, dozens who were more than willing to fill the breach.
That’s the tragedy. As for the international environment today, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and individual liberty all seem to be under siege or attack. These cherished values seem to be in retreat.
In the day and age of social media-shaped narratives and decline in the influence of legacy media, especially those elements of the legacy or traditional media that believed in truth, objectivity, balance and fairness, a whole new equilibrium is emerging. Where it takes us or is taking us is another story.
In our case specifically, with so many external dangers and the resurgence of terrorism, and having discarded a relatively better form of democracy in favour of the hybrid variety, all authority and power now vests in one individual. Or, some would argue, the individual has been facilitated by politicians lacking in legitimacy to take total control. From now on, the onus of delivery is on him and accolades or the opposite will be his alone. I, for one, earnestly hope that in the area of national defence, he can repeat the wins of the May conflict with India and improve the performance of the SIFC, which has not managed to achieve what it was intended to.
 
 

Going forward, the only thing that guarantees national security and stability in a hostile environment is economic development and provision of jobs and basic services to the people, a vast majority of whom have nothing. Literally. Our people have been badly let down.
So far, a lot of the blame has been put on the political class for its failure to deliver. Even if there are glaring examples of the political class having been blocked or removed from decision-making when the economy was doing well. Individual ambitions of unelected power wielders overwhelmed what was in the interest of the teeming multitudes.
By its very definition, this hybrid set-up devolves common responsibility where the senior partner cannot blame civilian junior partners for failures. Any shortcomings will have to be jointly shouldered.
This 27th Amendment seems to make the task of the politicians and political parties out of power even harder to stage a comeback. Having tried to take to the streets to force a change in the status quo and failing, perhaps the one hope that flickered in what was a strong wind was legal, judicial relief coming via the superior courts. That too has been extinguished.
Sympathisers and supporters in other powerful institutions have been purged or sidelined. This calls for a change in the opposition strategy as no assistance will be forthcoming from within power centres in the country.
Imran Khan’s supporters and believers say his position is unshakeable, principled, while others at the very least feel he has so far displayed resilience and stubbornness in not talking to the junior hybrid partner as he has often been told to.
With the legal route to freedom, rehabilitation now blocked off, it will be interesting to see what the former prime minister and his key lieutenants agree is the best way forward. Given that his deputies constantly complain of his being largely incommunicado, it may be weeks, even months before the first hints emerge of a shift, if any, in strategy.

Mr Moonis has been living in Spain for about three years following the crackdown on Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) here.
Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had been vigorously pursuing the extradition plea before Interpol and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had furnished so-called evidence related to money laundering and other offences during the last couple of years with the Interpol.
 
 

Rejecting the Pakistan government’s plea, the Interpol said: “The General Secretariat of International Criminal Police Organization – Interpol – hereby certifies that as of today Mr Moonis Elahi is not subject to an Interpol notice or diffusion.”

Cites lack of evidence in money laundering, murder and other cases

A source in the FIA told this reporter that Interpol had dropped the investigation against Moonis for want of evidence against him. “Although the FIA had been pursuing this case for about two years, it appears that Interpol did not accommodate its stance because most cases were of political nature,” he said.
Interestingly, Gujrat police implicated Moonis in a murder case that was used in the government’s plea before Interpol. However, the local court withdrew arrest warrants and proclamation of him after the case turned out to be false, which helped Moonis prove the government’s malafide stance.
A counsel for Moonis Amir Rawn told Dawn that the Interpol cleared his client of all baseless charges framed by the PML-N government after a thorough fact-finding probe.
“The Interpol’s clean chit has proved that all allegations ranging from murder to money laundering and fraud to corruption were politically motivated against Moonis,” he said and added the Elahi family had been victimised for staying loyal to Imran Khan.
“Moonis Elahi deserves an apology from the Pakistani authorities for targeting him through fake cases,” he said and added that the Elahi family had faced relentless targeting since the PML-N returned to power.
“Moonis has been vocal in criticising the PML-N regime, especially Mohsin Naqvi and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, making him a prime target. The ruling party’s use of fake cases, arrests, and coercive measures against opposition figures reflects a broader strategy to suppress dissent,” he said and added the case in point serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of weaponising state institutions against political opponents.
Interior ministry spokesperson Qadir Yar Tiwana did not comment on Dawn’s query in this regard.

What is contributing significantly to this tension is the role of non-state actors. Where Afghanistan and Pakistan are concerned, the TTP is now a major point of contention. Meanwhile, for India and Pakistan, the situation has been exacerbated by the recent terrorist attack in Delhi. The identities and motives of the perpetrators are not clear, neither are possible links with regional or international terrorist networks. Nevertheless, it is evident that terrorist actors are a key factor in conflict escalation in the region. The irony is that political leaders are viewing the problem primarily through geopolitical and ideological lenses, an approach that will only benefit the terrorists.
States and their security institutions, particularly in South Asia, have long been accustomed to interpreting terrorism-related threats within broad geopolitical frameworks. While this may provide some diplomatic or political leverage, it rarely contributes to actually resolving the underlying issues. This is precisely what terrorist actors want. They exploit such environments, expanding their operational space with minimal investment in attacks that can inflict disproportionate damage on both inter-state relations and lives.
One of the core domains in which terrorism operates lies between the broader geopolitical environment and the counterterrorism practices of states. Terrorist organisations shape their strategies, operations, narratives, and political messaging within this space. When state priorities shift, terrorists exploit the resulting vacuums and disruptions. A case in point is the US shift in focus from Afghanistan to Iraq in 2003, which expanded the theatre of war for terrorist groups. This allowed them to build extensive networks. Their internal differences, rooted in divergent readings of global and regional politics, initially weakened them, but these same differences eventually gave birth to the militant Islamic State (IS) group and several other groups across Iraq and Syria.
 
 

Terrorist groups also drew ideological strength from the nature of the US, Nato, and allied counterterrorism approaches, which were often brutal and violated humanitarian norms. From abuses at Abu Ghraib to torture cells, and later the collateral damage caused by drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Africa, and the Gulf, these actions fuelled resentment. Terrorist groups effectively exploited this anger to amplify their narratives, enhance their recruitment, and sustain their financial networks.

When state priorities shift, terrorists exploit the resulting vacuums and disruptions.

It is not surprising that when then president Barack Obama announced America’s exit from Iraq in October 2011, most terrorist groups redirected their focus towards the Assad regime in Syria. Although Russia, Israel, Iran, Turkey and the Arab states pursued their own geopolitical agendas, they eventually recalibrated their political positions within the increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. Over time, they adopted more pragmatic approaches. As the conflict evolved, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-led alliance captured key areas around Damascus and gradually emerged as a significant actor in both regional and global politics. Recently, President Donald Trump received Ahmed al-Sharaa, who headed HTS, and praised him in his typical style, declaring that under his leadership, Syria would become a vibrant state.
The Afghan Taliban, meanwhile, gained considerable strength from the expanding conflict and from the support they received within the neighbourhood, particularly from Pakistan, which enhanced both their operational capacity and political leverage. Afghanistan, however, represented a very different theatre of war. Its geopolitics were not as multi-layered or complex as those in Iraq and Syria. The principal clash of interests centred on Pakistan and India, and this rivalry shaped much of the Nato presence in Afghanistan.
Iran, for its part, was occupied with multiple regional priorities. Its main focus was the Middle East, where it sought to secure its proxies and allies in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Consequently, Iran invested more in recruiting fighters from these regions, while providing support to certain Taliban factions at a level that never matched Pakistan’s influence.
For the Taliban, the equations were not particularly difficult. They found political and strategic space between US and Nato urgency to exit the region and Pakistan’s desire to safeguard its interests in Afghanistan. What later unfolded between Pakistan and the Taliban is a separate story, one that has become increasingly evident in recent developments. Afghanistan’s conservative, tribal-centric nationalist tendencies also enabled the Taliban to shape their political approach, negotiate with the US and later manoeuvre strategically in their dealings with Pakistan.
However, the major commonality between HTS and the Taliban was that both were claimants to territory and to a form of power that their respective religious or ethnic groups believed they had lost. Al Qaeda, by contrast, belonged to a different category, anchored in ideological operations rather than territorial ambition. It sharpened the political worldview of terrorist organisations across the globe, and to some extent, IS later followed its template. Al Qaeda remained an inspiration and a connective force for smaller terrorist groups, self-radicalised individuals and segments of Muslim diaspora communities, as well as Muslim societies.
Al Qaeda also shaped the worldview of Pakistani and Kashmir-based groups. Its call for ‘global jihad’ encouraged militants to detach themselves from state agendas and pursue a ‘pure’ cause, fighting for lands free from the influence of Muslim states, which they perceived as subservient to a global imperial order. An example is Zakir Musa in Indian-held Kashmir, who attempted to ‘purify’ the Kashmiri jihad movement. He openly criticised groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and claimed that jihad should be waged solely for God.
In many instances, terrorist groups deliberately create conditions that push states to the brink of confrontation, as Al Qaeda (through LeT) attempted with the Mumbai attacks in 2008. They closely study political contexts and exploit any emerging fissures within states. In India’s context, the probability cannot be ruled out that a rogue or self-radicalised cell of indoctrinated individuals can independently conceive and execute acts of violence driven by utopian or grandiose ideas rooted in faith, ethnicity, freedom, perceived suppression, or reactions to repression.

According to the data from IQAir, an air quality monitoring platform, Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) soared to a staggering ‘hazardous’ level of 577 in the early hours of the day, once again ranking it as one of the most polluted cities in the world. The provincial capital was ranked second after improvement in its air quality on the global pollution index in the evening.
The AQI of other stations in Lahore at 8pm were recorded at 448 at Phase 8 DHA, 342 at Gurumangat Road and AC Office Shalimar Complex Wahga at 305.
 
 

Other major cities in Punjab also reported hazardous conditions. In Gujranwala, particulate matter levels soared to 632, far exceeding safe limits. Similarly, Sialkot recorded an AQI of 462, indicating extremely poor air quality and prompting renewed concerns over public health.

Lahore retains the most polluted city title for fourth consecutive day

As smog casts a pall over the cities turning the sun into a faint, orange disc, environmental experts have warned that prolonged exposure to such high pollution levels can lead to respiratory illnesses, eye and throat irritation, and long-term health complications. Authorities continued to urge residents to limit outdoor activities, wear masks, and take precautionary measures as smog conditions persist across the region.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasted dry weather in most districts of Punjab, however, cold and dry weather, with very cold during the mornings and nights, is likely in Kashmir, Murree and Galliyat. It also warned that smog could further develop over a few plain areas of Punjab.
Earlier, a smog awareness campaign was launched in Lahore and masks were distributed among citizens at China Chowk. The campaign was launched by Nawaz Sharif Lovers group Chairperson Uzma Aamir Butt. The participants also appealed to the citizens to conduct emission tests of their vehicles and not come out of their houses without wearing masks.
Meanwhile, Punjab police carried out an anti-smog operation and registered 28 cases against violators and arrested them from various districts, including Lahore, during the last 24 hours.
Punjab Police spokesperson said that during the operations, fines amounting to Rs915,000 were imposed on 499 individuals, and 44 people were issued warnings. A total of 26 violations of crop residue burning, 227 violations by smoke-emitting vehicles, and five violations related to brick kilns were reported.
The spokesperson further said that during the current year, a total of 2,548 cases were registered and 2,278 violators were arrested across various districts as a result of the anti-smog crackdown. During this period, fines amounting to more than Rs192.3 million were imposed on 91,518 individuals, while 13,166 people were issued warnings. Reported violations included 1,652 cases of crop-residue burning, 54,850 violations by smoke-emitting vehicles, 1,407 industrial violations, and 2,117 brick kiln violations.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar has directed the concerned officers to further accelerate the anti-smog crackdown on highways, in industrial areas, agricultural lands, and other locations. He made it clear that under the zero-tolerance policy, no delay should be made in taking strict action against those who violate the smog SOPs.

Pakistan has been placed close to the bottom in Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net index, scoring only 27 out of 100. Ranked ‘not free’, the country accompanies China, Iran and Russia on the list known for internet curbs. Regional peers, meanwhile, performed better with India at 51, Sri Lanka at 53 and Bangladesh at 45. All three were declared ‘partly free’. The assessment comes at a time when Pakistan is experiencing major democratic curtailments such as the passage of the 27th Amendment, besides repeated internet shutdowns, including the recent weeklong outage in Balochistan.
According to the report, which gave Pakistan a score of 6/25 on ‘access’, 13/35 on ‘limits on content’, and 8/40 on ‘violations of user rights’, the country has seen a rapid decline over the past 15 years. In this period, like in other countries experiencing similar downward trends, the government imposed curbs on online activity in response to challenges to its rule. The country was ranked ‘not free’ in 2012 and not much seems to have changed since. Between June 2024 and May this year, repeated disruptions were reported across major communication platforms, including WhatsApp and Signal, often linked to new blocking and monitoring technologies. In November 2024, authorities restricted internet services across Islamabad during mass protests.
The pattern intensified this year with threats to block VPNs, mandatory registration requirements that sought user identification details, and amendments to Peca introduced in January. Rights groups warn that these changes contain vague language that can easily be used to suppress speech that is critical of the state. Such repressive actions have consequences. The report documents at least five death sentences issued for alleged online blasphemy during the coverage period. It also highlights the continuing influence of the establishment over electoral processes, media environments and policy decisions. These pressures create an atmosphere in which online and offline expression feel unsafe.
 
 

Heavy-handed restrictions reinforce the perception that the state prefers control and opacity over engagement and accountability. The passage of the 27th Amendment, criticised for weakening constitutional safeguards, adds to the sense that Pakistan’s democratic space is contracting. Elections alone cannot uphold democracy. They require an open public sphere in which citizens can speak, assemble and challenge authority.
When the physical and digital spheres contract simultaneously, the foundations of democratic life weaken. In a modern democracy, the internet must serve as a basic civic infrastructure rather than a tool of control. Transparent regulation, judicial oversight of shutdowns and the repeal of opaque cyber law provisions are non-negotiable. Pakistan can still walk back and reverse this negative trajectory. It remains to be seen whether the political will to do so exists.

The report covered PTI founder Imran Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister. Imran married Bushra in February 2018.
 






An official response, issued by the party’s media wing, claimed that co-writer Bushra Taskeen was a known critic of PTI and the “so-called” analysis published in the report was to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and stolen elections.
The party said it had the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and publication, if they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology.
 






“We have seen this narrative play out before. Half-truths, innuendo, selective outrage, all packaged and presented as ‘objective analysis’. This attempt to misrepresent facts is not intended to inform Pakistan or its people, but rather to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and systematically stolen elections,” it claimed.
“What is most striking is the convenient targeting of Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, who have been incarcerated for two years and three months, while the article remains silent on what has been happening in Pakistan for the last three years and seven months. There is no mention of human rights violations, the rigged elections confirmed even by the Commonwealth observers, the hundreds of PTI supporters who have recently been convicted to 10-year sentences in fabricated cases, or the systematic political persecution the party has faced.
“Instead, the writers chose to focus on the personal lives of the country’s most popular and courageous leader, a man revered by millions of Pakistanis, while ignoring the glaring injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens, party members, and the democratic system itself.”
 
 

The party further claimed that the Al Qadir Trust case, frequently cited in the article, was ongoing and had not been “fixed” as implied.
“PTI has consistently sought transparency and judicial resolution. The Constitution itself has been repeatedly tampered with, in fear of Imran Khan, undermining the rule of law. One must ask the writers why they did not highlight these grave concerns and instead chose to sensationalise the personal life of the PTI leader? Furthermore, co-writer Bushra Taskeen is a known critic of PTI, demonstrating clear bias against Imran Khan and favouring the PML-N, calling into question the objectivity of this analysis,” the party stated.
“Imran Khan’s own trials are far from open and fair. They are being conducted inside prison, denying him his basic rights, including meetings with family, friends, and legal counsel, despite explicit court orders. This systematic denial of due process exposes the politically motivated nature of these proceedings, yet the article conspicuously omits these facts.“
The PTI added that they “reserve the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and The Economist, should they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology for this baseless, reckless, and defamatory personal attack on the leader of 240 million Pakistanis and the millions of devoted supporters of Imran Khan worldwide”.
“The people of Pakistan know the truth. They see through these attempts to malign their leader and continue to revere Imran Khan for his courage, integrity, and steadfast commitment to the nation. His moral leadership and dedication to justice remain a beacon of hope for millions, despite the relentless political persecution he and his family have endured,” the response concluded.</p><small>2025-11-16 03:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16082022e75841a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955376/fazl-addresses-clerics-in-dhaka' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl addresses clerics in Dhaka</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman called for stron­ger ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh on Sunday, telling a large religious gathering that a shared “unity of faith was a stronger bond between the two nations that cannot be abolished”.
The JUI-F chief was addressing the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat conference at Suhrawardy Ground in Dhaka. “The people of Bangladesh possessed a strong and dynamic spirit of activism, but religious movements stood for continuity and stability at the ideology not violence,” he said.
 






Maulana Fazl emphasised that the delegation from Pakistan had not come merely to attend the event but to convey a message of goodwill from the Pakistani people to their Bangladeshi brethren. Focusing on the conference’s central theme of the finality of prophethood, Maulana Fazl underscored a core shared belief.
“We the Muslims of Pakistan and Bangladesh are part of a single Ummah,” he said, adding that scholars across the subcontinent are united in the belief that anyone claiming prophethood after Prophet Muhammad is outside the fold of Islam.
The JUI-F chief also expressed hope that the conference would serve as a catalyst for strengthening relations and cooperation across various sectors.
He pledged that “if Bangladesh took one step forward, Pakistan would take two”, and asserted that “mutual goodwill and affection would continue to grow stronger between the two countries”.
Participants were also seen carrying Palestinian flags during the event.

The regional police officer’s (RPO) spokesperson confirmed the clash between law enforcers and terrorists. “A large police contingent backed by CTD commandos was dispatched to the remote rural area when local police authorities received credible information about the presence of Fitna al-Khawarij terrorists,” he said, using an official term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He added that a fierce gun battle erupted when law enforcers tried to surround the terrorists in the border area between Lakki Marwat and Bannu.
According to the official, seven terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire that lasted several hours. “The police first recovered five bodies and then two more bodies of terrorists were found during a search operation,” he said, adding that no policemen were hurt in the fighting.
The regional police chief said the militants had initially moved into the Shaikh Landak area, within the Havaid police jurisdiction, to attack a police post. He told reporters when police, with the support of residents, swung into action, the terrorists fled towards Takhtikhel, where they were again confronted by police and villagers. “The terrorists were surrounded by the police and armed tribesmen of both districts,” he said, adding that police had seized arms and ammunition from the slain militants and launched a search for their fleeing accomplices.
“Law enforcers are busy in the sanitisation operation to clear the area of other terrorists and recover the bodies of more slain Khawarij, if any,” he said.
RPO Khan said the militants’ hideouts were being identified with the help of locals. “These operations are proof of the police’s strong resolve and commitment to eliminate the menace of terrorism,” he asserted.
KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed praised the police for their “quick and effective action” against Fitna al-Khawarij.
Bridge blown up
Separately, a small bridge was blown up with explosives in the Masoomabad area on the Bannu-Miranshah Road on Friday night.
A police official said an improvised explosive device planted under the culvert exploded, damaging part of the bridge. He said the blast was heard across the locality. “Luckily, no human loss occurred as a result of the explosion,” he added.
Quadcopter strike
Meanwhile, four people, including two teenagers, were injured in a quadcopter strike in the Sher­i­k­hel area of Lakki Marwat on Friday evening. A police official said that based on initial reports, explosives were dropped from a quadcopter on a cricket ground where villagers had gathered to watch a match.
“The injured were shifted to the District Head­quarters Hos­pital,” the official said.
Also on Saturday, RPO Sajjad Khan paid an unannounced visit to parts of Bannu city to review security arrangements, traffic management and police deployment at key public places.

The initiative addresses multiple forms of violence against children in Pakistan, including killings, physical and sexual violence, psychological abuse, and neglect.  The plan comes as the country faces challenges where only one in three children under five is registered at birth and over 12.5 million are involved in child labour.
 
 

The consultations, which included experts, partners, participants from all provinces and self-governed areas, began in Karachi last week and concluded in Islamabad.
The new strategy will be grounded in the principles of the  UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the INSPIRE framework, an evidence-based package developed by international agencies under WHO’s leadership.
According to a WHO statement, the framework outlines seven strategies focused on laws, norms, safe environments, caregiver support, financial stability, response services, and life skills, which have proven effective in reducing violence against children.

Consultations underway to protect 112m minors against various abuses

“We recognise that fragmented efforts must now evolve into a cohesive, national, multi-sectoral strategy, one that mobilises education, health, law enforcement, and community systems together,” Federal Secretary for the Ministry of Human Rights Abdul Khalique Shaikh said.  “The strategy will provide that unified vision, with measurable targets, clear institutional responsibilities, and a robust monitoring and evaluation framework.”
The lack of birth registration creates significant gaps in protection, leaving many children vulnerable. Displaced, migrant and those in poor urban settlements face high risks of exploitation, early marriage, trafficking and child labour.

The warning came a day after 153 Palestinians, who left Gaza without knowing their final destination and without proper paperwork, arrived in South Africa on board a flight from Kenya on Fri­day and were held up for 12 hours as authorities investigated the issue.
 
 

South Africa gave the war-ravaged Palestinians 90-day visas, Al Jazeera reported.
The Palestinian ministry on Saturday expressed “deep appreciation” for the support from the South African authorities and people.
The Palestinian embassy in Pretoria said it is working to assist the travellers who have “endured over two years of Israeli genocidal war, killing, displacement, and destruction”.

Gaza health ministry receives 15 more bodies

But it warned that companies, unofficial entities and unregistered intermediaries inside Isra­eli-occupied Palestinian territory are trying to mislead Palestinians and incite them towards leaving.
“The ministry calls upon our people, especially our people in the Gaza Strip, to exercise caution and not fall prey to human trafficking, to merchants and companies of blood, and to agents of displacement,” it said.
Meanwhile, Israeli authorities said on Saturday that 153 Pales­tinians who turned up unexpectedly in South Africa, triggering questions from its president, had received entry approval from an unnamed third country.
Shimi Zuaretz, a spokesman for COGAT, the Israeli body that runs civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, told AFP they had only been allowed to leave Gaza “after COGAT received approval from a third country to receive them”.
He did not name the country.
An Israeli official who did not wish to be identified said that the organisation which coordinated the transfer had submitted third-country visas to COGAT for all the evacuated residents.
South Africa’s home affairs ministry said 130 of the group entered the country, while the remaining 23 took onward flights to other destinations.
15 bodies received
Also, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza confirmed on Saturday it had received the bodies of 15 Palestinians. “The Ministry of Health announces the receipt of 15 bodies of martyrs who were released yesterday, Friday, by the Israeli occupation through the Red Cross. This brings the total number of bodies received to 330” as part of the deal, the ministry said, adding it had so far identified 97.
They were returned in exchange for the remains of 73-year-old Israeli prisoner Meny Godard, which Hamas returned via the Red Cross.

Immunisation against climate-sensitive diseases and the strengthening of health infrastructure have some of the highest climate-adaptation values among health sector investments. For every $100 invested in these activities, up to $36.50 goes towards addressing the additional disease burden caused by climate change.
The report, titled “Protecting Our Future: An Investment Framework for Quantifying the Climate Adap­ta­tion Benefits of Health and Immu­nisa­tion Investments”, proposes a quantitative framework that enables key funders and national governments to identify health sector investments — such as strengthening healthcare infrastructure, early warning and health surveillance systems, improving vaccine delivery and cold-chain systems, and bolstering immunisation and disease-outbreak preparedness — that simultaneously advance both health and climate objectives.
Collectively, multilateral development banks (MDBs) have invested nearly $2bn between 2019 and 2023 in making health systems more resilient to the effects of climate change. Despite the urgent need to build health resilience among vulnerable populations facing escalating climate-driven threats, less than 0.5 per cent of global climate finance currently supports human health interventions, leaving a critical gap in adaptation strategies, notes the report.
Six countries examined
The report assessed all health-sector investments made by AIIB, the World Bank and Gavi between 2019 and 2023. It also examined six countries highly vulnerable to climate impacts — Pakistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and the Philippines — and found that the share of funding for health programmes with climate adaptation objectives has increased in these countries in recent years.

In Pakistan, 74pc of the funding targeted mitigation

Regarding Pakistan, the report states that growing exposure to extreme climate events, such as floods, droughts and heatwaves, has contributed to an increase in climate finance. Estimates place the total amount of development finance targeting climate change from 2019 to 2021 at $5.4bn.
 
 

During this three-year period, the majority (74pc) of the funding targeted mitigation, while a quarter ($1.37bn) went to adaptation activities. Overall, Pakistan has limited climate-finance provision, as pressing priorities such as poverty eradication often outweigh long-term domestic investments. One earlier report noted that climate-relat­­ed expenditures made up only 6pc of the federal development budget in 2014.
The most common climate-related health hazards in Pakistan stem from extreme heat, erratic rainfall patterns, landslides and droughts. Many of these extreme weather events have intensified and become more frequent in recent years.
Flooding also poses major risks due to heavy rainfall and erratic monsoons. Communities along the Indus River are particularly susceptible to diseases like cholera and malaria because of their proximity to flooding events.

The highest number of arrests or detentions were made in 2025, the report says, adding that a total of 100,971 Afghans were arrested from Jan 1 to Nov 8, 2025, whereas 9,006 Afghans were detained in 2024. In 2023, 26,299 Afghans were arrested.
The UNHCR report, which was released on Friday, says that prior to 2023, there was no data collected on the arrest and detention of Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders or undocumented Afghan nationals. Since January 2023, International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has started to collect this data.
From Nov 2 to 8, a total of 13,380 Afghan nationals were arrested and detained, marking a 72 per cent increase compared to the previous week. Out of all arrests and detentions during Nov 2 to 8, the ACC holders and undocumented Afghans represented 76pc of the total arrest and detentions, and Proof of Registration (PoR) holders represented 24pc.

Majority of detentions reported from Chagai, Quetta and Attock

During the reporting period of Nov 2 to 8, 41pc of the total reported arrests and detentions took place in Balochistan, and 43pc in Punjab.
Key findings of UNHCR report says cumulatively, from September 15, 2023, to November 8, 2025, 1,723,481 individuals have returned to Afghanistan. During the period November 2 to 8, UNHCR and IOM say 55,768 Afghans returned through the Torkham, Ghulam Khan (located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Chaman, Badini and Bahramcha (located in Balochistan) border crossing points to Afghanistan.
Between Nov 2 and 8, the number of returns and deportations rose by 49pc and 75pc, respectively, compared to the previous week of Oct 26–Nov 1 (37,448 returns including 7,733 deportations). From Nov 2 to 8, the figures reached 55,768 returns, including 13,548 deportations.
The increase in returns is attributed to the reopening of the Torkham border on Nov 1, which allowed more Afghan returnees to cross into Afghanistan. However, the overall number of Afghan returnees during this reporting period still remain more moderate compared to the peaks observed in late August and September.
For the returns from Nov 2 to Nov 8, most of the returnees were PoR holders (48pc) followed by undocumented (43pc) and ACC holders (9pc). Majority of the POR returns include those facilitated by UNHCR through the Voluntary Repatriation Centres (VRCs).
For the deportees from Nov 2 to 8, most were undocumented (84pc), followed by PoR holders (13pc) and ACC holders (3pc).
Since April 1, this year, 869,448 Afghan nationals returned to Afghanistan, of which 115,159 (13pc) were deported. During this period, fear of arrest remained the main reason for the return among undocumented individuals and ACC holders (93pc) as well as PoR holders (47pc).
 
 

During the same time period, returnees were most likely to return from Quetta (20pc); Attock (13pc) and Islamabad (9pc) in the country and intend to go to Kunduz (19pc), Nangarhar (18pc) and Kabul (17pc) in Afghanistan.
In 2025, the Pakistan government issued several directives impacting Afghan nationals. In January, the government announced that Afghan nationals should relocate from Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and Rawalpindi, or else face deportation.
In April, further announcements indicated the implementation of the second phase of the “IFRP”, targeting ACC holders, in addition to undocumented Afghans.
 
 

In July, the government issued a Statutory Regulation Order (SRO) directing the repatriation/deportation of PoR card holders following the expiry of PoR card validity on June 30. The government later indicated a deadline of Sept 1 for PoR holders to leave Pakistan, before the start of the repatriation/deportation process.
434 shifted to refugee camp
As police raids continued in different parts of Balochistan, a total of 434 Afghan nationals were taken into custody in Nokundi, officials said.
Acting on a tip-off, they said, the law enforcement agencies raided a residence in Killi Burhanabad, Nokundi, where the Afghan nationals were hiding. Upon seeing the police, the house owner, Sarfaraz, who belongs to Burhanzai tribe, along with three unidentified suspects fled. However, police detained around 200 Afghans during the operation and registered an FIR.
In a subsequent operation, police raided the residences of Khaleel Ahmed and Attaullah, sons of Sher Ali, and took at least 234 Afghan nationals into custody. All detainees were later transferred under police supervision to the Girdi Jungle Refugee Camp for deportation proceedings.

According to a notification from the Finance Division, the new HSD price is Rs284.44 per litre. The prices will come into effect on November 16.
“The government has revised the prices of the petroleum products following input from the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) and the relevant ministries.”
 






Most of the transport sec­tor runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
The government charges about Rs99 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petrol levy and climate support levy.
It also charges about Rs17-18 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre of distribution and sales margins are going to oil companies and their dealers. Petrol and HSD dominate consumption at 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes a month compared to about 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.
Petroleum levy collections reached Rs1.161 trillion in FY25 and are budgeted to rise about 27pc to Rs1.47tr in the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-11-16 02:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1607271805aeb66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955382/china-russia-may-not-veto-gaza-resolution-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>China, Russia may not veto Gaza resolution tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: Senior UN diplomats are cautiously optimistic that China and Russia may abstain rather than veto a US-sponsored Security Council resolution to authorise an international stabilisation force (ISF) in Gaza — a key test of the UN’s ability to back a postceasefire vision for the enclave, according to diplomatic sources.
The draft resolution is expected to come up for vote in the UN Security Council on Monday, and would take effect if it secures at least nine affirmative votes and avoids a veto from any of the five permanent members (the US, China, Russia, Britain and France).
“China will not veto the resolution, but Russia’s position is uncertain, and key as well,” said one senior diplomat. Another added, “both China and Russia may abstain, but they will not use their veto.”
 
 

The draft resolution, formally circulated by the US, would authorise a two-year mandate for a transitional body called the Board of Peace, chaired by President Donald Trump, as proposed in his 20-point Gaza plan. It would also authorise a temporary, 20,000-strong ISF to disarm non-state armed groups, secure humanitarian corridors, protect civilians, and help rebuild governance structures. The US has clarified that no American troops will be deployed in the force.
In a strong show of regional support, eight Arab and Muslim countries, including Pakistan, Qatar, Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Jordan and Turkey, signed a joint statement this week, endorsing the US draft and called for its swift passage. The United States also joined the statement. According to the diplomats, this backing reflects deep concern over a resurgence of violence.
Asked why Muslim states supported the US resolution, one diplomat said, “Nobody wants the Palestinian genocide to resume.”
At the UN, the Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine, Riyad Mansour, met Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN Asim Iftikhar Ahmad and concurred that “blood-letting in Gaza must stop immediately.” The Palestinian mission is believed to have endorsed the Arab-Muslim group’s support for the US text.
The draft envisions a Board of Peace to administer Gaza during the transition, but this has drawn sharp criticism. Russia and China have pressed to remove the board entirely.
The ISF would work on “permanent decommissioning of weapons” from non-state armed groups, including Hamas, a particularly sensitive point.
As the force “establishes control and stability,” the draft requires an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza tied to agreed “standards, milestones and timeframes” negotiated among Israel, the stabilisation force, the US, and others.
In response to criticism, the US draft was modified to emphasise “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” but only conditionally, after “faithful” reforms to the Palestinian Authority and progress in Gaza redevelopment.
 
 

Some Arab and possible troop-contributing countries have also raised concerns about how the Board of Peace will be composed, who will lead it, and what role (if any) the Palestinian Authority (PA) will have.
Opposing draft from Russia
Moscow has responded by tabling a rival draft that removes the Board of Peace and instead asks the UN Secretary-General to propose options for stabilisation and governance.  In its submission, Russia argues that the US draft falls short of “universally recognized international legal standards,” notably the long-standing two-state framework.  The alternative text seeks a more inclusively negotiated international force under clearer UN oversight.
The Trump administration, however, is pressing Council members hard to adopt the resolution. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has publicly defended the proposal, calling it “the best path to peace in the Middle East” and thanking the Arab and Muslim countries endorsing the resolution.
Despite optimism from US diplomats, the resolution faces serious hurdles as there is still no guarantee about veto; the UAE though in close talks publicly stated it sees “no clear framework” for the force and has not committed to sending troops; besides legitimacy concerns for the Board of Peace especially if the Palestinian Authority is sidelined; ambiguity over logistics and funding, and humanitarian urgency.

In addition, international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, have also sought my assistance. I have also been a member of various United Nations committees on physical and social development, and a consultant to them. As the chief adviser and the chairperson of the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) and the Urban Resource Centre (URC), I have challenged the structure of thinking of many such projects and documented my concerns regularly. 
The most important thing I have learned in the process is that most of these projects have a very strong anti-poor bias and are primarily concerned with brick and mortar aspects of problems. 
ANTI-POOR BIAS
As far as academia is concerned, almost all teachers and supervisors bring their class prejudices with them, and the literature search that students have to undertake strengthens these prejudices. 
The poor are portrayed as helpless and incapable of taking decisions regarding their own lives. The students are asked to observe and pass judgements on their observations. The poor are almost never asked their own definition of poverty. Judgements are passed in surveys on the basis of very small numbers. And once these numbers are cited, they become the “truth” for other students and consultants to follow. 

Planning and development expert Arif Hasan has spent more than five decades working with poor communities across Pakistan and development practitioners and institutes around the world. He reflects on the major lessons he has learnt from that experience and his personal observations on what is wrong with Pakistan’s development paradigm…

In addition, studies by IFIs have an interest in portraying conditions to be much worse than they really are, so as to increase their loan packages for the project or policy under consideration. In addition, much of the loans Pakistan takes are for paying off previous loans, something that is seldom taken into consideration by the authors of the plans. 
DOUBLE STANDARDS
The anti-poor bias expresses itself in other ways as well. Building standards developed for poor and rich settlements vary considerably. The poor settlements have much lower standards, the contractor is badly supervised, and the element of corruption is much higher in percentage terms. Much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed for them collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, low-income settlements are completely flooded. 
It is not of much satisfaction that middle-income settlements today suffer the same fate as well. Even the workmen employed for the low-income settlement projects are not skilled, paid less per day, and the savings that are generated are taken over for politicians, bureaucrats and the contractor himself. 
Many decisions that are taken for low-income settlements are a violation of common sense. Much of the professionals employed on these projects are barely trained, and many do not possess a qualification and are seldom present on site. 
HEALTH
Health is a major issue in low-income settlements. Disease deprives a family of income and, to get well, one has to spend money, which the family cannot afford. The location of hospitals or medical facilities are not where they are needed, but in locations where amenity plots had been located in formal and informal planning. 
In addition, in academic training, a lot of emphasis is put on curative rather than preventive medicine. That determines the location and design of health-related infrastructure, and the relation between disease and architecture simply does not exist in planning concepts.
The cost of curative medicine has become so high that many families are now heavily in debt because of it. Surveys show that people have shifted to hakeems [traditional healers] and homeopathic systems, so as to make medicine affordable. 
PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS
If you look at the location of parks and playgrounds, the main municipal parks are eight to 10 km away from most low-income settlements. Amenity plots in low-income settlements have been encroached upon, and those that have not been encroached upon have not been developed. Many of them have become garbage dumps and sorting yards for solid waste, promoting disease and environmental degradation of the settlements around them.
There are other aspects as well. Surveys by my office and the URC show that the poor are clear in their view that the major cause of their poverty is the absence of a roof that they own. A roof gives them dignity, the possibility of upward mobility, better proposals for their daughters’ marriages, the possibility of improving their home incrementally as and when they have money, freedom from insecurity, the possibility of their children — especially girls — receiving an education because of the savings made on rent and, subsequently, better jobs for their women, such as in malls and as supervisors in factories. 
These very important issues seldom form part of the housing analysis. Perhaps this is because these intangible issues do not help in justifying a large loan. 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE LOANS?
A study of loans taken by Pakistan for housing purposes shows that, while the brick and mortar part is utilised, the intangible aspects are normally not utilised. Much of this is because sociologists who can make the necessary studies for the IFIs are very short in supply, and are usually employed as consultants. It is also because it is not easy to save money for illegal benefits from social infrastructure projects. 
Every loan has an element of capacity-building for the government staff and the special staff that is hired. This capacity-building usually consists of workshops and visits to foreign countries to see how projects in those countries were designed and how they function. They are usually independent projects, not necessarily a part of a larger policy. 
This capacity-building component is normally 12 percent  of the project cost. Over the years, millions of dollars have been invested in capacity-building. In spite of this, we keep building the same capacity again and again, and the departments for whom capacity is built revert back to their previous organisational culture and manner of functioning. We can see from the state in which the development agencies are, that no capacity has been built. 
EVICTIONS AND RESETTLEMENTS
In housing projects, one of the main problems is acquiring land for them. This is done by removing existing settlements and relocating them, sometimes on the same land and very often elsewhere, on land identified and provided by the state. 
The new settlement, which was previously in the city centre, is relocated to the city’s fringes. This impoverishes the people and destroys community ties. It adds transport costs to work and back, deprives women of jobs because of distances and the costs involved from home to work and back, and it puts households in debt (since the poor pay monthly for their groceries, which was possible previously because of community links). Poor households also borrow from each other in times of need, which becomes difficult with new neighbours.
The old manner of professionals and their support staff visiting settlements for long periods and spending time with the affectees of evictions is gone. And where it takes place it is like “development tourism.” 
As a result, there is little empathy between the different actors of development planning and the opinion of the affectees is usually missing, except for a paragraph or two summarised from a visit or survey. 
In addition, previously people formed committees and stood up for themselves and negotiated or demonstrated with their representatives and other influential personalities. Today, there is no lack of NGOs to support them or to initiate their struggle. This weakens their position as compared to before, as NGOs’ positions are more understanding and supportive of government decisions, as compared to people’s committees.

LAND AND HOUSING
There are other issues with land as well. Government agencies claim that they have no land for development for the poor. Yet they have no problem handing out large land parcels to formal sector developers. There are many reasons for this. 
The state collects large revenues from the sale and or development of these land parcels. The fact that poor cooperatives can produce the same revenue over a longer period of time, with interest, is disregarded. Then there is another problem. Available land, which is next to expensive land and that can be considered for low-income groups, is not considered because the value of the expensive land will fall if it is next to low-income settlements. As a result, the poor can only live on peripheral or environmentally degraded land that no one wants. 
The market, realising the demand for low-income housing near the city centre, has found ways to cater to this demand. Old katchi abadis [informal settlements] near the centre are being converted into multi-storey apartments, often four to seven floors high. They have no lifts and very narrow streets. 
When they began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they provided cheap flats for the lower-middle class to purchase on cash, instalments or pagrri [goodwill money]. Today, they are not affordable, even for the better-off poor. The result is that an increasing number of flat-owners are in debt, from purchasing and continuing to live in these highrises. 
These new developments are not considered legal by state agencies, as they follow no by-laws and zoning regulations, simply because such regulations do not exist. The residents, therefore, live in a constant fear of eviction. But the informal sector has devised documents of sale and possession amongst themselves. 
Their legality is decided on the basis of by-laws which are applied to formally constructed houses. This is very unfair because these houses have no lease and they have never applied for a building permit — this concept did not exist when they began construction. 
In addition, government surveys of informal settlements for rehabilitation purposes are also faulty. These surveys usually count houses as they appear on a Google map. However, in informal settlements, many households often live on one plot of land or in one house. So, government surveys are usually about houses and not about people. Thus, government figures are unreliable and the cause of considerable injustice. 
COMPENSATIONS
Compensation given as money is usually more equitable, as the affectee can use it at their convenience. Yet it has to be sufficient to rent accommodation or purchase a plot. It never is, because the needs of the poor are always under-estimated because of the bias against them, in the name of transparency. 
The manner in which money is given is complex. The affectee is viewed with suspicion by officialdom. So, something that could take a few hours gets lost in bureaucratic complexity, with many steps to take and many days in taking them. Because of this, affectees often lose day wages or have problems with their employers. 
A major problem is encountered by senior residents who are invalid and cannot afford to purchase or hire a home. So, many of them end up living on the street or under bridges. At night, many parks are also full of them but, as government attempts to prevent them from sleeping in parks improve, the number of people sleeping on the street or under bridges also increases. An increasingly large number are also sleeping on the beach.
Conditions in the rural areas are also becoming increasingly difficult because of the need for cash, which daily wage labour can not manage to earn sufficiently. With climate change, the number of environmental refugees is also increasing rapidly. There are no plans to provide them jobs or spaces to live. They are also living on the streets, under bridges, or in under-construction buildings. 
They manage to earn somewhat because another informal sector provides them with trinkets, such as balloons, to sell. A whole supply-chain of manufacturing exists, providing these items on credit. The women clean car windscreens at crossroads. I have never found out what exactly their men do or what the number of such a population is. 
There are also street hotels on pavements that rent out a bed and breakfast for between Rs100 to 300 per night, along with some basic toilet facilities, which are often provided by the neighbouring mosque in lieu of a small donation by the user. These ‘hotels’ are also adjacent to transport terminals, where drinking water is publicly available. This is a whole unexplored world.

DENSITY
A serious issue that is evolving is related to density. 
One-hundred-and-twenty square yard plots (which were owned by the father or grandfather) are divided among the children. Every child wants his/her part to have access to the road, which divides the plot, often into 3, making the divided plot no more than 30 feet at the roadside. This means that each person gets no more than a 10-foot frontage. A first floor is sometimes added to this. 
So, where one family was living, now at least six families are living in a plot of very small frontage. This creates a situation of unbearable density and, as the population grows, there are further divisions and subdivisions and/ or high rises, which manage to create densities over 1,000 to 1,200 persons per hectare. This issue is seldom or never addressed.
GROWING INEQUALITY GAP
As a result of what has been discussed above, there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. 
That is why better-income young men and women stand a better chance in becoming members of national cultural and sports teams. The poor also complain of elite schools and colleges using their social and political influence in getting their members to become members of national teams. 
It is for all these reasons that the upper echelons of the judiciary, bureaucracy, business and the military are drawn from the elite private schools and universities of Pakistan and support each other on a class basis. Their development decisions support their class interests, and they are not fully aware of the problems that their country and its less fortunate citizens face. Development for them means bringing the benefits they have to the people of Pakistan. But this is not possible. 
IFIs have a major say in the development model of Pakistan. Their air-conditioned offices in the city centre, far away from the homes of low-income groups, their fleet of expensive cars, constant trips abroad, workshops in five-star hotels and huge salaries anger the people, and it is not uncommon to hear them say “they are becoming rich on our problems.”
EDUCATION
Education is one of the priorities of poor families. However, the government schooling system is poor, and so poor families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which are operated by local entrepreneurs. 
These are expensive as a result, so families have to decide which child to send to school and which child to send to work. This is a very difficult decision and causes ruptures in the family. Unlike neighbourhood schools, colleges and universities are very far away from low-income settlements, and a trip to them (in the absence of efficient and cheap transportation) and back is very expensive in terms of money and time. This also results in many young people giving up on higher education. 
This adversity affects the majority of women aspirants. All this is in addition to very high fees (often in tens of thousands), which low-income groups can seldom afford. 
CULTURE
The Pakistan state is anti-culture and against students organising themselves. As a result, there is no student political activity. It is frowned upon, if not persecuted, and arts, music, dance and drama are discouraged. 
But all this has become an exclusive part of elite culture and held in elite institutions, often supported by cultural institutions of foreign countries. However, there are signs that this is changing and that the lower-middle class is slowly becoming a part of this. 
There was a time when student cards could subsidise travel, hostel charges, student canteens and library fees. All this has gone due to the neoliberal economic policies adopted by the state. Not only this, but every student who is admitted to a university signs a form saying he or she will not indulge in any form of discussion or debate regarding politics or religion. With this statement, dissent, which is a basic requirement of development and progress, is killed. 
WOMEN AND FAMILY STRUCTURES
In the last 20 years, the family structure and the women of Karachi have changed. We have moved from joint to nuclear families. As a result, women have become comparatively independent and also dominate the fields of education and health.
Self-willed marriages are increasing rapidly, and so is divorce. The conservative segment of society feels this is because people do not follow their religion. But this cannot be stopped. There is now a women’s football team, cricket team and hockey team, and women participate in athletics and martial arts and win. They participate in politics and participate in demonstrations, and often arrange them. 
Their public presence has increased too, and many women are in important government and private sector jobs as heads of institutions as well. But in spite of fairly strong women’s movements, women complain that they still have a long way to go before they can use their independence to achieve some form of equality with their men. They earn, but still they have to cook and clean. 
These changes have had a major impact on the design, especially on the incremental development, of the home and the future culture of the younger generation. Most homes possess a smartphone and have access to the internet and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, in spite of these developments, the city has almost no toilets for women, which restricts their working hours, and during their periods, they often have no option but to take the day off. 
In addition, the pavements that are available to them to walk on have obstructions such as trees, advertisement signage and broken patches. Often there are no pavements at all. This results in accidents and difficulty in moving around, especially with children and with senior citizens. 
There are many newly built roads that have no pavements at all and, when I have expressed this observation, I have been told “Arif Bhai, have you ever seen anyone walk on a pavement in Karachi?”
FINAL NOTE
There is much more that I have observed and written about and can safely conclude that, unless these and many other things are taken into account when trying to solve our problems and building a future, our problems will not be solved. 
Streets will flood, additional katchi abadis will be created, transport will not improve because it will not be maintained and managed, traffic will become more unbearable in the absence of management and, worst of all, women’s development will take place in an environment full of conflicts because the state will not support it. 
Hopefully, a new generation that is now growing up will be able to change this.

SSGC spokesperson Sal­man Ahmed Siddiqui said an 18-inch diameter QPCEP pipeline had ruptured at around 5am, affe­cting gas supply to multiple districts of the province.
The interruption hit Pis­hin, Kuchlak, Ziarat, Bus­tan, Hur­muzai, Mast­u­ng, Kalat, Mangocher, Kad Kocha, and nearby areas.
The spokesperson noted that as an interim arrangement, gas supply was being maintained at a limited level. He added that gas at low pressure was being provided through the company’s 12-inch QPL line to some suburban parts of Quetta, including Nawan Killi, Hanna, Sra Ghurgai, Pasht­unabad, and Eastern Bypass.
“The SSGC’s technical teams were immediately dispatched to the site and efforts are underway to repair the damaged pipeline at the earliest,” he elaborated.
The spokesperson said it was too early to give a timeline for the completion of repair work.
However, he added that the company would continue to keep its consumers updated on the situation.

“Yesterday morning at 7:30, after a judicial authority ordered the seizure of the cargo of an oil tanker with the trade name Talara and the flag of the Marshall Islands, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) rapid reaction units of the naval forces monitored its movements and intercepted and seized it,” said the IRGC.
“The tanker was found to be in violation of the law by carrying unauthorised cargo,” the statement continued, adding it “was carrying 30,000 tonnes of petrochemical cargo and was heading to Singapore”.
The Iranian news agency Fars said that action was not taken as a measure against any other nation, but was a purely local matter.
The seized cargo, the report said, was made up of Iranian-produced petrochemicals being illegally exported and “the main culprit was an Iranian individual or business”.
The vessel had departed from Ajman in the United Arab Emirates and was heading south through the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by three small boats, after which it made a “sudden course deviation”, maritime security company Ambrey said.
The US Navy had earlier said it was “actively monitoring the situation”.
“Commercial vessels are entitled to largely unimpeded rights of navigation and commerce on the high seas,” said the US 5th Fleet, which patrols the region.
The Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for global oil and liquefied natural gas, has previously been the scene of similar incidents.
Last year, the Revolutionary Guards seized a container ship, saying it had links to Israel, following a deadly attack on Iran’s consulate in Syria blamed on Israel.</p><small>2025-11-15 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633827-indian-sikh-woman-marries-pakistani-man-after-embracing-islam' target='_blank'><strong>Indian Sikh woman marries Pakistani man after embracing Islam</strong></a><br><p>

The Marburg virus is one of the deadliest known pathogens. Like Ebola, it causes severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and has a 21-day incubation period.
Also like Ebola, it is transmitted via contact with bodily fluids and has a fatality rate of between 25 and 80 percent.
The head of the World Health Organization, Ethiopia’s Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, confirmed on Friday that at least nine cases had been detected in southern Ethiopia, two days after Africa CDC was alerted to a suspected haemorrhagic virus in the region.
“Marburg virus disease (MVD) has been confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory (in Ethiopia),” Africa CDC said.
“Further epidemiological investigations and laboratory analyses are underway and the virus strain detected shows similarities to those previously identified in East Africa.” It said Ethiopian health authorities had acted swiftly to confirm and contain the outbreak in the Jinka area.
It said it would work with Ethiopia to ensure an effective response and to reduce the risk of the virus spreading to other parts of east Africa.
An epidemic of Marburg virus killed 10 people in Tanzania in January before being terminated in March.
Rwanda said in December 2024 it had managed to stamp out its first known Marburg epidemic, which caused 15 deaths.
There is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for the Marburg virus, but oral or intravenous rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms increases patients’ chances of survival.
Last year, Rwanda trialled an experimental vaccine from the US-based Sabin Vaccine Institute.</p><small>2025-11-15 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1522221511005fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955267/us-justice-department-heeds-trumps-demand-to-probe-epstein-ties-with-democrats' target='_blank'><strong>US Justice Department heeds Trump’s demand to probe Epstein ties with Democrats</strong></a><br><p>The United States Justice Department said on Friday it will fulfil President Donald Trump’s request to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s ties to former Democratic President Bill Clinton and JPMorgan, as Trump sought to shift the focus from his relationship with the convicted sex offender.
The move comes two days after a congressional committee released thousands of documents that raised new questions about Trump’s relationship with the late financier, and marks the latest in a series of demands by Trump for federal law enforcement to pursue his perceived political enemies.
Attorney General Pam Bondi said Jay Clayton, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, will lead the investigation.
The Epstein scandal has been a political thorn in Trump’s side for months, partly because he amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein to his own supporters. Many Trump voters believe Bondi and other Trump officials have covered up Epstein’s ties to powerful figures and obscured details surrounding his death by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019.
Trump has harnessed the Justice Department to target other perceived political enemies, notably former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey and New York State Attorney General Letitia James, both of whom were charged after Trump replaced the prosecutor leading the cases.
‘Not how it’s supposed to work’
Legal experts say Trump’s demands could undermine the criminal cases that emerge from those probes, as judges can dismiss cases found to be motivated by “vindictive prosecution” — which both Comey and James have raised, though judges have not yet ruled on their requests to dismiss the cases.
Patrick J Cotter, a former federal prosecutor, said it was “outrageously inappropriate” for Trump to order the department to investigate individual citizens, adding, “That’s not how it’s supposed to work.”
 
 

Along with Clinton, who socialised with Epstein in the early 2000s, Trump said he had asked the Justice Department to investigate former Treasury secretary Larry Summers and Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder who is also a prominent Democratic donor. All three men were mentioned in the 20,000 Epstein-related documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.
“Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrats’ problem, not the Republicans’ problem!” Trump wrote on social media. “They all know about him, don’t waste your time with Trump. I have a country to run!”
JPMorgan said in a statement that the US bank regrets its past association with Epstein, who was a client between 1998 and 2013, and did not help him commit “heinous acts”.
Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said on X, “These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.”
 






In a post on X, Hoffman called on Trump to release all of the Epstein files, saying his only engagement with Epstein was to raise funds for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“I want this complete release because it will show that the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander,” he said.
 






Summers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Justice Department’s decision to acquiesce to Trump’s demand came despite a July memo in which the department and the FBI said there was no “evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties” in the Epstein case.
 
 

“This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list’,” the memo said. “There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”
Trump faces continued pressure over Epstein
Trump and Epstein were friends during the 1990s and the 2000s, but Trump says he broke off ties before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution.
Trump has consistently denied knowing about the late financier’s abuse and sex trafficking of underage girls. Still, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters have accused his administration of a cover-up. Trump, who frequently engages with reporters, has declined to take questions over the last several days as new revelations about Epstein have become public.
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is expected to vote next week on legislation that would force the Justice Department to release all of the material it holds on Epstein, who was facing federal charges of sex trafficking minors at the time of his suicide.
The measure is expected to pass, even after House Speaker Mike Johnson repeatedly manoeuvred to try to block the vote. It would also require the Senate to pass similar legislation and Trump’s approval to compel the Justice Department to act.
Just four in 10 Republicans in an October Reuters/Ipsos poll said they approved of Trump’s handling of the Epstein files, well below the nine in 10 who approve of his overall performance in the White House.
Epstein socialised with well-known figures
 
 

JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to some of Epstein’s victims to settle accusations that it had turned a blind eye to his sex trafficking. The deal followed embarrassing disclosures that JPMorgan had ignored internal warnings and overlooked red flags about a valued client. The bank did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.
No credible evidence has surfaced that Clinton, Summers or Hoffman were involved in Epstein’s sex trafficking. All have previously denied wrongdoing and have expressed regret about their relationships with him.
Clinton flew on Epstein’s private jet several times before the financier’s 2008 conviction, while Summers accepted philanthropic gifts from Epstein while serving as president of Harvard University. Hoffman has acknowledged meeting with Epstein multiple times in professional situations.
Before his 2008 conviction, Epstein worked and socialised with a long list of well-known figures, including the UK’s former Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his royal title due in part to his association with Epstein.
Clayton, the prosecutor who will head the probe into Clinton, JPMorgan and the other figures, is a political independent who chaired the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump’s first White House term.</p><small>2025-11-15 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/15213521c9c4ac5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955250/pm-shehbaz-jordanian-king-affirm-zero-tolerance-for-any-displacement-of-palestinians-from-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, Jordanian king affirm ‘zero-tolerance’ for any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Saturday affirmed “zero-tolerance” for any displacement of Palestinians from the besieged Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the devastating military onslaught by Israel in the territory.
The two countries were among the eight Muslim countries that worked with United States President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza last month. They also joined other key Muslim and Arab states on Friday in expressing support for a US resolution that seeks to deploy an international stabilisation force in Gaza.
The prime minister and Jordanian king held a bilateral meeting today at the PM House after the latter arrived in Pakistan for a two-day state visit.
 
 

A statement issued from the Prime Minister’s Office on the meeting said: “On the issue of Palestine, both leaders acknowledged the unanimity of views and principled positions taken by Pakistan and Jordan regarding the post-war Gaza; zero-tolerance for any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. The two leaders agreed to enhance coordination among the eight Arab Islamic countries that are working with the US on the Gaza ceasefire and the Gaza Peace Plan signed in Sharm el Sheikh.”
King Abdullah II also praised Pakistan’s consistent support for Jordan’s role in regional stability and humanitarian efforts during the Gaza conflict, as well as for the territory after the ceasefire.
 






The discussions during the meeting focused on further deepening bilateral relations as well as exploring avenues for enhanced cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, health, science and technology, education, as well as defence sectors.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing strategic and economic ties between Pakistan and Jordan, as well as expanding mutually beneficial collaboration at regional and international fora.”
The statement said the meeting also featured a comprehensive exchange of views on regional security and peace initiatives, with PM Shehbaz briefing King Abdullah II on recent developments in Pakistan’s neighbourhood, especially Afghanistan and India.
“King Abdullah II acknowledged Pakistan’s key role in maintaining peace and stability in the region,” the statement added.
PM Shehbaz welcomed the king’s visit to Pakistan as a “testament to the enduring friendship” between the two countries, while the latter thanked the people and government of Pakistan for their “warm hospitality”.
The statement further said that both the dignitaries also witnessed a ceremony on the exchange of memorandums of understanding in the fields of media, culture and education.
 






The premier also hosted a banquet in honour of the king and his accompanying delegation.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, Climate Change Minister Musaddiq Malik, and senior government officials were also part of the meeting.
 






The king was presented with a guard of honour upon his arrival at the PM House.
 






 






Arrival in Pakistan
The Jordanian king was warmly received by PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari on his arrival at the Nur Khan Airbase. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and First Lady Aseefa Bhutto Zardari were also present to welcome the Jordanian king.
President Zardari said King Abdullah II’s visit would give Pakistan–Jordan relations a new strategic dimension. He added that the ties between the two countries were built on historical brotherhood, mutual trust and shared values.
A statement issued by state broadcaster PTV News on X said the visit reflected the “longstanding fraternal relations” between the two countries and would further strengthen political, economic and cultural ties.
“This visit of King Abdullah II will further solidify the longstanding relations between Pakistan and Jordan and will prove instrumental in expanding the scope of bilateral cooperation between the two brotherly countries.”
 






A statement from the President’s Secretariat said that a formation of Pakistan Air Force JF-17 Thunder aircraft provided a protective escort and accompanied the royal flight to Islamabad as the king’s aircraft entered Pakistani airspace.
The Jordanian monarch’s last visit to Pakistan was at the invitation of former president Mamnoon Hussain. Two memoranda of understanding were signed by both nations, with one related to cooperation in civil protection and defence and the other to cooperation in the housing sector.
Last month, he lauded the Pakistani military’s contributions to regional peace and security in a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The army chief was on an official visit to Jordan and had called on the Jordanian king for a meeting, with Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II also present.

A group of lawyers at the convention, held at the Sukkur District Bar, began shouting slogans against President Asif Ali Zardari, whereas another group of lawyers began chanting in the president’s favour.
The disorder intensified with the involvement of plainclothes individuals when a verbal altercation and scuffle broke out between them and lawyers.
Meanwhile, some of the protesting lawyers reportedly held five outsiders, who were in plainclothes and entered the lawyers’ convention, and began beating them up. Advocate KB Laghari said the five individuals were apprehended and handed over to the police.
He asserted that “lawyers are brothers, and no one can make us fight”.
Laghari added that Sukkur District Bar Association President Qurban Ali Malano felt unwell during the unrest and was moved to the hospital due to his deteriorating condition.
PPP workers allegedly caused disruption
The outsiders who caused the clash and disorder during the lawyers’ convention were said to be PPP workers.
The central figure of the conflict was reported to be Mairaj Gopang, a worker of the PPP’s Shaheed Benazir Division and an office-bearer of the Peoples Students Federation (PSF).
According to lawyers, the disturbance began when Karachi Bar General Secretary Rehman Korai mentioned the name of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar during his speech.
Upon hearing this, the alleged PPP workers attacked the lawyers’ leadership, including Aamir Nawaz Waraich, Malano, Laghari, Haseeb Jamali and Shafqat Raheem, during the speech.
Although other lawyers present tried to protect their leadership, the senior lawyers received minor injuries and were taken to the hospital.
The individuals then began chanting slogans of “Long Live Bhutto” when police brought them to the C-Section Police station.
Syed Zain Shah, president of the Sindh United Party and convener of the Save Sindh River Movement, strongly condemned the attack.
He asserted that this action was not only an attack on the legal fraternity but also a clear assault on the Constitution, law, democratic values and freedom of expression.
Lanjar takes notice
Lanjar took a strong notice of the incident. In a strongly-worded statement, the home minister expressed regret over the incident and termed the attack on lawyers as highly condemnable.
He stated that those involved in the assault would face strict legal action in accordance with the law.
Lanjar emphasised that lawyers were his own community, akin to family, and urged the legal fraternity to avoid internal disputes and maintain unity and discipline.
The minister further said that the government would take every possible step to ensure the safety and protection of lawyers. The home minister added that a full investigation was already ordered and responsibility would be determined following the inquiry.
Lanjar said restoring a peaceful environment remained a top priority of the government, and all necessary measures were being taken in this regard.

Hyderabad Deputy Commissioner Zain-ul-Abideen Memon told Dawn that a fifth body had been recovered from the incident site. “We have seven injured, of whom three are in critical condition.”
A statement from the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said: “A powerful explosion was reported in a firecracker factory on the banks of the Laghari Goth river, Latifabad Police Station B Section limits,” adding that a fire subsequently broke out in the factory.
Latifabad Assistant Commissioner Saud Lund said that he was monitoring the operation himself.
He said the fireworks were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence. “We can only tell you the actual position once the rescue operation is complete. There is rubble from one room that collapsed with the boundary wall, so there are reports of some people and children who were working there; we are trying to get them out.”

Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Adeel Chandio told Dawn that the details of the factory’s licence were being verified the owner of the manufacturing site was not present at the spot.
SSP Chandio added that rescue staff were clearing the site to find any bodies. He added that the police were investigating the ownership of the factory.
DC Zain told Dawn that the fire caused by the blast was extinguished quickly, but its impact was so strong that bricks of the structure were flung several metres away from the site.
He said it looked to be a single warehouse that collapsed, adding that the site was being cleared by Rescue 1122 staff and the exercise would still take some more time.
In an earlier statement, Dr Vinesh Kumar, a duty doctor at Liaquat University Hospital, told Dawn: “One [body] was received expired in the burns ward. Six injured were also shifted  to the burns ward with moderate to severe burn wounds.”
Dr Haya, a doctor at the burns ward, told Dawn that two of the six had burn wounds of “approximately 100 per cent”.
Medico-legal officer Dr Mohammed Hussain told Dawn that two bodies of unidentified males were brought to the mortuary, while Assistant Medical Superintendent Dr Mujeeb Kalwar said one more completely charred body was taken to the burns ward.
The Rescue 1122 spokesperson added that a fire and rescue team, along with an ambulance and a fire brigade truck, were dispatched to the scene as soon as the information was received.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took strict notice of the incident and summoned a detailed report.
“The legal status of the factory should be immediately investigated. Whether the legal license and safety principles required for making fireworks were being followed or not. Playing with lives cannot be allowed, and such incidents are unacceptable in the eyes of law enforcement agencies,” he was quoted as saying in a statement.

Epstein mentioned the now-incarcerated PTI founder in his email conversations with an unidentified individual on July 31, 2018, according to the latest batch of emails released by the US Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.
In 2019, the United States Justice Department charged Epstein in Manhattan with sex trafficking of minors. Epstein pleaded not guilty, but died by suicide the same year before the trial at age 66.
In an email exchange encompassing various topics, Epstein wrote at 4:04am that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been “kind so far” and quipped, “how the US involves itself in others’ elections”.
Minutes later, Epstein mentioned both Imran and Putin in the same message: “[Putin] hasn’t pointed out assassinations to overthrow [governments] … coup funding … Imran [Khan] in Pakistan, a much greater threat to peace than [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, Khomeini, [China’s President] Xi or Putin.”
The other individual asked, “The populist in Pakistan???”, to which Epstein only replied “really bad news”, apparently referring to Imran.
“The cricket player? — How could he be worse that [sic] the Islamist?” the person conversing with the sex offender wondered.
“Makes Donald look like Einstein. Incapable of truth. Devout Islamist [sic],” Epstein wrote back, seemingly referring to Imran.
“Many nuclear weapons. (not Erdogan or Khomeni). He was married to two friends of mine, one daughter of Jimmy Goldsmith. Super wealthy take over guy. Forced her to convert. Wacko,” the pedophile financier claimed.
“It follows your prediction around cults of personality. He is a cricket
captain. Not a chess player, but he’s good at rousing the crowd,” Epstein added.
 
 

The conversation, as per the emails released, then went silent for 40 minutes before resuming on another topic.
Oxford-educated Imran is described as one of the world’s greatest all-rounders in cricket before he entered politics. He had a string of socialite girlfriends, frequented exclusive nightclubs in London and earned a reputation as a playboy, which he began to tone down soon after 1992.
As the reports of Imran’s mention in Epstein’s emails circulated on social media, users also reshared a picture of Imran and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell from a 1990 party, published by the stock photography website Shutterstock.
Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence, was found guilty in 2021 by a jury in New York of helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.
Epstein’s network of powerful contacts
The latest batch from Epstein’s emails illustrates the extraordinary scope of his contacts with powerful people, ranging from a top adviser to US President Donald Trump to Britain’s ex-prince Andrew.
Epstein’s emails also suggested that Trump was aware of the financier’s sexual abuse and definitely “knew about the girls”. The US president has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the sex-trafficking activities of his former friend.
 
 

The United States House of Representatives is expected to vote next week on trying to force the release of evidence gathered on Epstein by law enforcement over the years, including the identities of the men suspected of participating in his alleged sex trafficking ring.
Trump has angrily called the push for more transparency a “hoax”, while simultaneously demanding a probe of Epstein’s links to others, including former US president Bill Clinton.
Documents already released by Democrats in Congress include email exchanges running from 2009 to 2019, when Epstein died in detention while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><small>2025-11-15 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633754-big-relief-for-moonis-elahi-as-interpol-drops-nearly-two-year-investigation' target='_blank'><strong>Big relief for Moonis Elahi as Interpol drops nearly two-year investigation</strong></a><br><p>

The president gave his assent to the Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill 2025. Notifications of the same were also shared by the PPP on social media platform X.
With his assent, the bills have now become part of the Constitution.
 






As explained by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in the National Assembly (NA) earlier this week, it now means that the five-year tenure of the CDF will commence from the date of his notification of the appointment.
All three pieces of legislation, which were hurriedly passed by Parliament without any debate earlier this week, pertain to the contentious 27th Amendment.
The amendment, which has paved the way for the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and changes to the military leadership structure, has been heavily criticised by the opposition.
 
 

Under the new changes made to the Army Act, the expression “chief of the army staff” will be replaced with “chief of the defence forces” as per the 27th Amendment. Similarly, the expression “Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee” (CJCSC) will be replaced with the “commander of the Natio­nal Strategic Command”.
Further, changes have been made to Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act 1952, saying that “provided that for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces under paragraph (a) of Clause 4 of the Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
Another change pertains to the appointment of commander of the National Strategic Command says, “The prime minister may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces, appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command, from amongst generals in the Pakistan Army, for a tenure of three years.” The proposed amendment also authorises the prime minister to “reappoint the commander…for additional tenure of three years and/or extend the tenure(s)…up to three years” on the recommendations of the CDF.
Under the changes, the appointment, reappointment or extension of the commander of the National Strategic Command, or the “exercise of discretion by the appointing authority in this regard, shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.
Further, the federal government may, on the recommendation of the army chief and concurrently the CDF and by order in writing, “authorise the officer appointed as vice chief of the army staff or deputy chief of the army staff to exercise and perform such of the powers and functions vested in the chief of the army staff under any law, rules, regulations, orders or instructions for the time being in force as may be so specified”.
Meanwhile, the changes to the air force and navy laws include the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents.</p><small>2025-11-15 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633730-bushra-bibi-influenced-imran-khan-on-governance-key-decision-making-report' target='_blank'><strong>Bushra Bibi influenced Imran Khan on governance, key decision-making: report</strong></a><br><p>
