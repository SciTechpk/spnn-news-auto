The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”.
Speaking in video statements as she made her way to the prison today, Aleema alleged that the state had been breaking the law, while maintaining that the PTI had done nothing illegal.
“If they do operate illegally and we do our work according to the law, and if they are right and we are wrong, then that shows just how our system works,” she said,







She then highlighted that Imran has not been allowed to meet his personal physician for the past 14 months.
“What is the issue in allowing one doctor to meet Imran Khan?” she asked. “When Nawaz Sharif went to jail, a doctor was with him all day, counting his platelets.
“What sort of system is this?”







Aleema then exited her car and began to walk towards Adiala jail, accompanied by a large crowd of party members and supporters. She made it to Gorakhpur Market on Adiala Road — roughly a kilometre southwest of the prison — before being stopped by riot police.
Sitting at the police barricade, Aleema delivered another statement on video.
“This is unconstitutional and illegal. Why are they keeping Imran Khan isolated and tortured?” she asked. “These people are violating the Constitution and breaking the law.
“We will not move from here; they can beat us with sticks or shoot us,” Aleema added. “Do what you will.”







Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan spoke to reporters at Dahgal, just up the road from the prison and urged authorities to allow meetings with Imran, stating that it would “improve the situation”.
“We have a right to come here, and there is a court order allowing us to be here,” Gohar argued. “We had an agreement and a consent order that family and legal counsel could meet him (Imran), but even today, we have been stopped.”
“There are a lot of things we are trying to do, but they are not in our control. But if we are allowed to meet, if he is allowed to meet his wife then it will improve the situation.”
Gohar also said that there cannot be division in the country and while there is disagreement in politics, there should not be hostility.
He left the area without meeting the PTI founder
Last Tuesday, Uzma was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as she went inside the prison to meet her brother.
When she exited, she delivered remarks on Imran’s behalf, which were later posted to his X account. These remarks were critical of army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and prompted a fiery response from the military’s spokesperson last Friday, who branded Imran “mentally ill” and a “narcissist”.
Last Thursday the federal government barred Uzma and others from meeting Imran over alleged violations of the prison code.
“There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.
That same day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the ninth time. He addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access and said he would update the media on the future course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not.
The next day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, would be dealt with harshly.
The minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.</p><small>2025-12-09 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638381-imran-khans-sisters-stage-sit-in-after-being-denied-meeting-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sisters stage sit-in after being denied meeting at Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>

Several global corporations have announced large investments this year in the South Asian nation, which is projected to have more than 900 million internet users by year’s end.
“To support the country’s ambitions, Microsoft is committing US$17.5B (billion) – our largest investment ever in Asia – to help build the infrastructure, skills, and sovereign capabilities needed for India’s AI first future,” Nadella said in a post on X.
Nadella made the announcement on social media after he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, thanking the leader for “an inspiring conversation on India’s AI opportunity”.In a statement, Microsoft said the investment would be spread over four years.







“Together, Microsoft and India are poised to set new benchmarks and drive the country’s leap from digital public infrastructure to AI public infrastructure in the coming decade,” the statement said.
The tech giant said one of the key priorities of its investment plan was “building secure, sovereign-ready hyperscale infrastructure to enable AI adoption in India”.
“At the heart of this effort is the significant progress being made at the India South Central cloud region, based in Hyderabad – that is set to go live in mid-2026,” Microsoft added.
The planned cloud region is twice the size of the iconic Eden Gardens stadium in India’s eastern city Kolkata, which has a capacity of over 65,000 people.
Microsoft said the latest announcement “builds on” a previous investment pledge Nadella had made earlier this year, committing $3 billion for AI and cloud infrastructure in India over the next two years.
Modi said he was “happy” that the tech giant had chosen India as the destination for its largest investment in Asia.
“The youth of India will harness this opportunity to innovate and leverage the power of AI for a better planet,” the prime minister said in a post on X.
“When it comes to AI, the world is optimistic about India,” Modi added.
Tech giants
Global technology giants are aggressively courting more users in India, the world’s most populous country and fifth-largest economy.
A special area of focus has been artificial intelligence with US startup Anthropic in October unveiling plans to open an office in India. Its chief executive Dario Amodei has also met Modi.
The same month, Google said it will invest $15 billion in India over the next five years, as it announced a giant data centre and artificial intelligence base in the country.
OpenAI has said it will open an India office, with its chief Sam Altman noting that ChatGPT usage in the country had grown fourfold over the past year.
AI firm Perplexity also announced a major partnership in July with Indian telecom giant Airtel, offering the company’s 360 million customers a free one-year Perplexity Pro subscription.
But India’s bid to become a global technology and artificial intelligence hub is colliding with increasingly tightening digital regulations.
According to recent media reports, authorities are drafting plans to ensure that manufacturers enable satellite location tracking in smartphones that cannot be turned off by users - a proposal that rights groups have raised the alarm over.</p><small>2025-12-09 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091421547f2b04e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960120/us-to-allow-nvidia-h200-chip-shipments-to-china-trump-says' target='_blank'><strong>US to allow Nvidia H200 chip shipments to China, Trump says</strong></a><br><p>The United States will allow Nvidia’s H200 processors, its second-best artificial intelligence chips, to be exported to China and collect a 25 per cent fee on such sales, US President Donald Trump said on Monday.
The decision appears to settle a US debate about whether Nvidia and rivals should maintain their global lead in AI chips by selling to China or withhold the exports, though Beijing has told companies not to use US technology, leaving it unclear whether Trump’s decision would lead to new sales.
Nvidia shares rose 2pc in after-hours trading after Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, following a 3pc rise during the day on a report by Semafor.
Trump said in his post that he had informed President Xi Jinping of China, where Nvidia’s chips are under government scrutiny, about the move and that he “responded positively.”
He said the US Commerce Department was finalising details of the arrangement and the same approach would apply to other AI chip firms such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel.
Trump’s post said the fee to be paid to the US government was “$25 per cent”, and a White House official confirmed he meant 25 per cent, higher than the 15 per cent proposed in August.
“We will protect national security, create American jobs, and keep America’s lead in AI,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
“Nvidia’s US customers are already moving forward with their incredible, highly advanced Blackwell chips, and soon, Rubin, neither of which are part of this deal.”
Trump did not say how many H200 chips would be authorised for shipment or what conditions might apply, only that exports would occur “under conditions that allow for continued strong national security.”
Administration officials consider the move a compromise between sending Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips to China, which Trump has declined to allow, and sending China no US chips at all, which officials believe would bolster Huawei’s efforts to sell AI chips in China, a person familiar with the matter said.
“Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,” Nvidia said in a statement.
Intel declined to comment. The US Commerce Department, which oversees export controls, and AMD did not respond to requests for comment.
A White House official said that the 25pc fee would be collected as an import tax from Taiwan, where the chips are made, to the United States, where the chips will undergo a security review by US officials before being exported to China.
Asked about the approval on Tuesday, the Chinese foreign ministry said that China believes it should cooperate with the US to achieve mutual benefits.
Fears of chips strengthening China’s military
China hawks in Washington are concerned that selling more advanced AI chips to China could help Beijing supercharge its military, fears that had first prompted limits on such exports by the Biden administration.
The Trump administration had been considering greenlighting the sale, sources told Reuters last month.
Trump said last week he met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and that the executive was aware of where he stood on export controls.
“It’s a terrible mistake to trade off national security for advantages in trade,” said Eric Hirschhorn, who was a senior Commerce Department official during the Obama administration.
“It cuts against the consistent policies of Democratic and Republican administrations alike not to assist China’s military modernisation.”
According to a report released on Sunday by the non-partisan think tank, the Institute for Progress (IFP), the H200 would be almost six times as powerful as the H20, the most advanced AI semiconductor that can legally be exported to China, after the Trump administration reversed its short-lived ban on such sales this year.
The Blackwell chip now in use by US AI firms is about 1.5 times faster than H200 chips for training AI systems, the IFP said, and five times faster for inferencing work where AI models are put to use. Nvidia’s own research has suggested Blackwell chips are 10 times faster than H200 chips for some tasks.
Several Democratic US senators in a statement described Trump’s decision as a “colossal economic and national security failure” that would be a boon to China’s industry and military.
Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House China Select Committee, said in a statement to Reuters that China would use the chips to strengthen its military capabilities and surveillance.
“Nvidia should be under no illusions – China will rip off its technology, mass-produce it themselves and seek to end Nvidia as a competitor,” he said.
In recent months, Beijing has cautioned Chinese tech companies against buying chips that Nvidia downgraded to sell to the Chinese market, which are the H20, RTX 6000D and L20, two sources said.
George Chen, partner at consultancy The Asia Group, said he expected Chinese regulators to soften their hardline approach to Nvidia following Trump’s comments on Xi’s reaction, given efforts to improve US–China relations. The H200 was also far more useful to China than the H20, he said.
“I expect state media to gradually change their narrative and be more welcoming to Nvidia,” he said.
Bo Zhengyuan, political analyst at consultancy firm Plenum, said he also believed that Beijing would be more cautious about intervening.
“But on a longer horizon, we don’t know how long this window can last. China will not be disturbed by this easing, and it will remain ultra-focused on gaining advanced chip-making capability of its own,” he said.
China’s domestic AI chip companies now include tech giant Huawei Technologies as well as smaller players such as Cambricon and Moore Threads.</p><small>2025-12-09 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09174710070c60b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960128/as-militancy-surges-in-kp-police-ask-for-special-allowance-to-enhance-morale-of-force' target='_blank'><strong>As militancy surges in KP, police ask for special allowance to ‘enhance morale’ of force</strong></a><br><p>As militant attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa surge, the provincial police force has asked the government to grant a special allowance to its personnel, which would cost around Rs4.2 billion per month.
Attacks on police personnel have increased by around 56 per cent during the current year.
In this regard, the Central Police Office (CPO) moved a summary to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
The summary stated that the provincial government prioritised the enhancement of police capacity and welfare in view of militancy and security challenges.
“Due to the government’s focused efforts and effective administrative measures, not only has the law and order situation improved, but the government’s overall public image has also strengthened,” the summary read.
The summary further stated that special financial incentives, such as a militancy allowance, were being provided to police personnel in view of the grave risks, operational responsibilities, and constant exposure to threats they face on a routine basis.
It added that these measures were intended to boost the morale of the force and enable them to discharge their duties with greater confidence.
The summary further stated that KP police continuously confronted terrorists and insurgents, often at great personal risk, due to their role on the front lines.
“KP police have made countless sacrifices, including the loss of precious lives and serious injuries,” the document reads.
The department pointed out that police duty in the province remained extremely risky, and exposed personnel to the threats of bombings, targeted attacks and other violent activities carried out by extremist elements.
It further stated that the KP police were currently performing their duties without any additional financial incentive, despite the challenging security environment and the operational nature of their assignments, in view of the continuous high-risk duties performed by all cadres of the force.
It was proposed that a special allowance, equivalent to one basic pay, be granted to all ranks of the provincial force.
“The provision of this allowance will not only recognise the extraordinary services and sacrifices of KP police but will significantly enhance their morale, efficiency, and motivation in carrying out critical security operations throughout the province,” the summary stated.
The summary stated that the special allowance would amount to Rs4.2bn per month.
Data showed that attacks on police personnel have increased by 56 per cent during the first 11 months of the current year as compared to the corresponding period of last year.
Till December 1 of this year, 137 KP police personnel were martyred, while 236 were injured in 510 incidents, as compared to the same period of 2024, in which 147 personnel were martyred in 327 attacks.
According to the police officials, the casualties during the current year have decreased by 7pc due to the police department’s focus on strengthening check posts, police stations and up-armouring of vehicles.
According to officials, the number of militant attacks repelled at police installations increased by 102pc. Police personnel repelled 320 attacks during the current year, compared to 158 last year
“This showed a high level of training, rapid response capacity and effective operational strategy,” an official said.
In addition, the KP police’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted 2,791 intelligence-based operations (IBOs), arrested 1,244 terrorists, and killed 420 during the first 11 months of the year — an increase of 61pc and 43pc, respectively. The CTD also arrested 25 high-value targets.
On Monday, KP CM Afridi handed over the newly-purchased armoured vehicles, modern weapons and security gadgets to the police at an event at the Malik Saad Shaheed Police Lines.
The equipment includes drones, anti-drone guns, anti-drone systems, thermal cameras, jammers, body armour, ballistic helmets, armoured vehicles, sniper rifles, Dragunov marksman rifles, M-16s, sub-machine guns, heavy machine guns, and various other advanced security tools, according to a statement.

Displaced children chased each other on the tarmac of Thailand’s Chang International Circuit race track, where hundreds of families were sheltering in vast silo-shaped tents.
“I want the government to deal with this decisively so it stops for good,” said handyman Boonsong Boonpimay at the racecourse in Buriram city, 70 kilometres from the fraught frontier.

 

“Otherwise we’ll have to keep living like this — unable to work and constantly on edge,” the 51-year-old told AFP.
Thailand and Cambodia have a long-standing dispute over portions of their boundary dating back to their colonial-era demarcation.

Five days of combat in July killed dozens of people and displaced around 300,000 on both sides of the border before a truce took effect.
But all-out fighting flared again along their jungle-clad frontier this week — with Thailand launching air strikes and Cambodia announcing retaliatory attacks on Tuesday.
At least seven Cambodian civilians and three Thai soldiers have been killed so far, according to officials, while more than 125,000 people have been evacuated on the Thai side alone.
Chang International Circuit owner Newin Chidchob told AFP he was ready for the surge of his displaced compatriots, sceptical this summer’s armistice would hold.

“After the clashes last time, when things quieted down, and villagers returned home, we did not believe it would truly be peaceful,” the former MP said.
“So we worked with the province to set up this system and prepare the site, because we felt that real peace or stability was unlikely.”
‘Ears open all the time’
Thai and Cambodian troops laid down their arms in July after intervention by US President Donald Trump as well China and Malaysia — current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Conflict monitors said a follow-on pact failed to adjudicate their core conflict, but Trump nonetheless touted it as a major peace-making achievement of his presidency.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has said he nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for halting the violence.
But cradling her five-year-old son at a makeshift shelter at a temple, Cambodian Ros Sambok lamented how her life was still being uprooted by the conflict.
“It is my third time fleeing home, and we have been on alert every day,” the 31-year-old said. “I just want peace so the kids can go to school together.”
She fled with around 20 family members from her village, about seven kilometres from the front line, on Monday morning — but her mental peace has remained broken since the original clashes.
“I could barely sleep in recent months. Authorities told us to be ready all the time,” she said.
“It is not easy. Our ears [are] open all [the] time.”
Though divided by a contested border, Thai evacuees expressed near-identical complaints about the conflict disrupting their lives again after a brief interlude of peace.
“We live day to day, and we have debts and children to take care of,” said 60-year-old Thai rubber farmer Painee Khengnok, displaced from the borderland where he earns his keep.
“Whatever the government needs to do, I just want them to solve this quickly so we can get back to making a normal living.”</p><small>2025-12-09 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091541197bd4e74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960122/ihc-declares-plea-questioning-legitimacy-of-justice-jahangiris-law-degree-maintainable' target='_blank'><strong>IHC declares plea questioning legitimacy of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree maintainable</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) declared on Tuesday a petition seeking the verification of Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s degree maintainable and sought a reply from the judge on the matter within three days.
The petition questioning the legitimacy of the LLB degree of the IHC judge and seeking a judicial determination on whether he lawfully held office as a high court judge was filed by lawyer Mian Daud. The court had reserved its decision on the maintainability of the plea in July last year.
The case against Justice Jahangiri centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
A two-member IHC bench, comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan, issued the verdict today after hearing arguments on the matter.
During the hearing, Ahmed Hassan Shah, who was representing the District Bar Association, contended that the matter should be referred to the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC), which issues licences to lawyers. He also argued that allegations of misconduct against any judge fell under Article 209 of the Constitution, which covers the subject of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).
At that, CJ Dogar observed that the case did not pertain to misconduct but the eligibility of a judge to hold office.
However, the lawyer insisted that the SJC — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — was the right forum for the matter.
He further argued that Article 199 — the constitutional provision that deals with the jurisdiction of the high court and under which Daud’s plea was filed — should not be invoked where Article 209 could apply.
The lawyer argued that the “judges cannot proceed against one another”.
“The court cannot exercise its jurisdiction under Article 199 in competing circumstances,” he argued.
While presenting his arguments, Aleem Abbasi, who was representing the IBC, contended that while Article 209 could be applied in various matters, a “new trend” seemed to be emerging.
He said that Justice Jahangiri held three licences, and the matter of his qualification needed to be addressed by a competent authority.
Abbasi reminded the court that an intra-court appeal was pending — seemingly a reference to a plea filed in the Federal Constitutional Court by five IHC judges, including Justice Jahangiri — and the appointment of one of the judges hearing the case had previously been questioned.
“Your lordship may help him if a judge is being arm-twisted,” he further remarked.
For his part, amicus curiae Barrister Zafarullah Khan raised questions regarding the maintainability of the plea. He also raised the question whether the case should proceed under Article 209 or Article 199.
Highlighting that the case concerned the “integrity of a judge”, he noted that sub-clause 5 of Article 199 excluded courts and sub-clause 3 excluded the armed forces.
Moreover, he pointed out that the Supreme Court (SC) had also previously dealt with the matter at hand.
At that, CJ Dogar remarked that the SC had directed the IHC to proceed with the plea. He also observed that a writ of quo warranto could be issued against a judge.
The term quo warranto refers to legal action requiring a person to show by what warrant an office is held.
During the hearing today, Advocate General Ayaz Shaukat read out a report by the University of Karachi.
At the previous hearing, the Higher Education Commi­ssion (HEC), in its detailed report submitted to the IHC, had endorsed KU’s findings that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri was obtained through unfair means.
In its submission, the HEC enclosed KU’s inquiry report that revealed glaring discrepancies in the judge’s academic record.
Reading the report today, the advocate general said Justice Jahangiri had been debarred from appearing in an LLB exam for three years in 1988, but he still sat an exam under a different name.
At that, Abbasi argued that the Sindh High Court had suspended the KU notification cancelling the judge’s degree.
CJ Dogar, however, observed that the degree had not been restored.
The court then declared the plea questioning the legitimacy of the judge’s law degree maintainable and issued notices to the respondents, directing them to submit their replies within three days.
KU inquiry report
The KU’s report stated that candidate ‘Tariq Mehmood’ obtained an LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968, but records showed that another student, Imtiaz Ahmed, had been enrolled under the same number in 1987, while the transcript for LLB Part-I was issued in the name of ‘Tariq Jahangiri’.
The report added the judge had also enrolled for LLB Part-I under a second enrolment number, 7124 — a violation of the university’s rules, which permit only one enrolment number for the entire duration of a degree programme.
The inquiry committee refrained from labelling the degree as ‘bogus’, but it declared the credentials invalid on account of multiple identities and conflicting enrolment records.
The KU alleged the judge “used and appeared in LLB examinations on false identities having different enrolment numbers of Karachi University in collusion with university staff”. It further stated that he had “personified different other regular/ex-regular students of Islamia College, i.e., Mohammad Naeem­uddin, son of Mohammad Moinuddin, and Imtiaz Ahmed.”
As a result, the university declared the candidate guilty of using unfair means, cancelled the result, and imposed a three-year ban, allowing him to reappear in examinations in 1992.
Protracted legal trajectory
The controversy around Justice Jahangiri’s law degree has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.</p><small>2025-12-09 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09113626b157a57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960110/transparency-international-pakistan-survey-says-police-tender-and-procurement-judiciary-most-corrupt-sectors' target='_blank'><strong>Transparency International Pakistan survey says police, tender and procurement, judiciary most corrupt sectors</strong></a><br><p>An annual survey released by Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) on Tuesday showed that the police is perceived as the most corrupt government sector in Pakistan, followed by the tender and procurement sector, and then the judiciary.
According to a press release issued by TIP, the National Corruption Perception Survey aims to gauge the perception of the public on important governance issues.
This year’s survey showed that 24 per cent of 4,000 people (1,000 from each province) surveyed believed police to be the most corrupt sector, with the highest level of perception of corruption in Punjab at 34pc, followed by 22pc in Balochistan, 21pc in Sindh, and 20pc in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The department has consistently ranked the most corrupt in previous surveys conducted by TIP.

However, the findings of the latest survey noted that there was, at the same time, a “notable” improvement in public perception of the police, compared to 2023.
Closely followed by police was the tender and procurement sector with 16pc of the respondents perceiving it as a corrupt sector. The highest level perception of corruption was among the respondents in Balochistan at 23pc, followed by 18pc in KP, 14pc in Sindh and 9pc in Punjab.
The judiciary was perceived to be third-most corrupt sector by 14pc of the respondents, with the highest level in KP at 18pc.
Bribery encounters
According to the press release, a majority of the citizens, around 66pc, said they did not feel compelled to bribe a public sector official in 2025.
However, the survey also showed that around 77pc of the respondents expressed “low satisfaction” with the government’s anti-corruption efforts.
The highest number of bribes in connection with access to public services was recorded in Sindh, with 46pc of the respondents feeling forced to offer a bribe. The numbers stood at 39pc in Punjab and 20pc in KP.
Further, 59pc of the respondents believed the provincial governments were more corrupt compared to local governments.
“This view is shared in Punjab by (70pc), Balochistan (58pc), Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (55pc) and Sindh (54pc),” the report said.

‘Lack of accountability’ major cause for corruption
The findings also showed that a lack of accountability, transparency and limited access to information, and delays in disposing of corruption cases were “major causes” for corruption in the country.


Screengrab from the Transparency International 2025 National Corruption Perception Survey shows results of response to a question on corruption.

“An overwhelming 78pc of respondents nationwide believe that there should be accountability of anti-corruption bodies such as the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), reflecting a strong public desire for greater oversight and integrity within these institutions,” the press release said.
Respondents cited the following as the top reasons for demanding accountability mechanisms: a lack of transparency in investigations by anti-corruption bodies (35pc), absence of independent oversight of anti-corruption bodies (33pc), and misuse of anti-corruption bodies’ powers for political victimisation (32pc).
The survey outlined three key measures suggested by respondents to curb corruption within the country. At least 26pc of the respondents believed that enhancing accountability was the way forward, while another 23pc advocated for “limiting discretionary powers” and another 20pc for “strengthening right to information laws”.
Around 33pc of the respondents also believed that provincial Anti-Corruption Establishments (ACEs) “were ‘not effective’ in combating corruption at the provincial level,” mostly in Sindh and Punjab, while another 34pc termed it “less effective,” particularly in KP and Balochistan.
The report further added that around 77pc of respondents “are not satisfied with the government’s efforts ot combat corruption,” with 80pc in Balochistan, 78pc in Punjab, and 75pc each in KP and Sindh.
Almost half of the respondents (42pc) shared that “they would feel safe reporting corruption if strong whistleblower protection laws were in place,” while 70pc of them were unaware of corruption reporting mechanisms.
“Among the respondents who are aware [of] corruption reporting channels (30pc), only 43pc have ever reported corruption or unethical practice,” the press release said.
“The findings are consistent across all provinces; Balochistan (76pc), KP (73pc), Sindh (68pc) and Punjab (64pc) respondents feel they are unaware about corruption reporting channels,” it added.
The respondents also believed that the “two key factors motivating citizens to report corruption are anonymity mechanisms in the reporting channels (38pc) and rewards for reporting corruption (37pc).”
Corruption within health sector
The survey also highlighted corruption in the health sector, where a majority of people (67pc) were of the view that corrupt and unethical practices had a “high impact on people’s lives”.
The survey showed that the perception was highest in Sindh at 69pc, followed closely by KP in 68pc, Balochistan at 67pc, and Punjab at 63 pc.
The respondents identified hospitals, doctors and pharmaceuticals as the “main sites of corruption” in the sector.
They also called for “stricter policies against pharmaceutical companies’ commission to doctors”, and “ban on private practice” as effective measures against corruption in the sector.
The respondents also called for stronger regulatory mechanisms in the health sector.
As per the survey, 51pc of the respondents also believed that “NGOs, hospitals, trusts, medical testing laboratories, educational institutions and other charitable organisations receiving tax exemptions from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) should not charge any fees from the public.”
“Majority of respondents nationally (53pc) believe that tax-exempted charitable institutions should publicly disclose the names of their donors and donation amounts on their website,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-09 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/090804010367f8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960098/imf-sees-pakistan-stepping-back-from-default-risk' target='_blank'><strong>IMF sees Pakistan stepping back from default risk</strong></a><br><p>The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections for Pakistan suggest that the immediate risk of economic free fall has eased but the country remains locked into a narrow stabilisation path marked by weak growth, heavy debt and limited relief for households.
Projections by the Fund, released early on Tuesday alongside the statement announcing a fresh disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, showed that the country’s economic growth was projected to inch up from 2.6 per cent in FY2024 to 3.2pc by FY2026, a pace that barely matches population growth in the country of 240.5 million people.
With a per capita income of $1,677, this trajectory points more to economic containment than recovery.
Pakistan’s population also continues to grow at a high pace, with mid-2025 official figures citing 2.55pc, while World Bank data points to 1.8–1.9pc. Though slightly lower than past peaks, the rate remains a significant development challenge.

 

Pakistan, however, appears to have made the most striking turnaround in inflation. After averaging 23.4pc in FY2024, consumer prices are estimated to have fallen sharply to 4.5pc in FY2025, and projected to rise to 6.3pc in FY2026.
End-period inflation is also projected to ease from 12.6pc in FY2024 to 3.2pc in FY2025, before climbing to 8.9pc in FY2026. The disinflation reflects tight monetary policy, lower subsidies and compressed demand under the IMF programme, though the projected rebound suggests price stability remains fragile.
Labour market conditions offer limited comfort. Unemployment is projected to fall only modestly from 8.3pc in FY2024 to 7.5pc in FY2026, underscoring the weak job-creating capacity of the current growth path.
On the fiscal front, the adjustment underway is substantial. Government revenue and grants are projected to rise from 12.7pc of the gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2024 to 16.3pc by FY2026, while expenditure is expected to remain near 20pc of GDP.
As a result, the budget deficit is projected to narrow from -6.8pc to -4.0pc of the GDP. Pakistan is also projected to maintain a primary surplus rising to 2.5pc of the GDP, a central IMF benchmark.
Despite this tightening, the public debt burden remains heavy. Total general government debt, including IMF obligations, is projected to hover around 72–73pc of the GDP, while government and guaranteed debt is expected to stay near 76pc.
Domestic debt accounts for nearly half of the GDP, keeping interest costs elevated amid high domestic borrowing rates.
External pressures have eased but vulnerabilities persist. The current account balance is projected to remain close to zero, shifting from a 0.6pc of GDP deficit in FY2024 to a 0.5pc surplus in FY2025, before slipping back into a small deficit in FY2026. Foreign exchange reserves are projected to rise from $9.4bn in FY2024 to $17.8bn by FY2026, lifting import cover from 1.6 months to 2.7 months — an improvement, but still short of comfortable levels.
Foreign investment, however, remains subdued. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is projected at just 0.5–0.6pc of the GDP throughout the period under review, pointing to persistent investor caution despite improved macro stability.
Monetary conditions also remain tight. Broad money growth is projected in the 14–16pc range, while private sector credit growth, though improving from 6pc to 15pc, remains constrained by high interest rates. The six-month treasury bill rate stood at 21.5pc in FY2024, reflecting the heavy cost of domestic borrowing.
Meanwhile, the 15.4pc real effective appreciation of the rupee in FY2024 signals a shift towards currency stability after a period of sharp depreciation, though it also carries risks for export competitiveness in an economy where textiles, valued at $17.3bn, remain the dominant export.
Taken together, the IMF projections depict an economy that has regained short-term stability through sharp fiscal and monetary adjustment, but remains burdened by high debt, weak investment and slow employment growth.
The immediate crisis may have passed, but the challenge of translating stabilisation into sustained, inclusive growth remains unresolved.
‘Stability achieved, more efforts needed for growth’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed the latest IMF disbursement a “proof that Pakistan is making progress in implementing the necessary steps for economic stability and growth”, according to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan.
A statement carried by Radio Pakistan further quoted the premier as saying that “the IMF’s expression of satisfaction with the effective implementation of economic reforms and measures in Pakistan is a clear testament to the hard work of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his team”.
The statement added that the PM also acknowledged that Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir “played a key role in supporting the implementation of the reform agenda and paving the way for Pakistan’s economic development”.
He said that steering the country from the brink of default toward stability and growth was a “challenging phase, requiring collective sacrifice from everyone”.
“Political parties sacrificed politics, and the nation endured economic hardships to make the impossible possible,” he was quoted as saying.
Moreover, PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction that Pakistan’s economic reforms and digitisation [process] had “become a successful case study and an example for the world”, the statement said, adding that the premier also expressed the confidence that the “dream of Pakistan’s economic development will soon be realised”.
He said that while “stability had been achieved, more efforts are needed to move the economy toward growth”.
The PM expressed his “firm commitment to working diligently for the prosperity of the people and completely freeing the country from foreign debt. He is confident that time is not far when Pakistan will achieve economic self-sufficiency after getting rid of debt”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-09 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091611217aa7b70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960126/not-in-favour-of-banning-political-parties-governor-rule-but-pti-pushing-authorities-in-that-direction-azma' target='_blank'><strong>Not in favour of banning political parties, governor rule but PTI pushing authorities in that direction: Azma</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari on Tuesday said that she was not in favour of a ban on political parties or the imposition of governor’s rule in a province, but stressed that the PTI’s “recent actions” were “pushing” authorities in that direction.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, Bokhari, in response to a two-part question regarding the possibility of a ban on PTI and the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, said, “As a political worker, I do not support that any party should be banned or that governor’s rule should be imposed.”
But, she continued, “considering the state of affairs, the PTI is pushing us to go in that direction.”
“On the one hand, KP remains most afflicted by terrorism, the police their remain understaffed; they do not yet have a Crimes Control Department (CCD), and police do not have the necessary equipment,” she said. The minister stressed that the PTI’s rhetoric was putting “Pakistan at stake, and if they do not stop, we will not be left with any other options.”

 

The minister further added that the incarcerated PTI leader had “become Altaf Hussain part two,” referring to the self-exiled MQM leader. In 2015, the Lahore High Court had banned the broadcast of images and speeches of Hussain across all electronic and print media till further orders for his inflammatory speech against state institutions.
“He has the same policies as Altaf Hussain, which were still quite mild compared to his (Imran),” she said.
At a later point in the press conference, Bokhari remarked about the PTI founder that “I fear that perhaps he will meet the same fate as Altaf Hussain.”
Bokhari alleged that PTI was engaging in maligning the head of an institute — an apparent reference to Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“If you are going to engage in a campaign against the head of an institution, it will not be long until a full stop is placed,” she warned.
She recalled that during the party’s tenure, Pakistan remained “globally isolated.”
However, she said, Pakistan was “now on track, and the PTI cannot digest it because whatever is good for Pakistan…this group considers it bad news.”
She stressed that Pakistan “cannot run in parallel with Imran’s politics.”
“We have tolerated this for 2.5 years; there is a limit,” she noted, adding that the party had become a “threat” to the country.
Over the past week, PTI has received a string of admonishments from the country’s politicians, who have been rallying behind the armed forces after a fiery press conference by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on December 5.
The press conference, where the army spokesperson assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, followed the former prime minister’s latest outburst against the military leadership, delivered last week through his sister Uzma Khan during a jail visit after weeks of restricted access.
On Monday, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said that the PTI’s “unjustified” criticism of the army had pushed the institution to respond.</p><small>2025-12-09 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/091411572a64621.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960109/pm-shehbaz-hails-extremely-productive-gratifying-talks-with-indonesian-president' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz hails ‘extremely productive, gratifying’ talks with Indonesian president</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday termed his meeting with the Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto “extremely productive and gratifying”, as the two pledged to expand bilateral trade ties.
Speaking during a ceremony held for the signing of several memoranda of understanding between Indonesia and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz detailed the pair’s discussions and said, “What we have decided is […] to promote our bilateral trade, culture, interact in the field of medical health, education, and vocational training.”







He assured the Indonesian president that Pakistan would “work closely” with Indonesia to achieve the decided targets.
The premier noted that Pakistan’s current bilateral trade with Indonesia stood at $4.5 billion, out of which more than 90 per cent accounted for palm oil imports.
“We have discussed how to take corrective measures to balance this balance of trade through agricultural exports from Pakistan, through exports of IT-led initiatives,” adding that the “trade gap” can be filled in many other areas as well.
The premier shared that the two countries had reached an agreement to send Pakistani doctors, dentists, medical professors and experts to Indonesia, which he said was establishing a “a large number” of medical colleges and universities.
“I assure you that whatever is possible for us in this [regard], we will do it without any delay and with great pleasure,” PM Shehbaz said, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to its “brotherly nation.”
PM Shehbaz conveyed Pakistan’s “warmth and sincerity” to Indonesia in his address.
He noted that the Indonesian president’s visit coincided with the anniversary of Pakistan’s diplomatic relations with Indonesia.
On that note, the premier stressed, “Let us agree to celebrate these 75 years with great fanfare in Jakarta and in Islamabad simultaneously, that will convey a very loud and clear message to all and sundry.”
The prime minister recalled that the two nations’ relations “predated” their independence.
“Our founder, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, supported the war of independence of Indonesia while he was president of the All India Muslim League,” he said, lauding the “great heroic struggle of the Indonesian people.”
The premier continued: “Little did we know in 1965, our war against our neighbouring country, [Indonesia] stood with Pakistan like a rock, and this has gone into the annals of history in golden words.”
“It will be remembered by the people of Pakistan for all times to come,” PM Shehbaz added.
He also appreciated Indonesia’s “unwavering stand” on Gaza, stressing that it had “resulted in peace in that part of the world”.
“By the grace of god, bloodshed has stopped. However, Israel’s ceasefire violations continue,” the premier noted.
He insisted that it was “high time that we sit down and really put our heads together and stop this bloodshed over there for all times to come”.
Coming back to Pakistan-Indonesia relations, the premier voiced optimism that “the bond between Pakistan and Indonesia will continue to grow in strength, depth, and vision”.
He stressed that the president’s visit “will take these wonderful relations to a much higher level”.
In his concluding remarks, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to “cooperate” with Indonesia for progress and peace in the region.
President Subianto hails ‘historic brotherly relations’
Meanwhile, President Subianto, at the outset of his speech, expressed his gratitude and appreciation for the warm reception he had received in Pakistan.

He thanked PM Shehbaz for receiving him in person along with President Asif Ali Zardari.
Echoing PM Shehbaz’s remarks, he said, “Today we have had very productive meetings. We have achieved many agreements in various fields, and we have addressed matters of mutual interest between us.”
“We have common values, we have common interests; we are both maybe the biggest Muslim countries in the world,” Subianto said.
“But our Islam is moderate Islam, which promotes inclusivity, tolerance.”
He added that the historic and brotherly relations between the two countries were “solid”.
“I think it is very important for us in the coming days and coming years that we make use of this history, make use of this brotherly bond, to benefit our people in most fields.”
He particularly expressed his gratitude that Pakistan was willing to help Indonesia in the field of health by sending doctors, professors and experts to assist in strengthening its health sector.
“We have a very vast need [for] doctors and dentists, and I am starting a massive programme of education in this field, so your assistance will be very strategic and critical for us,” he said.
Subianto also said that he had instructed his ministers to expedite the rebalancing of Pakistan-Indonesia trade relations “in practical terms” and assured the prime minister that “we want to move as fast as possible in all these fields”.
Additionally, the Indonesian president said that the two countries would be coordinating their foreign policy as they had a common stance and common principles, “especially towards Palestine”.
“Our foreign ministers are closely in contact with each other […] we will always maintain a common stance in this regard,” he said.
“Once again, we will not waver in our support for a two-state solution in Palestine.”
I think, going forward, […] I feel very optimistic, I feel very bullish,” he said.
Prabowo concluded by expressing his hope to officially invite Shehbaz to visit Indonesia, along with Pakistan’s other leaders, hoping to “provide assistance and advice on how the two countries could advance their cooperation.”
Meeting with Field Marshal Munir
Later in the day, Prabowo also held a meeting with the Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “during the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security, and bilateral defence cooperation were discussed.”Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to further strengthen existing ties between the armed forces of the two brotherly countries.

“The visiting dignitary appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan Armed Forces and acknowledged Pakistan’s role in promoting regional peace and stability,” the statement said.
Field Marshal Munir reiterated that Pakistan values its longstanding relations with Indonesia and is committed to expanding defence collaboration in training, counter-terrorism, and capacity-building domains, it added.
Guard of honour
President Subianto, who is currently on a two-day official visit to Pakistan, was earlier presented a guard of honour upon his arrival at the Prime Minister’s House in Islamabad.
According to Radio Pakistan, a formal welcome ceremony was held for Subianto, who was received by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“A smartly turned out contingent of armed forces presented a guard of honour to the visiting dignitary,” it said.
The Indonesian president arrived in Islamabad yesterday at the invitation of PM Shehbaz.
In a post on X, the premier had said he was honoured to host President Subianto and looking forward to “our meaningful engagements tomorrow as we work to strengthen this enduring partnership”.







According to the Foreign Office (FO), this is the president’s first visit to Pakistan, as the last presidential visit was by ex-president Joko Widodo in 2018. The FO also said that the visit carried added significance as it coincided with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
President Prabowo will also meet President Asif Ali Zardari during his stay. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on the Indonesian president, the FO said.</p><small>2025-12-09 11:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0914231816104b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958990/the-open-manhole-that-laid-bare-karachis-systemic-rot' target='_blank'><strong>The open manhole that laid bare Karachi’s systemic rot</strong></a><br><p>“The echo of the mother’s screams still rings in my ears,” said a cop who was on duty near Karachi’s Nipa Chowrangi on the fateful night of November 30. The constable was at the site when the incident occurred; a three-year-old child had fallen to his death in an open manhole.
Ibrahim and his parents were exiting the Chase Department Store in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, from where they had purchased monthly groceries. The father was on the motorcycle, while the mother-son duo followed behind. Suddenly, the excited three-year-old boy ran towards his dad, who was a few footsteps away, but instead of falling into the safe arms of his father, he fell into a pitch-black manhole.
What ensued was witnessed by most of Karachi on television and mobile screens: a hysterical mother begging for her child, a search operation that lasted 15 long hours and an apathetic city administration that barely batted an eye.
“The manhole had been uncovered for days,” the constable, who wished to remain anonymous, told Dawn as he stood at the same spot a day later. Behind him, several labourers were working to repair the sewage pipes that had been dug up and sliced during the rescue operation to search for the child.


Construction work continues at Nipa Chowrangi days after Ibrahim’s death.

The manhole, on the other hand, was still uncovered. “Ab kya faida? Bacha to gir gaya (what is the use now? the child fell and died),” the policeman lamented, as a group of nine- and 10-year-old boys passed by.
In 2023, some 68 people were reportedly lost to manholes in Karachi. From January to November this year, another 22 people have died by falling into manholes and open sewers, according to data compiled by the Edhi Foundation. Of the latter, eight were children, all of whom were 10 years old or younger.
The rescue operation
Three-year-old Ibrahim Nabeel, budding with life, the only child of his parents, became the 23rd victim of the year. His body was found almost a kilometre away, the day after he fell into the manhole at Nipa Chowrangi.
That fateful night, teams of the Rescue 1122 and Edhi Foundation scrambled through Karachi’s dilapidated underground sewage network that comprises 43 major drains and 516 drain water channels, until the operation had to be halted due to visibility issues.
Realistically, the timespan within which a person can be rescued from a manhole alive is two minutes or less. For a child as young as Ibrahim, this window is even shorter.
“At 10:29pm, we received a complaint at the Command and Control Centre,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan ul Haseeb told Dawn. By 10:56pm, the first responder unit had reached the site, where a mob-like situation had formed — angry and agitated residents had gathered. A search operation was immediately commenced.
“One of our divers went to the bottom of the manhole in which the child fell, but the flow of the sewage water was rapid, and he couldn’t find anything,” he explained, adding that water from four other nullahs was also flowing through the same site.
Subsequently, heavy machinery — called in by Ibrahim’s family and locals for Rs15,000 from the nearby BRT construction site — was used to dig into the sewerage lines, but to no avail. The excavation was done 2km along the service lane adjacent to the Chase department store. “The delay in this was caused because we didn’t have a blueprint or map of Karachi’s underground water drainage system.”
The rescue team, Haseeb continued, was unaware of the inlets and outlets of the sewage drains and their choke points. “We were relying on the judgment and knowledge of locals,” he said, explaining that relevant departments — district administration, town municipal corporation and Karachi Metropolitan Corporation — were responsible for providing the blueprint. But they were unavailable on the night of the tragedy.
Even if they were present, they wouldn’t be able to do anything because no structural documentation exists for Karachi’s sewerage and stormwater network.
Eventually, a few hours past midnight, the search operation was halted due to a lack of visibility, which Haseeb said was in accordance with international protocols for underwater rescue and search. The operation resumed early the next morning.
“We had positioned our volunteers at eight sewage points along a one to two kilometre stretch of the service lane,” he told Dawn, adding that the child’s body was finally found near the Sir Syed University, around a kilometre from where he had fallen into the manhole.


Edhi workers conduct rescue operation to find Ibrahim’s body on Dec 1.

Meanwhile, Farooq, an Edhi worker who was also involved in the rescue operation, said that the Foundation received a call at the control centre at around 11:15pm. It took him about 20-25 minutes to gather a team to reach the site, where he recalled Rescue 1122 officials were already present.
“We took some directions from them and divided the areas for the search operation,” he said. “But around 3:30am, the operation was halted due to visibility issues.” When the rescue operation commenced again in daylight, Farooq decided that it was time to go down inside the sewage pipes, as otherwise the chances of finding Ibrahim’s body were slim.
“After crossing 40-50 pipes, we found ourselves in front of two pipes that were choked with garbage.” But underneath Karachi’s uneven roads, oxygen was deficient due to toxic gases, and with every passing moment, it became difficult to breathe. “So we drilled two holes into the pipes, and as they began clearing, the sewage water flow increased exponentially.”
Ultimately, along with the water, Ibrahim’s body too floated out from a sewage drain at a short distance, where a teenage boy identified as Tanveer found it. The three-year-old boy was subsequently moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in an Edhi ambulance.


Banners calling for resignation of Mayor Murtaza Wahab hung opposite Chase store.

At JPMC, Ibrahim’s grandfather, Mehmoodul Hasan, received the body. The three-year-old’s mother was unconscious, and his father stricken with grief. Meanwhile, relatives of the grieving family, along with residents and political workers of Jamaat-i-Islami, reached the site the same day and held a protest.
Murtaza Wahab must resign immediately, they demanded angrily. Later that evening, Ibrahim was laid to rest.
Who is to blame?
The city’s mayor, on the other hand, only focused on the rhetoric surrounding the incident. At a press conference the same day, he said: “Unfortunately, when this kind of thing happens, we immediately go toward blame […] if there is a human tragedy, then is it necessary to bring politics into it?”

         View this post on Instagram            

The nonchalance in Wahab’s tone, who was likened by the Sindh chief minister to New York’s Zohran Mamdani until a few weeks back, was too evident to be ignored. It worsened when a journalist tried to hold him accountable by asking why he was addressing a media talk instead of visiting the family, why he hadn’t visited the site of the incident, and where he was during the 15-hour-long rescue operation.
The exchange grew heated, responsibility was deflected, and frustration piled up until finally, the mayor apologised; an apology that was forced, an apology that didn’t sound so sincere, an apology that Karachi has heard several times but lacks any subsequent action.
Thus began a blame game. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) blamed the TransKarachi and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line, which blamed the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation, which said the stormwater drain involved in the incident does not fall under its jurisdiction. A vicious cycle with no end in sight.
Dawn reached out to Murtaza Wahab but did not hear back from him until the filing of the story.
Today, six days after the incident, authorities have failed to determine who is responsible for leaving the manhole open. But Dawn found that the KMC had already been alerted to the manhole problem between Hassan Square and Nipa Chowrangi on October 20.



“We wrote three letters to the mayor and the chief minister this year regarding the problems caused due to the BRT construction work (traffic, open sewers, holey roads),” said Riaz Azhar, the UC chairman of the locality. “But we never received any response.”
Finally, on Oct 20, Azhar met with the BRT committee to discuss the aforementioned issues, after which a document detailing the minutes of the meeting was sent to the KMC. The second pointer of the document, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said: “covered all manholes through rings and covers on service lanes (at Asr-e-Shirin shop block 13-A). No output.”
In a response on Oct 29, Azhar was told that the contractor assigned for manhole covers had fled due to a dispute, and there was nothing that could be done. “A month later, a child was gulped down,” he said. “Had the chief minister and mayor acted on time, a tragedy of such a proportion could have been prevented.”
He explained that the KWSC, headed by Mayor Wahab, was responsible for all sewage-related concerns, for which it had launched a 1334 helpline. “Unfortunately, it was only responsive for so long.”
A few years back, the UC-02 chairman recalled, the KWSC provided 20-25 manhole covers per month to each union committee free of cost. But the process is usually so long and tedious that it is preferred to purchase the covers from the market, where they cost Rs700, Azhar said.
Following the Nipa manhole incident, the KMC approved a day earlier nearly Rs300 million per year —Rs100,000 per month each — for all union committees to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights.
When asked why the UC did not purchase a manhole cover for the one in which Ibrahim fell, the chairman lamented, “How would we know which manhole is missing where?”
He further explained that each UC was given a monthly fund of Rs1.2 million, half of which was spent on salaries. The other half was used for contracts and quotations — each of which cost Rs300,000 — and the remaining was spent on bills. Separately, the expenditure for each of the four UC wards was Rs25,000.
“And when we use our own funds for any such repairs, we are reprimanded for it by the KMC,” Azhar added. However, he did admit that the town chairman, who had reached the incident site at 11pm on the night of Nov 30, should have made efforts to expedite the rescue operation instead of waiting for the machinery to be arranged.
For its part, the KWSC spokesperson Abdul Qadir Sheikh told Dawn that they had a comprehensive complaint management system where anyone — from the city and town council to ordinary citizens — could lodge their queries by calling the helpline. The aim, according to Sheikh, was to resolve them at the earliest. He, however, did not admit or deny whether a complaint, as mentioned by Azhar, was sent to the KWSC regarding the missing manhole covers.
To another question, Sheikh concurred that 25 manhole covers were indeed provided to the UC. “In the case of a need for more, they can write to the concerned department.” He explained that apart from the complaints, executive engineers also undertook efforts to ensure that all manholes were covered in their respective areas.
From Oct 23, 2024, to Dec 1, 2025, the KWSC received a total of 1,543 complaints regarding open manholes, of which 89.94 per cent were resolved, data provided by the corporation showed. In the Gulshan-i-Iqbal Town, 107 out of 110 such queries were resolved.
Ibrahim fell into one of the three remaining manholes.
“I don’t want to place responsibility on any one department; we are all to blame for it … nothing is dearer to us more than the people of Karachi,” Sheikh remarked. But when asked if an internal inquiry or investigation had been initiated by the KWSC to determine why the manhole in question was left open, he did not have an answer.
Meanwhile, UC Chairman Azhar, after complaining about the state of affairs, held Ibrahim’s parents and the Chase department store responsible. “They [the parents] should have been more careful, and the department store, where hundreds and thousands of people come every day, should have installed a manhole.”
“Should have been more responsible” — the phrase is Karachi’s favourite absolution. A dumper truck crushes a motorcyclist? The driver should have been careful. A child goes missing? The family should have been careful. A three-year-old slips from his mother’s hand and disappears into an open manhole within seconds? The parents, too, should have been careful.
Ultimately, all Karachiites must be “careful” because the responsibility of their well-being does not lie with those who build, manage or govern the city — instead, it lies with the people who are simply trying to live in it. Where safety depends not on systems, but luck. Where we tell parents, pedestrians, and drivers to be vigilant — because the city will not be vigilant for them. Here, you survive if you can. And if you don’t, well … you should have been more “careful”.
The systematic collapse
Karachi’s pressing infrastructural gaps are not a new topic of discussion. Unfortunately, they are only brought up when a life is lost, especially that of a three-year-old innocent child.
The pattern is almost recognisable now: visit the victims with photographers and videographers in tow, feign empathy and concern, sack a bunch of ‘not so important’ officials, and give it a few days until the incident fades into a painful memory.
Or better yet, turn it into a controversy. In the case of this one, a grieving grandfather’s love was questioned, as he had to sit before the media and clarify that he did not take any money from the KMC for issuing statements in favour of them.

  @timesofkarachi The grandfather of three-year-old Ibrahim has rejected claims made in the media regarding the Nipa Chowrangi manhole incident, stating that he never confirmed that Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) recovered the child’s body. TOKReports Ibrahim NipaIncident ♬ original sound - Times of Karachi - Times of Karachi   

“All institutions linked to this tragedy are responsible,” he stressed by the end of his media talk. The institutions he referred to are the confluence of Karachi’s three-tier local government structure, which comprises about 250 UCs, 25 town municipal corporations, and the KMC — read mayor — that reigns above them all.
Within this organogram are also various state institutions that are a part of the structure: here, the KWSC.
“Open manholes are essentially reflective of a systematic failure,” said urban planner Bilal Khalid. “It is not a one-off incident.” He explained that a missing manhole is a problem that lies right at the local level because it exists in gallis and muhallas.
And it should be solved by the UC, because the people higher up in the hierarchy have a broader scope of work. “You cannot expect the mayor to personally ensure that every manhole is covered, and this is why UCs exist.”
But here, the power was never devolved, and so, the mayor is responsible because he is the head of the KWSC, which looks after all sewage-related matters. “It is simple: a manhole is missing, the UC chairman is told, he collects a cover from the council inventory and gets it installed.”
Instead, what happens is that even if the UC is told of a missing manhole, he will first have to file a complaint at the KWSC office because neither the TMC nor the KMC have the authority to solve the issue. “The hierarchy that is shown to you or any other citizen of Karachi is far from the ground reality.
“The solution is very clear: the devolution of power. In this case, the best solution can come from the local representatives.” He emphasised that the authority for local muhalla-related matters should lie with the TMC, terming it “crucial”. It should be authorised, funded and provided with inventory, among other things.
Khalid added that regular monitoring by TMCs would ultimately lead to mapping of sewage and water lines, which is the most critical for Karachi. “This is something that the KWSC cannot do because it does not have localised wings.”
Urban planner Farhan Anwar concurred. He termed young Ibrahim’s death “symbolic of a larger level of institutional bankruptcy that presently defines Karachi’s governance construct”, a problem that has existed in the port city of 20.3 million residents for years.
“Years of political battles over control of power and resources have rendered all our institutions impotent,” he deplored. “It is like flogging a dead horse because the mandate of these institutions has been twisted completely.” Basically, the merit and capacity required to solve Karachi’s issues have eluded key organisations.
Despite housing a big chunk of the country’s economic and human capital, the city lacks people-centric planning and development, he explained. “The problems are political, the problems are institutional, the problems are related to a complete dysfunctionality that exists within the governance construct of Karachi.”
The only solutions, he went on to say, lie at the political level. “There has to be a show of strong political will to completely redo and overhaul the governance architecture in Karachi, whereby the relevant institutions are given the power, authority, and functions that are relevant at that tier/level.”


The manhole in which Ibrahim fell.

Ibrahim did not die because of one missing manhole cover. He died because Karachi is governed by institutions built to fight each other rather than serve the people who live in .
What’s needed is not another committee, another apology, or another reshuffling of duties. It is the political will to return power to the level where problems actually exist — the street, the lane, the neighbourhood. Without that, no document, no plan, and no new model of manhole will save lives.
Because in Karachi, people do not fall into manholes — they fall through the gaps of a system that refuses to hold itself accountable.</p><small>2025-12-09 11:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638309-muhammad-hashir-secures-bronze-for-pakistan-at-ijso-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Muhammad Hashir secures bronze for Pakistan at IJSO 2025</strong></a><br><p>

The term of the local government expired in February 2021, but elections could not be held and were further delayed due to “new legislation.”
In a notification also posted to social media, the ECP called on voters in the ICT to elect their representatives to the general seats of union councils.
It set Dec 19 as the date for public notice inviting nomination papers to be issued by the returning officers (ROs), while Dec 22-27 (excluding Quaid-i-Azam Day on Dec 25) as the dates for filing of nomination papers with the ROs by the candidates.
The names of the nominated candidates will be published on Dec 29, and the nomination papers will be scrutinised by the ROs from Dec 30 to Jan 3, 2026.
From Jan 5-8, appeals may be filed against the decisions of the ROs to accept or reject the nominations. These appeals will be decided by the Appellate Authority from Jan 9-13, and the revised candidate list will be published on the 14th.
Jan 15 marks the final day of withdrawal of candidature, the day after which election symbols will be allotted and the list of contesting candidates published.
The polling day will take place after 29 days on Sunday, Feb 15, with the results being consolidated between the 16th and 19th of the month. The ECP, in its notification, added that polling hours will be observed from 8am to 4pm and that all polling activities would take place during office hours.







The ECP also issued directives to ensure “that elections to the local government are conducted honestly, justly, fairly, in accordance with the law and to ensure that the corrupt practices are guarded against”.
It directed that all executive authorities in the federation would “neither announce any development project nor use state resources in local government polls calculated to influence the elections in favour of a particular candidate”.
“If any person in government service misuses his official position in any manner in order to influence [the] results of the elections, he shall be liable to be proceeded against under the law,” the notification added.
It further said that after the issuance of the LG election programme, no transfers or postings of government officers and officials, including autonomous bodies and authorities, were to be made in Islamabad without the commission’s prior approval until the publication of the election results. The same applied to the granting of leave for these individuals.
“In case leave has already been sanctioned, the officer will not relinquish his charge without approval of the honourable commission,” the notification said.
In addition, it prohibited the president, prime minister, chairman and deputy chairman of the Senate, Speaker, deputy Speaker of an Assembly, federal minister, ministers of states, governors, chief ministers, provincial ministers and advisers to the prime minister, chief ministers and chairmen or vice chairmen from participating in an election campaign after the issuance of this programme.
“However, members of any assembly, Senate and local government are allowed to participate in the election campaign,” it added, on the condition that they strictly abide by the ECP’s code of conduct.
The ECP said that any holder of public office who was found to have violated any provision of the election laws or the ECP’s instructions would be “proceeded against as mandated in law”.
LG polls in Islamabad have faced a five-year delay. The ECP stated that the terms of the local government in Islamabad expired on February 14, 2021, and elections were supposed to be conducted within 120 days after it.
The commission finally issued the order in November to hold the polls, after voicing concern over the delay.</p><small>2025-12-09 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638299-ihc-declares-justice-jahangiris-invalid-degree-case-admissible' target='_blank'><strong>IHC declares plea on Justice Jahangiri's degree case admissible</strong></a><br><p>

Adult life at work is often characterised by busy days and numerous responsibilities.
However, this place where we spend so much of our adult lives is also where many feel most lonely. It’s a strange thought when we consider the number of hours spent surrounded by colleagues. Yet, workplace loneliness remains a common yet silent issue worldwide.

This is not just about its effects on workplace productivity; it is about how loneliness can impact self-worth, emotional stability, and even physical health.

In a world centred around connection, many employees feel isolated in ways they never anticipated.
Part of the problem is that loneliness at work rarely appears dramatic. It doesn’t display the signs typically seen in issues like burnout, stress, or absenteeism. There are no obvious warnings, no raised voices, and no sudden changes in performance.
Instead, it creeps in quietly. It manifests as the person who keeps conversations brief, the teammate who prefers to eat lunch alone, or the colleague who appears fine on the surface but feels strangely disconnected underneath.

Loneliness is not about how many people are around you. Instead, it is about feeling unseen or unsupported. You can be in a crowded office and still feel like no one knows you.

This feeling of loneliness is present in workplaces that mistreat their employees, but it is also seen in supportive workplaces. Even in teams that support us and treat us fairly, we can feel out of place.
The inside jokes, the quick chats, the shared lunches, all of it can make you feel like you are watching a conversation you were never invited into. It is not about exclusion, just a quiet feeling like you don’t belong with the people around you.
You want to contribute to the team, but the group’s social dynamics make you feel like an observer, as if you weren’t even there.
Why does this happen? One reason is something researchers call the belonging gap. Humans are wired to look for signs that they matter to the group around them. When those signals are faint or missing, the brain reacts as if something vital is slipping away.
That reaction can stir up worry, self-doubt, and a sense of being excluded.
You may start wondering whether you said the wrong thing, missed an unspoken rule, or whether others are judging you, even when nothing suggests they are.
Another reason is due to remote work. Many people enjoy the freedom and flexibility of working from home, yet others quietly struggle with a sense of distance.
The work gets done, messages are exchanged, meetings run on schedule, but something feels missing. Technology keeps everyone connected, but it cannot fully replace the simple comfort of sharing a space with others.
Screens make communication easy, but they can also make relationships feel thin, leaving some workers unsure whether they are truly part of a team or just a name on a screen. This was especially prevalent during Covid-19 when employees felt disconnected.
The effects of workplace loneliness reach far beyond the office. It can follow a person home, shaping how they talk to their family or how they feel when the workday ends. They can feel guilty for coming home drained not being able to do anything else.
This type of loneliness is not about being physically alone. It is about feeling emotionally disconnected throughout the day, which leaves the person too tired to engage with the people they love.
While the causes of workplace loneliness vary, the heart of the issue is simple. People need to feel valued. They need the sense that someone hears them, recognises their efforts, and cares enough to check in.
One of the most effective ways to reduce loneliness is through micro connections. These are the brief but meaningful moments when someone feels acknowledged, like when a coworker asks how your morning is going and actually listens to the answer.
They might seem minor, but these interactions reinforce a sense of belonging and connection within the community.
Leaders and coworkers alike play a role in this. A simple thank-you, a short chat before a meeting, or an invitation to lunch can soften the edges of isolation.
For teams working remotely, turning on cameras for a few minutes, sharing personal updates, or checking in casually can create moments of connection that help reduce feelings of loneliness. None of this requires dramatic gestures. It only requires intention.
It also helps to remember that loneliness is not a personal failure. It is a human response. Feeling disconnected does not mean you are not capable or likeable. It simply means you need a connection, which is something everyone deserves.

Reaching out to a trusted coworker, joining a group discussion, or even mentioning your feelings to a manager can help.

Whether you are a leader, a teammate, or someone trying to find your place, you can make the environment warmer and healthier. A workplace built on real connection is not just more productive. It is more human.
Pay attention to how you feel at work. Notice how others seem to be doing. Reach out when you can. And if you are feeling lonely, know that you can speak up. The next move is yours.

The move comes after Texas Governor Greg Abbott last month designated the CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood as foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organisations. Since then, US President Donald Trump has also issued an executive order directing agencies to initiate the formal process for designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations.
According to Fox News, Florida’s designation of the CAIR is at the state level. It doesn’t carry the legal force of a federal foreign terrorist organisation listing, which only the US State Department can issue.
In a post on X, the Florida governor said, “Florida is designating the Muslim Brotherhood and the CAIR as foreign terrorist organisations.
“Florida agencies are hereby directed to undertake all lawful measures to prevent unlawful activities by these organisations, including denying privileges or resources to anyone providing material support,” he said in the post, which also shared images of the governor’s executive order.







In response, the CAIR and its Florida chapter announced that a lawsuit would be filed against DeSantis in response to his “defamatory and unconstitutional” order.
“From the moment Ron DeSantis took office as Florida governor, he has prioritized serving the Israeli government over serving the people of Florida,” the joint statement said.
“Like Greg Abbott in Texas, Ron DeSantis is an Israel-first politician who wants to smear and silence Americans, especially American Muslims, critical of US support for Israel’s war crimes,” it said.







“We look forward to defeating Governor DeSantis’ latest Israel-first stunt in a court of law, where facts matter and conspiracy theories have no weight. In the meantime, we encourage all Floridians and all Americans to speak up against this latest attempt to shred the Constitution for the benefit of a foreign government,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-12-09 08:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09131613ac2bbc8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960107/7-injured-as-6-trailer-trucks-collide-on-multan-sukkur-motorway-due-to-fog-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>7 injured as 6 trailer trucks collide on Multan-Sukkur Motorway due to fog: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>Reduced visibility due to fog resulted in the collision of six trailer trucks on the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) on Tuesday, leaving seven people injured, according to Rescue 1122.
A section of the motorway (M5) from Zahir Pir in Rahim Yar Khan to the Multan Sher Shah Interchange — near which the collision took place — was also briefly closed in the morning due to fog hampering visibility.
According to a statement by the Rescue 1122, trucks being driven on the motorway collided with stationary ones due to fog.
Separately, Multan Rescue 1122 spokesperson Arshad Hussain told Dawn that the collision had taken place between six trucks.
The rescue service’s statement further detailed that seven people were injured in the accident, of whom two were taken out of a truck during a rescue operation.
Traffic diverted due to closure
National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) spokesperson Imran Shah earlier confirmed to Dawn that the M5 was closed from the Multan Sher Shah Interchange to Zahir Pir in Rahim Yar Khan between 6am and 11:30am due to foggy conditions.
The M5 is part of the Lahore–Karachi Motorway network and is operational up to Sukkur. Tuesday’s temporary closure forced thousands of travellers to shift to the National Highway to reach their destinations.
Following the closure, traffic was diverted onto the National Highway from Zahir Pir to Uch Sharif, Alipur and Muzaffargarh to access Multan and Rahim Yar Khan.
The disruption inconvenienced commuters travelling to Jalalpur Pirwala and Shujabad tehsils of Multan district.
Heavy traffic congestion was also reported near several interchanges, including Zahir Pir, Uch Sharif, Jhangra, Jalalpur Pirwala and Shujabad, after the motorway closure.
In a statement released earlier in the day, the NHMP spokesperson said the decision to close a section of the M5 was taken to ensure the safety of motorists as visibility had dropped significantly along the affected stretch.
The spokesperson said lane violations during fog could lead to serious accidents and urged motorists to strictly adhere to lane discipline.
He advised citizens to travel during the daytime between 10am and 6pm. He also instructed motorists to use fog lights, avoid unnecessary travel, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and refrain from overspeeding.
Weather forecast
Meanwhile, the weather forecast by the Pakistan Meteorological Department shows fog was expected to blanket multiple areas in Punjab from today until Thursday, including Sahiwal, Bahawalpur, Multan, Faisalabad and Lahore. Foggy weather was also expected in Dera Ghazi Khan, Sargodha and Jhelum on Wednesday and Thursday.
However, the weather forecast on the Met Office’s website for the M5 Motorway shows that foggy weather was not expected until at least 11pm.
Fog had disrupted travel in various areas of Punjab in January as well, when authorities had to close sections of motorways due to reduced visibility. Low visibility caused by dense fog had also led to several flights being either delayed, cancelled or diverted at the time and had also affected train traffic.</p><small>2025-12-09 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/09125005df87369.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960113/1-injured-after-unknown-assailants-open-fire-on-senator-khurram-zeeshans-in-laws-home-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>1 injured after unknown assailants open fire on Senator Khurram Zeeshan’s in-laws’ home in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>At least one person was injured after unknown assailants opened fire on PTI Senator Khurram Zeeshan’s in-laws’ home located in Hayatabad area on the outskirts of Peshawar during the early hours of Tuesday.
Zeeshan was elected to the Senate in October on a general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz.
According to the incident report filed at the Tatara police station, the attack occurred around 3:15am, with unidentified attackers opening fire on the home located in Phase 2 of Hayatabad.
According to police, Syed Azhar Hussain Bukhari, the senator’s brother-in-law, said he was at his home when it came under attack. He said that one of the people working at his home, identified as Absar Ahmed, had sustained a bullet injury in the attack. He further said that his property was also damaged in the incident.
The spokesperson for the PTI’s KP chapter, Ikram Khatana, also confirmed the attack. He further said that the senator was not present at the residence when it occurred. He said that the attackers had tried to persuade the occupants to open the gate, and upon their refusal, proceeded to open fire.
Senator Zeeshan has not yet responded to requests for a comment.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted on social media platform X that he was “ deeply disturbed” to hear about the attack.
While the incident report said that only one person had been injured in the attack, Nasir’s post mentioned two injured.
He said, “The assault on the home of a senator who has been a vocal critic of the power elements underscores the perilous environment for political dissent in the country.
“It is therefore imperative that transparent, thorough investigations be conducted to ensure justice and accountability.”
Senator Nasir further stated that such incidents “erode confidence in the constitutional promise to protect freedom of speech and association, and they must be addressed urgently to safeguard the rights and safety of all citizens, regardless of their political stance”.

In reality, the 22-year-old from Madaripur, some 100 kilometres to the south of Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, was fighting for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — a banned militant group waging insurgency against the Pakistani state in order to establish their own interpretation of Sharia law.
On September 26, 2025, Pakistani security forces killed Hossain during an operation in Karak district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. His brother, Arman, identified him from photos of bodies circulated in the media.
Hossain is one of at least four Bangladeshis confirmed killed while fighting for the TTP, referred to as the Fitna al-Khawarij by the Pakistan state. Bangladesh’s Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit adds that another two dozen or so Bangladeshi nationals are currently in Pakistan, fighting for the TTP and other militant organisations — a trend that experts say first emerged in 2023 and has alarmed authorities in Dhaka.
A second Bangladeshi, Zubair Ahmed, 22, is believed to have been killed in April 2025. “At the end of April, I received a call from an unknown number, informing me that my son is no more,” his mother, Aleya Akter, tells Eos.

Dozens of young Bangladeshi men are said to be fighting for extremist Pakistani outfits such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban. Their recruitment marks a dangerous new export for Bangladesh and a perplexing shift in South Asian militancy…

THE FATE OF RATAN DHALI
The fate of a third man, Ratan Dhali, 29, remains unclear. In early November, the CTTC informed his family he had been killed in the September 26 operation. But on December 1, a video surfaced on Bangladeshi social media, showing someone identified as Dhali and claiming to be alive.
CTTC Superintendent of Police (SP) Rawshan Sadia Afroz tells Eos that officers have investigated the video and found it to be fake and will not be conducting a forensic analysis. A TTP spokesperson in Pakistan, Imran Haider, who initially told Eos that Dhali was dead has now retracted the statement, saying Dhali was only presumed dead because he had been missing.
For Dhali’s family, the uncertainty is agonising. “A few days ago, the police informed me that my son had been killed in Pakistan,” his father Anwar Dhali tells Eos. “Now, God only knows whether my son is alive or not.
Ratan Dhali last spoke to his family on April 11, 2024 — Eid day. He made a video call to his mother, exchanged Eid greetings, and told her he was in Delhi and would soon travel to Dubai. “That was our last conversation. I never spoke to my son again,” says Selina Begum, Ratan’s mother, as she broke down in tears.

RECRUITMENT METHOD
In March 2024, Hossain told his father that he wanted to go to Dubai. But his family did not agree, as they could not afford it. A few days later, Hossain told them that he had found a way to get there. “An elder brother will take me there and pay all the expenses. My salary will be 35,000 takas [$285]. After arriving in Dubai, I will have to repay him from my salary,” he told them.
When Hossain was about to leave home for Dubai, his elder brother Arman asked him if he had obtained a visa. Faisal replied that his visa would be from India. “I was surprised when I heard that,” Arman tells Eos.
“He [Hossain] would call us once or twice a month and say he was working in Dubai,” says Arman. “We last contacted him in June this year. Since then, despite repeated attempts, it has not been possible to reach him.”
Also in March 2024, Dhali told his father he was going to Dubai. “He told me that his boss had a clinic in Dubai and he wanted Ratan to work there,” his father Anwar tells Eos. About 20 days later, was when Dhali called his mother and told her he was in India and would be going to Dubai, he adds.
In reality, both men had travelled to India via the Benapole Land Port — the largest land port in Bangladesh, used for imports and exports to and from India — before staying in Kolkata and Delhi for several days. “Our investigation found that Ratan [Dhali] and Faisal [Hossain] entered India via the Benapole land port on March 27, 2024. From there, they illegally travelled to Pakistan through Afghanistan, where they joined the TTP,” says SP Afroz.
Dhali and Hossain had been working at a clinic called Rof Rof Hijama Centre, located in Dhaka’s Khilgaon area. When Eos went to look for the clinic, it was no longer in the building. A resident said it had relocated a few months earlier.
Zubair took a different route. He first went to Saudi Arabia in November 2024 to perform Umrah. After completing Umrah, he did not return home. The CTTC say Zubair entered Pakistan through legal channels from Saudi Arabia. “After performing Umrah, Zubair said he was not coming home for now, as he was busy spreading the message of Allah,” says Aleya Akter, his mother.

PREYING ON THE VULNERABLE
There seems to be certain similarities in the three recruits: all three come from modest backgrounds.
Dhali studied at a school in Dhaka until class five. His father drives an autorickshaw and his mother is a housewife. Hossain completed his matriculation at a school in Uttara, Dhaka. His father is a retired private-sector employee and his elder brother works as a deliveryman. Ahmed was pursuing an undergraduate degree in Islamic Studies and comes from a middle-class family.
The families of the victims allege that their sons were misled and trapped. They are demanding justice and have urged the Bangladesh government to take immediate action.
“I have only one demand. I want the people who led my son down this path to be punished,” says Ratan’s father. Faisal’s brother Arman echoes the demand. “I request the Bangladeshi government to investigate the root of this cycle and punish those responsible, so that no one else falls for this kind of deception and loses their child in the future,” he tells Eos.
Analysts say militant recruiters often target young people from rural districts, who are seeking jobs abroad or are financially strapped. “People from lower-middle-class families are the most vulnerable, which is why they can be easily persuaded by promises of money,” says Mubashar Hasan, a political analyst specialising in South Asian geopolitics and an adjunct researcher at the Western Sydney University in Australia.
Imran Haider, the TTP spokesperson in Pakistan who spoke to Eos via WhatsApp, contends that the young men knew what they were getting into. “No one was brought here by force or deception,” says Haider, who claims to be a former Bangladesh Air Force engineer. According to the CTTC, he left Bangladesh in April 2023.
SCALE OF THE ISSUE
According to SP Afroz, Bangladeshis are joining multiple militant organisations in Pakistan beyond the TTP. “So far, we have identified three of them: TTP, TLP [Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan] and IMP [Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan],” she says.
Experts believe the majority join the TTP, which was founded in 2007 by Baitullah Mehsud. Its current leader is Noor Wali Mehsud, who has publicly pledged allegiance to the Afghan Taliban.
While it remains difficult to estimate how many Bangladeshis are leaving for Pakistan, the trend has grown in recent years. “I am not obligated to tell you how many [Bangladeshis] are fighting for TTP,” says TTP’s Haider.
Bangladeshi police say they have identified dozens who are currently in Pakistan. “We have been able to identify 25 to 30 people who are currently in Pakistan and fighting,” says SP Afroz. Most of this recruitment, experts and security officials add, tends to take place online and often involves misinterpretation of religious edicts.
Dr Tawhidul Haque, a criminologist and associate professor at the University of Dhaka, says the involvement of Bangladeshi youth in militant organisations has been rising in recent years. “And they are now doing these things online, where they face less risk,” he adds.
Hasan Al Mahmud, who has been reporting on militancy in Bangladesh for years, says this trend of people from Bangladesh going to Pakistan to join militant organisations started in 2023. “They are constantly trying to recruit newcomers by misinterpreting religion,” he tells Eos.
Bangladesh police say that they have been cracking down on such activities and are keeping a close watch. “In recent years, we have identified at least a hundred people who were planning to go to Pakistan to engage in militancy,” says SP Afroz. “We stopped them.”

MOTIVATING FACTORS
For experts in Bangladesh, their fellow citizens fighting against a Muslim-majority country like Pakistan represents an unusual development. “In history, people from Bangladesh have gone to fight in many countries for various reasons,” says Mubashar Hasan, the political analyst. “But going to Pakistan to fight against the Pakistani government is a new and surprising development,” he adds.
Haider, the TTP spokesperson in Pakistan, says these young men are fighting to establish Islamic rule in Pakistan. “Although India and Pakistan were divided in 1947 based on the two-nation theory, Islamic rule was never truly established in Pakistan,” he says. “Our main goal is to establish Islamic rule in Pakistan.”
Mamunul Haque, an Islamic scholar and the joint secretary-general of Hefazat-i-Islam Bangladesh — one of the country’s largest Islamic organisations — rejects this reasoning. He says his organisation strongly advises against leaving Bangladesh to wage an armed war against another Islamic state. “Islam does not support this either,” he tells Eos.
But religious condemnation alone may not deter recruits who have already been radicalised — both online and offline. Dr Haque, the criminologist, says radicalised individuals lose their capacity for critical thinking. “They can’t think about things logically,” he says. “They simply follow whatever instructions they’re given.”
MILITANCY IN BANGLADESH
While Bangladesh has largely suppressed domestic militant activity in recent years, the emergence of citizens fighting abroad suggests extremist networks have adapted — recruiting online and sending fighters to foreign conflicts.
On July 5, 2025, an officer from the Intelligence Branch of Bangladesh’s Anti-Terrorism Unit filed a case with Savar police station in Dhaka, naming six people and their unidentified associates, confirms Savar police station’s officer-in-charge, Mohammad Jewel Mia. “The case, filed under the Anti-Terrorism Act, accuses them of conspiring against another country by attempting to disrupt and destabilise its public security on behalf of the TTP, as well as sharing extremist content,” Mia tells Eos.
Law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh also arrested two people on charges of being involved with the TTP, also in July this year. The case file states that some Bangladeshi youths, inspired by the ideology of the TTP, are attempting to establish an Islamic Sharia-based regime in Pakistan by travelling to Afghanistan.
However, local acts of terrorism are few and far between. The last major terrorist attack on Bangladeshi soil took place on the night of July 1, 2016, when five young Bangladeshis carried out a brutal attack at the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka, killing 20 people — including 17 foreigners — by shooting and stabbing them. Two police officers were also killed while trying to stop the attackers.
That night, the international extremist organisation Islamic State (IS) claimed responsibility and released photos of the perpetrators. However, the government rejected the IS claim, attributing the attack to the Bangladeshi militant group Neo-Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh.
In response to such attacks over the years, the Bangladeshi government has banned nine militant organisations in the country as terrorist groups. Under the prevailing laws, these groups are prohibited from carrying out any activities in Bangladesh.
Yet some banned groups have tried to resurface, including Hizb-ut-Tahrir Bangladesh, which was proscribed in 2009. In March 2024, hundreds of members of the group held a public procession following Friday prayers in Dhaka, demanding the country’s secular democracy be replaced by an Islamic caliphate. Law enforcement responded by firing tear gas and sound grenades and arrested several participants.
Meanwhile, even if the video claiming to show Ratan Dhali to be alive isn’t forensically analysed, his family remains trapped between hope and grief — unsure whether their son will return or if he has already become another casualty in a conflict most Bangladeshis barely understand.
It’s an uncertainty that may define this new phase of militancy: families left in limbo, young men vanishing across borders and a threat that operates in digital shadows, far beyond the reach of domestic law enforcement.

In its annual report, the Paris-based media freedom group said the total number of journalists killed reached 67 globally this year, slightly up from the 66 killed in 2024.
Israeli forces accounted for 43 per cent of the total, making them “the worst enemy of journalists”, RSF said in its report, which documented deaths over 12 months from December 2024.
The most deadly single attack was a so-called “double-tap” strike on a hospital in south Gaza on August 25, which killed five journalists, including two contributors to international news agencies Reuters and the Associated Press.
In total, since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023, nearly 220 journalists have died, making Israel the biggest killer of journalists worldwide for three years running, RSF data shows.
Foreign reporters are still unable to travel to Gaza — unless they are in tightly controlled tours organised by the Israeli military — despite calls from media groups and press freedom organisations for access.

 

Elsewhere in the RSF annual report, the group said that 2025 was the deadliest year in Mexico in at least three years, with nine journalists killed there, despite pledges from left-wing President Claudia Sheinbaum to help protect them.
War-wracked Ukraine (three journalists killed) and Sudan (four journalists killed) are the other most dangerous countries for reporters in the world, according to RSF.
The overall number of deaths last year is far down from the peak of 142 journalists killed in 2012, linked largely to the Syrian civil war, and is below the average since 2003 of around 80 killed per year.
The RSF annual report also counts the number of journalists imprisoned worldwide for their work, with 121 in China, 48 in Russia and 47 in Myanmar.
As of December 1, 2025, 503 journalists were detained in 47 countries across the world, the report said.</p><small>2025-12-09 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638252-kp-risks-governors-rule-if-provincial-govt-resists-cooperation-kundi' target='_blank'><strong>KP risks governor's rule if provincial govt resists cooperation: Kundi</strong></a><br><p>

Each side has blamed the other for the clashes, which have derailed a fragile ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump that ended five days of fighting in July.
Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said two civilians had been killed overnight, taking its death toll to six. One Thai soldier has died in the fighting.

 

In a statement on Tuesday morning, the Thai Navy said Cambodian forces had been detected inside Thai territory in the coastal province of Trat and military operations were launched to expel them, without providing further details.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said late on Monday that Thailand “must not use military force to attack civilian villages under the pretext of reclaiming its sovereignty”.
Earlier, Cambodia said it had not retaliated even after its forces came under sustained attack.
The Thai Navy said Cambodian forces were increasing their presence, deploying snipers and heavy weapons, improving fortified positions and digging trenches, adding it saw the actions “as a direct and serious threat to Thailand’s sovereignty”.
Monday’s clashes were the fiercest since a five-day exchange of rockets and heavy artillery in July, when at least 48 people were killed and 300,000 displaced, before Trump intervened to broker a ceasefire.
Thailand evacuated 438,000 civilians across five border provinces and authorities in Cambodia said hundreds of thousands of people had been moved to safety. Thailand’s army said 18 soldiers were wounded and Cambodia’s government reported nine civilians injured.
Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817-km (508-mile) land border, with disputes over ancient temples stirring nationalist fervour and occasional armed flare-ups, including a deadly week-long artillery exchange in 2011.
Tensions rose in May following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a skirmish, which led to a major troop buildup at the border and escalated into diplomatic breakdowns and armed clashes.</p><small>2025-12-09 05:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638241-tip-ncps-2025-finds-economy-stable-police-tendering-seen-as-most-corrupt' target='_blank'><strong>TIP NCPS 2025 finds economy stable; police, tendering seen as most corrupt</strong></a><br><p>

Now students with arts background at the matric level can also be enrolled in pre-medical, pre-engineering and in ICS etc. The decision was made by the Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) at its 183rd meeting held in Karachi a few days ago, sources told Dawn.
The forum made another major policy decisions for O/A level students. Students who passed two major subjects in O/A level will be given equivalence in science group instead of humanities. The meeting also discussed abolishing the science and arts groups at the matric level by replacing it with standards Secondary School Certificate (SSC) with flexible choice of elective subjects. However, a final decision on abolishing groups at the matric level was not made as this will be further debated later.
The sources in Karachi said the forum was of the view that due to the bar at the matric level many brilliant students could not get admission in accordance with their choice at the inter level.

Under new policy, students with arts background at matric level can also be enrolled in pre-medical and pre-engineering

When contacted, IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah confirmed the two major decisions.
“Yes, IBCC forum has decided to give open choice to students for getting admission in first year in their favouirte groups. Similarly, the forum also decided that students of O/A level, who passed two major science subjects, should also be given equivalence in the Science Group,” he said and added that discussion also took place regarding replacing science and arts groups at the martic level with a standardised SSC certificate under which all students, besides compulsory subjects, will have flexible choice of elective subjects.
Dr Mallah while presenting rational behind these decisions said that due to some illogical bars, the growth of many shining students was halted.
“For example, in any school of far flung area of the country, students due to some reasons including shortage of science teachers could not study science, so as per pervious practice, they had no choice to get admission in engineering, medical and computer fields, which was a big injustice with them,” he said and added that now all fields are open for everyone and if students have the potential, capability and talent, they can pass pre-engineering and pre-medical at the inter level without studying these subjects at the metric level.
“Now world is changing and there is need of making changes to help students growth,” he said.
“Let me appreciate all members of IBCC and curriculum councils, who with collective wisdom made these students centric decisions,” Dr Mallah said.
Asked when these decisions will be implemented, he said at the IBCC level, “From today [Monday] we started issuing equivalence in science group to all those students who passed two majors science subjects in their O/A levels exams. Just a moment ago, we issued first equivalence certificate to a student who had passed physics and match in their O/A level.” He added that earlier such students were granted equivalence in humanities groups for not studying one more subject in science. “But, there was no encouragement for them for studying two science subjects,” he said.
“As far as admission in first year with open choice is concerned, I guess, this will be started from upcoming admission session. A decision had already been made and soon we will write a letter to all colleges, universities and boards for implementation,” he said.

The decision came in a move triggered by a public outrage after a three-year-old boy drowned in an uncovered nullah near NIPA.
“And this is in addition to the manhole covers placed by the KWSC (Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation) and the streetlights fixed by the KMC,” Mayor Murtaza Wahab told Dawn, clarifying that the city administration is not abdicating its responsibility for covering manholes and fixing streetlights, but is instead giving some financial powers to the UCs to help keep them maintained.
The announcement came directly from Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who said that the new mechanism had been designed to give fiscal space to the union committees, which are currently receiving Rs1.2 million each per month, an amount recently enhanced from half a million rupees.
Under the new summary approved by Mayor Wahab on Monday, each of the 246 UCs across the city would receive additional Rs100,000 every month to maintain the manhole covers and streetlights in their neighbourhoods.

Mayor Wahab says KMC is financially empowering UCs for infrastructure upkeep

Although the manhole covers are provided by both the KWSC and the KMC, he said, it was deemed necessary to take an additional step. Therefore, the KMC has decided to provide additional money to every UC, specifically and exclusively for streetlight maintenance and manhole cover requirements, he added.
An official told this reporter that according to the newly-passed summary by the mayor, the KMC would disburse Rs24.60 million every month to 246 UCs across the city and almost Rs300 million in a year for the maintenance of manhole covers and streetlights.
“The KWSC has already notified all towns and UCs for smooth supplies of the manhole covers and for the public-level engagement. The mayor has also set up helpline 1334 and email complaint@kmc.gos.pk, asking people to identify any open manholes and report them,” he added.
The move marks the first direct financial intervention by the KMC at the UC level since June 2023, when the current local government system was put in place. Since then, the KMC has largely relied on departmental coordination and inter-agency mechanisms to manage routine tasks, avoiding decentralised financial allocations to the UCs.
The decision comes against the backdrop of intense public outrage following the NIPA tragedy, which reignited criticism over the local government system’s failure to maintain essential civic infrastructure. However, despite releasing funds to the UCs, the authorities have not shared any mechanism to monitor or ensure that the money is spent for its intended purpose.
The official said the new allocation will be released from the Municipal Utility Charges and Taxes (MUCT) account, enabling each UC to respond quickly to the complaints, improve neighborhood infrastructure and deliver essential municipal services more effectively. Implemented in August 2024, the KMC aims at generating an annual income of Rs4 billion through the MUCT being collected through K-Electric (KE) bills.
Mayor Wahab hopes that the fresh initiative would help prevent “unfortunate incidents” in the city and to ensure that municipal issues at the local level are addressed promptly and effectively.
“The safety and well-being of Karachi’s citizens remain the city administration’s top priority, and this decision marks another stride toward building a safer, well-lit, and efficiently managed Karachi,” he added.

The humanitarian appeals’ immediate priority is to save 87 million lives with $23bn in funding, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said. Ultimately, in 2026, the aim is to raise a total of $33bn to support 135m people through 23 country operations and six plans for refugees and migrants.
The appeal, titled ‘2026 Response Plan’ earmarks $64.9m to provide assistance to 1.9m people in Pakist­­an. The aim of the appeal, called ‘Life by Life’, is to reach 135m in 50 countries in 2026, the UN agency said.
UNOCHA noted that in 2025, 98m people received help despite funding cuts and attacks on aid workers.

Occupied Palestinian Territory gets the largest individual plan — $4.1bn for three million people

In 2026, the largest individual response plan is for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, where $4.1bn is needed to assist 3 million people who have experienced shocking levels of violence and destruction. In Sudan, the world’s largest displacement crisis, $2.9bn is needed for 20 million people. The largest regional plan is for Syria, with $2.8bn targeted for 8.6 million people.
The highly prioritised appeal follows a year in which humanitarian lifelines were strained and, in some places, snapped due to severe funding cuts. Funding for the 2025 appeal — $12bn — was the lowest in a decade, resulting in 25 million fewer people being reached compared to 2024.
Amidst this devastation, civilians endured blatant disregard for the laws of war, and more than 320 aid workers, the vast majority of them local staff, were killed. The consequences were immediate: hunger surged, health systems came under crushing strain, education collapsed, mine clearance stalled and families suffered blow after blow, with no shelter, no cash assistance and no protection services.
“This appeal sets out where we need to focus our collective energy first: life by life,” said UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher. “The Global Humanitarian Over­view 2026 is grounded in reform, evidence and efficiency. We are shifting power to local organisations, putting more money directly into the hands of those who need it, and, behind all, renewing and reimagining hu­­manitarian action with idealism, humility and hope.”

However, the HEC claimed, it had never verified Justice Jahangiri’s law degree at any stage, nor had the judge ever approached the commission for verification.
The report was filed after a bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan directed the HEC to provide complete academic record of Justice Jahangiri in a case pertaining to his eligibility to hold judicial office.
During the hearing, the court was requested to summon the original academic record directly from Karachi University, which had cancelled the LLB degree awarded to the judge though the university decision was later suspended by the Sindh High Court.
Chief Justice Dogar obs­e­rved that the matter invo­lved a serious allegation and must be examined strictly on the basis of the record. Since the HEC is the regulatory authority for all universities in Paki­s­tan, the bench would first evaluate the commission’s report before deciding whether KU should be iss­u­­ed a notice, he remarked.
In its submission, the HEC enclosed KU’s inquiry report that revealed glaring discrepancies in the judge’s academic record. It stated that candidate ‘Tariq Mehmood’ obtained an LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968, but records showed that another student, Imtiaz Ahmed, had been enrolled under the same number in 1987, while the transcript for LLB Part-I was issued in the name of ‘Tariq Jahangiri’.
The report added the judge had also enrolled for LLB Part-I under a second enrolment number, 7124 — a violation of the university’s rules, which permit only one enrolment number for the entire duration of a degree programme.
The inquiry committee refrained from labelling the degree as ‘bogus’, but it declared the credentials invalid on account of multiple identities and conflicting enrolment records.
The KU alleged the judge “used and appeared in LLB examinations on false identities having different enrolment numbers of Karachi University in collusion with university staff”. It further stated that he had “personified different other regular/ex-regular students of Islamia College, i.e., Mohammad Naeem­uddin, son of Mohammad Moinuddin, and Imtiaz Ahmed.”
As a result, the university declared the candidate guilty of using unfair means, cancelled the result, and imposed a three-year ban, allowing him to reappear in examinations in 1992.

 

The controversy has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.

ISLAMABAD: With the main opposition PTI threatening to boycott parliamentary proceedings if the government continued to push it against the wall, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday reiterated his offer to mediate between the government and the party.
Responding to the points raised by PTI interim Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the NA speaker noted that dialogue was the only way forward.
He asked the opposition to consult on his offer and said he would also make a request to the government.
“What can be achieved by criticising the institutions. The army not only defends the borders but also fights terrorism in the country,” Mr Sadiq rema­rked. He added that while his previous efforts to resolve issu­es between the between government and the opposition had not succeeded, he was still ready to play his role.
‘En masse resignation’
Earlier speaking in the House, Barrister Gohar called for defusing tensions and warned that if would not be possible for them to sit in the House if the prevailing situation continued.
He also made it clear that the “minus-one [PTI founder Imran Khan] formula” would not work at all. The PTI leader indicated that all the party’s members would resign if there were any attempt to implement the minus-one formula.
He said the enemies of Pakistan and democracy wanted a fight between “tita­ns and gladiators”, and that the country’s enemies would benefit if a major political party and a state institution came face to face.
“It will be very unfortunate if the ongoing tensions in the country is not defused. There should be tolerance and not anarchy in politics,” he added. The PTI leader said the whole nation had been concerned since last Friday — when Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general held a press conference, wherein he launched a scathing attack on the PTI founder.
Without naming the DG ISPR, Barrister Gohar said certain press conferences were very “disappointing”.
He regretted that the PTI founder had been labelled a security threat, saying that it was unexpected.
“Press conferences are not addressed like this,” he remarked. He maintained that Imran Khan was a guarantee for the continuation of democracy and not a threat to national security.
Barrister Gohar said they had been demanding the PTI founder’s release, but a ban on meetings with him had now been placed.
“We never desire that infighting in the country starts after Pakistan’s victory against a hostile neighbour,” he said. He asked the speaker and parliament to play their roles in defusing the tensions.
Financial position
Earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the House that the government’s efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base were yielding results and the tax-to-GDP ratio had entered double digits after a long time.
“It was 8.5 per cent in 2023-24 and 10.3pc last year. We are hopeful that it will be 11pc this year,” he remarked. He added that the total tax collection last year was Rs 11.7 trillion — a 27pc year-on-year increase.
The minister continued that income tax collection increased by 28pc, sales tax by 26pc, federal excise duty by 33pc, and customs duty by 16pc. He added that revenue collection figures till November this year showed a 10.3pc increase.
The minister said sugar and cement were the first two sectors where production was being digitally monitored through artificial intelligence. He elaborated that from July to November this year, Rs7bn in additional revenues from the sugar industry and Rs10bn from the cement sector had been collected compared to the same period last year.
Mr Aurangzeb said digital monitoring would be ex­­panded to other sectors, including tobacco and beverages. “Technology is a big equaliser. It brings transparency. Technology brings a world which is no place to hide,” he said.
The NA on Monday passed ‘The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025’ and ‘The Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2025’. ‘The National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) (Amendment) Bill, 2025’ was also introduced in the House.

At a press briefing last week, provincial ministers said the bill would make counselling mandatory before a marriage is registered. Couples would receive guidance on family planning, reproductive health, mental well-being, newborn care and basic communication within marriage. These are simple goals, yet their absence has cost women and families far too much. Pakistan’s maternal health indicators remain among the worst in the region. Many women face repeated, closely spaced pregnancies because they lack information or support. Others undergo multiple C-sections without understanding the risks. Unsafe abortions continue because access to reliable contraceptive advice is scarce. Too many women still do not know how to protect themselves or their babies, and too many couples make life-altering decisions without proper knowledge.
The proposed bill seeks to fill these gaps and build on the Sindh Reproductive Healthcare Rights Act, 2019. While that Act formalised reproductive health as a right, it did not include structured, couple-based counselling or premarital education. The new legislation attempts to turn those rights into practical guidance offered before a family is formed. If couples understand birth spacing, safe contraception, breastfeeding rights and early childhood vaccinations, they are better placed to build healthier households. Premarital counselling also gives partners a chance to discuss expectations — something that seldom happens, yet often shapes whether a marriage becomes stable or strained. The ministers also raised issues that receive little public attention, such as the genetic risks linked to cousin marriages and the fact that a child’s gender is determined by the father. These basic facts could help reduce stigma and the unfair blame placed on women. Pilot projects in Karachi South and Tando Allahyar are already underway, but the bill’s implementation will decide whether the idea can take hold. Counselling should empower couples, not judge them. Proper training, standardised modules and monitoring will be essential. At a time of high maternal mortality, rising mental health stress and weak family planning outcomes, a preventive step is better than another crisis response. If delivered with care, the bill could improve family health in Sindh and, if it succeeds, offer a model for the rest of the country.
