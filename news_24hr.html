<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914642/overzealous-justice' target='_blank'><strong>Overzealous justice</strong></a><br><p>AN Islamabad antiterrorism court has handed out varying sentences to 12 individuals, including a PTI National Assembly member, in a May 9 rioting case. MNA Abdul Latif and other party supporters have been convicted of attacking a police station in the federal capital.
The sentences, the first related to the May 9 events in the capital, raise troubling questions about the use of antiterrorism laws against political dissidents, including lawmakers.
While it is true that the violent actions of PTI supporters after the arrest of their party chief and ex-prime minister Imran Khan were indefensible in many cases, should these individuals be tried under antiterrorism laws? After all, ATCs and the even harsher military courts are reserved for anti-state elements including ‘jet-black’ terrorists.
 
 

The PTI’s lawmakers and supporters do not fall within this very narrow category. They should have been tried under the regular courts. The ATC judge concerned has said that the convicts met the threshold of terrorism, while the party has termed the sentences “unjust” and “politically motivated”.
In a related development, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, in a dissenting note, has criticised the use of courts martial in terrorism-related cases.
Pakistan indeed needs to tackle terrorism with the full force of the law. But there has to be a clear distinction between violent militants and political dissidents.
Political violence needs to be treated with the relevant legal instruments, while ATCs should be reserved for bringing violent terrorists to justice. While speaking in Lahore the other day, President Asif Zardari urged all “democratic forces” to unite.
Yet this unity will be hard to bring about if lawmakers and supporters of a major national political party are hounded by lawfare, using legal instruments meant for hard-core terrorists. All political forces, as well as the powers that be, must realise this.
 
 

The PTI has made plenty of mistakes in the course of its political journey, but parties evolve over time. The fact that it has a considerable national mandate cannot be ignored.
Instead of ‘punishing’ political opponents, a genuine process of reconciliation is needed with buy-in from all major political forces. Pakistan cannot afford internal discord and the suppression of rights at a time when it faces both external and internal threats to its security.

In an unexpected move, IS-K has declared war not only on the Pakistani state but also on the insurgents themselves, denouncing their nationalist agendas as unIslamic.
Recently, IS-K released a booklet denouncing ethno-linguistic nationalist movements in Pakistan, explicitly targeting the Baloch and Pakhtun nationalist movements. The group singled out the BYC and its leader Mahrang Baloch, as well as the PTM and its leader, Manzoor Pashteen.
 
 

The release of this threatening booklet was alarming in itself. However, the following day, IS-K escalated matters by issuing an audio statement formally declaring war on Baloch insurgents, justifying the move by accusing the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) of killing its fighters in the Mastung district of Balochistan.
Although IS-K has had a presence in Baloch­istan since the early days of its parent group, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and was one of the first global affiliates to pledge allegiance to its leadership, it had never directly confronted natio­nalist forces, until now. What does IS-K’s entry into this already volatile theatre mean? And can it reshape the dynamics of conflict in Balochistan?

Can the militant group’s entry reshape the dynamics of conflict in the province?

IS-K has been involved in 33 terrorist attacks in Balochistan since 2016, resulting in the deaths of 436 people and injuries to 691 others. Shrines and churches have remained among its primary targets. IS-K has attacked shrines and churches eight times, while among human targets, political figures, especially politicians affiliated with the JUI, are at the top of its hit list. Security forces and polio health workers follow close behind.
 
 

Many senior JUI leaders have been targeted by IS-K in Balochistan, including Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Hafiz Hamdullah and Maulana Abdul Wasay. While it also targeted a PTI candidate in Sibi, one of the most dangerous attacks was an assassination attempt on former president Arif Alvi, who survived. The group has not spared nationalist leaders and pro-state politicians either. Notably, Siraj Raisani of the Balochistan Awami Party was killed during the 2018 election campaign. Another significant incident was the kidnapping of Chinese nationals, who were held in Mastung.
Interestingly, IS-K operations in Balochistan, like in KP, are limited to specific territories. In KP, its activities are mostly confined to the Baja­­ur tribal district and Peshawar, where it has carried out 36 and 19 attacks, respectively. IS-K stri­ctly follows the Salafi interpretation of Islam, which is also prevalent in Bajaur and neighbouring regions in Afghanistan, such as Kunar and Nu­­ristan. These Afghan regions, where IS-K main­­­­tains a strong presence, share borders with Pakistan.
However, the operational context in Balochistan is different. IS-K’s activities are concentrated in the central western part of the province, from the outskirts of Quetta to Mastung, Kalat, and parts of Khuzdar. From Mastung, its presence extends into Bolan and reaches Sibi district, which borders Sindh. At one point, Sindh’s Counter-Terrorism Department reported that IS-K had established training camps in Balochistan near the provincial border and was exporting terrorism into Sindh, particularly by radicalising Sindhi youth, especially those from Brahui tribes. These reports surfaced after the February 2017 investigation of the IS-K terrorist attack on the famous shrine of Sehwan Sharif.
Mastung and the outskirts of Quetta serve as IS-K’s major hubs, where it has carried out 12 and 10 attacks, respectively. It also maintains a presence in Kalat, Bolan and Khuzdar, which are nearby. These areas are predominantly inhabited by Baloch communities, many of whom are affiliated with religious organisations. The JUI enjoys strong political support here, and some experts trace this religious inclination to the Qalat state’s pre-merger policy of patronising Deobandi madressahs. Regardless of the reasons, Balochistan has witnessed increasing competition among different Islamic movements, including the TLP and Shia organisations.
 
 

Shia madressahs have expanded their presence in the region over the past 15 years. Attacks on Shia pilgrims, particularly by groups like Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, which later merged into IS-K, have occurred along the routes passing through Mastung and Nushki districts. Convoys here have often been targeted in the past.
The TLP has also established a foothold in this region, primarily through Karachi, extending its influence along the Quetta-Karachi highway. Certain Baloch residents from this area who live in Karachi have played a key role in spreading this influence. Nonetheless, JUI remains a dominant political force in the region and continues to hold significant electoral power.
One understands why the IS-K targets JUI both in KP and Balochistan — the group considers it to be a close ally of the Taliban in Pakistan. In Afghanistan, the armed confrontation between IS-K and the Afghan Taliban has been going on even before the latter’s takeover of that country; the significant difference between the two lies in their views on state structure and the concept of a caliphate.
The IS-K believes that the Taliban is a nationalist movement and an ally of the West, and there is no difference between the power elites of Pakistan, other Muslim states, and the Taliban. To IS-K, nationalism is an unIslamic concept, and now it has expanded its circle to nationalist movements in the country, both violent and peaceful.
 
 

This development will heighten the threat level for nationalist and rights movements in Balochistan and KP, while also triggering potential clashes between Islamist militants and nationalist insurgents.
Until now, both sides had avoided confrontation, despite operating in overlapping territories; however, that dynamic is likely to change. Although the BLA has expanded its operational footprint across much of the province, IS-K remains confined mainly to Mastung and its surrounding areas. Still, its presence could become a significant distraction for the BLA.
It remains uncertain whether this confrontation is necessarily good news for the state’s security institutions. While some may view it as a conflict that could weaken two adversaries simultaneously, the reality may be more complicated. IS-K is unlikely to abandon its operational strategy; instead, it may adapt and evolve, further complicating the already volatile security environment in Balochistan.

Published in Dawn, June 1st, 2025</p><small>2025-06-01 04:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01083909469dad9.jpg?r=083921' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914660/july-may-collection-falls-short-by-rs1tr' target='_blank'><strong>July-May collection falls short by Rs1tr</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its revenue collection target by nearly Rs1.008 trillion in the first 11 months of FY25 due to slowing economic growth and a drop in imports, which impacted domestic sales tax collection.
The FBR collected Rs10.233tr between July and May against the budgetary target of Rs11.241tr. However, the collection is 26 per cent higher than the Rs8.11tr collected a year ago.
On a monthly basis, the FBR collected Rs932 billion in May against the target of Rs1.11tr projected for the same month, indicating a shortfall of Rs178bn. However, the collection is 22pc higher than Rs762bn collected a year ago, according to provisional data released on Saturday.
The shortfall highlights poor tax compliance, particularly concerning sales tax collection at the domestic stage, even after the removal of substantial exemptions on products such as stationery and infant formula. However, the sales tax collection continues to fall short of the anticipated target, indicating potential gaps in the collection process.

Low imports amid a slowing economy hit sales tax generation

FBR has introduced several digital measures to plug loopholes and more will be announced in the upcoming budget to promote a cashless economy.
The FBR has identified two key factors contributing to the significant shortfalls observed in May. The eight-day strike by farmers in Sindh, who blocked the main highway, has significantly disrupted the supply chain, resulting in a decline in sales tax collection.
Furthermore, the recent conflict with India has resulted in a decrease in port clearances. Nonetheless, the FBR has yet to quantify the actual impact of these two factors on the decline in revenue collection during May.
The IMF has revised the FBR revenue collection target for FY25, decreasing it to Rs12.33tr from Rs12.913tr, marking a reduction of Rs580bn. Independent economists estimate that real revenue collection in FY25 will be approximately Rs12tr.
The shortfall is largely attributed to reduced tax collection from imports, sluggish manufacturing growth and unexpectedly low inflation, which has dropped to a record 0.3pc in recent months.
In the last year’s budget, the government has imposed a stunning Rs1.761tr in new revenue measures for the current fiscal year. However, the revenue collection fell short of the target.
The FBR paid Rs458bn in refunds/rebates to taxpayers in 11MFY25, up Rs5bn from Rs453bn in the same period last year. However, May saw a decline to Rs29bn against Rs31bn in the same month last year.
In July-May, income tax collection totalled Rs4.9tr, exceeding the target of Rs4.586tr by Rs314bn. The income tax collection grew 27pc compared with last year’s Rs3.852tr.
The sales tax collection fell short of the target by Rs895bn in 11MFY25, totalling Rs3.503tr against the target of Rs4.398tr. The sales tax collection recorded a growth of 27pc compared with last year’s Rs2.765tr.
The customs collection also fell short of the projected target by Rs263bn to Rs1.157tr in 11MFY25 against the target of Rs1.420tr. The customs collection recorded a growth of 17pc compared with last year’s Rs991bn.
The Federal Excise Duty collection fell short of the target by Rs165bn to Rs673bn in 11MFY25 against the projected target of Rs838bn. The excise duty recorded a growth of 34pc over last year’s Rs503bn.

He put the outcome beyond doubt with a crisp finish into the bottom corner in the 63rd minute before Khvicha Kvara­tskhelia ran free to bury PSG’s fourth goal and substitute Senny Mayulu completed the rout.

The ministers condemned “Israel’s decision to ban the delegation’s visit to Ramallah (on Sunday) to meet with the president of the State of Palestine, Mahmud Abbas”, the Jordanian foreign ministry said.
Ministers from Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had been expected to take part alongside Turkiye and the secretary-general of the Arab League.
Israel had announced late Friday that it would not cooperate, effectively blocking the visit as it controls the territory’s borders and airspace.

Hamas responds to US truce proposal, to free 10 prisoners, return 18 bodies

Abbas “intended to host in Ramallah a provocative meeting of foreign ministers from Arab countries to discuss the promotion of the establishment of a Palestinian state,” an Israeli official said. “Such a state would undoubtedly become a terrorist state in the heart of the Land of Israel. Israel will not cooperate with such moves aimed at harming it and its security.”
Had the visit gone ahead, the delegation’s head, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, would have become the first Saudi foreign minister to visit the occupied West Bank.
Israel this week announced the creation of 22 new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, regarded by the United Nations as illegal under international law and one of the main obstacles to a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
During a visit to one of the new settlement sites on Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to build a “Jewish Israeli state” in the Palestinian territory.
In June, Saudi Arabia and France are to co-chair an international conference at UN headquarters meant to resurrect the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Saudi Arabia was said to have been close to recognising Israel before the start of the Gaza war, and US President Donald Trump, during a recent visit to Riyadh, called normalisation between the countries “my fervent hope and wish”.
But de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has repeatedly said Saudi Arabia will not recognise Israel without an independent Palestinian state.
Saudi Arabia is co-hosting with France a conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York aiming to revive the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
French President Emmanuel Macron previously said he could recognise a Palestinian state at that conference, drawing a sharp rebuke from Israel.
Prisoner deal
Meanwhile, Hamas on Saturday said it had responded to a ceasefire proposal from US envoy Steve Witkoff, saying 10 living prisoners would be freed from Gaza as part of the deal.
The Palestinian group did not explicitly say it had accepted the version of the proposal it received on Thursday, which reportedly included a provision for the release of 10 living prisoners.
Hamas noted that its response had been made out of a “sense of responsibility towards our people and their suffering”.
The White House previously said the proposal had been approved in advance by Israel, which on Friday warned Hamas to either accept the deal and free the prisoners “or be annihilated”.
Hamas said in a statement on Friday that it had “submitted its response to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff’s latest proposal to the mediating parties”.
“As part of this agreement, 10 living prisoners of the occupation held by the resistance will be released, in addition to the return of 18 bodies, in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners,” it added.
A breakthrough in negotiations had been elusive since a previous ceasefire fell apart on March 18 with the resumption of Israeli operations.
US President Donald Trump had said Friday that the parties were “very close to an agreement”.
Two sources close to the negotiations have said the deal involves a 60-day truce, potentially extendable to 70 days. It would see the release of five living prisoners and nine bodies in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners during the first week, followed by a second exchange the following week, the sources said.

• Additional DC laid to rest in Kachhi
QUETTA: A Levies official was martyred in a shooting in Dera Bugti and a Levies police station was set on fire in Mastung district, while a roadside blast on the outskirts of Quetta left two siblings dead and nine others wounded on Saturday, officials said.
The gun and bomb attacks were carried out on the day when the additional deputy commissioner of Surab district, who had embraced martyrdom in an attack on Friday, was laid to rest with full state honour in Kachhi district.
According to Levies sources, the official, identified as Rehan, was on his way home when some armed men opened fire on him in the Sui Tehsil Bazaar area of Dera Bugti.
The body was shifted to a nearby hospital for medico-legal formalities before being handed over to the family.
A search operation was launc­hed to track down the assailants.
No one claimed responsibility for the shooting. The motive for the shooting remains unclear. Levies authorities later registered a case.
In the late evening, armed militants attacked a Levies police station in Wali Khan area of Mastung. “Armed militants set fire to the building of Levies thana. The building was badly damaged and record burnt,” a senior official said.
No casualty was reported in the attack.
The official said the armed men also attempted to surround the area but failed when security forces reached there and launched an operation forcing the militants to flee.
Earlier, on the outskirts of Quetta, a roadside bomb blast claimed the lives of two brothers and left nine others wounded, officials said.
They said an improvised explosive device (IED) planted at the roadside in the Nawan Killi area was detonated when a car was passing through the area. The blast left two sons of a tribal elder, Sardar Abdullah Kakar, dead.
Soon after the explosion, heavy contingent of police and Frontier Corps rushed to the site and shifted the bodies and injured to Civil Hospital Quetta.
“We have received two bodies and nine injured, who were hit by splinters after the IED blast,” Dr Wasim Baig, the spokesman for the Civil Hospital told Dawn.
He said that the deceased were identified as Abdul Salam and his brother, Abdul Nafay.
While three of the nine injured remained unidentified till the filing of this report, the six others were identified as Janan, Saifur Rehman, Samiullah, Zabihullah, Muhammad Asif, Naseebullah and Jameel Ahmed.
The bodies were handed over to the families after necessary legal procedures, authorities confirmed to Dawn.  Police termed the blast a targeted killing.
No  group claimed responsibility for the attack  with security agencies continuiing their investigations.
Funeral
Meanwhile, the additional deputy commissioner, Hidayatullah Buledi, who was martyred in an attack at his residence, was laid to rest in his native town of Bhag in the Kachhi district on Saturday.
His body was flown to the area by a helicopter.
People from all walks of life gathered to pay their final respects.
The funeral was attended by Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Zahid Saleem, Naseerabad Commissioner Moeenur Rehman Khan, Kalat Commissioner Shahzeb Kakar, Kachhi Deputy Commissioner Jehanzeb Baloch, Surab Deputy Commissioner Habib Nasir, senior officers of the divisional and district administration, Frontier Corps officials, tribal elders, political figures and locals.
After the funeral, a smartly turned-out contingent of Levies and police presented a salute to the fallen officer. His coffin, draped in the national flag, was laid to rest with full state honour.
Former chief minister of Balochistan Nawab Sanaullah Zehri while condemning the attack said, “Those who storm homes in the presence of women and children and commit such brutal acts have no right to call themselves Baloch.”
He described the assassination as a cowardly and shameful act, stating that action against culprits was inevitable.
A day ago, a large group of militants cordoned off police and Levies stations in Surab and set fire  to multiple government offices and looted a local bank.
The militants also tried to storm the deputy commissioner’s office but were repulsed by secuirty forces.
The banned Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack.

According to a statement from his office, Mr Mushahid made the remarks during a 40-minute meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Eurasian Forum in Perm, Russia.
He was invited as Pakis­tani to speak at the international gathering, which brought together more than 100 delegates from 25 Eurasian countries.
A former federal minister and ex-chairman of the Senate’s foreign affairs and defense committees, Mr Mushahid praised Russia’s role in promoting regional stability.
He welcomed President Vladimir Putin’s Eurasian Security Initiative.
He likened it to China’s Global Security Initiative, saying both emphasise “indivisible security” and uphold the UN Charter.
He rejected the notion of an ‘Asian Nato’ or ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy’ as these reflected militarisation of international relations.
The former minister also highlighted the Russian foreign minister’s criticism of India’s role in the US-led Quad alliance.

• Claims conflict never came close to a nuclear war
• Says ‘channels of communication’ with Islamabad were open
• BJP leader says PAF shot down five Indian aircraft
NEW DELHI: A day after a BJP politician and staunch critic of Prime Minister Nare­ndra Modi, Subrahmanyam Swamy, claimed Pakistan had downed five Indian planes in the recent military escalation, India’s top military general admitted losses.
In an interview with Bloomberg on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan admitted losses but dismissed Pakistan’s claims that it shot down six Indian jets, including four Rafales, as “absolutely incorrect”.
“What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down… Why they were down, what mistakes were made — that are important. Numbers are not important,” he said.
In a separate interview to Reuters, Gen Chauhan said the losses India suffered were in the initial stages, on May 7, when it launched Operation Sindoor.
“What I can say is that on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses… What was important is why these losses occur and what we will do after that,” he said.
 
 

However, the chief of defence staff said the armed forces were quick to analyse the “tactical mistakes”, remedy them, and again target Pakistan on May 8 and May 10.
“The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range,” India Today quoted Gen Chauhan as saying.
It may be recalled that Pakistan military says India did not fly its fighter jets again in the conflict after suffering losses on May 7.
Earlier on Friday, former law minister Swamy became the most candid Indian to admit that Pakistan Air Force had shot down five Indian planes, including French-made Rafales. Speaking in an online interview, Dr Swamy blamed the French planes as being responsible for the losses, implying that the deal the prime minister had made for them was to blame. The interview came as Mr Modi went about holding mammoth meetings in Gujarat and other states claiming victory and threatening more dire conflict with Pakistan.
Gen Chauhan’s remarks were the most direct by the army so far on losses suffered during the hostilities, which came as India attacked nine alleged terror camps deep inside Pakistan. It was in response to the horrific Pahalgam attack, which left at least 25 tourists dead.
As Pakistan retaliated by launching a wave of drone attacks targeting Indian military facilities and border towns, the armed forces struck 11 vital airbases with long-range BrahMos missiles, India Today reported.
Previously, the armed for­ces had deflected questions abo­ut Indian jets being shot down by Pakistan. Addressing a press conference, Air Mar­shal A.K. Bharti, Director Gen­e­ral of Air Operations, said “losses are a part of any combat scenario”. However, he said all Indian pilots “were back”.
“We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is, have we achieved our objective? Answer is a thumping yes. At this time, I would not like to comment on that (loss of jets) as we are still in combat and give advantage to adversary. All our pilots are back home,” he claimed.
The chief of defence staff also claimed that the conflict never came close to a nuclear war, while underscoring that “channels of communication” with Pakistan were always open to control the situation.
This flies in the face of US President Donald Trump’s repeated assertion that he avoided a potential nuclear disaster by mediating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the news report said.
“I personally feel that there is a lot of space between conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold,” Gen Chauhan told Bloomberg.
During the hostilities, Indian missiles and jets were able to bypass Chinese-supplied air defence systems to target Pakistani military sites, the report said.

The decision was taken at the third meeting of the Counter-Terr­orism Committee and Har­den the State Commi­ttee held here under the chairmanship of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday.
The government had already announced it would deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting resettlement in the West if the prospective host countries didn’t relocate them by April 30. Tens of thousands of Afghans came to Pakistan fearing retribution after the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of US-led forces.

An official told Dawn that so far 1.023 million Afghans had been repatriated. He said 135,865 had been repatriated in April and another 65,057 in May. On May 30 alone, 1,483 individuals had been repatriated.

Naqvi asks all institutions to coordinate for implementation of one-document regime

Speaking on the occasion, the interior minister said the federal and provincial agencies must coordinate their efforts to eli­m­inate the illegal spectrum undermining nat­io­nal security, emph­asising that all institutions must work together to fully implement the “one-document regime”.
He said that Nadra would provide live data verification facilities at exit points.
Referring to the beggar mafia, Mr Naqvi said they must be dealt with strictly as they were tarnishing the country’s image. He highlighted the need to declare begging a non-bailable offence.
As a nationwide crackdown on power theft continues, the meeting was informed by a representative of the power division that Rs142 billion was recovered with the cooperation of the interior ministry and provincial governments. The minister said every possible support was being provided to the Ministry of Energy and provincial governments to prevent electricity theft.
The meeting also reviewed progress on anti-encroachment operations.
Regarding maintenance of law and order, the meeting was briefed that more than 250 intelligence-based operations were being conducted on a daily basis.
It also reviewed progress on the establishment of the Pakistan Port Authority, ‘Gwadar Safe City Project’, besides the construction of a protection wall was also discussed.
Digital transformation
Also, progress on the digitalisation of petrol pumps to curb the sale of illegal and smuggled fuel came under review. According to new rules, customs officers and the relevant deputy commissioner will have the authority to seal petrol pumps and seize vehicles in case of violations.
During the briefing, it was stated that digital enforcement stations were being set up on the Indus River, while work on an Intelligent Trans­portation System (ITS) was also underway for effective motorway and highway monitoring.

The first edition of Breathe Pakistan sparked national dialogue and global collaboration around vital climate challenges — from climate justice and finance to renewable energy transitions, disaster risk reduction, and inclusive public-private partnerships.
It emphasised the crucial roles of accountability, media engagement, and the empowerment of women and smallholder farmers in building climate resilience, according to a press release.
 
 

Pakistan remains increasingly vulnerable to the devastating effects of climate change, facing record-breaking heatwaves, destructive hail and windstorms, water scarcity, and extreme weather events that threaten lives, infrastructure, and livelihoods.
As climate challenges intensify, DawnMedia continues to bring this critical issue to the forefront through the following ways.
Raising awareness: Increasing awareness around critical issues such as water scarcity, air pollution, and deforestation to mobilise public action to combat climate change.
Impactful journalism: Leveraging multimedia platforms through in-depth articles, documentaries, podcasts, and TV/radio explainers to keep climate discourse at the forefront.
Engaging children: Involving children in the climate conversation through interactive activities and storytelling on tree plantation, recycling, and water conservation to cultivate lifelong environmental stewardship.
Strategic collaborations: Building and strengthening partnerships with the public and private sectors, as well as government institutions, to sustain momentum and drive meaningful change for a sustainable Pakistan.
“The fight against climate change must continue,” says a DawnMedia spokesperson. “Through awareness, education, and collaboration, we can forge a sustainable future.”
The Breathe Pakistan 2026 conference will further amplify these efforts, convening global and local leaders to accelerate actionable solutions.

This follows an earlier announcement by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) notifying the decrease of liquified petroleum gas prices by Rs4.62 per kilogram for the month of June.
According to a notification seen by Dawn.com, the finance divison stated that the new rates had been decided “based on the recommendations of Ogra and the relevant ministries”.
Petrol, which previously stood at Rs252.63 per litre, was increased to Rs253.63, the notification read.
Earlier, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of LPG by Rs4.62 per kilogram, or 1.88 per cent for June. The authority had announced a decrease of Rs3.20 per kg for May.
According to the notification issued by the authority today, the new price for an 11.8kg cylinder stood at Rs2,838.31 for June against Rs2,892.91 for May, making the cylinder cheaper by Rs54.6 per kg.
It added that consumers would now pay Rs240.53 per kg, with the price coming down from Rs245.16 in May.
According to a separate press release issued by the department, Ogra said that the LPG producer price was linked to Saudi Aramco-CP and the US dollar exchange rate.
As compared to the previous month, Saudi Aramco CP decreased by 2.67pc while the average dollar exchange rate slightly increased by 0.35pc, resulting in a decrease in LPG consumer price by Rs54.6 per 11.8kg cylinder.
The government introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly aimed at digitally tracking petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration, which cause massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually besides affecting the environment and vehicle engines.
The Petroleum (Amend­ment) Act, 2025 — moved by Pet­roleum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik — seeks to amend the 1934 Petroleum Act. The draft law envisages new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb smuggling and to initiate strict actions against the illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with action against illegal petrol pumps.
In a separate development, eight units involved in the illegal sale of LPG cylinders were sealed and fined Rs5,000 earlier this month.</p><small>2025-05-31 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3123062105dc4e1.jpg?r=231136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914544/two-killed-11-injured-in-explosion-near-quetta-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two killed, 11 injured in explosion near Quetta: police</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and 11 others were injured in an explosion in the Killi Mangal area near Quetta in Balochistan, a police official told Dawn.com on Saturday.
According to Hanna Urak Station House Officer (SHO) Naveed Akhtar, Abdul Salam, a notable and the owner of a coal mine, was the target of the attack.
“A banned organisation tried to extort money from him,” Akhtar told Dawn.com. “When he did not pay, around 100 armed suspects attacked his mine and destroyed the machinery there.”
The SHO said that Salam, his brother and several of his men arrived at the mine, but were ambushed by the suspects and a gun battle ensued.
“The armed suspects had planted explosives in the mine,” the SHO said. “They fled the scene before the explosion. Salam and his brother were killed by one of the explosives. There were also 11 injuries.”
Immediately after the explosion, police and security forces reached the scene and started collecting evidence from the crime scene. According to SHO Akhtar, the suspects were armed with advanced weaponry.
“Security forces have launched a search operation in the area, but panic has spread,” he added.
Meanwhile, Health Department spokesperson Dr Waseem Baig told Dawn.com that those injured in the blast were immediately transported to the Trauma Centre at Civil Hospital Quetta, where their condition is said to be out of danger.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari issued a statement condemning the blast and expressing “deep sorrow over the loss of two lives”.
“Those who spill innocent blood at the behest of the enemy deserve no mercy,” the PPP chairman was quoted as saying.
 






The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
A district official was killed when his house was attacked by terrorists in Balochistan’s Surab city on Friday, a statement from the provincial government said.
Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind, in a statement, termed the incident a “nefarious attempt to challenge the writ of the state”.
“A bank was looted and the homes of several government officials were attacked, including Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Hidayatullah Buledi.</p><small>2025-05-31 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31202431cf51ea0.png?r=202813' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914525/at-balochistan-grand-jirga-pm-stresses-need-to-win-back-misled-people' target='_blank'><strong>At Balochistan grand jirga, PM stresses need to win back ‘misled’ people</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that people who were “misled” by terrorists in Balochistan must be brought back on board, stressing the need for resolving issues through dialogue.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
Speaking at the Balochistan Grand Jirga in Quetta, PM Shehbaz said, “The terrorists [in Balochistan] must not be tolerated by the public, government or armed forces.
“We must make efforts to bring back the people who were misled [by the terrorists] onto the wrong track.”
He added that economic or social injustices cannot happen in Balochistan during his rule and stressed collectively solving the issues through talks.
“If there are any concerns, brothers need to sit together to solve those issues,” he emphasised. “The blood-thirsty terrorists who are against Pakistan’s success and welfare must be stopped. I want to ask what the gaps [there] are that we can fill with your suggestions [to solve problems].”
Govt designates term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ for terrorist groups in Balochistan
The government has designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan, state media PTV News reported.
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
A notification from the Ministry of Interior said, “… All terrorist groups and organisations operating in Balochistan will be referred to as ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’.”
“The change aims reflect the true nature and ideology of these terrorist organisations and groups, and nefarious designs of India against the people of Pakistan.”
 






Balochistan to receive Rs250bn development budget
The premier also announced that Balochistan will receive Rs250 billion in development funds from the federal budget.
He said, “In the upcoming budget, the federal-funded Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for provinces and [the] federation will be Rs1 trillion in total. Balochistan will get Rs250bn, which is 25 per cent of the total PSDP.”
He added, “To me, even that seems like a small amount.
“Whether it is Gwadar, Pasni, Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Quetta, Jhal Magsi or any other place, every penny of these resources must be honestly utilised for the public’s welfare.”
The premier also highlighted past development projects in the province, such as the Rs70bn solar initiative for farmers and the N-25 Highway.
Last month, PM Shehbaz announced that instead of passing on the relief of reduced oil prices in the international market to consumers, the government would use the saved money for the reconstruction of the N-25 Highway and completion of Phase-II of the Kachhi Canal project in Balochistan.
Addressing the event today, he further said, “In 2010, Punjab gave Rs11bn in NFC to Balochistan [and] that would be around Rs155-160bn today. But for the sake of national unity, even Rs1600 billion would not be too much.”
“The vastness of Balochistan demands greater investment,” he added.
Pakistan ‘flying high’ militarily, economically
Earlier on Saturday, the PM said that Pakistan was “flying high” off the back of its victory in a military conflict against India and economic progress made since he took office as prime minister.
The comments, made during an address at the Quetta Command and Staff College, followed a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad retaliated by downing five Indian jets. It took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
 
 

India, however, is still weaponising the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — a water distribution deal between the two countries — saying that it will no longer abide by the treaty, placing the agreement in “abeyance”.
In his address today, PM Shehbaz congratulated the military personnel in attendance on their counter-operations against India. He said these operations had left New Delhi “completely baffled and shell-shocked”.
“We won a war against an enemy, which in the eyes of our detractors was unthinkable, but we have converted this unthinkable into a reality, and I think that is our finest hour in history,” he stated. “Pakistan at this point in time is flying high.”
PM Shehbaz noted that the conflict with India was not only victorious, but illustrated that the threats Pakistan faces are no longer restricted to conventional battlefields.
“They [threats] are multifaceted, ranging from kinetic warfare to cyber attacks, economic coercion, disinformation campaigns and hybrid threats that challenge both our borders and ideological frontiers,” he elaborated.
“The recent Indian aggression … was not only countered successfully, but we turned the tables on those who tried to establish a new normal,” he added. “Indian leaders had no option but to concoct a patently false explanation for their losses. Operation Bunyanum Marsoos destroyed the enemy’s defences and shattered the myth of their military might.”
The PM highlighted that Pakistan “established a new norm” in its relations with India, warning that the country will never let its neighbour “behave in an arrogant and haughty manner”. He also reiterated that Pakistan would not allow India to continue weaponising the IWT, calling it a “red line”.
“We need to convert this moment into something this nation has been longing for — that Pakistan’s progress … would not only be witnessed [and] enjoyed by [the people], but that the world at large would respect Pakistan’s hard work,” he added.
‘Sacrifice, blood and sweat’
Noting Pakistan’s victory on the battlefield, the prime minister said that the country “faces major challenges” on the economic front.
Highlighting economic difficulties during his tenure in 2022, Shehbaz said, “International banks were refusing our letters of credit for vital imports like energy … linked to Pakistan’s wellbeing”, and the country faced the threat of international lending agencies walking away.
“As a result of that meeting in Paris in July 2023, we were able to sign a standby agreement with the IMF, which averted an impending economic meltdown,” the PM said.
He added that upon assuming office in 2024, his administration “wasted no time” implementing major reforms and making “cast-iron guarantees to lending agencies”.
“We would not shy away from undertaking difficult, tough, but very relevant, deep-rooted changes in our system,” he said. “We undertook those very difficult decisions and we were able to calm those fears of our lending partners. Today, we are witnessing the fruits of those sacrifices made by the common man in Pakistan.”
According to the PM, inflation plummeted from 38 per cent to 0.3pc, while interest rates were halved from 22.5pc in 2022 to 11pc.
“Our rupee stands stable [and] forex reserves have crossed over a billion dollars,” he said.
“These achievements, significant as they are, represent only the beginning of a very arduous, difficult, thorny journey towards progress and prosperity. On the way, we will meet huge challenges like mountains, rivers — we will have to surmount them [and] cross those rivers through unwavering commitment to our nation and our people, and that will require sacrifices, sweat and blood,” he emphasised.</p><small>2025-05-31 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607141-five-people-killed-including-college-educator-in-karachi-road-accidents' target='_blank'><strong>Five people killed, including college educator, in Karachi road accidents</strong></a><br><p>

Tensions between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief fell apart.
Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi “paid a short visit to Tehran today to present elements of a US proposal which will be appropriately responded to in line with the principles, national interests and rights of the people of Iran,” Araghchi said on X.
 






Iran stepped up its production of highly enriched uranium in recent months, said a confidential report by the watchdog, seen by AFP earlier on Saturday.
It said in its quarterly report that it is of “serious concern” that Iran has an estimated amount of 408.6 kilogrammes enriched to up to 60 per cent as of May 17, up by 133.8kg since the last report in February.
Uranium enriched to up to 60pc fissile purity is close to the roughly 90pc level needed for atomic weapons. According to the IAEA, Tehran is the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to 60pc.
Iran has always denied seeking a nuclear weapon.
In a separate in-depth report, the IAEA criticised “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran over its scrutiny of Iran’s nuclear programme.
“While Iran continues to cooperate with the agency on matters of routine safeguards implementation, in a number of respects […] its cooperation with the agency has been less than satisfactory,” the report said.
It specifically notes Tehran’s lack of progress in explaining nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
“In particular, Iran has repeatedly either not answered, or not provided technically credible answers to, the agency’s questions and has sanitised locations as listed in this report, which has impeded agency verification activities.”
Iran’s foreign ministry accused Israel of providing “unreliable and misleading information” to the UN nuclear watchdog to be used in the report.
“Relying on unreliable and misleading information sources provided by the Israeli regime … is contrary to the IAEA’s principles of professional verification,” the ministry said in a statement.
Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from a landmark 2015 deal with Tehran during his first term as president. The deal had exchanged sanctions relief for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme.</p><small>2025-05-31 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31220129ec6d165.png?r=220225' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914539/3-killed-in-separate-road-accidents-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>3 killed in separate road accidents in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Three people lost their lives in separate road accidents in Karachi on Saturday, according to police officials.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
A motorbike rider was killed in the Defence Housing Authority when a vehicle hit him early Saturday morning, Deputy Inspector General South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com.
He said, “The Bykea [hail-riding service] rider was passing through Khayaban-i-Nishat crossing when the an sport utility vehicle hit him. He sustained critical injuries and was transported to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) where he succumbed to his injuries.”
The police have impounded the vehicle and arrested the driver, he added.
Darakshan Station House Officer (SHO) Shahid Taj said that the victim’s heirs and the suspect had reached an out-of-court settlement and they told the police that they did not want any legal proceedings.
He added that the suspect was stated to be belonging to an influential family.
In another incident, a water tanker claimed the life of a motorcyclist in Qayyumabad.
Korangi SHO Mohammed Ali Niazi told Dawn.com, “The tanker hit the rider on Jam Sadiq Bridge. He suffered critical injuries and was transported to the JPMC where he was pronounced dead.”
The errant driver was arrested and a heavy vehicle was impounded, he added.
Separately, a trailer killed a man in Landhi. According to Malir Superintendent of Police Mansoor Gulzar Bozdar, the victim was a lecturer at a government college who was on his way to the institute when a trailer hit him at Future Colony.
Police surgeon Summaiya Syed said that he was shifted to the JPMC but he lost his life during the treatment.
The driver managed to escape from the spot, leaving behind the heavy vehicle that was impounded by the police, the SP said, adding that a first information report was registered against the driver on the complaint of the victim’s brother.
Earlier this month, the police said that a woman was killed and her husband injured when a water tanker hit their motorcycle and ran them over in Korangi, prompting an angry mob to set the water tanker on fire.
In April, an employee of the Pakistan Navy was killed while another was injured in Karachi’s Baldia after a 10-wheeler trailer hit them, police said.</p><small>2025-05-31 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/312120227438444.jpg?r=214700' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914540/pentagon-chief-warns-china-is-preparing-to-use-military-force-in-asia' target='_blank'><strong>Pentagon chief warns China is ‘preparing’ to use military force in Asia</strong></a><br><p>US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth warned on Saturday that China was “credibly preparing” to use military force to upend the balance of power in Asia, vowing the United States was “here to stay” in the region.
The Pentagon chief made the remarks at an annual security forum in Singapore as the administration of US President Donald Trump spars with Beijing on trade, technology, and influence over strategic corners of the globe.
China’s embassy in Singapore blasted the speech, accusing Washington of escalating tensions in the region and “profiting from creating risks of war”.
Trump has launched a trade war with China since taking office in January, has sought to curb its access to key AI technologies and deepened security ties with allies such as the Philippines, which is engaged in escalating territorial disputes with Beijing.
“The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent,” Hegseth said at the Shangri-La Dialogue attended by defence officials from around the world. Beijing is “credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific”, he said.
Hegseth warned that the Chinese military was building the capabilities to invade Taiwan and “rehearsing for the real deal”.
China has ramped up military pressure on Taiwan and held large-scale exercises around the island that are often described as preparations for a blockade or invasion.
The United States was “reorienting toward deterring aggression by communist China”, Hegseth said, calling on US allies and partners in Asia to swiftly upgrade their defences in the face of mounting threats.
‘Stirring up trouble’
Hegseth described China’s conduct as a “wake-up call”, accusing Beijing of endangering lives with cyber attacks, harassing its neighbours, and “illegally seizing and militarising lands” in the disputed South China Sea.
Beijing claims almost the entire waterway, through which more than 60 per cent of global maritime trade passes, despite an international ruling that its assertion has no merit.
It has clashed repeatedly with the Philippines in the strategic waters in recent months, with the flashpoint set to dominate discussions at the Singapore forum, according to US officials.
As Hegseth spoke in Singapore, China’s military announced that its navy and air force were carrying out routine “combat readiness patrols” around the Scarborough Shoal, a chain of reefs and rocks Beijing disputes with the Philippines.
Hegseth’s hard-hitting address drew a critical reaction from the Chinese embassy in the city-state.
“The speech is steeped in provocations and instigation,” the embassy wrote on its Facebook page. “Mr Hegseth repeatedly smeared and attacked China and relentlessly played up the so-called ‘China threat’,” the statement said, accusing the United States of being the “biggest troublemaker” in the region.
Beijing did not send any top defence ministry officials to the summit, dispatching instead a delegation from the People’s Liberation Army National Defence University led by Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng.
Without referring to Hegseth by name, Hu said of his speech that “these actions are essentially about stirring up trouble, creating division, inciting confrontation, and destabilising the Asia-Pacific”.
Hegseth’s comments came after Trump stoked new trade tensions with China, arguing that Beijing had “violated” a deal to de-escalate tariffs as the two sides appeared deadlocked in negotiations.
The world’s two biggest economies had agreed to temporarily lower eye-watering tariffs they had imposed on each other, pausing them for 90 days.
‘Cannot dominate’
Reassuring US allies on Saturday, Hegseth said the Asia-Pacific region was “America’s priority theatre”, pledging to ensure “China cannot dominate us — or our allies and partners”.
He said the United States had stepped up cooperation with allies, including the Philippines and Japan, and reiterated Trump’s vow that “China will not invade [Taiwan] on his watch”.
However, he called on US partners in the region to ramp up spending on their militaries and “quickly upgrade their own defences”.
“Asian allies should look to countries in Europe for a newfound example,” Hegseth said, citing pledges by Nato members, including Germany, to move towards Trump’s defence spending target of 5pc of GDP. “Deterrence doesn’t come on the cheap.”</p><small>2025-05-31 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607122-kp-cm-intervenes-after-student-tortured-to-death-in-school' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM intervenes after student tortured to death in school</strong></a><br><p>

India’s Sachin Yadav took silver with an 85.16m and Japan’s Yuta Sakiyama took home bronze with an 83.75m throw. Both athletes threw a personal best.
After leading the field in the first few throws, Sri Lanka’s Rumesh Tharanga Pathirage was bumped off the podium to finish fourth with an 83.27m throw.
India’s Yash Vir Singh finished fifth with an 82.57m personal best throw.
China’s Hu Haoran threw a season best 80.93m to finish sixth, while Sri Lanka’s Sumedha Jagath Ranasinghe Ranasinghe Mudiyanselage finsihed seventh with a 79.81m throw.
Pakistan’s Muhammad Yasir finished eighth with a 75.39m throw.

In a post on Instagram, Nadeem wrote: “This victory belongs to the Almighty first — His blessings, His will. Without His grace, none of this would be possible.
“To my coaches, my team, my family, and every Pakistani who prayed for me — this medal is yours. Your support fuels my journey,” he added.

Speaking to Dawn.com after the final, Nadeem’s coach Salman Butt said: “It was a good performance, especially since this was his first competition of the season.
“If there had been one day of rest between [yesterday’s] heats and finals, he would have had more recovery and a better throw. But this is a good start,” he said.
Nadeem’s triumph marks the first time Pakistan has won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship in 50 years.
Nadeem, who holds the Olympic record after throwing a monstrous 92.97m at Paris 2024, narrowly missed breaking the championship record of 86.72m.
Nadeem had a slow start in the competition, throwing 75.64m and 76.80m on his first and second attempts before bagging top spot with an 85.57m throw on his third attempt. He then threw 83.99m and 83.44m before flexing his muscles and throwing a commanding 86.40m to win gold in his sixth and final attempt in true Arshad Nadeem fashion.
All eyes were on Nadeem as he stepped up to the field for his first throw and the audience waved Pakistani flags.
‘Dil Dil Pakistan’ was blaring in the stadium as the crowd anticipated a massive throw from the javelin superstar, who is competing internationally for the first time since last year’s Paris Olympics.
Nadeem was in a state of prostation after winning gold, as his become characteristic of the 28-year-old who added another feather to his cap.
 
 

He bagged gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, followed by a silver medal at the 2023 World Championships in Budapest.
Nadeem will soon be going to England to prepare for September’s World Athletics Championships, the only major tournament where he has yet to win gold.
In yesterday’s heats, Nadeem threw an impressive 86.34m throw on his first and only attempt to cruise into today’s final. Yasir qualified for the final with a 76.07m throw in the heats.
After he punched his ticket to the final, Nadeem took to Instagram to say: “As always I would need your support and prayers.”
Nadeem’s gold is Pakistan’s first and only medal at the championship.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan’s fastest female sprinter Tameem Khan finished 17th in the Women’s 100m heats with a 12.14.
Meanwhile, top sprinter Shajar Abbas ran a 47.17 in the Men’s 400m heats, and a 47.38 in the semi-finals, where he finished 12th. Compatriot Abdul Mueed ran a 50.10 in the heats and finished 27th.
Ahead of the championship, Nadeem was awarded Best Male Athlete of the Year by Asian Athletics.
 






Felicitations pour in
President Asif Ali Zardari said Nadeem “has once again brought glory to Pakistan” as he congratulated the 28-year-old on his win.
“He had excellent performance throughout the championship, including in the final,” the president was quoted as saying in a post on X by PPP.
“I congratulate the entire nation on this victory and pray for his success in the future.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Nadeem’s “hard work, dedication and outstanding success are a worthy example for young athletes.
“The glory of the crescent flag has increased after Arshad’s outstanding performance,” he said on X.
 






The cricket fraternity was quick to congratulate Nadeem, with T20 Vice Captain Shadab Khan calling his win “another proud moment for the nation.”
“What a throw, what a champ! Arshad Nadeem you beauty!” he said on X.
 






Former T20 captains Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi also felicitated Nadeem on their Instagram Stories.
 


 


The Pakistan Cricket Board posted on X, saying: “Gold for Pakistan!”

The Climate Risk Index (CRI), published by Germanwatch, ranks countries by the human and economic toll of extreme weather. The latest edition highlights increasing losses and the urgent need for stronger climate resilience and action.
In the report published in February, Pakistan was ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, followed by Belize and Italy. Rehman shared the report to her X page, stating that Pakistan had been listed in the report as the country most affected by climate change.
“CRI ranks countries by the human and economic toll of extreme weather, measuring realised risk,” she wrote, adding that the report “should serve as a huge wake-up call”.
 






In a longer statement published by the PPP, Rehman regretted that Pakistan is now the most vulnerable country in the world to climate risks.
“Now it would be wrong to say that Pakistan is in the top 10, unfortunately, we are number one,” Rehman was quoted as saying. “The sharp increase in the risks of stormy rains, hailstorms [and] glacier melting shows the seriousness of the situation.”
Noting that Pakistan has suffered the most from climate change despite minimal impact on the environment, the senator asked why the country is suffering the consequences of the international community’s contributions to global warming.
“Both lives and the economy are at risk from environmental events. Why should countries like us be punished for the world’s massive use of carbon? The time for environmental justice has come,” Rehman was quoted as saying.
“The international community cannot have sustainable development without environmental justice,” she added. “Take a real account of global warming, only then will developing and poor countries be able to escape the effects of climate change.”
The senator also noted in the statement that “the imposition of an environmental emergency, policy reforms and global aid have become imperative for Pakistan”.
Pakistan has seen the effects of climate change in unprecedented floods in 2022, primarily caused by record-breaking monsoon rainfall, glacial lake outburst floods, and other factors.
The CRI highlighted that over 33 million people were affected and over 1,700 lives were lost due to the floods. It also says that climate change made the severity of extreme monsoon rainfall increase by 50 per cent.
Not only that, over eight million people lost their homes and were internally displaced due to the 2022 floods, while 1.3 million houses were damaged. The issue was compounded by a lack of drinking water availability and a surge in waterborne diseases, such as diarrhoea, cholera, dengue, malaria, and skin infections.</p><small>2025-05-31 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607100-pm-shehbaz-stresses-need-to-bring-misguided-individuals-back-on-right-path' target='_blank'><strong>PM urges engagement with 'misguided' elements for national reintegration</strong></a><br><p>

Delhi suspended its participation in the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs the usage of the Indus river system, on April 23, shortly after 26 civilians were killed in India-held Kashmir. Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack. The latter has denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe.
Despite the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreeing to a ceasefire this month following the worst fighting between them in decades, the accord remains “in abeyance” by India.
According to data provided by Wapda today, the inflow of water at Chenab River at Marala Headworks was 98,200 cusecs on May 29, before dropping to 44,800 cusecs yesterday. The inflows plunged further to 7,200 cusecs today, with no water discharged.
 
 

Overall, a reduction of 91,000 cusecs in the inflow of water at Chenab River at Marala Headworks was recorded in the last two days.
The Flood Forecasting Division of the Pakistan Meteorological Department categorised the flow at Marala Barrage as “normal” and showed a falling trend.
Chenab River water flows had also been impacted when India virtually stopped water discharges from it into Pakistan without prior notice on May 5, just before the two countries’ military escalation.
A senior official of the Punjab irrigation department had said at the time that India was using Pakistan’s water “to fill up their dams/hydropower projects in the Chenab basin”.
He noted that Marala Headworks was located 76 kilometres away from Salal Dam, one of India’s three hydropower projects in the Chenab basin.
According to the official, Chenab is very important for Pakistan’s irrigation system as its canals, including the Upper Chenab and Bambawali-Ravi-Bedian canals, irrigate a vast tract of agricultural land in Punjab.
Rejecting the weaponisation of water by India, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif yesterday warned that Pakistan would not allow Delhi to cross the red line by holding the IWT in abeyance and endangering millions of lives for narrow political gains.
 
 

His statement came after India’s PM Narendra Modi threatened that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India had “rights”.
Even after the ceasefire, Modi had ordered officials to expedite the planning and execution of projects on the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers — three bodies of water in the Indus system that are designated primarily for Pakistan’s use, six people told Reuters.
The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters (PCIW) has finalised a detailed report on the IWT violations by India, including the construction of three hydroelectric projects at the western rivers, including Jhelum and Chenab.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31180819b9b3e8e.jpg?r=180947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914526/trump-says-chinese-students-in-us-will-be-ok' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Chinese students in US will ‘be ok’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump told reporters late on Friday he wanted to assure Chinese international students in the country that they would be fine amid his administration’s crackdown on academia.
Trump’s administration this week said it would specifically target permissions for Chinese students, in its latest broadside against US higher education. But when asked on Friday what message he would send to Chinese college students in the country, Trump insisted: “They’re going to be ok. It’s going to work out fine.
“We just want to check out the individual students we have. And that’s true with all colleges,” he told reporters.
The softer tone comes after a judge on Thursday extended a temporary block on Trump’s bid to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio vowed on Wednesday to “aggressively” revoke visas to students from China. Rubio has already revoked thousands of visas, largely over students’ involvement in activism critical of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, but also over minor traffic violations and other infractions.
The Trump administration has been in an ongoing showdown with academia, and Harvard in particular, demanding that it provide a list of students that the government is interested in, something the prestigious university has declined to do.
“I don’t know why Harvard’s not giving us the list. There’s something going on because Harvard is not giving us a list,” Trump said on Friday.
“They ought to give us a list and get themselves out of trouble,” he insisted, suggesting that “they don’t want to give the list because they have names on there that supposedly are quite bad.”
At graduation ceremonies this week, Harvard University president Alan Garber received a one-minute standing ovation when he called for universities to stand “firm” in the war the Trump administration has waged against students and schools.
“We want people that can love our country and take care of our country and cherish our country,” Trump said on Friday.
International students on average make up just under six per cent of the US university population — far below Britain, the second top destination for international students, where the figure is 25pc.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31164132d813129.jpg?r=164142' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914520/punjab-ctd-foils-major-plot-by-arresting-34-terrorists-of-banned-organisations' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CTD foils ‘major plot’ by arresting 34 terrorists of banned organisations</strong></a><br><p>Punjab’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Saturday said it foiled a “major terror plot” by arresting 34 terrorists of banned organisations during 415 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) across the province.
The CTD regularly carries out operations across the province to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.
The law enforcement agency said in a statement, “Two dangerous terrorists [were] arrested in Lahore along with explosives, both of whom are affiliated with Fitna al Khawarij.”
Fitna Al Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement quoted a CTD spokesperson as saying, “Punjab CTD conducted 415 IBOs in different districts of the province to effectively deal with any untoward incident of terrorism, in which 420 suspects were questioned and 34 terrorists were arrested along with weapons, explosives and other prohibited materials.”
The terrorists were identified as Muhammad Ashfaq, Ismail Khan, Naseerullah, Irshad, Saqib, Shoaib, Muhammad Usman, Muhammad Adeel, Muhammad Ki Naam, Muhammad Suleman, Hamza Tariq, Qazi Khan and Sakhi Zaman.
The spokesperson also said that the terrorists were affiliated with Fitna al Khawarij and other organisations, adding that the IBOs took place in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Jhelum, Bahawalpur, Sahiwal, Narowal, Jhelum, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, Bukhara, Kasur and Nankana Sahib.
 
 

The CTD recovered 5,841 grams of explosives, 19 detonators, 51 feet of safety fuse wire, one grenade, pamphlets, cash and mobile phones.
The statement further said that the terrorists had planned to target important buildings in different cities, adding that 23 cases had been registered against the terrorists, and further investigation was underway.
It added that 5,045 combing operations were conducted in May with the cooperation of local police and security agencies, 209,518 people were checked, 604 suspects were arrested, 561 FIRs were registered and 456 recoveries were made.
The statement said that Punjab CTD was “diligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and no stone will be left unturned in its efforts to bring terrorists and anti-state elements behind bars”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
Last month, the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting 10 terrorists belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3116452302c47d3.jpg?r=164925' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914521/pakistan-says-india-violating-global-human-rights-by-deliberate-incitement-against-its-own-muslims' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says India violating global human rights by ‘deliberate incitement’ against its own Muslims</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Saturday said India was violating its international human rights obligations by its “deliberate incitement” against Muslims in its own territory.
The statement comes amid heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries in the wake of their recent military confrontation, sparked by New Delhi’s allegations levelled without evidence against Islamabad over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
Responding to media queries, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said in a statement: “The targeting of Muslims through hate speech, discriminatory actions, and state complicity is a matter of serious concern for the international community.
“At a time when restraint and reconciliation are most needed, the deliberate incitement of religious hatred for political or ideological purposes violates international human rights obligations and vitiates the prospects for communal harmony, and regional stability,” it added.
Pakistan expressed “grave concern over the alarming rise in Islamophobic incidents across India” and called upon its government to “uphold the rights and safety of all its citizens, regardless of faith”.
 






Earlier this month, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), which is based in New Delhi, reported 184 hate crimes targeted at Muslims all over India between April 27 and May 8.
These affected at least 316 individuals, “physically or otherwise”, noting that the actual number was likely higher.
The incidents comprised 84 hate speeches, 64 acts of intimidation, 42 harassment incidents, 39 assaults, 19 acts of vandalism, 14 threats, seven verbal abuses and three murders.
 






The APCR further said that 106 of the 184 hate crimes were linked to the Pahalgam attack. The highest number of them was recorded in Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.
“The nature of hate crimes indicates a nationally resonant atmosphere of hostility and not local anomalies,” the civil rights group noted.
One such incident was the vandalism of Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad by the right-wing workers of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
According to Al Jazeera, incendiary music tracks labelling Indian Muslims as “traitors” and advocating their boycott were being circulated widely. Al Jazeera found at least 20 songs that “carried and amplified such Islamophobic themes”.
Besides intensifying a crackdown on alleged links to Pakistan, India has also made arrests over critical comments.
 
 

Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor with the Department of Political Science at Ashoka University, was arrested on May 18 in a case related to his comments on the military briefings during the India-Pakistan flare-up.
Days later, Mahmudabad was granted bail by India’s top court, which also ordered the formation of a special police team to probe his comments.</p><small>2025-05-31 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607081-adc-hidayatullah-buledi-laid-to-rest-after-deadly-surab-attack' target='_blank'><strong>ADC Hidayatullah Buledi laid to rest after deadly Surab attack</strong></a><br><p>

Indian fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.
Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes. According to a Dawn report, the recent clash between India and Pakistan marks a significant development in the regional air power constellation. Three Rafales, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.
 






While speaking to Bloomberg at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, General Chauhan said, “I think what is important is not the jets being downed but why the jets were shot down.”
In response to a query by the show’s host, he confirmed that Indian fighter jets were shot down during the recent escalation between the two countries.
He emphasised that the reasons why the Indian jets were shot down and what the Indian forces did after that were more important.
General Chauhan also claimed that the four-day conflict never came close to the point of nuclear war.
American and French officials also confirmed that Pakistan shot down an Indian jet using fighter aircraft it acquired from China, CNN and Reuters reported earlier in the month.
CNN cited a senior US official saying, as per their assessment, Pakistani forces shot down the jet during India’s air strikes inside Pakistan.
A high-ranking French intelligence official also told CNN that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan.

Earlier in the month, American newspaper The Washington Post also verified visual evidence that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
The paper based its findings on analyses by former US Army explosive ordnance disposal technician Trevor Ball, Etienne Marcuz, an associate fellow at the Foundation for Strategic Research and an anonymous French air power expert.
“In a review of more than a dozen images and videos posted online in the aftermath of the strikes, The Post verified debris consistent with at least two French-made fighter jets flown by the Indian Air Force — a Rafale and a Mirage 2000,” The Post reported.
After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases on the night of May 9-10, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad’s call for a neutral probe into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.</p><small>2025-05-31 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/311404418cb3b1f.png?r=144440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914506/kabul-also-levels-up-its-pakistan-diplomat-to-ambassador-as-ties-see-normalisation' target='_blank'><strong>Kabul also levels up its Pakistan diplomat to ambassador as ties see ‘normalisation’</strong></a><br><p>Hours after Pakistan decided to enhance ties with Afghanistan yesterday, the Afghan foreign ministry welcomed the decision and announced upgrading the status of its chargé d’affaires in Islamabad to ambassador.
Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging envoys earlier this month — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations due to terrorism concerns repeatedly voiced by Islamabad.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan welcomes the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its diplomatic mission in Kabul to that of an ambassador,” the Afghan foreign ministry said on its X account late on Friday.
“In reciprocity, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will elevate the status of its mission in Islamabad from chargé d’affaires to ambassador,” the ministry added.
 






Zakir Jalaly, an Afghan foreign ministry official, wrote on X that the current chargé d’affaires in Islamabad, Sardar Ahmad Shakeeb, will assume responsibilities as the country’s ambassador to Pakistan.
 






Kabul’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is due to visit Pakistan “in the coming days”, ministry spokesman Zia Ahmad Takal told AFP.
Following Pakistan’s decision from yesterday, its chargé d’affaires Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani will be levelled up to an ambassador.
This elevation in diplomatic representation between the two countries paves the way for enhanced bilateral cooperation in multiple domains.
Pakistan and Afghanistan made the announcements days after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the two nations “expressed clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible”.
Wang, who hosted an informal Afghanistan-China-Pakistan trilateral meeting in Beijing, had welcomed that development and said China would continue to provide assistance for the improvement of Pak-Afghan relations.
 
 

Pakistani experts have acknowledged the role of China, which pressed Pakistan and Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to normalise relations.
“China, as a bridge builder, is playing a historic role in bringing together Muslim countries,” Senator Mushahid Hussain, chairman of the Pakistan-China Institute, told Dawn.com today.
“They presided over the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia in 2023, then brought 14 Palestinian factions together in Beijing in 2024, and now they have helped in normalising ties between Islamabad and Kabul,” detailed Mushahid, who has served as the chairman of the Senate foreign affairs and defence committees.
He recalled that at the tripartite meeting hosted by FM Wang, all three countries agreed to expand the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to include Afghanistan as well. Then they politely prodded both sides to restore their level of representation to ambassador level, he added.
The senator termed the decision as a good sign that both Pakistan and Afghanistan were willing, ready and able to move forward on the path of normalisation with China’s “excellent” facilitation.
 
 

“China as a South Asian power also has the highest stakes for peace, security and stability in the region,” Mushahid highlighted.
Afghan experts also view the decision as very important for engagement in the current environment in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Dr Ubaidullah Burhani, an American academic writer of Afghan origin and a researcher in political strategy, noted that the levelling up of diplomatic ties represented a significant political development, adding it arrives belatedly within a context marked by complex geopolitical rivalries.
“It is imperative, however, that both sides seize this opportunity to engage in direct, constructive dialogue — independent of regional pressures — in order to lay the groundwork for policies that build mutual trust and deliver concrete outcomes,” Dr Burhani told Dawn.com.
The international affairs specialist stressed that priority should be given to advancing cooperation in critical areas such as trade, healthcare, and education, to ensure that diplomatic gestures are matched by practical steps that serve the interests of both nations and their people.
 
 

Ambassador Nizamani, who joined the Foreign Service exactly three decades ago, was sent as charge d’affaires in November 2022, months after Ambassador Mansoor Khan completed his tenure.
According to a profile of Ambassador Nizamani shared by the embassy with Dawn.com, he has served as the deputy chief of mission at the Embassy of Pakistan in Washington, DC from November 2019 to February 2021.
Other roles he has been posted at include deputy high commissioner at the High Commission for Pakistan in New Delhi, political counsellor at the High Commission for Pakistan in Dhaka as well as at Pakistan’s embassy in Berlin, and vice consul at the Consulate General of Pakistan in Jeddah.
In Islamabad, Nizamani has served as the director for the US, as well as director general for Europe and South Asia.</p><small>2025-05-31 10:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/31145216f02413c.jpg?r=145239' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914510/punjab-govt-to-impose-section-144-in-province-during-eid-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt to impose section 144 in province during Eid holidays</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab government on Saturday said that Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) will be in place to prevent disturbance of public peace and danger to human life from June 5 to June 11.
A notification issued by the provincial government today said that it was reported that during Eidul Azha, random people burned the heads and feet of sacrificial animals which emitted unhealthy smoke and unpleasant smell.
“Members of the public throw entrails of sacrificial animals on roadside and drains, which causes smell/insanitary conditions and blockage of sewerage system,” the notification added.
It continued that people in different areas swim in the “canals, ponds, lakes, riverbanks and distributaries during Eid holidays”, placing their lives at risk.
“Cattle sellers illegally establish sale points for sale/purchase of sacrificial animals within populated areas of districts, which causes hindrance in smooth conduct of traffic and also spread of different diseases,” it read.
“The said activities are not only injurious to public health and safety, but also cause nuisance and resentment among the general public [and] are likely to cause disturbance in public peace and tranquility.”
The notification said there were sufficient grounds to proceed under Section 144 of the CrPC to prevent disturbance of public peace and danger to human life within the territorial limits of the province of Punjab.
Therefore, the government prohibited the following actions June 5 to 11 across the province: “Burning of the head and feet of sacrificial animals in public places; swimming/bathing/boating in rivers/lakes/dams; throwing offal/ entrails of sacrificial animal on manhole/ drainage/canals etc; sale/purchase of sacrificial animals at any place other than notified cattle markets and display of arms and ammunition.”

The agreement between the two airlines has come under public criticism in India after Turkiye came out in support for Pakistan during the recent conflict.
The pact has also been opposed by IndiGo’s rival Air India, which has lobbied the Indian government to end the deal, citing business impact and security concerns.
 
 

India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it had denied IndiGo’s request for a six-month extension and approved only three months, citing passenger convenience. The lease was due to expire on Saturday.
The regulator said IndiGo gave an undertaking that it will terminate the lease with state-owned Turkish Airlines by Aug 31 and will not seek a further extension.

The airline has previously defended the Turkish partnership, saying it offers multiple benefits to Indian travellers and boosts aviation growth and jobs.
Turkiye’s support for Pakistan during the recent conflict has sparked a boycott of Turkish products, including chocolates, coffee and clothing, in India.
IndiGo has had a codeshare partnership with Turkish Airlines since 2018 and has used that to connect travellers from India to a growing number of destinations in Europe and the US in the last few years, making Istanbul an important hub for India’s largest airline.
Since 2023, Turkish Airlines has leased two IndiGo two Boeing 777 aircraft with pilots and some crew. The aircraft currently operates on the Delhi-Istanbul and Mumbai-Istanbul routes, allowing IndiGo to carry more passengers, compared with the narrow bodies it operated previously.
IndiGo has been leasing aircraft to tide over aircraft delivery delays and expand internationally. The airline expects its first Airbus A350 by early 2027 and the long-range A321XLR this financial year.
In the absence of the leased 777s, IndiGo could go back to operating narrowbody aircraft on the two routes, or it could use widebody aircraft it has leased from Norse Atlantic Airways. It could also deploy the XLRs once they are delivered, analysts have said.
The regulator’s decision to give a limited extension comes after the Indian government earlier this month revoked the security clearance of Turkish ground handling service firm Celebi, citing national security, prompting a lawsuit from the Indian arm of the Turkish firm.

Pakistan faces a potential 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world’s biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington last month on countries around the world.
Pakistan’s formal negotiations with the United States on reciprocal tariffs started earlier in the day with a phone call between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, a press release from the finance ministry said.
“Pakistan representatives are coming in next week,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after departing Air Force One.
“And India, as you know, we’re very close to making a deal with India. And I wouldn’t have any interest in making a deal with either (Pakistan and India) if they were going to be at war with each other. I went that and I let them know,” the US president stressed.
The developments follow a recent military confrontation between Pakistan and India over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
 
 

Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides aiming to sign an interim agreement by early July.
India faces 26pc tariffs on shipments to the US.
Reuters reported last week that India is likely to allow US firms to bid for contracts worth over $50 billion, mainly from federal entities, as it negotiates a trade deal with Washington.
The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products, amongst a global tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and serve as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs could have a “devastating impact” on the country’s export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.
Trump’s tariffs, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.
Trump again claims role in Pakistan-India ceasefire
President Donald Trump also reaffirmed his claim of having brokered the May 2025 Pakistan-India ceasefire — a statement that continues to irk New Delhi but is quietly welcomed in Islamabad.
Speaking at a White House press conference on Friday, President Trump said his intervention “stopped India and Pakistan from fighting”, adding that the conflict could have “turned out into a nuclear disaster”.
“We talk trade and we said we can’t trade with people that are shooting at each other and potentially using nuclear weapons,” he said. “They’re great leaders in those countries. And they understood and they agreed and that all stopped.”
This marks the fifth time President Trump has publicly cited his role in halting the conflict. He underscored America’s power to both wage and prevent wars, stating, “Ultimately, we can fight better than anybody,” but added, “we’re stopping others from fighting also.”
He also expressed gratitude to the leaders of both South Asian nations, as well as his own diplomatic team. “I want to thank the leaders of India, the leaders of Pakistan, and I want to thank my people also,” he said.
 


A Pakistani delegation, led by PPP chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, will arrive in New York on Sunday. It is expected to meet UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the current president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The delegation will also address a joint session of OIC envoys during its two-day stay in New York.
The group will travel to Washington on June 3, where it hopes to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior US officials. The visit also includes meetings with congressional lawmakers, policy experts from major think tanks, and US media representatives.
While Pakistani officials have been cautious in public, they privately acknowledge that President Trump played a significant role in defusing the recent conflict. In contrast, India has repeatedly rejected the notion of outside involvement, claiming that the ceasefire was initiated by Pakistan and achieved without US mediation.
Curiously, Islamabad denies making such a request and instead credits President Trump — creating an unusual diplomatic convergence between Pakistani officials and the current US president.
Trump’s latest comments are seen in Islamabad as a timely morale booster for the visiting delegation. Pakistani diplomats say they not only endorse his claim but would welcome a broader US role in South Asia, particularly in resolving the Kashmir dispute. Trump had earlier underscored the need to resolve this issue, calling it a “festering wound” that must be addressed to ensure lasting peace in the region.
President Trump’s remarks were part of a broader narrative positioning his second term as one focused on restoring global stability. “When I left, we had no wars, we had no problems. We defeated ISIS, we rebuilt our military, and we had no inflation,” he said. “And when I came back, we had a lot of inflation. We had wars all over the place.”
Listing current global crises — including the war in Ukraine, the Israeli invasion of Gaza, and tensions in the Indo-Pacific — President Trump cited South Asia as another region where US leadership has made a difference. “And now we have something where we’re really healing a lot of that,” he said, casting himself as a stabilising force in a turbulent world.
His assertion of having averted a “nuclear disaster” is likely to prompt strong reactions in diplomatic circles, particularly in New Delhi, which has consistently rejected third-party involvement in its disputes with Pakistan.
Yet, the timing of his remarks is significant. The Pakistani delegation’s visit to Washington aims to focus on trade, regional security, and reshaping US-Pakistan ties amid shifting global alliances and domestic political transitions. President Trump’s comments may complicate the diplomatic tone — or, for Islamabad, provide an opening to highlight its international relevance and US engagement.
Analysts say even if the president’s role in the ceasefire is exaggerated, the fact that hostilities ceased suggests that diplomatic pressure — including from Washington — was a factor. Given President Trump’s preference for direct engagement and bold claims, his involvement cannot be ruled out.
For Pakistan, the ceasefire remains a rare instance where a US president publicly acknowledged playing a role in reducing South Asian tensions — something successive governments in Islamabad have long sought.
As one Pakistani official noted privately: “It doesn’t matter who claims the credit, as long as the firing stops.”
Meanwhile, Christine Fair, a US scholar once seen as aligned with pro-Indian perspectives, challenged New Delhi’s narrative of success in the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
“Indians who fail to see the victories that Pakistan snatched from the latest skirmish will fail to understand just why India has not and will not deter Pakistan,” she wrote in a post on X.</p><small>2025-05-31 06:47</small></div><hr>
