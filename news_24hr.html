The development was notified by the provincial home department in similar notifications, of which 11 are dated November 6 and one was issued on October 31.
According to the notifications, seen by Dawn, the provincial government ordered the formation of five JITs under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 for as many cases registered against the TLP in the Sheikhupura district. Of these, four cases have been registered in the Muridke tehsil and one in Ferozewala tehsil.
Another seven JITs have been formed to carry out the investigation in as many cases registered in Lahore. Of these cases, three have been registered in the   Nawankot area, three in Shahdara Town and one in the Ravi Road area.
Crackdown on TLP
In recent weeks, the Punjab government has intensified action against the TLP following a ban imposed on the party after a violent clash between TLP protesters and law enforcement personnel in Muridke last month.
 
 

Meanwhile, authorities continue to look for TLP Chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi, whose disappearance has seemingly baffled the Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies.
The TLP chief and his brother were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 first information reports lodged against them.
On October 29, the duo, including 21 other senior TLP leaders, were placed on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) to prevent them from travelling abroad.
According to a senior officer in the Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore, so far, Lahore police have reportedly arrested a total of the group’s 1,250 key members, including their financiers and the workers wanted in over 100 criminal cases.
The official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of party.
So, the major focus of the police remained on arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore.
A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke, where they had encountered the LEAs.
The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said, adding that the crackdowns continued daily.
As per sources, the sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members have increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes.
A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid a police crackdown.
On Tuesday, Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari detailed that assets worth Rs23.40 billion belonging to the TLP had been frozen, along with 92 bank accounts linked to the organisation.</p><small>2025-11-19 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17130936c7e5b77.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954862/pakistan-and-the-paris-promise-on-the-wrong-side-of-15c' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and the Paris promise: On the wrong side of 1.5°C</strong></a><br><p>Ten years after the signing of the Paris Agreement, Pakistan faces an uncomfortable truth: we are steadily moving towards a climate future we were meant to avoid.
For decades, Pakistan’s engagement with the annual UN climate summits — the COPs — has revolved around a single question: how much money are we going to get? Our success or failure at these negotiations has thus been measured by the size of the financial commitments pledged by developed countries to developing ones.
The fight for climate safety
When COP27 established the Loss and Damage Fund, Pakistan — then chairing the G77 — rightly celebrated it as a diplomatic victory. Yet, our climate diplomacy remains trapped within a narrow frame of finance and compensation, while paying little attention to the far greater challenge of halting the emissions that are driving the crisis itself.
This imbalance carries grave, devastating stakes. Pakistan is one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries. At the current level of global warming — estimated at about 1.34 degrees above pre-industrial temperatures — the country is already witnessing a cascade of climate-induced disasters. Floods, droughts, and prolonged heatwaves have become recurring events, glaciers in the north are retreating at alarming rates, and rising sea levels are encroaching upon coastal settlements.
One does not need to be a climate scientist to imagine what lies ahead if global temperatures exceed the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree limit. For a country as exposed as Pakistan, every fraction of a degree translates into tangible loss of livelihoods, ecosystems, and lives. The path to safety therefore lies not in compensation alone, but in mitigation and the collective effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The decade since the Paris Agreement presents a mixed picture of progress and failure. On one hand, there are reasons for cautious optimism. A recent report by the international think tank Climate Analytics notes that since 2015, many countries have moved from fragmented and sector-specific targets to comprehensive, economy-wide emission reduction goals.
As a result, projections for this century show a marked decline in expected emissions, with anticipated warming by the year 2100 falling from roughly 3.6°C before the Paris Agreement to about 2.7°C under current policies. Avoiding that one extra degree means fewer heatwaves, less sea-level rise, and a lower risk of crossing dangerous climate tipping points.
The Paris Agreement has also triggered a historic shift in global investment trends. Clean energy technologies now attract more than two trillion dollars in investment each year, which is more than double the amount still directed towards fossil fuels. For every dollar spent on oil, coal, or gas, nearly two dollars are now being invested in renewables.
Following the landmark advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, the 1.5°C target has become both the moral and scientific foundation of global climate policy. Meanwhile, the Loss and Damage Fund is being operationalised, climate litigation is expanding across jurisdictions, and cities, regions, and civil society networks are advancing Paris-aligned actions where national governments have been slow to act.
Yet despite these developments, global ambition continues to fall short of what is required. Even if all existing national pledges, like the Nationally Determined Contributions, are fully implemented, the planet remains on course for between 2.3 and 2.5°C of warming by the end of the century. Years of delayed action have already added about 0.1°C of additional warming since 2015, making it increasingly unlikely that we can limit the rise to 1.5 degrees without overshoot.
Because global emissions failed to peak during the past decade, scientists now consider a temporary breach of the 1.5°C threshold to be almost inevitable. The extent of that overshoot will determine how much irreversible damage the world suffers. A sustained rise of even 0.4 degrees beyond the target could push many glaciers past the point of recovery and unleash losses that no amount of future adaptation can undo.
Survival demands more than diplomacy
For Pakistan, this global trajectory is deeply worrying.
Given the country’s extreme vulnerability, one would expect Pakistan to be among the most vocal defenders of the 1.5°C target. Instead, its position has remained ambiguous and subdued, shaped less by scientific urgency and more by geopolitical alignment.
As a member of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) group — a bloc that includes China, India, and Saudi Arabia — Pakistan has tended to echo the priorities of economies that remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels. These countries publicly endorse the Paris goals, yet often invoke the principles of “equity” and “historical responsibility” to justify a slower transition away from carbon. In doing so, they weaken collective ambition, and Pakistan has followed the same path.
Our domestic choices tell a similar story. Over the past decade, Pakistan has continued to invest in coal and imported liquefied natural gas, locking its energy system into dependence on expensive and polluting fuels. At the same time, ordinary citizens have begun their own quiet transition.
With the falling price of solar technology, more and more households are turning to rooftop solar systems and batteries, reducing their reliance on the national grid. Instead of supporting this encouraging trend, policymakers have sought to slow it down, citing the rising circular debt in the power sector, a problem rooted not in solar power but in years of mismanagement and short-sighted planning.
Today, Pakistan stands at the intersection of three converging crises: escalating temperatures, geopolitical inertia, and a fragile power sector. To continue treating climate action as a bargaining chip in international negotiations is no longer sustainable.
As a democratic republic, our foremost responsibility is to safeguard our people from the worsening impact of climate change. That requires reclaiming our climate leadership, not merely as a victim seeking aid, but as a country willing to act, a nation that defends the 1.5 degree goal as a matter of survival and aligns its domestic energy policies with that vision.
Whether Pakistan chooses that path at the next COP remains to be seen. But time is running out.
The world will not wait for us to find our footing. We can either remain on the wrong side of the Paris promise or recognise, before it is too late, that keeping the 1.5 degree goal alive is not a diplomatic preference, but an existential necessity.

The PTI had held a protest outside the jail on Tuesday, where Imran is currently incarcerated, but the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. Subsequently, the party held a sit-in outside the jail and criticised the prison administration for violating the court order in this regard.
In a post on social media platform X after midnight, the party said Aleema Khan, Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when the police action happened.
It added that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi, MNA Shahid Khattak and other party workers, including several women, were “subjected to violence and picked up by police”.
“What should be routine weekly court-mandated family visits, in accordance with Imran Khan’s rights as a prisoner, are being used as a tool of oppression and violence against his family members and supporters,” the party said.
 






Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled.
In a later video shared by the party, Noreen said that female police officials grabbed her by her hair and forced her down to the ground. “I didn’t understand it. I still don’t understand what happened,” she said, asserting that PTI workers were sitting peacefully outside the jail.
 






Aleema said that at one point, Noreen was “practically unconscious” as she was dragged on the floor. “Thank goodness we saw and managed to set her free,” she said.
She also asserted that the incident would not “scare us”, adding that a press conference would be held later. “The way the women dragged us, ripped away our chaddors … they should be ashamed.”
Aleema also alleged that her and her sisters were denied a meeting with Imran as “Asim Munir’s notification has not yet been signed”.
 






In another post, the party condemned the “inhumane, unlawful, and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family members. It said that the PTI founder’s sisters, along with his legal team, had arrived at the jail to meet him on Tuesday but were denied the meeting and forced to wait until night.
“By 10pm, despite spending twelve hours under severe distress, the Punjab government ordered an appalling operation that no civilised or democratic society could ever justify,” the PTI said.
 






It alleged that the area where Imran’s sisters were seated was “intentionally flooded with water”.
“The lights were switched off to plunge the entire place into darkness, and in the ensuing chaos, police physically assaulted Imran Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan and Uzma Khan,” it added.
It further said that one of the sisters was dragged “across the road, manhandled, and violently detained despite her cries and the pleas of those present”.
“This level of state oppression and cruelty represents an unprecedented assault on basic human dignity, constitutional freedoms, and moral norms,” it said.
Meanwhile, a senior Rawalpindi police official told Dawn that no action was taken against the PTI protesters. He said that they were only removed from the road they were occupying.
‘Our collective humiliation’
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the police action against Imran’s sisters and a member of his cabinet.
“The attempt to arrest MNA Shahid Khattak and other provincial and national assembly members is also condemnable,” he said, adding that things were now progressing to a point of no return.
 






“This is today’s Pakistan — where the sanctity of a woman’s veil is violated. The sisters’ only fault was that they came to meet their brother,” said ex-president Arif Alvi.
 






“With every crime, the usurpers feel more and more immune. Abductions, arrests, raids, military court trials, rigged elections, amendments — all are connected. Every time they get away with no accountability, they feel more immune. Every time the bureaucracy, media, and judiciary, instead of resisting falls in line, they are emboldened,” said activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir.
He said that the Iddat case against Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi, the recent discourse on an article published by The Economist about the couple and the manhandling of the PTI founder’s sister all served one purpose: to humiliate.
“It is a fallacy to think this is Imran Khan’s or PTI’s humiliation alone. It is our collective humiliation. We are all being shown the price of dissent, the price of seeking justice, demanding democracy, and resisting oppression,” he said.
 






Senior journalist Hamid Mir said that the current regime was not realising that the “inhumane and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family was tarnishing the country’s image globally.
“It’s becoming difficult for our diplomats serving in the West to defend at public forums,” he said.
 






“Which Pakistan is this? What humanity is this?” asked Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. He said that the police action against Imran’s sisters was a “slap in the face of humanity and an example of the worst abuse of state power”.
“Those who lay their hands on women are neither worthy of being called Muslims nor Pakistanis,” he said.
 






PTI firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat condemned the treatment meted out to Noreen.
“Such brutality against a citizen — let alone a woman — is unacceptable. The state has reached a new low, and this abuse of power must end!” he said.
 






PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari said police had demonstrated “highly despicable behaviour” by attacking Imran’s sisters.
“We strongly condemn this disgraceful and unjustifiable act by the police,” he said.

The unusual request comes just weeks after direct India-China flights resumed after a five-year hiatus following a Himalayan border clash between the nations.
Air India has been seeking to rebuild its reputation and international network after a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed in Gujarat in June, killing 260 people and forcing it to briefly cut flights for safety checks.
But that effort is being complicated by the closure of Pakistan airspace to Indian carriers since diplomatic tensions erupted in late April.
For Air India, the country’s only carrier with a major international network, fuel costs have risen by as much as 29 per cent and journey times by up to three hours on some long-haul routes, according to the previously unreported document submitted to Indian officials in late October and reviewed by Reuters.
The Indian government is reviewing Air India’s plea to diplomatically ask China to allow an alternative routing and emergency access to airports in case of diversions at Hotan, Kashgar and Urumqi in Xinjiang, aiming to reach US, Canada and Europe faster, the document said.
“Air India’s long-haul network is under severe operational and financial strain … Securing Hotan route will be a strategic option,” it added.
The airline, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, estimated the Pakistan airspace closure’s impact on its profit before tax at $455 million annually — a significant amount given its fiscal 2024-25 loss stood at $439m.
The Chinese foreign ministry said it was not aware of the situation and referred Reuters to the “relevant authorities”.
Air India and civil aviation authorities in India, China and Pakistan did not respond to Reuters’ queries.
Without Hotan, some routes becoming ‘unviable’
The Chinese airspace Air India is seeking to access is ringed by some of the world’s highest mountains of 20,000 feet or more, and is avoided by international airlines due to potential safety risks in case of a decompression incident.
More critically, it also falls within People’s Liberation Army’s Western Theatre Command, which is equipped with extensive missile, drone and air-defence assets and shares some airports with civilian aircraft, military analysts say.
The Pentagon’s December report on China’s military said the command’s responsibilities include responding to any conflict with India.
China’s military has much greater control of the country’s airspace than in most other aviation markets, restricting flight paths. Open-source intelligence tracker Damien Symon said China’s military has recently expanded an airbase at Hotan.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Data from AirNav Radar shows no non-Chinese airlines departed or arrived at Hotan airport in the last 12 months.
Shukor Yusof, founder of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said: “Air India can try, but it’s doubtful China will accede” to access given the region’s terrain, lack of emergency airports and possibility of security issues.
Airspace globally has been constricted due to proliferating conflict zones.
 
 

US carriers have been banned from flying over Russia since the Ukraine war began in 2022 and pulled out of many US-India routes. That gave Air India a near-monopoly on non-stop flights from India.
But after the Pakistan airspace closure, Air India’s Delhi-Washington route was suspended in August. Now other routes are under review, with the direct Mumbai- and Bengaluru to San Francisco routes “becoming unviable” due to an additional three hours of travel time, including a technical stop in Kolkata, the document said.
A flight from San Francisco to Mumbai on Lufthansa via Munich is now only five minutes longer than on Air India.
“Passengers (are) shifting to foreign carriers due to shorter flight time as they have the benefit of Pakistan overflight,” the document said.
Air India estimates the requested Hotan route in China could substantially cut extra fuel requirements and flight times, help restore passenger and cargo capacity it trimmed by as much as 15pc on routes like New York- and Vancouver-Delhi, and reduce losses by an estimated $1.13m per week.
Cash flow burden deepens finance woes
With no signs of airspace ban easing, Air India also wants “temporary subsidy till Pakistan airspace opens”, the document said.
Air India, which has placed $70 billion of aircraft orders, is seeking help resolving legacy tax issues.
India’s government indemnified the airline against claims payable before selling it to Tata in 2022, but several notices have been received related to old tax liabilities of $725m, raising legal and reputation risks, the document said.
A confidential government notice from March, seen by Reuters, showed tax authorities warned of “coercive steps” — which can include freezing of assets — to recover dues of $58m in one case.
Contesting such tax demands has led to “additional cashflow burden … despite assurances during disinvestment”, the airline said.</p><small>2025-11-19 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1911063950bc73f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956018/us-confirms-sale-of-700m-air-defence-missile-system-to-taiwan' target='_blank'><strong>US confirms sale of $700m air defence missile system to Taiwan</strong></a><br><p>The United States confirmed the sale to Taiwan of an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million, its second weapons package in a week, bringing the total to $1 billion, and reaffirmed support for Taipei.
In the Indo-Pacific region, only Australia and Indonesia now operate the system, three of which the US said last year Taiwan would receive as part of a $2-billion weapons sale.
The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) medium-range air defence solutions, as they are called, are made by RTX. They have been battle-tested in Ukraine, but are a new weapon for Taiwan.
The Pentagon said the company was given a firm fixed-price contract for procurement of the NASAMS units, with work estimated to be completed in February 2031.
“Fiscal 2026 foreign military sales (Taiwan) funds in the amount of $698,948,760 were obligated,” it said in a statement on Monday.
RTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Used in Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion, the NASAMS system offers a sharp boost in air defence capabilities that the US is exporting to Taiwan as demand for it surges.
‘Rock solid’ US support
“It should be clear today and will remain clear into the future that America’s commitments to Taiwan are rock solid,” Raymond Greene, the de facto US ambassador in Taipei, told an event of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan on Tuesday.
“We are backing these words with actions, with a focus on supporting Taiwan’s efforts to achieve peace through strength. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our growing defence industrial cooperation.”
Thursday’s US approval of the sale of fighter jet and other aircraft parts to Taiwan for $330m was its first such deal since US President Donald Trump took office in January, prompting thanks from Taipei and anger in Beijing.
 
 

The arms sales news comes amid a worsening diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Tokyo over Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, although Taipei’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims.
On Sunday, Chinese coast guard ships sailed through waters around a group of East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China.
Japan said it also scrambled fighter jets on Saturday, after China flew a drone between Taiwan and Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni.
Asked about the tension on Wednesday, Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said China should not resort to force to resolve disputes.
“China should abandon its thinking of using force to resolve things,” he told reporters.
 
 

Taiwan’s military is beefing up its armaments to better tackle any attack from China, through efforts such as building its own submarines to defend vital maritime supply lines.
China’s military operates around Taiwan on an almost daily basis in what Taipei views as a “grey zone” strategy to test and exhaust Taiwan’s forces.
Despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, the US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, to the constant anger of Beijing.</p><small>2025-11-19 06:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/190953501178cda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955983/confusion-deepens-over-relocation-of-islamabad-high-court-to-its-former-premises-at-g-10' target='_blank'><strong>Confusion deepens over relocation of Islamabad High Court to its former premises at G-10</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Confusion surrounding the supposed relocation of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to its former premises in G-10 has deepened after reports cited a November 7 letter that directed the shifting of official records to the old building.
The circulation of the letter on social media quickly gave rise to speculation that the high court itself was being moved, a claim denied by IHC senior hierarchy and the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA).
According to officials familiar with the development, the order to shift the record was issued solely to clear four courtrooms previously occupied by judges of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC).
These courtrooms were urgently needed for the shifting of the FSC judges as the authorities had planned establishment of the newly-formed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) in the building meant for FSC.

High court bar says administrative letter wrongly interpreted as relocation order

Under the initial plan, the FCC was to be housed in the FSC building, but judges of the Shariat Court resisted the unplanned relocation and refused to vacate their premises.
Their firm stance forced the authorities to make alternative arrangements, resulting in the temporary accommodation of FCC judges inside the IHC building.
 
 

So far, seven of the FCC’s sanctioned strength of 13 judges have been appointed through presidential orders, all of whom have taken oath and been allotted separate courtrooms within the IHC.
Court insiders however clarified that this arrangement was temporary and should not be misconstrued as a signal that the IHC was being moved out of its current Shahrah-i-Dastur premises.
IHC’s senior officials denied the rumours saying that ample space had been given to the FCC where it could easily perform its functions.
However, the FCC judges are not comfortable as they are still using their chambers in the Supreme Court building because of the paucity of space in the IHC.
At a press conference, IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja dismissed the speculation as “misleading and baseless”, stating that the administrative letter was wrongly interpreted as a relocation order.
Recalling the long struggle for a permanent high court building in the federal capital, he noted that the judiciary in Islamabad began in a rented structure in Aabpara in 1980. The Islamabad High Court was established in 2007, abolished in 2009, and re-established in 2010. The current building was secured largely through the efforts of former IHC judge Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, and it took more than a decade to shift the court to Shahrah-i-Dastur. “The High Court is not going anywhere,” he reaffirmed.
Jajja also said while the FCC was welcomed by the bar after its creation under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, disagreements within the judiciary should be resolved by judges themselves. “The judges resigned from their jobs; they have to fight their own battles. We stand with the institution, not individual conflicts,” he added.
In contrast, the Islamabad District Bar Association has expressed support for shifting the high court back to G-10. In a letter to Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Bar President Chaudhry Naeem Ali Gujjar and Secretary Abdul Halim described the relocation as a step that would enhance convenience for lawyers and litigants while improving judicial efficiency and reducing delays. They assured full cooperation with the Law Ministry and the IHC administration should the government decide to proceed with the move.
Meanwhile, sources confirmed that a high-level meeting was expected soon to decide the final seating arrangements for the IHC and FCC.
The meeting will determine whether the IHC will remain at Shahrah-i-Dastur, whether the FCC will shift elsewhere, or whether a mutual exchange of premises will be considered. Until then, officials stress that no decision has been taken regarding the relocation of IHC.

Denial of due process and the sentence of death should give us pause. No matter what the offence, neither is to be celebrated.
The verdict has been handed down by the International Crimes Tribunal, a special domestic court set up by her with handpicked judges to sort out those she wanted punished. She succeeded, and several men were hanged on trumped-up charges in show trials.
Times change, and with them the crosshairs of kangaroo courts and the loyalties of those who man them. It is a lesson for all who confuse alliances with friendships and mistake servility for loyalty: by the time they learn, it is too late, both for them and the institutions they torpedo.
 
 

The accusation against Hasina was a deadly crackdown on the student protests of 2024; the charge was crimes against humanity.

The immunity of the few is made possible by the complicity of the many  and the indifference of all those who watch but say or do nothing

The episode put one in mind of the events of Friday, October 16, 1998. In a London clinic, an 82-year-old man was recuperating from a minor back operation. Around 11pm, there was a knock on the door. The man was woken up. He was informed of his rights. The order of his arrest was read out. International law turned a corner.
The man was General Augusto Pinochet. The coup he pulled had led to the death of Chile’s popularly elected President, Salvador Allende. For 17 years, he had ruled with an iron fist. Compelled to step down after a referendum unexpectedly went against him, he sought and got watertight immunity.
A belt was added to braces. He was made a senator for life and secured more immunity. Ever careful to make his immunities ironclad, when travelling to England, he became head of a diplomatic mission to negotiate an arms deal with the United Kingdom.
Accused of many crimes against humanity – including conspiracy to torture and assassination of critics and opponents – he took no chances. But what he underestimated was the growing reach of law, fearless investigators and independent judges. A chink in the armour was found. An extradition warrant was issued by a Spanish magistrate. International law was its basis. After a few ups and downs, the House of Lords (then the highest court of England) came through.
It was not an easy case. As Ariel Dorfman, author of The Pinochet Case: Origins, Progress and Implications, wrote in the New York Review of Books, no precedent existed to answer two important questions.
First, could a foreign court pass judgment against a former head of state of another country for crimes against humanity, committed in his own country and against his own people? Second, did his status as a former head of state and his presence in England on a diplomatic mission guarantee him immunity from prosecution anywhere in the world?
The court ruled that Britain and Spain had the right to put Pinochet on trial. Given the nature of his crimes, he had no immunity. He was to be extradited.
The real heroes of this triumph of international law were ordinary people who, against all odds, had refused to give up and had pursued justice for the disappeared and the dead.
Their story, and of the trials of Pinochet and others, is the subject of a magnificent and meticulously researched book by Professor Philippe Sands QC, 38 Londres Street: On Impunity: Pinochet in England and a Nazi in Patagonia.
In the end, politics prevailed. The governments of Spain, UK and Chile made a deal. The judiciary of Chile underwrote it by promising to try Pinochet, but it never did. Pinochet escaped trial, first in Spain, and later in Chile for faux health reasons.
Sheikh Hasina Wajid too, may yet be able to beat extradition.
But all has not been in vain. Cases against several others were reopened, and prosecutions commenced. Pinochet died in his bed, but till he did, he lived in fear.
Others, too, began to beware the reach of the law. In 1999, Franjo Tudman of Croatia, fearing being indicted for crimes during the Yugoslavian conflict, decided not to go to Germany for treatment.
In 2002, Henry Kissinger, cancelled a trip to Brazil; in February, 2011 George W. Bush aborted a trip to Switzerland, suspecting that he may be questioned for authorising waterboarding; and in 2023, after being indicted by the ICC, Russian President Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to South Africa.
While this may sound upbeat, one message from the authors of books on Pinochet’s murderous rule and his comeuppance is that the immunity of the few is made possible by the complicity of the many and the indifference of all those who watch but say or do nothing.
The other and more significant take is that absolute rulers, guilty of crimes against humanity, no longer have impunity from the long reach of the law. To use an oft-quoted expression, “the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice”.

“Tonight, I’m pleased to announce that we’re taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-Nato ally, which is something that is very important to them,” Trump said during a formal black-tie dinner at the White House.
“And I’m just telling you now for the first time, because they wanted to keep a little secret for tonight,” Trump said of the designation, which only 19 other countries have previously received.

According to Politico, the other countries in that category include Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Qatar.
The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June had made Saudi Arabia safer, Trump added.
Meanwhile, bin Salman had earlier promised to increase his country’s US investment to $1 trillion from a $600 billion pledge he made when Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May. But offered no details or timetable.
In his remarks at the dinner, the Saudi crown prince thanked Trump for the “warm welcome” accorded to him.
“This relationship started close to nine decades ago,” he said, adding that the two countries had worked together during this period.
“But today is a special day. We think the horizon of economic cooperation between US and Saudi Arabia, it’s bigger and wider,” he said, adding that the two were also signing agreements that would lead to deeper ties.
Defence agreement
Separately, a White House fact sheet said the two sides signed a Strategic Defence Agreement, which “fortifies deterrence across the Middle East,” makes it easier for US defense firms to operate in the country and secures “new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to defray US costs”.
The agreement appeared to fall short of the congressionally ratified Nato-style treaty Saudi Arabia initially sought.
The White House announced Trump had approved future deliveries of F-35 fighter jets and the Saudis had agreed to purchase 300 American tanks.
The sale of the stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, which has requested to buy 48 of the advanced aircraft, would mark the first US sale of the advanced fighter jets to Riyadh, a significant policy shift.
The deal could alter the military balance in the Middle East and test Washington’s definition of maintaining what the US has termed Israel’s “qualitative military edge”.
Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35.
The two countries also signed a joint declaration on the completion of negotiations on civil nuclear energy cooperation, which the White House said would build the legal foundation for a long-term nuclear energy partnership.
Bin Salman has been seeking a deal to unlock access to US nuclear technology and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE and traditional regional foe Iran.
But progress on such a nuclear pact has been difficult because the Saudis have resisted a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel.</p><small>2025-11-19 04:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691d07ee463f7.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955885/karachi-traffic-police-began-issuing-speeding-fines-without-fixed-speed-limits-on-city-roads' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi traffic police began issuing speeding fines without ‘fixed speed limits’ on city roads</strong></a><br><p>• DIG says speed limits for different roads to be set after completion of road safety, engineering audit
• Police say prior to launch of e-challan system, citywide speed limit for cars, motorcycles, etc was 30km/h
• In first phase, 60km/h limit set for cars, bikes and LTVs on Sharea Faisal
• Many believe top speed on city’s main artery is ‘ok for bikers but too slow for cars’
KARACHI: The newly introduced automated e-ticketing system appears to have been launched in haste as traffic authorities have issued hundreds of challans for speeding, but they are yet to set the speed limit for vehicles on major thoroughfares, it emerged on Tuesday.
Last week, authorities had installed speed limit signs on Sharea Faisal, despite the fact that the traffic police had already issued 1,967 tickets for speeding within the first week (from Oct 27 to Nov 3) of the launch of the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (Tracs).
The traffic police said they are in the process of fixing speed limits for vehicles on different arteries in the metropolis and in the first phase they set 60 kilometres per hour (km/h) on Sharea Faisal for all cars, motorbikes and light transport vehicles (LTVs) and 30 km/h for heavy transport vehicles (HTVs).
DIG Traffic Pir Mohammed Shah conceded that at present “road-specific speed limits” were not notified.
“A comprehensive road safety and engineering audit including assessment of road geometry, access points, pedestrian activity, and traffic flow is under way,” he told Dawn. “Once the audit is completed, revised and road-specific speed limits will be notified.”
He said that currently a uniform, but interim, speed limit is in place for all roads in the metropolis.
“At present, the citywide speed limit for HTVs is 60 km/h, while for cars, motorcycles and LTV it is 30 km/h,” he said. However, he did not know when this speed limit had been fixed or whether it had ever been revised.
Asked as to how fines were imposed over speeding violation, the DIG claims: “Limits were displayed from the day 1 through digital boards on all digital streamers across the city.”
 
 

DIG defends speed limit on signal-free Sharea Faisal
People using Sharea Faisal for their daily commute are expressing their surprise over the speed limit of 60 km/h, saying the road is almost signal free from Hotel Metropole traffic intersection to Karachi Airport.
Many people are of the view that the speed limit makes sense for motorcyclists, but for cars, 60 km/h is too slow on a signal-free road.
A senior official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn that Sharea Faisal is used for VVIP traffic and vehicles part of their motorcade drive at the minimum speed of 100 km/h.
“The speed limit should have been 80 km/h for LTVs and cars and 60 km/h for motorbikes,” he said.
However, the DIG Traffic told Dawn the speed limit was fixed keeping in view road safety, and not traffic flow alone.
He said although Sharea Faisal now functions as a signal-free corridor, “it remains a mixed-traffic urban artery, with multiple entry/exit points, pedestrian activity at certain locations, service lanes, and merging traffic from side roads”.
“Higher speed will significantly increase the likelihood and severity of accidents,” he said.
He believed that the 60 km/h limit was in line with “international standards for urban expressways where pedestrian and mixed-use interactions still exist”.
“Our goal is to maintain smooth traffic movement while prioritising the safety of commuters, motorcyclists and pedestrians,” DIG Shah said.
He said that the 30 km/h speed limit for heavy vehicles was due to their “size, braking distance and impact force”, which posed a significantly higher risk at high speeds.
“Even at night, Sharea Faisal continues to have private traffic, motorcyclists, and ride-hailing vehicles, and any high-speed accident involving a heavy vehicle can be catastrophic,” he said.

Beneath its glaciers and granite are traces of rare earth elements. At a time when nations are racing to secure supplies of lithium, cobalt and rare earths, the northern frontier could emerge as a regional hub for high-value mineral processing. With its road link to China, developing internal network, new international airport, hydropower generation potential and a growing pool of educated, enterprising youth, GB is well-positioned for investment.
Processing rare earth elements, however, is capital intensive. Challenges ranging from technology to environmental management can only be overcome via extensive investment, expertise and regulation. But opaque governance hinders the attempt and GB continues to exist under a colonial-style legal order that denies investors protection and local communities their rights — made worse due to the region’s unsettled status.
GB does not enjoy constitutional status in Pak­istan and is governed through executive orders that can be changed through bureaucratic rules of business. The current law, the Gilgit-Baltistan Governance Order 2018, was notified and proclaimed as a step towards empowerment, but in reality, as noted by the Supreme Court, it was designed to roll back the limited powers that were granted through 2009 Order to enhance federal control.
The 2018 Order concentrates decision-making in a single office, the Pakistani prime minister who chairs the Gilgit-Baltistan Council. Article 60 of the Order gives the PM exclusive power to legislate on all major subjects, including specific minerals, industries, electricity and investment policy. He can appoint and remove judges of the superior judiciary. For minerals like rare earths — linked directly to defence and high-technology supply chains — clarity of law and jurisdiction is vital. No serious investor will risk capital in a region where rights are undefined, courts are powerless, and laws can be changed at whim.
 
 

The Council has been reduced to an advisory body with no binding authority. Article 118 states that GB’s courts cannot question the validity of the Order. The local judiciary is mostly nominated, which turns it into an arm of the executive. In practice, the PM can override the GB Assembly, issue new regulations, or amend the Order at will, enjoying blanket immunity while doing so. This is hardly self-government; it is a continuation of the colonial model.
For the mining industry, the red flags are obvious: the governing law can be repealed or replaced without warning; contracts have no guarantee by empowered judicial protection; community compensation and environmental standards depend entirely on federal discretion; residents have no enforceable claim to royalties or employment; and no credible global company will invest in an area with such legal flaws.
By clinging to this defective system designed to control, Pakistan is sabotaging its own strategic interest. Instead of inviting investment through transparency and rule of law, an image of centralised control and uncertainty is projected. The Supreme Court saw this coming, and in January 2019, it delivered a landmark judgement directing that the 2018 Order be replaced with the consensus draft Gilgit-Baltistan Governance Reforms Order, 2019, that provides the very framework that both investors and citizens need.
It introduces a full chapter on fundamental rights: equality before law, freedom of speech and movement, property protection, and access to justice. Any law inconsistent with these rights is void. It defines a citizen of GB as someone domiciled or resident there, ensuring that only locals benefit from land and employment rights. Most importantly, it gives the Supreme Court final oversight. No amendment or repeal can take effect until it is placed before the court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution for review. This safeguard creates permanence and predictability for the investors.
The 2019 draft also establishes an independent higher judiciary and strengthens the GB Assembly’s role in social and economic legislation. It is not full provincial status, but it is a meaningful step towards rule-based governance. It grants GB full equality with Pakistani citizens, an independent judiciary with recourse to the Supreme Court and strong local governance.

A legal trap blocks the promise of prosperity that lies in the mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan.

Rare earth exploration and processing are capital-intensive ventures with long payback periods. Investors demand stable laws and independent courts. Without these, Pakistan risks losing billions in potential investment to other countries that offer legal security and transparency. At the same time, GB’s people risk repeating the history of extraction without benefit, their environment degraded, and their youth left unemployed. The 2018 Order denies them a share in their own resources. It denies Pakistan, too, the credibility it needs to partner with global technology and energy firms. The Supreme Court’s 2019 framework offers a practical and lawful way out for both investors and the residents of GB.
The court made it clear that adopting this Order does not prejudice the Kashmir dispute; it simply ensures justice and good governance. The only obstacle now is political hesitation and an inherited mindset of control.
GB’s mountains hold the minerals that could propel Pakistan into a high-tech future, yet its governance is reminiscent of a colonial past. The 2018 Order is legally weak, politically outdated, and economically self-defeating. If Pakistan truly wants to unlock its rare earth potential, it must replace this relic with the Supreme Court-approved 2019 Governance Reforms Order. Only then will investors see a predictable legal environment and the people of GB the justice they have long been denied. The world is racing towards clean energy and advanced technology. Pakistan cannot afford to stand aside. The choice is stark: bury the colonial order or bury the region’s promise.
It is time for the country’s major political parties each governing provinces, and some sharing power at the centre to act. The people of GB have waited too long for dignity and inclusion. The 2019 draft is already approved by the Supreme Court; what remains is the will to implement it. Ignoring it would not only betray the region but also squander Pakistan’s strategic and economic future.

The once all-powerful leader who governed Bangladesh with an iron fist for 15 long years — in the second stretch of her rule — and eliminated opposition with brute force, was driven out of power last year by a people’s movement. The disgraced leader who fled the country has now been convicted and sentenced to death for committing “crimes against humanity” though the sentence may never be implemented.
Such is the irony of history that the deposed leader was convicted by the same special tribunal which she had created to persecute her rivals. Some half a dozen political leaders, many of whom had served in previous administrations, were executed after dubious trials. Thousands of people were disappeared or thrown into dungeons for years. She retained power through controversial elections and had virtually established a one-party state.
But ultimately, the coercive power of the state could not withstand the power of the people. The ending was steeped in blood. A UN report said up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the 2024 protests, most from gunfire by security forces; it cited evidence that it was official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters and sympathisers. But even such a display of repression could not save her from losing power.

Ultimately, the coercive power of the state could not withstand the power of the people.

She might have saved her life by fleeing the country but could not escape the criminal proceedings conducted in her absence. After months of being tried in absentia, a three-member International Crimes Tribunal pronounced her guilty on several charges including incitement, orders to kill and inaction to prevent atrocities as she oversaw a crackdown on anti-government protesters last year.
Announcing the verdict in a courtroom packed with the relatives of the victims, the tribunal said the “accused prime minister committed crimes against humanity by her order to use drones, helicopters and lethal weapons” against the people. Sheikh Hasina said that the tribunal was a “politically motivated charade”. Her former home minister has also been convicted.
The UN human rights office described the sentencing as “an important moment for victims” but said Sheikh Hasina should not have been sentenced to death. “We have been calling for perpetrators — including individuals in positions of command and leadership — to be held accountable in accordance with international standards,” said a UN spokesperson, adding: “We … regret the imposition of the death penalty, which we oppose in all circumstances.”
 
 

But Muhammad Yunus, the head of the provisional government of Bangladesh has defended the convictions saying it reaffirmed the principle that “no one, regardless of power, is above the law”. He called the verdict “vital, if insufficient, justice” to the thousands affected during the crackdown, including the families of those killed during the uprising.
This is the first time in Bangladesh that a former prime minister has been sentenced to death by the court though the country has seen some leaders meeting a violent end while in power. Among them was Sheikh Hasina’s father and Bangladesh’s founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He was assassinated along with most of his family members on Aug 15, 1975, by a group of Bangladesh Army personnel who invaded his residence as part of a coup d’état. Sheikh Hasina escaped death as she was out of the country at that time. She lived in India for some years before returning to Bangladesh in the 1980s after being elected to head the Awami League. She was elected as prime minister for the first time in 1996 after the ouster of Gen Ershad’s government. But after the end of her first stint, she had to wait for almost a decade to return to power and then she stayed put for 15 long years.
One of the major reasons for her dictatorial control was the remarkable economic progress achieved by Bangladesh during that period. From a basket case, Bangladesh became an international success story with the fastest economic growth rate in South Asia. In the Human Development Index too, Bangladesh did very well as compared to other underdeveloped countries. This new prosperity and economic potential encouraged Sheikh Hasina to consolidate her authoritarian stranglehold, as she stocked state institutions with party loyalists.
But she failed to see the growing political unrest that was simmering beneath the surface. Her government crushed all voices of protest. Protests broke out in 2013 against the execution of some political leaders for alleged collaboration with the Pakistan military during the 1971 war. The protest was crushed with the full power of the state. The protest was a warning to her authoritarian rule but instead of heeding it, she consolidated more power and started building a personality cult around her father. Life-size portraits and sculptures of herself and Sheikh Mujibur Rehman adorned the capital’s streets and city squares.
The rigged elections of January 2024, when Sheikh Hasina won her fifth consecutive term in office, heightened political discontent in the country. The Awami League claimed a two-thirds majority in the elections, which had been boycotted by the opposition. Many of the remaining seats had also been won by ruling party members standing as independent candidates. The seething political discontent turned into a mass movement in July 2024 when students took to the streets to demand the removal of government job quotas for the descendants of those who participated in the 1971 independence movement. Soon, the movement brought down the government, with Sheikh Hasina fleeing the country.
The conviction and death sentence for the fugitive leader has once again brought Bangladesh into the spotlight. The tribunal’s judgement has heightened the prevailing tension in the country, which has not yet fully recovered from last year’s political upheaval. It is unlikely that India will extradite its trusted ally. Sheikh Hasina had virtually turned Bangladesh into a satellite state of India. Her ouster came as a huge geopolitical setback to New Delhi. The growing relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan under the new administration in Dhaka have added to the ire of the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi. Any Indian attempt to destabilise Bangladesh can have far-reaching geopolitical consequences.

At its meeting, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on IT and Telecom directed the Pakistan Telecommu­nica­tion Authority (PTA) to conduct comprehensive nationwide surveys and take im­­­mediate practical steps to ensure fast and reliable internet services across the country.
Committee chairman Syed Amin ul Haq instructed the relevant officials to conduct special surveys through PTA teams to assess the quality of internet services being provided to the public, and to present a detailed report at the committee’s next meeting.
Briefing the committee, PTA officials said that 273 MHz spectrum was currently available in the country, but it was insufficient to meet the rising demand for high-speed internet. They added that the government plans to auction 600 MHz of spectrum across various bands, with the process now moving towards the rollout of 5G.

Telecom sector regulator ordered to conduct comprehensive surveys and present a detailed report

While reviewing progress of the Islamabad IT Park project, the committee was informed that the consultant’s contract had expired on Oct 31. The contractor has initiated the renewal process, which is expected to be finalised shortly.
The NA panel emphasised that the project must meet the timeline set by the prime minister — Dec 31, 2025.
Regarding the Karachi IT Park, the committee noted that the project remains in its initial stages and that the contract is expected to be awarded soon.
A delegation from South Korea is scheduled to visit on December 2 to finalise the remaining matters related to the contract award.
The committee directed officials to award the contract without further delay so that work can begin promptly, emphasising that the project must be completed within the stipulated two-year period.
The panel was also briefed by the managing director of the National Tele­com­munication Corporation (NTC) on the company’s future initiatives, including secure mobile connectivity for government officials and the establishment of new data centres in Karachi and Quetta.
The panel was told that these initiatives are part of a broader strategic plan aimed at enhancing cybersecurity and expanding reliable IT and telecom services for public sector institutions.
The committee appreciated NTC’s performance and acknowledged that the organisation’s ongoing projects were satisfactory. It advised NTC to refrain from downsizing and instead adopt a rightsizing approach to ensure no employee is laid off, and that staff members are appropriately adjusted and placed where their services are genuinely required.
The committee deferred the Preven­tion of Obscenity and Indecency in Digi­tal Media Bill, 2025, to the next meeting due to the absence of the bill’s mover.
Published in Dawn, November 19th, 2025</p><small>2025-11-19 03:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955958/gaza-resolution' target='_blank'><strong>Gaza resolution</strong></a><br><p>THOUGH the UN Security Council has passed a US-drafted resolution that basically endorses President Donald Trump’s ‘peace plan’ for Gaza, the document’s ambiguities, and Palestinian objections to many of its stated aims, means that it is unlikely to bring long-term peace to the occupied territories. Moreover, those countries — including Pakistan — that are considering contributing troops to the international stabilisation force that the Trumpian scheme envisages, must be clear on its mandate. While the UNSC has approved it, it is very much an American plan.
For example, the ISF will not act as a UN peacekeeping force; it will work in ‘consultation’ with Israel and Egypt. Moreover, the language about a path to Palestinian statehood is ambiguous. On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister has reaffirmed his commitment to blocking a Palestinian state. The framers of this resolution, and the supporters of this plan, must be asked how they expect to reconcile these divergent positions. China and Russia abstained while Pakistan supported the US resolution. Hamas, meanwhile, has been critical of the resolution, while questioning the ISF’s neutrality.
 
 

The resolution calls for the ISF to demilitarise Gaza, while the US ambassador to the UN has said the ISF will “support a region free from Hamas’ grip”. These statements clearly indicate that foreign troops will be deployed in Gaza to engage and disarm Hamas. Pakistan, and other Muslim states that are reportedly considering troops for the mission, must therefore be clear about what is expected of them. Pakistan’s ambassador to the UN has said that disarmament should be carried out “through a negotiated political process”, while also observing that further clarity was needed about all aspects of the plan.
Without this clarity, and without debate in parliament, Pakistan should not commit troops. We must not partake in an Israeli-American exercise to disarm Palestinian resistance movements and help perpetuate the occupation. However, if the stated purpose of the ISF is to facilitate Gaza’s reconstruction and rehabilitation, and most importantly, to protect Palestinians from Israel’s savage assaults, which continue despite the ‘ceasefire’, then the contribution of troops can be considered.
It would have been much better for the UN to have taken the lead in this peacekeeping mission, instead of simply endorsing the American plan. While it is hoped that Gaza’s long nightmare is over, and the Palestinians in general can restart their journey towards a sovereign state, we must not hold our breath. The main reason for pessimism is Israel’s lack of commitment to peace, and its historical disregard for Palestinian lives. We should know quite soon whether the effort is genuine, or the plan just endorsed by the UN is another smokescreen that will strengthen the occupation, this time with international sanction, and Arab and Muslim buy-in.

In an appeal moved under Article 185 of the Constitution, Salman Akram Raja, who is also PTI’s Secretary General, stated that the IHC while disposing of his contempt petition relied solely on oral assertion of the Adiala jail superintendent regarding alleged compliance with previous judicial directions.
The petitioner pleaded that the IHC failed to call for the relevant re­­cord to verify with the jail authorities about the implementation of ea­­r­­lier directions for making arran­g­e­ments for regular meetings with Imran Khan at the Adiala jail. This constitutes a miscarriage of justice and a failure to exercise constitutio­nal jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution, the petition contended.
The petitioner argued that IHC failed to appreciate that its own previous judgment of March 24 had conferred a clear and unambiguous direction regarding visitation rights of the founding PTI chairman with his legal team and nominated coordinators, and that executive authorities were legally bound to comply with judicial orders unless modified or set aside by a superior forum.

IHC erred by disposing of case without looking at record, says Salman Akram Raja

The right of a prisoner to consult and communicate with his legal counsel is an integral part of Articles 4, 9, 10, and 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantee protection of law, liberty, fair trial, and due process, the petitioner stated, adding the high court while disposing of the matter on administrative grounds failed to safeguard these fundamental and inviolable rights.
The high court misapplied Rule 265 of the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978, without examining whether its rigid application is consistent with constitutional guarantees. These rules, being subordinate legislation, cannot override or restrict fundamental rights or judicial orders issued under Article 199 of the Constitution, the appeal argued.
Moreover, the high court also failed to appreciate that the administrative discretion of jail authorities is subject to judicial supervision, the petition argued, adding by directing strict adherence to the jail manual without enforcing previous judicial orders, the high court effectively allowed executive non-compliance to override judicial authority, contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers.
The petition contended that the high court erred in law as it dispo­s­­ed of the petition summarily, without examining the record of multip­le prior instances of non-compliance brought on the file, thereby failing to apply judicial mind and rendering the order mechanical, per­­functory, and devoid of reasoning.
Thus, the high court order resul­ted in a grave miscarriage of justice, as it deprived the petitioner and PTI founder of their rights to effective legal representation, consultation, and coordination in ongoing legal proceedings across the country.
The order also frustrates the principle of judicial supremacy, as it allows executive authorities to neutralize the effect of court orders through oral statements, the petitioner regretted.
The high court also failed to exercise its supervisory and coercive jurisdiction vested under Article 204 of the Constitution to ensure implementation of its previous orders and to hold the respondents accountable for continued defiance. Instead, it chose to dispose of the petition, and rendering the earlier judicial directions ineffective.
The Supreme Court has consistently held that when the high court declines to exercise jurisdiction vested in it by law, or misinterprets the scope of its powers under Article 199, such refusal constitutes an error of law justifying the grant of leave to appeal, the petition maintained.

He said that Pakistan was home to numerous sacred religious sites for the Sikhs, where members of the Sikh community from all over the world came to perform their religious rituals and Pakistan ensured their hospitality.
The prime minister met President of Sikhs of America Jasdeep Singh who called on him, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The meeting was also attended by Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar and Pakistani-American businessman Sajid Tarar.
 
 

The prime minister said that it was a matter of pride that Pakistan was ensuring the maintenance of Sikh community’s sacred sites and Gurdwaras, as well as providing all possible facilities to them.
He said the government would provide more facilities to Sikh pilgrims from around the world.
 
 

While referring to the Pakistani diaspora, the prime minister said that they were playing a vital role in the country’s development, prosperity and bringing global recognition to Pakistan.
Jasdeep Singh thanked the prime minister and the government of Pakistan for their hospitality and the warm reception extended to Sikh pilgrims in Pakistan.

The draft includes a sweep of options on the most difficult issues, reflecting the gulf between the nearly 200 nations in Belem and the work still ahead to refine a final compromise.
The nine-page “Global Mutirao” document — a reference to an Indigenous concept of uniting toward a common goal — came after Brazil on Monday urged delegates to work day and night to produce an agreement by midweek.
 
 

The text leaves open a wide range of possibilities on the flashpoint issues in Belem — trade measures, finance for poorer nations, and the global inadequacy of carbon-cutting goals.
But the quick turnaround of a draft on these thorny points suggested the COP30 presidency was confident it could soon have an outcome, observers said.
“It represents a steady progression from the previous iteration and is likely one of the earliest releases of such a clean text in recent COP history,” said Li Shuo, a climate analyst at the Asia Society Policy Institute.
 
 

The draft reflects the stark division between a coalition wanting a “roadmap” on a fossil fuel phase-out, and a bloc led by oil-producing countries opposing any such effort.
It proposes an optional “workshop” to discuss “low carbon solutions,” or a high-level ministerial roundtable on pathways to help countries “progressively overcome their dependency on fossil fuels.” A third option proposes no text at all.
The draft also raises the possibility of assessing national climate pledges annually, instead of every five years, to assess global progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions more frequently.

“Solar generation is increasing, but this does not have a significant impact on the grid,” Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) CEO Rehan Akhtar said while testifying before the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
Working under the Power Division, the CPPA is the key player responsible for the procurement of electricity from various sources and delivering to all distribution companies and handling their commercial affairs.
He said the energy costs had led to a shift to solar power. “They are now consuming more due to solar availability but their offtake from the national grid has not changed. Their withdrawal from the grid is almost stable. They are drawing the same quantities they were drawing earlier,” he said, adding, however, that the same could not be predicted about the future.

Net metering contribution jumped 173pc to 726m units in 2024

These comments came during the course of a public hearing on CPPA’s request for rebasing of power purchase price (PPP) with effect from January 2026 under the government’s policy directives.
The CPPA presented five different assumptions about the tariff revisions with effect from Jan 1, 2026. These assumptions presented a total average PPP price ranging between Rs25.95 per unit in the best case and Rs26.53 per unit in the worst case of currency devaluation to Rs300-310 from the existing Rs280-290 per dollar.
The existing PPP for FY26 stands at Rs25.98 per unit, showing a general sign of stability.
It was reported that net metering contribution had increased by 173pc to 726 million units in 2024 compared to 266m units in 2023, even though power distribution companies (Discos) showed 1pc growth. On the other hand, K-Electric offtake from the grid increased by 9.4pc as it started drawing the full 2,050MW.
 
 

Nepra was told that fuel costs were expected to remain generally stable with a minor risk of a 5pc increase in global prices in a worst-case scenario. Likewise, given foreign exchange reserve vulnerabilities, local currency had been estimated to increase by Rs10 in the first six months and Rs10 in the second half of the next calendar year in one case only. Interest rates were projected at 11pc for the first half and 10.5pc for the second half.
Industrial consumers bemoaned expensive energy costs, making their products uncompetitive. They said the industry was still cross-subsidising other consumers to the tune of Rs131bn, and all tariff reductions announced by the government had already vanished.
They said the CPPA’s calculation that demand will increase was inconsistent with ground realities, because consumption was going down because of high energy prices, the closing of industries and the shift to solar power.

Bunkering at a port is the process of supplying ships with fuel (such as marine gas oil, heavy fuel oil, or alternative fuels like LNG) for propulsion and onboard machinery.
It is a critical, tightly regulated operation that involves transferring fuel from land-based facilities, tanker trucks, or bunker vessels to the receiving ship’s fuel tanks.
Maritime Affairs Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Tuesday said the initiative was launched to accelerate the modernisation of port services and a broader upgrade of Pakistan’s maritime infrastructure.
He said the introduction of regulated bunkering would fill a long-standing gap in Karachi Port’s service offering, enabling it to compete more effectively with established bunkering hubs in the region and beyond.

Vitol begins refuelling ships with its barge at Karachi Port as Cnergyico starts supplying low-sulphur fuel

The minister said the availability of safe, reliable, and efficiently managed bunkering facilities is expected to attract more international shipping lines to Karachi, particularly those seeking streamlined port calls and predictable service standards.
Earlier, there was no refuelling facility for commercial shipping in the country, and ships had to obtain fuel from Fujairah or Singapore.
The fuel supply and bunkering facility will be executed by Vitol, a Swiss-based Dutch multinational energy and commodity trading company, through its barge.
Meanwhile, the Karachi-based Cnergyico refinery has started producing world-class ‘very low sulphur fuel oil’ (VLSFO) for ship refuelling.
The facility has also become essential as India has banned ships that enter or leave its ports from calling at any Pakistani port.
Sources at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) said that the availability of bunkering facilities would increase vessel traffic at the port, thereby improving revenue too.
Meanwhile, the maritime minister said that the move would translate into higher foreign-exchange earnings through port fees, marine services, and ancillary commercial activity such as repairs, supplies and maritime logistics.
Mr Chaudhry added that the new service would enhance Pakistan’s visibility in the international maritime market by demonstrating the country’s commitment to modern, environmentally responsible and globally competitive port management.
He said compliance with international standards covering fuel quality, safety procedures, documentation and transparency was essential for building confidence among ship-owners and global trading companies.
The minister said the first phase of operations would begin in collaboration with one of the world’s leading energy trading houses, which will conduct bunkering at Karachi Port in accordance with internationally certified practices.
He said the venture is expected to expand as domestic refineries supply larger quantities of refined fuel meeting global specifications, a development he described as a direct benefit to the national exchequer.
The minister noted that KPT had assessed existing bunkering practices, reviewed global procedures, drafted new documentation and engaged stakeholders to bring the service online.
He said the milestone reinforces KPT’s ambition to operate as a leading regional hub and signals the government’s intention to continue expanding port capabilities in line with international benchmarks.

“A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal,” said an update from the CDN, whose network handles around a fifth of web traffic, posted at 7:42pm.
It later said that some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. “We are working on a fix to resolve this, and continuing to monitor for any further issues,” it added.
In a subsequent statement, Cloudfare said services were currently operating normally and it was no longer observing elevated errors or latency across the network.
“Our engineering teams continue to closely monitor the platform and perform a deeper investigation into the earlier disruption, but no configuration changes are being made at this time.
“At this point, it is considered safe to re-enable any Cloudflare services that were temporarily disabled during the incident. We will provide a final update once our investigation is complete,” it said.
“Earlier today, we failed our customers and the broader internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us,” chief technology officer Dane Knecht wrote on X, adding that the problem had since been resolved.
“In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made.” The company said earlier there had been “a spike in unusual traffic” to one of its services.
 






The incident marked the latest hit to major online services. An outage of Amazon’s cloud service last month caused global turmoil as thousands of popular websites and apps, including Snapchat and Reddit, were inaccessible due to the disruption.
Cloudflare — whose shares were down about five per cent in premarket trading — runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks.
Earlier today, disruptions in internet access were widely reported as Cloudflare reported experiencing issues in its global network.
In an update on the situation posted at 6:09pm, it said: “We have made changes that have allowed Cloudflare Access and WARP to recover. Error levels for Access and WARP users have returned to pre-incident rates. We have re-enabled WARP access in London. We are continuing to work towards restoring other services.”
It later said it was continuing to work on restoring service for application services customers.
Earlier, the service provider said it was “aware of and investigating an issue” that was impacting multiple customers with widespread 500 errors, along with the Cloudflare dashboard and API application programming interface also failing.
NetBlocks, a global internet watchdog, also said that a wide range of online services were experiencing disruptions due to a technical issue affecting Cloudflare’s global network. It added that the incident was not related to “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
 






Downdetector showed that user reports from Pakistan indicated problems with Cloudflare, with complaints beginning around 4:10 pm. Problems were also reported with OpenAI, Amazon Web Services and Facebook.
Social media platform X was also down for thousands of users in the United States and worldwide, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.
There were more than 11,500 reports of issues with the social media platform as of 6:41am ET, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources.
It was not immediately clear whether the outages were related.
X and Cloudflare did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority said it was monitoring the global outage and was in contact with global platforms and local operators. It added that it would continue to observe the situation until services were fully restored.
Cloudflare had also reported a “widespread outage” in June 2022 and several popular websites were unreachable.
A DNS server is an address book that matches a website’s name (e.g. http://google.com) to its real IP (a set of numbers). For nationwide use, you need DNS servers that can handle a lot of traffic and respond fast.

Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh toppled Sheikh Hasina’s government in August last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
Fazl is currently on a visit to the country and called for stron­ger ties, telling a large religious gathering that a shared “unity of faith was a stronger bond between the two nations that cannot be abolished”.
Addressing a gathering of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam members today at Dhaka’s Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre as the chief guest with several other Bengali political parties in attendance, Fazl said: “Pakistan wants Bangladesh’s prosperity and stability, has forgotten the bitter memories of the past.”
He reiterated that the people of Pakistan had “forgotten the old bitter memories”, adding that now “a new future has to be carved”.
The JUI-F chief added Pakistan saw Bangladesh as a “brother”. “We were one, and God willing, we will remain one. Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh will be strengthened by the spirit of goodwill,” he added.
Fazl added that Islam is a religion of peace and security, but the United States is spreading chaos across the world. He maintained that internal divisions among Muslims give enemies an opportunity to attack.
“Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Pakistan has always worked for the protection of the rights of all people, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, beyond sectarian and denominational lines.”
On the occasion, prominent political and social leaders from various political and religiopolitical parties were also present.
“Muslim Ummah cannot be divided, and no worldly power can break these bonds,” reiterated the JUI-F chief.</p><small>2025-11-18 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/182213556e3f69d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955843/fm-dar-meets-russias-putin-chinas-li-qiang-on-sidelines-of-sco-moscow-summit' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar meets Russia’s Putin, China’s Li Qiang on sidelines of SCO Moscow summit</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday met with senior Russian and Chinese leadership at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of Government summit, according to the Foreign Office (FO).
The SCO is holding its Council of Heads of Government summit in Moscow from November 17 to 18. Taking place under Russia’s rotating presidency, the high-level meeting follows the landmark Tianjin summit three months earlier and comes at a pivotal moment for Eurasian economic connectivity in a shifting global order.
At the heads of government gathering, Dar met Russian President Vladimir Putin, along with other SCO heads of state and senior officials. In a post on X, the FO said that Putin welcomed leaders to the summit in the Russian capital.
He also “emphasised the importance of strengthening regional economic cooperation under the SCO, highlighting its role as a key platform for connectivity, stability, and mutually beneficial development across the region”.
 






Dar also met Chinese Premier Li Qiang, where the pair “reaffirmed the ‘all-weather’ Pakistan-China strategic partnership, reviewed bilateral and multilateral cooperation — especially within the SCO — and praised the Shanghai Spirit principles guiding regional collaboration”.
The post added that the FMs exchanged views on global issues and agreed to “maintain real-time engagement moving forward.”
 






Dar also had a bilateral meeting with Russian Deputy PM Alexei Overchuk on the sidelines of the summit, the FO said in another social media post.
“The two leaders undertook a substantive review of the full gamut of Pakistan–Russia relations, with a focus on strengthening cooperation across political, economic, energy, connectivity, agricultural, industrial, educational and people-to-people areas through institutionalised mechanisms,” the FO wrote.
“DPM Overchuk recalled his recent visits and noted Pakistan’s potential as a regional hub for transit and connectivity,” the post added. “Both leaders also exchanged views on key regional & global developments and reaffirmed their commitment to enhanced cooperation at bilateral and multilateral fora, including the UN and SCO.”
 






Additionally, Dar met Russian FM Sergei Lavrov on the sidelines of the Moscow summit, with photographs showing the pair hugging each other upon meeting.

During his address earlier today, Dar said the SCO was “well-placed” to promote regional cooperation in the humanitarian field to deal with emergencies.
“Excellencies, the agenda before us, spanning trade, economy, culture and humanitarian cooperation, is the basis of a mature, future-oriented SCO,” FM Dar said during his speech in Moscow. “Pakistan views them as interconnected threads in a single, stronger fabric of regional partnership.”
 






He said that the Tianjin summit was a clear signal that “our organisation is evolving with the resolve to harness the full spectrum of our collective potential by focusing on economic integration through expanded trade collaboration, improved infrastructure connectivity, investment partnerships, advancement of cross-border trade corridors, and the promotion of digital economic development”.
The SCO, Dar highlighted, has established a foundation for sustainable economic progress throughout the SCO space.
“Pakistan has developed a technology-driven, proactive disaster management system,” the FM pointed out, adding that the country is “keen” to organise simulation exercises with SCO partners to bolster disaster preparedness across the region.
“Excellencies, our discussions at Tianjin underscored the need to modernise our outreach. The value of our observer and partner states is immense,” Dar said.
He added, “Let us move from a model of passive observation to one of real engagement. Let us invite them to participate not as guests on the periphery but as stakeholders in specific project-based initiatives that align with their expertise and our collective goals.
This way, Dar emphasised, “we can create a flexible, multi-tiered model of cooperation that would benefit all”.
“An important feature of the modernisation of the SCO is the introduction of English as a working language,” FM Dar pointed out. “Let us move forward from political declarations and establish a translation unit. The SCO can attract more partners and achieve wider goal influence with this only one step.”
“Excellencies, to translate the momentum of Tianjin into tangible progress, we suggest greater focus on practical, cross-cutting initiatives,” Dar said.
 






‘Youth empowerment of foremost importance’
Pakistan, according to Dar’s address, has two proposals: operationalise financial tools for the promotion of trade and economy, and build human capital.
“While our efforts continue to make available diversified financial tools such as the SCO Development Bank and development and investment funds for our economies and businesses, we must aggressively utilise the tools already at our disposal, like the SCO Interbank Consortium, to finance connectivity and technical collaboration projects,” he said.
With respect to building human capital, Dar said the ultimate resource of the SCO is “our people”.
“The empowerment of our youth is of foremost importance,” he stressed.
 
 

“We must invest in them directly. Pakistan, therefore, advocates for a significant expansion of the SCO university network into a consortium for applied knowledge,” the minister said.
He added that this would facilitate not just student exchanges but also joint research programmes in critical fields such as information technology, artificial intelligence, water resource management, agriculture, and telemedicine while addressing common challenges with shared intellect.
“Excellencies, Pakistan is committed to being a proactive and creative partner in the journey,” Dar highlighted. “Let us build an SCO that is a launchpad for shared success, where every connection made, commercial, cultural, or intellectual, strengthens the whole. Let us ensure that the legacy of our work is a region more innovative, more interconnected, and more integrated.”
A day earlier, FM Dar was received by the Russian Deputy FM Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Director of State Protocol Aleksander Prusov, Deputy Director of the Second Asia Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Surovtsev and Pakistan Embassy officers on his arrival to Moscow.
 






Earlier this year, the SCO Council of Heads of State summit was held in Tianjin, China from August 31 to September 1, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif raised the Indus Waters Treaty issue.
He also announced in September that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date for it.

In a statement, the military’s media affairs said that the operations were carried out between November 15 and 16, adding that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The first IBO was conducted by security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said.
In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan district, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said.
In a separate statement later in the day, the ISPR said two IBOs took place between November 16-17 in Bajaur district and Bannu district, killing 11 and 12 terrorists, respectively.
It added that terrorist ringleader Sajjad alias Abuzar was also killed in the Bajaur IBO.
The ISPR said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other “Indian-sponsored” terrorists found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus.
He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces. “Under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are achieving great successes against terrorism,” he said in a statement.
“We are determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,” he said.
 






Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-18 16:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/18182104907866e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955853/after-unsc-vote-on-gaza-plan-netanyahu-calls-for-hamass-expulsion-from-the-region' target='_blank'><strong>After UNSC vote on Gaza plan, Netanyahu calls for Hamas’s expulsion from the region</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday called for Hamas to be expelled from the region, a day after the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) endorsed United States President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan that offers the Palestinian group amnesty.
Netanyahu publicly endorsed the plan during a White House visit in late September. However, his latest remarks appear to show that there are differences with the US on the path forward. Hamas has also objected to parts of the plan.
Diplomats say privately that entrenched positions on both the Israeli and Hamas sides have made it difficult to advance the plan, which lacks specific timelines or enforcement mechanisms. Still, it has received strong international backing, including from the Arab and Muslim countries that worked on it.
Netanyahu on Tuesday published a series of posts on X in response to the UN vote. In one post, he applauded Trump and in another wrote the Israeli government believes the plan would lead to peace and prosperity because it calls for the “full demilitarisation, disarmament, and deradicalisation of Gaza”.
 






“Israel extends its hand in peace and prosperity to all of our neighbours” and calls on neighbouring countries to “join us in expelling Hamas and its supporters from the region”, he said.
Asked what the prime minister had meant by expelling Hamas, a spokesperson said that it would mean “ensuring there is no Hamas in Gaza as outlined in the 20-point plan, and Hamas has no ability to govern the Palestinian people inside the Gaza Strip”.
 






Plan does not call for Hamas’s expulsion
Trump’s 20-point plan includes a clause saying that Hamas members “who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty”, and members who wish to leave will be given safe passage to third countries.
Another clause says Hamas will agree to not having any role in Gaza’s governance.
There is no clause that explicitly calls for the resistance group to disband or to leave Gaza.
The plan says reforms to the Palestinian Authority may ultimately allow conditions “for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”.
 
 

Ahead of the UN vote, Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel remained opposed to Palestinian statehood after protests by far-right coalition allies over a US-backed statement indicating support for a pathway to Palestinian independence.
Netanyahu also opposes any Palestinian Authority involvement in Gaza.
European and Arab states have said that Gaza must be governed by the Palestinian Authority and that there must be a clear pathway to Palestinian independence.
First step towards peace: Palestinian Authority
The Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, earlier welcomed the vote and has said it is ready to take part in Trump’s plan, which doesn’t outline a clear role for the authority.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin termed the UNSC resolution the “first step in a long road towards peace”.
“That step was needed because we could not embark on anything else before we had a ceasefire,” Shahin told reporters in Manila during a visit to the Philippines.
 


Shahin said there were still other issues that needed to be addressed, including Palestinian self-determination and eventual Palestinian independence, and that the process for implementing Trump’s plan must be governed by international law.
She said that although Trump’s plan alludes to possible Palestinian statehood only after the Palestinian Authority carries out reforms, that issue could be taken up later. “As long as these elements are in there, we’re happy with this first step,” Shahin said.
Multinational force for post-war Gaza
The UNSC resolution authorised a multinational force that Trump’s plan says will be temporarily deployed to Gaza to stabilise the territory.
The resolution’s text also says member states could join a “Board of Peace” that would oversee reconstruction and economic recovery inside Gaza.
Hamas has criticised the resolution as failing to “live up to the demands and political and humanitarian rights” of the Palestinian people, who it said rejected an international guardianship mechanism of Gaza.
 
 

Any international force must only be deployed along Gaza’s borders to monitor the ceasefire and under UN supervision, Hamas said in a statement, warning that such a force would lose its neutrality if it tried to disarm the group.
Reham Owda, a Palestinian political analyst from Gaza, said the Hamas statement should be viewed as an objection, rather than complete rejection, in an attempt to negotiate mechanisms for the international force and the role of the board of peace.
A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas came into effect on October 10 as part of Trump’s multi-phased plan to end Israel’s two-year relentless bombardment.
Israel has partially withdrawn its forces but still controls 53 per cent of Gaza and the sides have accused each other of violations.
Abu Abdallah, a businessman displaced in central Gaza, said Palestinians would support the deployment of international forces if it meant that Israel would fully withdraw its forces.
“Hamas can’t decide our fate alone, but we also don’t want to get rid of one occupation, Israel, and get another international occupation,” he said by phone.
Water provider suspends services after Hamas detains staff member
Separately, a Gaza company that operates water desalination plants serving nearly half of the enclave’s population has stopped operations to protest the detention by Hamas of one of its staff.
Youssef Yassin, a board member of the Abdul Salam Yassin Company, said the move would affect more than 1 million people who normally receive water from the company.

Over 70 trucks that carry water containers across the enclave have also stopped operations, he added, risking further supply disruption after the pipeline network was badly damaged due to Israel’s bombing.
“I know it is catastrophic but protecting our employees is a sacred issue,” Yassin told Reuters.
Yassin said Hamas had given no reason for the arrest late on Monday. Hamas had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday.
Hamas has been gradually reasserting control in areas of Gaza that Israel has withdrawn from as post-war talks over its future grind on. Foreign powers demand the group disarm and leave government but have yet to agree who will replace them.
Israel continues to control around half the Gaza Strip.
The move is a rare show of dissent against Hamas, which has run the Palestinian enclave since 2007.
 
 

Demonstrations briefly erupted in March and April, demanding an end to the war and that Hamas give up power, but fizzled out after a warning that public disorder would not be tolerated.
If the protest by the company persists, it could exacerbate the chronic water crisis in the enclave, which was worsened further by two years of Israel’s siege. Israel stopped all water and electricity supply to Gaza early in the offensive, resuming only a trickle of supplies later.</p><small>2025-11-18 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634272-23-india-backed-terrorists-killed-in-two-kp-ibos-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>23 India-backed terrorists killed in two KP IBOs: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement released by the US Justice Department last Friday, Acting US Attorney in the Eastern District of Texas Jay R Combs identified the woman as 34-year-old Kahkashan Haider Khan.
The Justice Department stated that Haider pleaded guilty to making false statements in relation to international terrorism and was sentenced to 96 months in federal prison by US District Judge Amos L Mazzant III on October 7, 2025.
“We will not allow the United States to be a launching point for terrorist attacks abroad,” said Acting US Attorney Jay R Combs.
“Vigilantly protecting the United States and its interests is inherent in everything we do. This includes aggressively prosecuting those who wrongly believe that they can find safe harbour in the United States while plotting crimes elsewhere.”
FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R Joseph Rothrock said, “The FBI will aggressively investigate individuals planning or taking part in acts of violence in support of terrorism. We take these crimes seriously and will work with our international partners to hold perpetrators accountable.”
According to information presented in court, on February 23, 2023, Haider was interviewed by special agents from the FBI regarding her involvement in the planned fire-bombing of two gas stations in Karachi.
The Justice Department identified Haider, a US citizen and immigrant from Pakistan, as “a member of a separatist movement in Pakistan known as the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which claims grievances against the Pakistani government over the treatment of muhajir immigrants in Pakistan”.
The statement claimed that Haider “served as a recruiter and facilitator of terrorist actions in Pakistan by collecting funds, sending them to Pakistan, and arranging and paying for violent actions in Pakistan”.
The department reported that in January 2023, Haider recruited an individual in Pakistan to conduct fire-bombings on two Punjabi-owned gas stations in Karachi, Pakistan.
Haider discussed multiple aspects of the plan with her co-conspirator in Pakistan, including selecting the target locations, discussing which flammable accelerants to use, where to stage before the attacks, how to escape after the attacks, and arranging for the purchase of two firearms to be used by the attackers to ensure their success, the statement added.
The department claimed that Haider collected money from MQM sympathisers in the United States and wired the funds to Pakistan to pay for the attacks.
The details show that on February 20, 2023, Haider’s co-conspirator in Pakistan sent her photos from news coverage of a fire-bombing of a Karachi gas station caused by attackers throwing something from a vehicle, resulting in six people being burned.
Haider “celebrated the news and told her Pakistani co-conspirator that he would be greatly rewarded for his work. Throughout that day, February 20, 2023, Haider scoured the internet for news in Pakistan regarding the fire-bombing but could find none.”
After approximately one day of searching, she discovered that the photos her co-conspirator sent were from an event that occurred in October 2022. Haider “was furious and accused her co-conspirator of deceit and being a disgrace to the MQM movement”, the Justice Department noted.
On February 23, 2024, FBI special agents interviewed Haider at her home about these events. During the interview, she made multiple false statements about the events and lied about her involvement in the attempted attacks.
Haider denied that she wanted a co-conspirator to commit the fire-bombings in Pakistan. She denied that she was involved in an action in Pakistan that would possibly result in someone’s harm or death.
During her plea hearing in February 2025, she admitted that these were false statements made knowing that the statements were material to a terrorism investigation.</p><small>2025-11-18 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/182032559a511eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955861/pti-leader-shah-mahmood-qureshi-undergoes-successful-gallbladder-surgery-lawyer-says' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi undergoes successful gallbladder surgery, lawyer says</strong></a><br><p>Senior PTI leader and ex-foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi underwent a successful procedure to remove his gallbladder, lawyer Rana Mudassar Umer said on Tuesday.
The senior PTI leader, incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail since 2023, was hospitalised at the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute for gallbladder stone complications on October 31, his daughter Meher Bano said. She added that his condition deteriorated while imprisoned and that surgery was “unavoidable”.
Speaking to Dawn, Umer said Qureshi’s gallbladder was successfully removed during the procedure.
“Shah Mehmood Qureshi will remain under the constant supervision of doctors for a few days,” he stated. “Shah Mehmood Qureshi has appealed to the nation to pray for his speedy recovery.”
Meher Bano also spoke to Dawn about the procedure, saying that the procedure was successful and the PTI leader is currently under observation.
“The size of the stone inside the gallbladder was quite large, so the surgery took longer than usual,” she explained. “[The doctor] performed the surgery successfully in the best possible manner.”
Meher Bano added that Qureshi’s recovery will “take some time”, expressing gratitude to people for their prayers.
Meanwhile, PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser, in a post on X, prayed for Qureshi’s speedy recovery.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi sahib has been enduring innocent imprisonment for the past two years due to his loyalty and steadfastness to Imran Khan’s vision,” he wrote. “The courage, patience, resolve, and spirit with which he has borne this trial set an exemplary standard within him. I salute his steadfastness.”
 






After Qureshi was hospitalised, three former PTI leaders arrived in his hospital room at the start of November to convince him to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’ — a move rebuffed by the ex-FM.
According to Umer, former leaders Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail, and Maulvi Mahmood managed to gain access to Qureshi when he was alone in his room.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-18 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634251-key-judicial-bodies-reconstituted-under-new-framework-after-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Key judicial bodies reconstituted under new framework after 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

The oath-taking ceremony was held a day after PPP’s Rathore was announced as the new AJK premier after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence (VoNC) in the region’s legislative assembly.
The oath was administered by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar at the President’s House in Muzaffarabad. The speaker performed the duty on behalf of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood, who reportedly could not travel to the regional capital owing to his health issues.
Speaking after the oath, Rathore said, “First of all, I thank God from my heart for bestowing this heavy responsibility on my weak shoulders.”
The newly sworn-in premier said fulfilling those duties would not be an “easy task in this extremely difficult era”, but said he believed God gave strength to those entrusted with such tasks.
 


Rathore also thanked President Asif Ali Zardari and his sister Faryal Talpur, saying that owing to them, not only was a “new government established, but the PPP has again become one of the biggest parties” in AJK.
The PPP leader termed AJK a “basecamp” of the freedom movement for Kashmir. “It aims to cultivate this movement and fully play its role in it while staying here,” he said.
The new premier highlighted that another key point was the region’s development and progress. He paid tribute to the martyrs of the freedom movement and the soldiers on the Line of Control.
 
 

Rathore also recalled that in 1975, ex-PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had chosen his father late Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore as a senior minister, and later in 1990, ex-PM Benazir Bhutto chose him as the AJK premier “despite him being a part of a small community in the PPP”.
“And now, in 2025, the party leadership trusted me and sent me into this field,” Rathore added. He went on to affirm that this “relationship of trust based on half a decade” would remain between him and his party.
‘Six months are a test’
PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also spoke on the occasion, urging the people to work together with his party. He also called for the restoration of open courts in the region.
Pointing out that elections were due in AJK in six months, he asked the PPP’s head in the region, Chaudhry Yasin, to start preparing for the polls.
He further assured that the PPP would not run the government from “closed rooms”.
“We will sit among the public, meet them, join their political struggle, and resolve their problems.”
He further stated: “These six months are a test. After this test, we will […] again get the people’s mandate and again lead this government. And we will show the world that when we work together […] when we don’t fight among ourselves, how my Kashmir progresses on the global stage.”
 


The PPP chairman then went on to call Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “coward”, saying that he had been “hiding his face from the world” following the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May. Meanwhile, Bilawal said, Pakistan’s diplomatic standing had improved.
He also slammed Modi over a “conspiracy to undermine the relationship between Pakistan and the people of Azad Kashmir”.
“I want to tell Modi that you lost the war, and God willing, this conspiracy of yours will also be unsuccessful. No one can undermine the relationship between the PPP and the public of Azad Kashmir,” Bilawal added.
Prosperity of AJK’s people among Centre’s priorities: Shehbaz
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif assured newly elected Rathore that the prosperity and progress of the region were among the federal government’s top priorities.

In a phone call, PM Shehbaz conveyed his heartfelt congratulations to Rathore on being chosen as the new premier of AJK, state-run PTV News reported.
“The progress and prosperity of AJK’s people are among the federal government’s priorities,” the prime minister was quoted as saying.
He further assured Rathore that the Centre was determined to work with the AJK government for the “welfare, economic development, prosperity, and peace and security” of the region’s public.
PM Shehbaz pledged that the federal government will provide “every possible cooperation” to the AJK set-up. He also expressed his best wishes to the PM-elect for his tenure.
 






Rathore is AJK’s fourth premier in the last four years, and the 16th since 1975 when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region.
The no-confidence vote against Chaudhry had sailed through on Monday with 36 votes from PPP and PML-N members, while two PTI opposition members voted against it.
Under the AJK Constitution, a note of no-confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution.
After his election yesterday, the 47-year-old PM-elect announced several administrative measures, including a downsizing process, a new transport policy for officials, and limiting the number of secretaries to 20. He also pledged to address public issues and cater to the needs of low-paid staff.</p><small>2025-11-18 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1817211523b48ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955852/sarajevo-siege-survivors-hope-for-justice-as-italy-probes-alleged-sniper-tourism' target='_blank'><strong>Sarajevo siege survivors hope for justice as Italy probes alleged ‘sniper tourism’</strong></a><br><p>The launch of an investigation in Italy into allegations that foreigners paid to shoot at civilians during the siege of Sarajevo three decades ago has raised survivors’ hopes that people will be brought to justice.
About 11,000 civilians were killed by shelling and sniper fire from Bosnian Serb army positions on hills around the besieged city during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia’s declaration of independence from Yugoslavia.
Milan prosecutors opened their investigation, a source said, after local journalist and novelist Ezio Gavazzeni filed a legal complaint over allegations that Italians and other foreigners had paid members of the Bosnian Serb forces to visit and shoot at civilians under what some referred to as “sniper tourism”.
Gavazzeni said he had been inspired to look into the allegations after watching a 2022 documentary titled Sarajevo Safari, by Slovenian director Miran Zupanic.
Without providing any firm evidence, Gavazzeni said wealthy foreigners paid large sums of money to take part in the shooting trips. He said the Italians used to meet in the city of Trieste before travelling to Belgrade, where Bosnian Serb soldiers escorted them to the hills overlooking Sarajevo.
Old wounds reopened
Opening an investigation is a formality in Italy when such a legal complaint is filed, and no individual suspects have been named. But some Sarajevo residents welcomed the investigation even though it reopened old wounds.
“I am completely shocked,” said Muamer Kalic, a Sarajevo University professor who spent the war in Sarajevo. “These are planetary disasters, and those who admired or financed that should, at the very least, face hanging or life imprisonment.”
Bosnian Serb wartime political leader Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic were jailed for life for war crimes and crimes against humanity, but many Sarajevo residents want others brought to justice.
 
 

Former Sarajevo Mayor Benjamina Karic said she hoped news of the Milan prosecutors’ investigation would pave the way for Bosnian state prosecutors to open an investigation into former Bosnian Serb army commanders and individuals over the siege.
“As a child who grew up and survived the siege of Sarajevo…I have special emotions about this case and truly want to believe the investigation will be initiated,” said Karic.
In a statement to Reuters, the Bosnian state prosecutor’s office said it had not been contacted by the Milan prosecutors.
The Milan prosecutors have not commented on the case.
Edin Subasic, a retired Bosnian army intelligence officer who featured in Zupanic’s documentary, said he learnt of the allegations that foreigners paid to shoot at civilians in 1993 from the testimony of a captured Bosnian Serb army soldier.
“It attracted our attention because it was extraordinary to have civilians with hunting rifles and highly sophisticated equipment on the battlefield,” Subasic told Reuters.
Subasic said Bosnian army intelligence had forwarded the allegations at the time to an Italian military intelligence agency.</p><small>2025-11-18 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/181414008ef7d85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955840/economic-coordination-committee-approves-grants-for-security-defence-projects' target='_blank'><strong>Economic Coordination Committee approves grants for security, defence projects</strong></a><br><p>The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on Tuesday approved grants pertaining to Pakistan’s security and defence.
In a post on social media platform X, the finance ministry said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired a meeting of the ECC that was attended by federal ministers, special assistants to the prime minister, secretaries, and senior officials from relevant divisions.
It said the ECC approved “several strategic grants and reforms aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s security framework, defence capabilities, food security, and petroleum sector operations”.
 






According to the ministry’s statement, a technical supplementary grant of Rs100.3 million was approved for the maintenance of defence equipment used by the federal civil armed forces.
A technical supplementary grant of Rs841.56m was also approved for enhanced border management, internal security and law and order. Further, a technical supplementary grant of Rs50 billion was also approved for defence services projects.
The ECC also decided to establish a new special purpose vehicle, with initial paid-up capital of Rs1,000,000, to take forward the winding up of Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation, along with “measures to incentivise foreign participation in offshore oil and gas exploration, including licence extensions and working interest assignments”.
ECC greenlights offshore exploration consortium
Pakistan also approved a new offshore exploration consortium, clearing Turkish Petroleum Overseas Company (TPOC) to take over operatorship of the Eastern Offshore Block-C as part of a push to revive drilling, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said.
The ECC approved Pakistan Petroleum Limited’s request to assign part of its interest in the block to TPOC, Mari Energies and state-run Oil and Gas Development Co Ltd, leaving PPL with a 35 per cent stake.
TPOC will hold 25pc and will operate the block once a formal agreement is signed.
“This will bring valuable international offshore operating experience to Pakistan’s exploration landscape and this transition is expected to enhance technical capabilities, operational efficiency, and overall project delivery,” Schehzad wrote on X.
He said the block contains a drill-ready prospect that the consortium will now pursue, a step he added could attract fresh foreign investment.
“With the ECC’s approval, the consortium is now set to advance preparations for drilling operations, marking a new chapter in the country’s pursuit of energy security and resource development,” he said.
 






In October, bids were awarded for 23 of 40 offshore blocks offered, covering around 53,500 square kilometres, in the first offshore bidding round since 2007.
Pakistan’s 300,000 square kilometre offshore zone, bordering energy-rich Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Iran, has seen just 18 wells drilled since independence in 1947; too few to fully assess its hydrocarbon potential.
Finmin meets delegation representing group founded by tech entrepreneurs
Separately, Finance Minister Aurangzeb held a meeting with a high-level delegation representing Dialog, an invite-only network founded by tech entrepreneurs Peter Thiel and Auren Hoffman.
In a handout, the ministry said the delegation was led by Ambassador Ali Jehangir Siddiqui and also included UK House of Lords Member Simon Stevens, Austrian MP Veit Valentin Dengler, Norwegian MP Himanshu Gulati, Jigsaw Chief Executive Officer Yasmin Green, Xbox-Microsoft Vice President Fatima Kardar and others.
The ministry said that during the meeting, the minister highlighted Pakistan’s economic reforms.
 






He also stressed the government’s focus on tax reform, energy sector restructuring, privatisation of state-owned enterprises, governance reforms, and rationalisation of federal expenditures.
“He emphasised efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base by integrating technology and artificial intelligence-based monitoring, enhancing compliance, and bringing under-taxed sectors such as real estate, agriculture, and wholesale/retail into the tax net,” the press release said.
The minister also discussed ongoing pension reforms, including the shift to contributory schemes for new entrants and upcoming measures to tackle long-term fiscal liabilities.
Aurangzeb outlined governance improvements in electricity distribution companies, loss-reduction initiatives, private-sector representation on boards, and a renewed privatisation pipeline.
“He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to a competitive tariff regime, long-term sustainability, and greater private-sector participation,” the handout said.</p><small>2025-11-18 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634229-dar-pushes-sco-to-activate-financial-tools-accelerate-economic-integration' target='_blank'><strong>Dar pushes SCO to activate financial tools, accelerate economic integration</strong></a><br><p>

A brilliant bowling show from Pakistan and a laboured chase later saw the hosts beat Sri Lanka by six wickets to complete a 3-0 series sweep over the visitors in the third and final ODI at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Babar was fined 10 per cent of his match fee for a Level 1 ICC Code of Conduct breach, which carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50pc of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points.

“The 31-year-old has been found to have breached Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to ‘abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match’,” ICC said in a press release.
One demerit point has been added to his disciplinary record, making it his first  in a 24-month period.
The incident occurred in the 21st over of Pakistan’s innings when Babar hit the stumps with his bat before leaving the crease following his dismissal (34 off 52) by Sri Lanka’s Jeffery Vandersay.
According to ICC,on-field umpires Alex Wharf and Rashid Riaz, third umpire Sharfuddoula Ibne Shahid and fourth umpire Faisal Afridi levelled the charge while Ali Naqvi of the Emirates ICC International Panel of Match Referees proposed the sanction.

Following these changes, Supreme Court’s  Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail has been included in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Practice and Procedure Committee while Federal Constitutional Court’s (FCC)  Justice Aamer Farooq has been made a member of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
Among the three statutory bodies, the SJC is the the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges, the Practice and Procedure Committee forms benches and fixes cases, and the JCP is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.
Changes in their composition were required to synchronise them with the latest constitutional amendment.
A Supreme Court (SC) press release issued on Tuesday said: “Pursuant to the 27th Constitutional Amendment, [these] key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies […] have been reconstituted in accordance with the revised constitutional framework.”
Elaborating on the changes in the bodies’ composition, the press release said that Justice Mandokahail, being the second-most senior judge of the SC, had been jointly nominated by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan as a member of the SJC.
Now, apart from Justice Mandokhail, the SJC will comprise the CJP, FCC CJ Aminuddin, Justice Munib Akhtar of the SC, Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi of the FCC, Lahore High Court (LHC) CJ Aalia Neelum and Islamabad High Court (IHC) CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar.
According to the 27th Amendment, the SJC will be headed by the senior most judge between the CJP and FCC chief justice. The inter-se seniority in this case will be determined by the dates of their appointment as the chief justices of the SC and FCC. This means that CJP Yahya will continue to head the body.
The SC press release also added that the two judges had nominated Justice Mandokhail as a member of Practice and Procedure Committee.
Under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure), Act 2023, the three-judge committee will now comprise the CJP, Justice Akhtar and Justice Mandokhail, who has become the second-most senior judge following the resignation of Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.
According to the SC press release, Justice Farooq, the second most senior judge of the FCC, was jointly nominated by the chief justices of the SC and FCC as a member of the JCP.
Following this, the JCP will now comprise the CJP, FCC chief justice, Justice Akhtar, FCC’s Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar, Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Ahsan Bhoon, two members from the National Assembly, two members from the Senate and a woman or non-Muslim nominated by the National Assembly speaker.
“The reconstituted bodies will continue to play a central role in matters of accountability, judicial appointments, and procedural governance under the amended constitutional scheme,” the press release read.
The changes in the bodies’ composition come amid a restructuring of the judiciary following the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
The contentious amendment, which resulted in the establishment of the FCC, was passed by Parliament amid the opposition’s outcry. It has also been criticised by some legal experts as a means to dethroning the SS as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to the FCC.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Hours after the Amendment was enacted on November 13, two judges of the SC had resigned, citing their reservations against it. These two judges were Athar Minallah and Mansoor Ali Shah, who was the senior puisne judge of the SC at the time.
ICJ’s reservations
The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) has also expressed concern over several main points of the Amendment, namely the formation of the FCC, the appointment of judges and chief justices to the SC and the FCC, the composition of the JCP, the transfer of high court judges and the immunities granted to the president and the military leadership.
“Before the amendment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan exercised the functions that have now been given to the FCC,” the (ICJ) statement issued on Nov 13 read. “Following the amendment, the Supreme Court will now effectively be an appellate court only in matters that do not involve the interpretation of the Constitution of Pakistan.”
The ICJ further noted that the first batch of FCC judges would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, with future judges being appointed on the recommendation of the JCP, while the chief justice would be appointed by a “special parliamentary committee”.
“The amendment does not provide any criteria on which the appointments will be made and does not require reasons to [be] given for the appointments, apart from general qualifications necessary to be considered a judge of the FCC,” the statement read.
