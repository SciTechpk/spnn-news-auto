The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno in the metropolis, which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need for reforms in the city’s administration, particularly in local governments (LGs).
Kamal, addressing a press conference today, called on the federal government to “invoke Article 148 and 149 of the Constitution, and declare Karachi as the financial capital of the country”.
Article 148 of the Constitution pertains to the obligation of provinces and the federation, while Article 149 allows the federal government to issue directives to provinces in certain cases.
Article 149(ii) enables the federal government to direct provincial governments regarding the “construction and maintenance of means of communication declared in the direction to be of national or strategic importance”.
Kamal stressed that given the potential of the metropolis, “it can not be given to such a provincial administration”, referring to the ruling PPP in Sindh.
“We have an administrative capital, but Karachi should be made a financial capital,” he reiterated, adding that the demand for provinces can be addressed later.
“A city that runs the entire country cannot remain under an administration engaging in democratic terrorism,” the MQM-P leader claimed.
Kamal insisted that the current city administration was “turning people against the state” by “disenfranchising them”, and cautioned that Pakistan’s enemies stood to gain from such a situation.
‘PPP taking unfair advantage of 18th Amendment’
The MQM-P leader further claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage of the 18th Amendment”, alleging that it was being “used against us (Karachi citizens)”.
“End this 18th Amendment drama now,” Kamal said.
He also reiterated the party’s demand for strengthening the LG system.
Recalling the discussions ahead of the 27th Constitutional Amendment passed in November last year, he said that “even the prime minister agreed to the local government reforms”.
“The cabinet, including Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Tanveer and Rana Sanaullah, supported it unequivocally. However, the PPP was the sole party which refused to comply,” the MQM-P leader said.
“They threatened to pull out from voting for the other clauses in the Amendment, so we had to retreat,” Kamal added, echoing his stance of the PPP creating a “deadlock”.
The MQM-P has been calling for empowering LGs for a long time, even tying its support for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the inclusion of related provisions in Article 140A.
However, after both Amendments did not address the matter, the party claimed that its suggested constitutional tweaks would now be advanced as the 28th constitutional amendment.
On Tuesday, the National Assembly session also echoed with calls for empowering LGs as lawmakers voiced their concerns over the deadly Gul Plaza tragedy.
MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units”, and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif also favoured strengthening LGs for better city management.</p><small>2026-01-22 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22124521ab0e6e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968420/us-set-to-quit-world-health-organisation' target='_blank'><strong>US set to quit World Health Organisation</strong></a><br><p>The US is due to officially exit the World Health Organisation on Thursday, in the face of warnings it will hit both US health and global health and also in violation of a US law that requires Washington to pay the UN health agency $260 million in fees that it owes.
President Donald Trump gave notice that the US would quit the organisation on the first day of his presidency in 2025, via an executive order. Under US law, it has to give one-year notice and pay all outstanding fees before departure.
On Thursday, a US State Department spokesperson said the WHO’s failure to contain, manage and share information had cost the US trillions of dollars and the president had exercised his authority to pause the future transfer of any US government funds, support, or resources to the WHO.
“The American people have paid more than enough to this organisation and this economic hit is beyond a down payment on any financial obligations to the organisation,” the spokesperson said by email.
Quick return unlikely
Over the last year, many global health experts have urged a rethink, including most recently WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“I hope the US will reconsider and rejoin WHO, he told reporters at a press conference earlier this month. Withdrawing from the WHO is a lose for the United States, and its a lose for the rest of the world.”
The WHO also said that the US has not yet paid the fees it owes for 2024 and 2025. Member states are set to discuss the US departure and how it will be handled at the WHOs executive board in February, a WHO spokesperson told Reuters by email.
“This is a clear violation of US law,” said Lawrence Gostin, founding director of the ONeill Institute for Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington, a close observer of the WHO. “But Trump is highly likely to get away with it.”
Speaking to Reuters at Davos, Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation, a major funder of global health initiatives and some of the WHOs work said he did not expect the US to reconsider in the short-term.
“I dont think the US will be coming back to WHO in the near future, he said, adding that when he had an opportunity to advocate for it, he would. The world needs the World Health Organisation.”
What the departure means
For the WHO, the departure of the US has sparked a budgetary crisis that has seen it cut its management team in half and scale back work, cutting budgets across the agency.
Washington has traditionally been by far the UN health agency’s biggest financial backer, contributing around 18% of its overall funding.
The WHO will also shed around a quarter of its staff by the middle of this year.
The agency said it has been working with the US and sharing information in the last year.
It was unclear how the collaboration will work going forward.
Global health experts said this posed risks for the US, the WHO and the world.
“The US withdrawal from WHO could weaken the systems and collaborations the world relies on to detect, prevent, and respond to health threats,” said Kelly Henning, public health program lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, a US-based non-profit.</p><small>2026-01-22 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22112933d672d9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968412/president-zardari-confirms-27-judges-of-sindh-lahore-and-peshawar-high-courts-as-permanent' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari confirms 27 judges of Sindh, Lahore and Peshawar high courts as permanent</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday approved the confirmation of a total of 27 additional judges of the Sindh, Lahore, and Peshawar high courts.
According to a statement issued on Thursday by the president’s secretariat, the approval was given in accordance with the recommendations of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
For the Sindh High Court (SHC), the statement said the president had approved the confirmation of all 10 additional judges recommended by the JCP: Justices Miran Muhammad Shah, Tasneem Sultana, Riazat Ali Sahar, Muhammad Hasan, Abdul Hamid Bhurgi, Jan Ali Junejo, Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro, Ali Haider ‘Ada’, Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi and Muhammad Jaffer Raza.
President Zardari also approved a six-month extension in the tenures of Justices Khalid Hussain Shahani and Syed Faizul Hassan Shah of the SHC, the statement added.
For the Lahore High Court (LHC), President Zardari confirmed all 11 additional judges recommended by the JCP as permanent judges, namely Justices Hassan Nawaz Makhdoom, Malik Waqar Haider Awan, Sardar Akbar Ali, Syed Ahsan Raza Kazmi, Malik Javed Iqbal Wains, Muhammad Jawad Zafar, Khalid Ishaq, Malik Muhammad Awais Khalid, Chaudhry Sultan Mahmood, Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh and Abher Gul Khan.
The president further approved a six-month extension in the tenure of Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa as an additional LHC judge, according to the statement.
Finally, for the Peshawar High Court (PHC), he approved the confirmation of the following six additional judges: Justices Muhammad Tariq Afridi, Abdul Fayaz, Salahuddin, Sadiq Ali, Syed Mudasser Ameer and Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah.
He also approved a six-month extension in the tenure of Justices Farah Jamshed, Inamullah Khan, Sabitullah Khan and Aurangzeb as PHC’s additional judges.
“The approvals have been made on the advice of the prime minister,” the statement added.
Last week, over multiple days of meetings presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the JCP had recommended making additional judges of multiple high courts permanent. It had approved three of the Islamabad High Court, 10 of the SHC, 11 of the LHC, six of the PHC and one of the Balochistan High Court.
By a majority of its total membership, the JCP had recommended the confirmations after due consideration of the relevant data forms, antecedents and evaluation of material placed before it.
Subsequently, the federal government had notified the appointment of IHC’s Justices Muhammad Azam Khan, Muhammad Asif and Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas as permanent judges, with them taking oath on Monday.</p><small>2026-01-22 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22122756e019c75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968419/rain-forecast-for-karachi-on-thursday-cold-spell-ahead-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Rain forecast for Karachi on Thursday, cold spell ahead: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Thursday that cloudy weather is expected in Karachi division today, with chances of rain leading to a dip in temperatures over the next three days.

The fire had erupted at the Gul Plaza on Saturday night. While the fire at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road was said to have been doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Rescue 1122’s urban search and rescue teams continued to comb through the debris overnight, using specialised tools and cutters, including thermal imaging cameras.
Relatives of those still missing have criticised the slow operation at the three-storey plaza, where rescuers are scouring the wreckage for human remains.
More than 50 families have given DNA samples, Police surgeon Sumaiya Syed told journalists a day earlier.
“We will hand over the bodies (remains) to the family once DNA samples are matched,” she said outside the Civil Hospital Karachi mortuary.
Faraz Ali, whose father and 26-year-old brother were inside the mall, told AFP he wants “the bodies to be recovered and handed over to their rightful families”.
“That is all so that the families may receive something, some comfort, some peace. At least let us see them one last time, in whatever condition they are, so that we may say our final goodbye,” the 28-year-old said.
On Wednesday, in a harrowing development, at least 30 bodies were recovered from a gutted shop of the ill-fated plaza.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the remains of 30 humans had been recovered from a shop called “Dubai Crockery” located on the mezzanine floor.
He said that earlier in the day, rescue workers had recovered three more bodies, which had taken the toll from 28 to 31. He added that with the discovery of the bodies from the gutted shop, the death toll was estimated to have risen to 61.
Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, also visited the gutted plaza yesterday. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner.
Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous.
Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards.
The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far.
“We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared.
KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots.
He said one portion of the building had been cleared, while two other portions were in the process of being cleared.
“We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable.
He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was received about the fire on Saturday night.
Khan further added that shopkeepers had created a chaotic situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops.
He said that the door leading to the building’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted, which was why all the exits were closed.

Additional input from AFP</p><small>2026-01-22 07:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22122529a6e00af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417/bangladesh-launches-campaigns-for-first-post-hasina-elections' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh launches campaigns for first post-Hasina elections</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh began official campaigning on Thursday for the hugely anticipated general elections next month, the first since the 2024 uprising ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters of key frontrunner Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) crowded the streets of the northern city of Sylhet, chanting his name.
“Do we have a leader? Yes, we do,” BNP loyalists shouted, carrying placards of the prime ministerial hopeful Rahman, who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile.
Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami will begin its campaign in the capital Dhaka later in the day.
The South Asian nation of 170 million votes on February 12 to elect 350 lawmakers.
The polls are expected to usher in new leadership after prolonged turmoil following the ouster of Hasina’s government, reshaping domestic politics and regional dynamics.
It comes against the backdrop of insecurity — including the murder last month of a student leader of the anti-Hasina protests — as well as warnings of a “flood” of online disinformation.
European Union election observers say the vote will be the “biggest democratic process of 2026”.
‘Never fulfilled’
Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP following the death of his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.
“He will carry forward the legacy of his parents,” said Harun Ur Rashid, a 40-year-old die-hard BNP supporter, referring to Zia and her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981.
Bangladesh, home to one of the world’s largest Muslim-majority populations, has a significant Sufi following, and parties have traditionally launched campaigns in Sylhet, home to the centuries-old shrine of Shah Jalal.
Supporters lined the streets on Wednesday night as Rahman prayed at the shrine, cheering as his election bus passed by.
Jamaat-i-Islami, which opposes Sufi mystical interpretations, begins its campaign in the capital Dhaka, in the constituency of its leader Shafiqur Rahman.
Ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-i-Islami is seeking a return to formal politics after years of bans and crackdowns.
Since Hasina fled to India, key Jamaat leaders have been released from prison, and groups have grown increasingly assertive.
The National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising, and who have formed an alliance with Jamaat, will also launch their rally in Dhaka.

 

Engineer Raqibul Hasan Shawon, 26, watched the BNP rally from the sidelines.
“I haven’t decided whom to vote for yet,” he said. “We have heard commitments before, but they were never fulfilled.”
‘New Bangladesh’
Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who returned from exile in August 2024 at the behest of protesters to lead a caretaker government as “chief adviser”, will step down after the polls.
Yunus said he inherited a “completely broken” political system, and championed a reform charter he argues is vital to prevent a return to authoritarian rule, with a referendum on the changes to be held on the same day as polling.
“If you cast the ‘yes’ vote, the door to building the new Bangladesh will open,” Yunus said on January 19, in a broadcast to the nation urging support for the referendum.

 

Earlier this month, he warned he was “concerned about the impact” a surge of disinformation could have.
“They have flooded social media with fake news, rumours and speculation,” Yunus said, blaming both “foreign media and local sources”.
Relations with neighbouring India have soured, after Hasina escaped to her old ally New Delhi as protesters stormed her palace.
Hasina, 78, sentenced to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power, remains in hiding in India.</p><small>2026-01-22 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22113838279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968414/pta-wrote-to-x-three-times-seeking-closure-of-imran-khans-x-account-over-the-past-35-years' target='_blank'><strong>PTA wrote to X three times seeking closure of Imran Khan’s X account over the past 3.5 years</strong></a><br><p>Over the past 3.5 years, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has written to X three times seeking closure of an account in PTI founder Imran Khan’s name, but received no response, it emerged on Thursday.
The information came to light in a PTA report, seen by Dawn and submitted to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) today in relation to a petition against the incarcerated former premier regarding “inflammatory posts” made from an X account operated in his name.
The report stated that the first request was sent on August 21, 2022, to X, and the body received no response from the social media platform.
On April 18, 2024, PTA submitted another request for the blocking of Imran’s account via email.
The report said that the email included “citation of relevant court orders against Imran and details of his conviction and sentence to 14, 10, and seven years in Toshakhana, cypher, and unlawful marriage cases”.
However, it added that once again, no response was received from X.
The report added that on November 27, 2025, PTA wrote to the platform seeking the blocking of 47 tweets from Imran’s X account.
However, out of the 47, X only blocked one tweet.
PTA, in its report, also noted that the over-the-top (OTT) services operating in Pakistan were not regulated as they were registered in their country of origin.
It added that the companies “are not necessarily bound by the region/country in which the user is accessing their content”.
It also took note of the fact that “content management, social media operators do provide an official channel to the users as well as the regulators to lodge their complaints”.
The authority said that the “other option remains to block the internet traffic flowing to these operations, however, since they utilise secure channels, selective blocking on their content cannot be enabled.”
“But complete access to their services can be revoked on a best effort basis,” it added.
The authority added that in October 2021, PTA had requested social media companies to comply with Section 7 (6) of the Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules and register themselves with PTA and “appoint a local compliance grievance officer”.
“However, no affirmative response has been received to date,” it added.
On Wednesday, the IHC took up the petition regarding the X account and questioned how proceedings in the case could continue if authorities were denying his counsel access to him.
The former premier’s family and party leaders have recently faced increased restrictions in meeting him.
During yesterday’s proceedings, the court told the PTA counsel that the authority’s response to the petition was “unsatisfactory”.
In September last year, a petition was filed in the IHC challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
A written reply submitted to the court by Adiala jail authorities last year denied that the X account was being operated from within the jail premises.
Superintendent of the Adiala jail stated the PTI founder was under strict surveillance and had no access to any prohibited device, “particularly mobile phones”.</p><small>2026-01-22 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646529-when-principle-meets-realpolitik-pakistan-and-the-peace-board' target='_blank'><strong>When principle meets realpolitik: Pakistan and the peace board</strong></a><br><p>

The International Cricket Council (ICC) board has dismissed Bangladesh’s concerns about the safety and security of their players and fans in India, citing political tension between the South Asian neighbours.
With their demands to play their matches in Sri Lanka shot down by the game’s global governing body, Bangladesh find themselves left with the difficult options of either withdrawing their demand or getting replaced by another team in the global showpiece that begins on February 7.
“I asked the ICC board for time to talk to my government for one last time,” BCB president Aminul Islam told reporters after learning of the ICC decision.
“They said it’s a valid point and gave me 24 or 48 hours to get back to them.”
“We know that India is not secure for us. We remain in the stance that we want to play in Sri Lanka. I know the ICC denied us, but we will talk to the government one more time. I will inform the ICC about the government’s feedback.”
Aware of a potential backlash that would follow any volte-face about playing in India, Aminul said the players were keen to play in the World Cup.
“I am hoping for a miracle from the ICC. Who doesn’t want to play in the World Cup?” he said.

“Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players.”

Political relations have soured between the neighbours in recent times and cricket has been affected too.
Bangladesh player Mustafizur Rahman was dropped from this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) despite him signing with its Kolkata franchise.
Bangladesh responded by banning IPL broadcasts in the country and demanding to play their World Cup matches in Sri Lanka.</p><small>2026-01-22 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646525-enough-is-enough-mqm-p-demands-karachi-be-declared-federal-territory-after-gul-plaza-tragedy' target='_blank'><strong>'Enough is enough': MQM-P demands Karachi be declared federal territory after Gul Plaza tragedy</strong></a><br><p>

The 79-year-old Republican has been clamoring for the United States to acquire Greenland, a large island territory of Denmark, citing what he called security threats from Russia and China in the Arctic Circle.
On Wednesday he announced a “framework” for a future deal on Greenland and the cancellation of planned tariffs on European countries that had opposed his moves to control the island — but not before ruffling Nato allies and straining transatlantic relations.
“I’m helping Nato, and until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,” Trump said during his remarks to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.
“They’re not there for us on Iceland — that I can tell you. I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.”

 


It seemed obvious he was referring to Greenland and not the smaller neighbouring Iceland, an island in the North Atlantic famous for its breathtaking volcanic landscapes.
After the speech, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against a post on X by a journalist, Libbey Dean, who wrote that “President Trump appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.”
“No he didn’t, Libby. His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here,” Leavitt fired back on X, misspelling the journalist’s name.







During his speech at Davos, Trump, as he often does, frequently strayed from the written script scrolling on the teleprompters.
Asked about the events in Davos, Gavin Newsom, California’s Democratic governor and a leading opposition figure in the United States who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028, seized on the moment.
“None of this is normal,” Newsom said. “There’s a normalisation, a deviancy of consciousness.”
Sensitive subject
The issue of mental acuity is a sensitive one for Trump.
During the 2024 presidential campaign, he attacked incumbent Joe Biden, claiming the Democrat suffered from dementia.
In recent days, some Democratic lawmakers have called for invoking the US Constitution’s 25th Amendment, which allows for removing a president who no longer has the physical or intellectual capacity to carry out the duties of office.
The politicians justified their calls by citing a message that Trump had sent to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.
In the message, made public on Monday, Trump expressed his displeasure with not being awarded last year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
Trump also reiterated his desire for the US to take control of Greenland.
“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump wrote.

But during the two-hour wait to get in, the excitement to hear the leader of the world’s most powerful nation in person was palpable — “It’s like a rock festival,” one attendee said.
Quickly the doors to the World Economic Forum’s packed congress hall closed, forcing hundreds to scramble for spots in overflow rooms to watch him on screens.
Even the president of Latvia, Edgars Rinkevics, was stuck in line at one point before an aide guided him elsewhere.
“It’s interesting that people were lining up to hear President Trump, like they were not lining to hear any other speaker — none has got such kind of interest,” Rinkevics said.
Many were apprehensive about the escalating tensions between Trump and Europe over his bid to seize Greenland, a crisis that has overshadowed the annual schmoozefest’s agenda.
“I expect the worst. From what we know from Trump, he always needs to have all the attention and he needs to have a shocker message,” Julia Binder, of the Swiss-based IMD Business School, said. And shock he did.
In one overflow room, attendees mockingly laughed and gasped throughout his speech. Guffaws when Trump talked about wind farms killing birds. Nervous laughs when he said he was asking for “a piece of ice”, meaning Greenland.
Others said “oh no” when he alleged that “Canada lives because of the United States.” Another exclaimed: “Oh my goodness!” when Trump recalled that Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte once referred to him as “daddy”.
More unbelieving laughs broke out when he made fun of French President Emmanuel Macron for wearing sunglasses — due to a burst blood vessel — during his own speech on Tuesday.
And howls when he again insisted: “All the US is asking for is a place called Greenland.” “I would say he’s gone from neocon to neo-imperial,” one attendee whispered. An hour into Trump’s rambling speech, people started to leave the overflow rooms. “He’s a nutcase,” one said on the way out.
‘Piece of rock’
Many said Trump was the ideal guest at a forum for hearing provocative voices. “Davos is a platform for and exchange of ideas, of views. So we are here to listen to all views, whether we like them or not,” said Daniel Marokane, chief executive of a South African power company. But others took umbrage at his trademark abrasiveness and attacks, including an insistence that the US deserves Greenland as payback for its massive Nato financing.
“Trump got elected because he knows how to read a room, but I’m not sure he read the room this time,” said an American medical technology executive, who like others requested anonymity to protect his company’s identity.
“One guy I saw get up and leave, he was visibly shaking with anger.” For Polish President Karol Nawrocki, it was a “very important speech”, not least because Trump claimed he would not use force to acquire Greenland.

The delayed action has triggered backlash from builders, developers and civil society, who say that the building regulator has been sitting on a KMC fire safety audit report for over two years despite being formally notified.
They termed the SBCA’s sudden directives to building owners “too little, too late”, accusing the authority of criminal negligence and questioning how many lives could have been saved if the warnings had been acted upon earlier.

 

“Since the SBCA will not be able to achieve the desired objectives without the cooperation of your members in this matter, you are therefore requested to direct your members to immediately comply with the fire safety deficiencies highlighted in the audit reports within three days, as this is an urgent matter requiring immediate compliance,” said a SBCA letter to the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) chairman.

Building regulator accused of ‘sitting on’ a KMC fire audit report for over two years; critics term move ‘too little, too late’

The KMC in January 2024 compiled a report on fire safety in hundreds of buildings across Karachi, following a deadly blaze at RJ Mall on Rashid Minhas Road in 2023.
The report identified at least 265 buildings lacking fire safety systems, emergency exits or a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire brigade. It warned that these structures could face disastrous consequences in case of a fire.
However, the SBCA moved to implement the report’s recommendations only after the Gul Plaza tragedy and that too more than two years later.
Muhammad Hassan Bakhshi, the ABAD chairman, — who has been asked by the SBCA to “cooperate” in implementing the fire compliance rules “within three days” — said he was hearing about the report for the “first time”.
He said the SBCA had never approached him earlier in this connection, adding that now it appeared that the authority was “trying to complete years of inaction in a matter of days”.
“These surveys and their implementation will only open another door to corruption,” Mr Bakhshi warned.
He stressed the need to digitise regulatory processes, arguing that reducing human-to-human contact was essential to prevent further corruption.
Saad Abdul Wahab, a fire and structural safety expert and CEO of Grow Safe, criticised the SBCA’s sudden push for fire safety compliance, warning that the move appears to be a temporary correction.
“A proper corrective action requires identifying root causes, assessing hazards, and implementing suitable and sufficient control measures,” he said.
He questioned the seriousness of the regulator and asked which legal framework or safety standard the authority was using as a benchmark for compliance, pointing out that multiple national and international codes exist.
The expert warned that enforcing fire safety installations without ensuring structural integrity could be dangerous.
He said there was no clarity on whether buildings were structurally capable of bearing additional loads from fire-fighting systems.
Meanwhile, a review by Dawn of the fire safety report compiled by the KMC two years ago showed that it included many residential and commercial buildings.
An official from the management of a commercial building on Sharea Faisal told Dawn that the SBCA had never warned them or provided any information regarding fire safety compliance.
“More than two years ago, a team of KMC fire department visited us and conducted a survey. But after that, we were never approached by the SBCA.”

This was not the first such fire. Journalist Mahim Maher compiled a list of 60 mall fires in Karachi between 2016 and 2022. “Gul Plaza was a disaster waiting to happen,” she said while re-sharing her interactive map of all these fires on her social media feed.
The massive flames engulfing the building were reminiscent of the inflationary fire that engulfed Pakistan between March 2021 and May 2023. The repeated nature of these fires was a parallel to how the economy of Pakistan burns in the fires of a balance-of-payments crisis every few years.
New reports talked about how the firefighters were late to the scene. Firefighters attributed this to the traffic mess through which their tenders had to travel to reach the scene. This reminded me of the intense power struggle that has been a constant feature of our politics for decades now, and how the political logjam serves as an obstruction in the path of decision-makers reaching the conclusion they need to reach: the country needs to go to the IMF and swallow the bitter medicine of austerity one more time to douse the economic flames engulfing the country.
The firefighters fought heroically. They fought all night. The smouldering remains of the building over the next few days bore testament to the strength they had to muster, the dangers they faced and all that it must have taken to douse the flames. It’s the same when respective governments have fought off a balance-of-payments crisis. The State Bank and the bureaucrats at the finance ministry make some of the toughest choices of their careers during these periods. The high-wire act performed to keep banks afloat in 2008 or to keep the energy supply chain running in 1998 is known only to those who actually performed these deeds. The rest of us may be oblivious to all that it took to keep the country running those days. But we are all in the debt of those who made sure this was the case.

The flames consuming Gul Plaza were reminiscent of the inflationary fire that engulfed the country between March 2021 and May 2023.

Yet the repeated fires in Karachi mock the efforts of the firefighters, just like the repeated slide into bankruptcy by Pakistan’s economy mocks the efforts of the heroes who had to pull it out of crises in the last episode of bankruptcy. Ms Maher counted 60 fires in six years. That is 10 every year. Yet after Gul Plaza the authorities are once again sending out notices to the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) in Karachi to please ensure their buildings have fire exits. I counted almost 25 episodes of bankruptcy for Pakistan since 1988. Yet after each programme ends, every government announces this is the last such programme.
The same mistakes are made over and over again. The same flames break out over and over again. The same drama plays out every such fire. And it always has the same ending: everyone gets back to business as usual, no lessons are ever learned, and certainly no lessons ever applied. Pakistan is one of a handful of countries that has spent more time inside an IMF programme than outside in the past quarter century or more. Yet, not once has there been an across-the-board exercise to determine why we keep falling into the same hole every few years, why we keep having to put out the same fire every few years.
The reason is simple. Nobody in Karachi, not least in all the administrations the city has had over the decades, is really interested in preventing the next fire. ABAD is not likely to do much to retrofit all buildings in the city that it has built with fire escape plans. According to DIG South, quoted in this paper, the building had 16 exits on the ground floor and 14 of them were closed, while the basement was packed with shoppers. It doesn’t take a lot of brains to know that blocked exits are a fire hazard, but who thinks of preventive maintenance? Who thinks about fire escapes and emergency evacuation plans in a city that literally lives from day to day?

 

Likewise, it doesn’t take a lot of brains to understand that if you burn your foreign currency reserves in a consumptive binge you will go bankrupt. It doesn’t take a lot of brains to realise that if you replenish these reserves with borrowed dollars, you will still go bankrupt but this time with more debt on top of it. It doesn’t take a genius to realise that if you keep doing what everybody before you did, you will land up in the same place as they all did: in bankruptcy, fighting the fires of inflation.
Yet they do it over and over again. The Gul Plaza fire was a massive tragedy. Even as the dead are still being counted and identified, it can be said the bigger tragedy will be when the fire is forgotten, when the furore dies down, when normality returns, and people get back to work once again. That is what happened 60 times between 2016 and 2022. It is now gearing up to happen for the 61st time.
And exactly the same thing happens with the economy. Every time they put out the fires of inflation, and every time they replenish the foreign currency reserves following a brush with bankruptcy, they spend a year extolling their heroism, reminding everyone how they just put out a fire started by the previous guys. Then they get to work doing the exact same thing the previous guys did, all the while reassuring us that this time the outcome will be different.
And because money gets made in these latter periods, nobody complains, except maybe naysaying doomsayers like yours truly. Until the next fire.

Unless this debate is addressed rationally, future privatisation transactions may also be at risk. Past experience offers a cautionary lesson: the Supreme Court’s decision to annul the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills did not revive the enterprise; instead, it led to its closure in 2015 and significantly slowed the overall privatisation process.
The popular binary often advanced — either retain enterprises under government ownership or privatise them — is flawed. Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations rather than ideological preferences. Pakistan has 85 commercial SOEs for diverse purposes across power, oil and gas; transport and communications; manufacturing, mining and engineering; finance; industrial estate development and management; and wholesale and retail trade. Of these, 51 are currently profitable. The argument that profitable SOEs should never be divested is as untenable as the view that all 34 lossmaking entities must be privatised. Neither ownership per se nor current financial performance should solely determine policy.
The basic principle for deciding whether an economic activity should be undertaken by the government — through its departments or through an SOE — rests on two questions: a) does the activity fall within the government’s public policy framework? b) Can it be adequately performed by the private sector?
Relevance to public policy framework: The PPF reflects the government’s development priorities, as articulated in documents such as the Principles of Policy (Article 3 of the Constitution) and sectoral policies relating to agriculture, industry, trade, etc. In assessing alignment with the PPF, it is necessary to consider whether an SOE is connected to one or more core state functions — i) ensuring national food security; ii) developing and managing large-scale infrastructure; iii) national defence and security-related activities; iv) entities established through government-to-government or intergovernmental arrangements; and v) provision of goods and services of critical national economic interest. If an SOE falls into any of these categories, there is a prima facie case for retaining it under government control. The decision then is whether it should be retained in its existing form or restructured to improve performance.

Decisions regarding state-owned enterprises should be guided by pragmatic considerations.

Market failure considerations: The second question concerns market failure: can the private sector adequately deliver the relevant activity? Each SOE must be evaluated in terms of its operations, functions and market structure, with attention to the following: a) is the SOE a natural monopoly; if so, does an effective regulatory framework exist to ensure socially optimal and cost-effective service delivery under private ownership? b) Does the SOE perform a function that generates significant positive externalities and is, therefore, insufficiently profitable for the private sector to undertake? c) Are there alternative delivery mechanisms to achieve the same objectives?
Where market failure prevents the private sector from maximising social welfare, the government has a strong case for retaining control. Even then, competition can be introduced by dismantling monopolies where feasible and establishing strong, independent regulatory agencies.
Financial viability: While several SOEs report accounting profits, financial viability requires more rigorous assessment. The key question is whether the organisation can generate sufficient revenues to cover operating costs, meet debt obligations, and, where relevant, finance investment for growth while maintaining acceptable service standards. The financial viability test should be based on the following: a) Negative shareholders’ equity: Any entity with negative equity for the past three years is financially stressed, as its balance sheet is not bankable and it remains dependent on government guarantees or direct budgetary support. b) Continuous losses: Entities incurring losses over the last three years are similarly stressed, as losses either necessitate government support or gradually erode equity. c) Return on assets: While return on equity is a standard metric, ROA is more appropriate when equity is negative. ROA measures how effectively management uses assets to generate earnings. SOEs with an ROA below five per cent for three consecutive years should be considered financially stressed.

 

In such cases, financial restructuring is the first step. If restructuring fails under government ownership due to extraneous constraints, alternative options — such as outsourcing, leasing, concession agreements, or transfer of managerial control — should be considered. SOEs that don’t meet public policy criteria, don’t address market failure concerns, or cannot be made viable even after restructuring are prime candidates for privatisation, liquidation, or winding up.
Lessons from successful privatisation: Pakistan’s main privatisation success stories are the banking and telecom sectors. In banking, the share of assets held by nationalised commercial banks declined from around 80pc to about 20pc following privatisation. Prior to 2003, the government injected Rs46 billion to recapitalise lossmaking banks; non-performing loans stood at 25pc, and financial soundness indicators were weak. Since privatisation, four major banks (HBL, UBL, MCB, and ABL) have contributed Rs245bn in corporate taxes in 2024 with cumulative contributions exceeding Rs1.6 trillion since 2004. NPLs have fallen below 7pc, provisioning exceeds 100pc, and overall financial soundness has improved.
The main weakness in recent years is the growing role of banks as public sector financiers, reflected in a declining advance-to-deposit ratio. Importantly, public sector banks such as the NBP and the Bank of Punjab have also improved under a competitive market structure and rank among the top 15 Asia-Pacific banks. The ideological argument that these institutions must also be privatised ignores the empirical evidence that ownership itself is not the decisive factor.
PIA’s case: Applying this framework (spelt out in the SOE Triage Report 2021) to PIA leads to a clear conclusion: there were no compelling public policy or market failure reasons for retaining it under government control. The aviation industry is competitive, and private operators have proved their capacity to perform effectively. Despite repeated restructuring efforts, PIA accumulated losses of Rs850bn. The privatisation objective was not short-term maximisation of sale proceeds but elimination of recurring losses and revival of the airline as an efficient enterprise. Over the longer term, improved performance under private management is expected to generate a steady stream of tax revenues rather than drain the exchequer. In sum, Pakistan needs an eclectic, evidence-based approach to SOEs, which transcends ideological divides and focuses squarely on public policy relevance, market structure, and financial viability.

In a statement issued from its regional office in Hong Kong, the agency said the rating actions reflect the application of Fitch’s new Sovereign Rating Criteria, effective September 2025, and the inclusion of recovery assumptions into sovereign debt ratings for the first time.
The recovery rating RR4 denotes ‘average’ recovery expectation from default in a scale of six categories, starting from RR1 for outstanding, RR2 for superior, RR3 for good and RR4 for average. This is followed by RR5 for below average and RR6 for poor.
The senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Pakistan and The Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Company Ltd are equalised with Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), reflecting Fitch’s expectation of average recovery prospects in a default scenario, given Pakistan’s high levels of general government debt and interest payments as a percentage of revenue, and the absence of any other clearly identifiable criteria factors that would cause us to notch the debt ratings up or down from the IDR.
On April 15, 2025, Fitch upgraded Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR to ‘B-’ with a stable outlook, from ‘CCC+’. In terms of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) key rating drivers for the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR and, in turn, the debt ratings, Pakistan has an ESG Relevance Score of ‘5’ for political stability and rights and for the rule of law, institutional and regulatory quality and control of corruption, as is the case for all sovereigns.
These scores reflect the high weight that World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have for sovereign rating model. Pakistan has a WBGI ranking at the 22nd percentile. The bond and sukuk ratings are sensitive to any changes in Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, which could change with sensitivities.
It notes that factors that could individually or collectively lead to a negative rating for downgrade include failure to keep government debt and debt-servicing metrics on a firm downward path, renewed deterioration in external liquidity conditions, for example, from delays in IMF programme reviews or insufficiently tight economic policy settings.
On the other hand, factors that could rating upgrade include significant declines in government debt and debt-servicing burdens, for example due to the implementation of fiscal consolidation plans in line with IMF programme commitments, leading to structural improvements in tax revenue generation and further significant easing of external financing risks, including evidence of greater ability to source external funding and a sustained recovery in foreign-currency reserves beyond Fitch’s forecasts.

An IHC division bench, comprising Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhsas, gave this ruling on Tuesday while dismissing a large number of intra-court appeals and upholding a single bench verdict which had declared that the directions issued by a Special Committee of the National Assembly for the reinstatement and regularisation of sacked employees had no legal effect and were void.
In its detailed judgement, the bench held that while the proceedings of the special committee, to the extent of examining matters and submitting a report to the House, were within the constitutional framework, the directions issued by it to executive authorities relating to reinstatement, regularisation, seniority, pay fixation and the initiation of coercive measures were without lawful authority.
“The recommendations of the Special Committee, insofar as they purported to bind the executive or override statutory provisions and judicial pronouncements, do not enjoy protection under Article 69(1) of the Constitution and were rightly declared void,” the court ruled.

DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had reached a framework for a deal over Greenland following a meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte, and that he would therefore waive tariffs scheduled to hit European allies.
In a speech on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump for the first time ruled out using force, but demanded “immediate negotiations” to acquire the island from Denmark.
“We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
Meanwhile, the European Parliament decided to suspend its work on a trade deal between the 27-member bloc and the United States, a parliament member said, following President Trump’s repeated threats to take control over Greenland.
The US president did not provide any details on the framework, but added that his threatened tariffs against European countries which were resisting his quest to acquire Greenland was now off the table.
“Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” Trump wrote.







In a speech that veered from topic to topic, Trump also expressed hope of ending the Ukraine war soon.
Trump’s quest to take the strategic Arctic island of Greenland from Nato ally Denmark has deeply shaken the global order and markets.
“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said.
“I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.”
Wall Street stocks opened higher after his speech, and jumped further following his post.
Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China.
But Trump appeared to take the threat of military action off the table, in a dramatic turnaround from his previous threats that the US could use force to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island.
“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.
All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher on Wednesday after Trump’s comments.
Denmark said it was a “positive” sign that Trump had said he wanted to avoid military force — but stressed that the US president had not backed away from his push to acquire Greenland.
“What is quite clear after this speech is that the president’s ambition remains intact,” Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.
Greenland’s government meanwhile unveiled a new brochure on Wednesday offering advice to the population in the event of a “crisis” in the territory, saying it was an “insurance policy”.
‘Immediate negotiations’
Trump repeatedly pushed his claims to Greenland — which he mistakenly called Iceland several times — during lengthy remarks on the deepest crisis in transatlantic relations for decades.
He said he was “seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States” and added that Washington would “remember” if Denmark said no. Trump says Greenland is under threat from Russia and China.







The US president also lambasted Europe on a number of fronts from security to tariffs and the economy, saying it was “not heading in the right direction”.
Trump flew into Davos by helicopter, stepping onto a red carpet laid in the snow — but he flew into a growing international storm over Greenland.
He arrived some two hours behind schedule, after an electrical issue earlier forced Air Force One to turn back to Washington and the president to switch planes.
Europe and Canada had earlier closed ranks against what they view as a threat to the US-led global order from Trump’s territorial ambitions.
French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said Europe would not be bullied. But Trump, who was due to meet a number of leaders in Davos, renewed his attacks on the two leaders, mocking Macron in particular for wearing sunglasses at Davos, which the French president said was because of an eye condition.
‘Thoughtful diplomacy’
Trump also repeatedly expressed doubts on Nato during his speech, saying Washington was treated “so unfairly” and questioning whether the alliance would defend the United States if asked.
Nato chief Mark Rutte, whom Trump was due to meet in Davos, said that “thoughtful diplomacy” was needed to resolve the crisis. The Greenland row has also soured relations with the European Union, which has threatened countermeasures after Trump vowed tariffs of up to 25pc on eight European countries for backing Denmark.
UN chief warns
UN chief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday of world leaders upending international order in a statement made as President Donald Trump said the United States needs to acquire Greenland in a hardline speech at Davos.
“When leaders run roughshod over international law, picking & choosing which rules to follow — they are undermining global order & setting a perilous precedent,” Guterres said on X.
“When a handful of individuals can bend global narratives, sway elections, or dictate the terms of public debate, we are facing inequality and the corruption of institutions.”

The record-high rate has added to the burden on gold jewellery buyers during the ongoing peak wedding season, while investors appear upbeat over the sharp rally triggered by geopolitical tensions, ongoing tariff wars and US President Donald Trump’s efforts to control Greenland.
According to rates issued by the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), based on interbank exchange rates, the domestic 10-gram gold rate rose to Rs434,123, up by Rs10,888 from Tuesday.
On Jan 1, the 10-gram and one-tola gold rates stood at Rs234,568 and Rs273,600, respectively, based on the global gold rate of $2,624 per ounce. To date, prices of 10-gram and one-tola gold have surged by Rs199,555 and Rs232,762, respectively, while the international price has climbed by $2,216 per ounce.
Gold currently leads in terms of returns among select asset classes, with stocks in second place.
It has been observed that local gold prices have shown wide disparities in the past between the official rates announced by the association and open market rates prevailing at jewellery shops. However, on Wednesday, jewellers were offering gold at Rs503,000-505,500 per tola, lower than the association’s rate of Rs506,362.
“The price difference between the association and market rates depends on demand and supply,” APSGJA President Qasim Shikarpuri said, adding that investors were currently driving the gold market rather than jewellery buyers.
“Investors all over the world and in Pakistan are selling dollars to buy gold,” he said, adding that central banks in various countries were also making large purchases of the yellow metal.
He said there was no shortage of gold in the market despite heavy investor interest, claiming that the per-tola gold rate in Pakistan was selling under cost by Rs25,000 compared to rates in Dubai.
Silver
In contrast, investors are also active in purchasing silver, which is currently in short supply due to high demand and is available at a hefty premium.
The one-tola silver (24 karat) rate rose to Rs9,933, up by Rs64 per ounce, while the 10-gram rate climbed to Rs8,515, up by Rs54 per ounce, in line with a slight increase in the world silver price to $94.58 per ounce, up by $0.64.
“Silver is available at Rs14,500 instead of Rs9,933 per tola due to huge demand coupled with its shortage in the market, not only in Pakistan but also in Dubai,” Mr Shikarpuri said, adding that speculation was underway in the silver market.
Meanwhile, All Karachi Jewellers and Manufacturers Association President Mohammad Haseen Qureishi recalled that silver was not available at Rs15,000 per tola on Tuesday, while on Wednesday its price was hovering between Rs13,500 and Rs14,000, depending on availability.

ISLAMABAD: The National Asse­mbly on Wednesday passed a bill seeking secrecy of lawmakers’ assets, a move that had been opposed by the PML-N and PTI in August last year. Interestingly, the bill, moved by PPP’s Shazia Marri, had faced opposition from both parties during a committee meeting in August, but this time the PTI was the only party to oppose it.
The bill was taken up for immediate consideration soon after National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs Chairman Rana Iradat Sharif Khan presented the committee’s report.
Under Section 137 of the Elections Act, all members of parliament and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Section 138 of the Act requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.
The proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the Speaker of the concerned Assembly or, as the case may be, the chairman of the Senate may, on an application made by a member and for reasons to be recorded in writing, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the Commission if such publication would pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the member or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.”
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the amendment aims to strike a balance between transparency and protection of individual rights. It states that while the publication of asset declarations promotes accountability, public trust and good governance, unrestricted disclosure could compromise the personal security and privacy of parliamentarians and their families.
Speaking in the House, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar explained that although members would still be required to submit their financial statements to the ECP, these may not necessarily be made public. He said the bill empowered legislative bodies to exercise greater control over the transparency of financial disclosures.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan of the PTI strongly opposed the amendment, arguing that the proposed cha­n­ges would transfer election-related matters from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to a constitutional court, thereby undermining the judiciary’s authority in electoral issues.
The House also passed the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) bill, making it mandatory for large companies with significant profits to spend one per cent of their profits on CSR activities. The statement of objects and reasons of the bill, moved by Dr Nafisa Shah and introduced through a supplementary agenda, stated that the corporate sector must contribute to the social and economic wellbeing of the poor and needy and help create a better environment for all.
‘Imran in good health’
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry told the House that all facilities were being provided to PTI founder Imran Khan in accordance with the jail manual and that he was in good health. He said meetings were allowed as per the rules and shared statistics showing that 850 people, including family members and doctors, had met the former prime minister.
Responding to points raised by PTI lawmaker Shahid Khatak regarding an alleged ban on meetings and claims of solitary confinement, the minister said that such a large number of meetings had not been allowed for prisoners in the past three decades. He also criticised PTI leaders for repeatedly questioning whether Imran Khan was alive.
Tallal Chaudhry further said the government would proceed with a military operation in certain parts of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, including erstwhile Fata. He said implementation of the National Action Plan was ongoing in consultation with provincial governments and insisted that the KP government was fully on board.
“There will be no sympathy for terrorists, and action will be taken at all costs,” he said while blaming the PTI-led provincial government for unrest in KP due to its failure to establish the Counter Terrorism Dep­artment despite ongoing militant activity.
18th Amendment controversy
Another highlight of the proceedings was renewed controversy over the 18th Amendment after comments by ministers sparked a heated debate on provincial autonomy. The issue res­urfaced after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s remarks and was further fuelled when Minister for Food Security Rana Tanvir Hussain questioned whether “everything was fine after the 18th Amendment”, referring to a recent fire incident in Karachi.
PPP MNA Naveed Qamar reacted sharply, saying Khawaja Asif’s comments should be seen as a government policy statement. He warned that any attempt to transfer municipal services to the Centre would undermine the federal structure. He criticised the defence minister for calling the 18th Amendment a “charade” and accused the government of weakening provincial autonomy.
He urged the government to focus on constitutional issues and public welfare instead of destabilising political moves.
PPP lawmaker Sehar Kamran asked Khawaja Asif to explain how the 18th Amendment was a drama, remarking that issuing an ordinance without the president’s consent and signature was the real “drama”. Senator Aliya Kamran of the JUI-F also termed criticism of the amendment inappropriate, recalling that it had been passed with the consent of the PML-N.
MQM’s Hafeezuddin said there was no harm in discussing the 18th Amendment.
Law Minister Tarar clarified that such remarks should be vie­wed as personal opinions rather than official government policy.
Earlier, during question hour, the House was informed that unauthorised possession of railway land by government departments was being regularised through leases under the railway land policy. Parliamentary Secr­etary for Railways Usman Awaisi said an anti-encroachment drive had been launched to retrieve valuable land, adding that 781.84 acres of Pakistan Railways land had been recovered between July 2024 and June 2025.

GILGIT: Traffic on the Chipurson Valley road, located near the Pakistan-China border close to the Khunjerab Pass, has been restored while government departments, non-governmental organisations, and community groups have dispatched relief items to people affected by the recent quake in the remote valley of Gojal in Upper Hunza.
Local residents and political leaders have urged the government to declare Chipurson a calamity-hit area and provide immediate assistance to the affected population.
On the instructions of Gilgit-Baltistan caretaker chief minister retired Justice Yar Muhammad, the GB Disaster Management Authority sent tents, food packs, kerosene heaters, blankets, warm clothes, and shawls to the affected communities. The link road to Chipurson, which had been blocked at several points, was reopened on an emergency basis.
A 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted Gilgit-Baltistan on Monday, killing one person, injuring four others, and damaging dozens of houses, cattle sheds, and public and private infrastructure. Rescue 1122 reported that Chipurson Valley was the worst-affected area.
Hunza Deputy Commissioner Nizamuddin told Dawn that road access had been blocked and large cracks had appeared in homes, roads, and water channels supplying power houses. NGOs and community organisations from Karimabad, Gulmit, and nearby areas have launched relief campaigns, collecting firewood, food, and tents.
Local residents said over 200 families were forced to live in tents amid sub-zero temperatures, making survival especially difficult for children, elderly people, women, and patients.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu­tio­nal Court (FCC) on Wednesday reserved its ruling on the federal government’s challenge to a set of directions issued by the Lahore High Court (LHC) concerning the prohibition on imports from India.
Headed by Justice Aamer Farooq, a three-judge FCC bench, also comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, took up an appeal filed by the commerce ministry against the Jan 26, 2024 LHC judgement.
The petition was earlier filed before the Supreme Court but after the passage of the 27th Amendment, the case was transferred to the FCC for hearing.
Issued by the federal government under its constitutional and statutory authority, the import ban was imposed through statutory regulatory orders (SROs) Nos 927 and 928(I)/2019, reflecting considerations of foreign policy, national security and sovereign discretion.
Through these SROs, imports from and exports to India were banned for all kinds of goods, including books and journals.
The controversy arose when the SROs were challenged before the LHC with the contention that these regulatory orders, to the extent of banning the import of books from India, were ultra vires the Constitution.
Validity of SROs upheld
Although the LHC upheld the va­­lidity of the SROs by declaring them intra vires the Constitution and the relevant statutory framework, it nonetheless issued certain directions to the federal government.
The LHC directed the federal government to appoint an officer to consider a review or revision of the policy. It also ordered the federal government to ensure that it considered and decided the officer’s recommendations.
One of the directions suggested that the officer should be appointed within the next two months by the commerce ministry and that the appointment should be posted on its website. The petitioners, if so advised, were to file their reviews thereafter.
These directions, despite affirming the legality of the policy, were challenged before the FCC as being beyond the permissible scope of judicial review.
In its petition, the federal government pleaded before the FCC that it was competent to ban one or all go­­ods, or a class of goods, from any one country or from worldwide sources.
It also argued that India was neither an authority in any field of knowledge nor enjoyed a monopoly over wisdom.
It added that as such, banning imports from India, including books or journals, did not infringe any fundamental rights of the respondents.
The petition also stated that the suspension of trade with India was taken in the context of Pakistan’s national interest and its longstanding stance on Kashmir.
‘Judicial overreach’
Appearing on behalf of the revenue division secretary, Advocate Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar argued that the Jan 26, 2024 LHC judgement was legally unsustainable to the extent that it issued directions after upholding the validity of the SROs.
He contended that once the policy decision embodied in the SROs had been affirmed, any further directions amounted to judicial overreach and encroachment upon the executive domain.
The counsel argued that matters relating to trade restrictions, import prohibitions and regulation of commerce with hostile or adversarial foreign states fell squarely within the exclusive domain of the executive under the constitutional scheme.
He emphasised that issues touching upon foreign policy and external relations were traditionally regarded as non-justiciable, and that courts were required to exercise judicial restraint unless a clear violation of the Constitution or fundamental rights was established.
The counsel further contended that constitutional courts were mandated to adjudicate legality and constitutionality, not to issue directions requiring the federal government to revisit, reconsider or reformulate policy decisions.
Such directions, he argued, violated the doctrine of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution and blurred the constitutionally demarcated boundaries between the judiciary and the executive.
Additionally, Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman, appearing on behalf of the federation, submitted that the impugned judgement was not legally sustainable. He stated that the LHC had gone beyond its jurisdiction by interfering in policy matters, which courts were constitutionally barred from doing so.
He added that allowing such directions would amount to judicial encroachment into the executive domain, rendering the judgement legally unsustainable.
After hearing arguments from both sides, the FCC reserved its judgement.

• Senate panel fumes over absence of economic minister, provincial secretaries
ISLAMABAD: Another episode of massive under-invoicing for tax evasion and trade-based money laundering through the import of solar kits came to light before a parliamentary committee, which expressed serious displeasure over the continued absence of the minister for economic affairs and provincial secretaries. 
The Senate Secretariat released selected operational parts of a report presented to the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), detailing grave irregularities in the import of solar home system kits under the Sindh Solar Energy Project (SSEP). 
The report revealed that solar kits were declared at $16-$23.4 per unit for tax purposes by contractors, while payments of up to $112.44 per unit, or about 700 per cent higher, were made by the World Bank for the SSEP, reflecting a difference of $89-96 per unit. Investigations are underway into trade-based money laundering, tax evasion, fund layering and violations of foreign exchange rules. 
According to the report, M/s Beyond Green, Karachi, imported 10 consignments comprising 200,968 solar home system units between December 2024 and July 2025 through clearing agent M/s Vista Impex. The goods were declared under HS Codes 8501.7210 and 8501.711, attracting zero customs duty, 18pc sales tax, 3pc additional sales tax and zero income tax. Declared unit values ranged from $16.1 to $23.4, and four consignments were cleared through the Green Channel. 
Subsequent verification revealed that the goods declarations (GDs) submitted to the Sindh government were either fake or tampered with, a fact officially conveyed on Oct 9, 2025. Further investigation showed that the same kits were supplied to the Sindh government at manifold higher prices. 
Official contracts under the SSEP with M/s Shenzhen LEMI Technology Development Co Ltd, China, revealed a contractual price of approximately $112.44 per kit, excluding duties and taxes. The World Bank reportedly paid this amount directly to the supplier, the FBR report said. 
For tax purposes, the transactional value was worked out at $103.08 per unit, leading to the forwarding of 10 contraventions to customs adjudication authorities. Show-cause notices have been issued and the matter is pending adjudication. 
The Senate committee was inf­or­med that fake invoices amounting to $12.5 million were also generat­­ed. In addition, evidence suggested third-party remittances routed through UAE-based entities, raising alarms of trade-based money laundering, foreign exchange violations and fund layering. The case has been referred for proceedings under the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010, while a comprehensive sales tax audit has been recommended. 
The committee was told that the SSEP implementation period ended on July 31, 2025, but around 30,000 solar kits out of 200,000 could not be distributed within the planned period and would now be handled under a separate arrangement. 
Following the identification of discrepancies, the Sindh cabinet had on Dec 1, 2025 referred the matter to the Enquiries and Anti-Corruption Establishment (EACE). A forensic audit has also been approved and is underway, while the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has taken cognisance of the case and is actively investigating. 
On these revelations, committee chairman Saifullah Abro asked whether any suspensions of suspected officials had taken place and was informed that no suspensions had occurred so far. He directed that a letter be written to the chief minister to ensure that all individuals involved were held accountable. 
Minister’s absence
Earlier, the Senate panel expressed sharp criticism over the continued absence of Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema and senior bureaucrats, as well as the participation of junior officers from provincial governments, terming it a serious disregard for parliamentary oversight. 
An additional secretary from the Economic Affairs Division informed the committee that the minister was attending the World Economic Forum in Davos. The explanation failed to satisfy the senators, with PPP Senator Waqar Mehdi remarking that he did not recall the minister ever attending a committee meeting and demanding that the minister’s chair be removed. 
Chairman Saifullah Abro reminded the meeting that parliamentary rules were explicit, stating that the membership of a committee member or the minister could be cancelled in case of absence on three occasions without prior notice.
“If the minister wants to increase corruption, then he should definitely not be in the committee, but if he wants to stop corruption, then he should come to the committee,” he said, directing that a message be conveyed to the minister that he had not been attending the panel for two years. 
“We are not removing the minister’s chair, but tell him that this behaviour is not good,” Senator Abro said. 
During the meeting, agenda items related to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa projects were postponed and provincial officers were asked to leave after it emerged that officials below grade-20 had been deputed to represent the province. 
The committee decided that a formal letter be written to the KP chief secretary to ensure that provincial secretaries attend the next meeting, failing which the matter would be referred to the Privileges Committee.

The premier made the remarks while addressing a breakfast event at the Pakistan Pavilion on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.
In his remarks, the premier said Pakistan “is moving forward with a sense of achievement and a sense of purpose”, noting a drop in the inflation rate and a reduction in the policy rate.
However, he noted that exports were facing challenges and that social indicators “need to be improved through continuous joint efforts”.
“Our exports, collectively, do face different kinds of challenges,” the premier noted. “But the way forward is very clear: Pakistan has to have export-led growth,” he asserted.
PM Shehbaz said that the government brought in “fundamental structural changes” to the system, such as digitalising revenue collection. He stated that the tax collection-to-GDP ratio stood at 10.5pc, compared to 9pc two years ago, hailing it as a “significant achievement”.



“We are now in the mines and minerals business in a big way,” PM Shehbaz added, citing agreements and memoranda of understanding with American and Chinese companies.
“Pakistan has been blessed with infinite natural resources still buried in the heap of mountains in the north of Pakistan, in Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan,” he said.
He added that Pakistan was “moving speedily” in the fields of cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and information technology (IT).
“Our IT exports have shown remarkable progress in the last few years, in that we brought a lot of instruments which have facilitated IT exports, which stand at $3bn annually,” he said.
In terms of the youth, PM Shehbaz said that the federal and provincial governments had enacted many programmes to empower the youth through vocational training.
“As a result, our youth [are] getting productive employment in Gulf states and other parts of the world because they are highly qualified and highly trained,” he emphasised.
PM Shehbaz then touched on improving relations with the United States, expressing the hope that Islamabad and Washington would “cooperate with each other in a big way” in the fields of mines and minerals, counter-terrorism, IT and AI.
“I think Pakistan is at a point in time where we are going to take off rapidly in agriculture, industry, the mining industry, AI and IT,” the prime minister said. “I think that the future is very promising, I have no doubt about it.”
IMF’s Georgieva acknowledges Pakistan’s reform efforts
Earlier, PM Shehbaz had met International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the WEF.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz briefed Georgieva on the improvement in Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators, stabilisation efforts and progress on institutional reforms.
He stressed Pakistan’s commitment to fiscal discipline, revenue mobilisation and sustainable development, the statement said.







The IMF official acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s reform efforts, the statement said. She stressed the importance of maintaining the momentum of reforms to ensure long-term economic resilience, it added.
The two sides discussed the global economic outlook, challenges faced by emerging economies and the importance of multilateral cooperation in safeguarding economic stability, it added.
Earlier, PM Shehbaz had also met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
According to the PMO, Mustafa expressed his heartfelt gratitude to PM Shehbaz for “Pakistan’s consistent, principled and unwavering support for the Palestinian people”.







“Mustafa personally walked up to PM Shehbaz and introduced himself,” the statement said.
“The Palestinian prime minister thanked Pakistan for supporting the Palestinian stance at international forums and for its role regarding the Palestinian cause,” it added.
The premier is on a three-day visit to the Swiss town (from January 20-22), primarily to lead a high-level delegation from Pakistan, including Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
The premier arrived in Davos on Tuesday. In a post on X, PM Shehbaz wrote that he was visiting Davos to advance Pakistan’s engagement at the WEF with global trade and investment partners.
“Pakistan’s ongoing economic reform journey is unlocking profound opportunities, driven by a resilient and entrepreneurial workforce and significant potential across energy, agriculture, minerals, and emerging technologies,” PM Shehbaz said.







He added that Pakistan was “ready to harness this potential into mutually beneficial economic cooperation and long-term investment”.
Dar’s engagements
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar inaugurated the Pathfinder Group’s Pakistan Pavilion on the sidelines of the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos, according to a post by the Foreign Office on X.
The foreign minister lauded the initiative to showcase Pakistan’s vast economic potential and emerging opportunities on a global platform, while highlighting the dynamism and innovation of the country’s start-ups.







He underscored the critical role of start-ups in advancing socio-economic development and driving innovation across diverse sectors.
FM Dar reaffirmed the government’s commitment to facilitating and promoting entrepreneurs and start-ups, particularly those led by youth, to fully realise the economic potential.
In another post on X by the FO, the foreign minister met his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand on the sidelines of the WEF 2026 meeting.
The two foreign ministers “agreed to explore ways to enhance Pakistan-Canada ties” and “discussed to upscale and strengthen economic and trade relations”, the social media post said.







Later, a post by the FO said Dar also met Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen and expand Pak-Finland bilateral cooperation in key areas, including trade and investment,” the FO’s post stated.







It added that they also exchanged views on important regional and global developments.
“Both sides emphasised advancing a forward-looking and mutually beneficial partnership,” it further stated.</p><small>2026-01-21 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21220522dcb0a9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968246/dispersal-of-power-actually-multiplies-it-khawaja-asif-again-argues-in-favour-of-empowered-local-govt-system' target='_blank'><strong>‘Dispersal of power actually multiplies it’: Khawaja Asif again argues in favour of empowered local govt system</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday reiterated his argument in favour of an empowered local government system, saying that the “dispersal of power actually multiplies power” and “concentration of power diminishes it”.
His fresh remarks come a day after he called for a “meaningful” constitutional amendment to introduce an empowered local government system in the country. During a speech in the National Assembly on Tuesday, he had also remarked that the 18th Amendment had proven to be a “farce” and had “concentrated all powers in provincial capitals”.
The debate in the lower House of Parliament was sparked during a discussion on the Gul Plaza inferno, with Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s Farooq Sattar calling for the creation of more administrative units for better governance in Karachi and strengthening local government systems.
Asif had endorsed Sattar’s views during the NA session.
On Wednesday, he said on X that “empowering local governments means taking the government to the common man’s doorstep”.







In such a scenario, he said, governments in cities such as Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, and Peshawar would be accessible to 250 million people in the country.
He decried that the local government system had not been made functional despite the 18th Amendment — which has devolved several ministeries and departments to the provinces from the Centre but also requires them to further devolve powers to local governments.
The defence minister contended that when a local government system will become functional, “people will not be dependent on bureaucracy and will be able to elect empowered representatives and institutions through their vote”.
And the common man would be able to hold them accountable if they don’t deliver, he added.
He further stated that amenities such as water, sanitation, education and healthcare would be available to the people through the local government system, which would establish its own taxation system.
“There are countless examples of this in the world; to some extent, even the judicial system and police are under the authority of elected local governments,” he said, adding that “weak and local bodies do not deliver”.
“Politically, they cause damage, not benefit.”
The defence minister stressed that strengthening local bodies would help establish the authority of the people and strengthen and sustain the bond between the government and the people.
“Empower the people through local institutions. Do not keep these institutions subordinate to the bureaucracy.
“Dispersal of power actually multiplies power. Concentration of power diminishes it,” he said.
Constitutional amendments
The MQM-P has been calling for empowering local governments for long, and had also proposed that a provision to this effect be included in the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed last year. It later blamed the PPP for opposing the proposal, saying that it was eventually withdrawn from the legislation.
The party has, however, claimed that its proposal will be included in the next constitutional amendment.
During his speech in the NA on Tuesday, Asif said: “The 18th Amendment has proved to be a farce. All powers have been concentrated in provincial capitals. There are no local governments, and where they do exist, they have no power.”
He supported the MQM-P’s demand for empowering the local government system, saying that given Karachi’s size, it was not humanly possible to manage it within the existing system.
“If we want to empower the people of Pakistan in a true sense, a local government system would have to be introduced,” he said.
He also recalled the initially proposed provision pertaining to local governments included in the 27th Amendment, saying that it had to be withdrawn due to “political wrangling”.
The defence minister also called for a uniform curriculum across the country, which he said was also proposed in the 27th Amendment. But the recommendation had to be “dropped as no agreement was reached” on it, he regretted.
Reiterating his demand for a local government system, he said, “This House will be meaningless unless the people are empowered.”
He said this country needed a system in which the people feel empowered, calling for constitutional amendments for the introduction of an empowered local government system and a uniform curriculum across the country.</p><small>2026-01-21 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2119564987f1bc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968203/30-bodies-recovered-from-single-shop-following-deadly-fire-at-karachis-gul-plaza' target='_blank'><strong>30 bodies recovered from single shop following deadly fire at Karachi’s Gul Plaza</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: In a harrowing development, at least 30 bodies were recovered from a gutted shop as rescuers combed through the wreckage of Karachi’s Gul Plaza on Wednesday.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the remains of 30 humans had been recovered from a shop called “Dubai Crockery” located on the mezzanine floor.
He said that earlier in the day, rescue workers had recovered three more bodies, which had taken the toll from 28 to 31. He added that with the discovery of the bodies from the gutted shop, the death toll was estimated to have risen to 61.
However, he cautioned that a final conclusion about the death toll could only be reached after receiving the DNA reports.
He said that the relatives of those missing as well as the shopkeepers had previously indicated the possibility of there being a large number of people at the shop.
Raza said that as per the last contact with the victims, they had believed they would be safe and the fire would be controlled but had suffocated to death while waiting.
Regarding the visit of a bomb disposal squad to the scene of the fire, the South police chief said that so far no evidence of mischief had emerged during the initial investigation.
A resident of the area, Rasheed, told Dawn that the shop had announced a sale for the wedding season. For this purpose, it had decided to stay open till 2am, even though it usually closed at 10pm.
The fire had erupted at the Gul Plaza on Saturday night. While the fire at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, visited the gutted plaza. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner.
Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous.
Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards.
The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far.
“We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared.
KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots.
He said one portion of the building had been cleared while two other portions were in the process of being cleared.
“We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable.
He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was recieved about the fire on Saturday night.
He further added that shopkeepers had created a chaos-like situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops.
He said that the door leading to the buildin’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted which was why all the exits were closed.
Rimpa Plaza affected due to blaze
According to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), a part of the structure of Rimpa Plaza — another shopping mall adjacent to Gul Plaza — has also been affected due to continued exposure to heat and fire.
SBCA Director General Muzammil Halepota told Dawn that three floors of the 13-storey building had been affected, and a SBCA technical committee had visited the site on Tuesday.
They found that two pillars had been weakened and the SBCA suggested jacketing to strengthen the pillars by adding a layer of steel supports around them.
“An SBCA team has started the process,” Halepota said, adding that a notice had also been issued to the owners of Rimpa Plaza regarding the pillars’ repair.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi also visited Gul Plaza. Speaking to the media at the site, he said the inquiry into the incident was a complicated one as it had multiple angles.
He said the matter would have to be probed from all angles, and the inquiry committee would try to make “long-term and far-reaching recommendations” to the government.
Tessori meets delegation of traders
Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met a delegation led by Gul Plaza President Tanveer Pasta and Karachi Chamber of Commerce’s Javed Balwani.
A statement issued by the governor’s office said Pasta appreciated Tessori’s efforts for the “timely rescue operation and effective measures” after the fire erupted at Gul Plaza and thanked him for “raising his voice for the victims” of the tragedy at every forum.
“During the meeting, Tanveer Pasta agreed, in principle, with the recommendations of the Sindh governor and Karachi Chamber of Commerce,” the statement said, without elaborating on the said recommendations.
All Gul Plaza records available, SBCA maintains
The SBCA, a day earlier, had rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”.
“The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”.
According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998.
“Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said.
“A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.”
The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies.
It is worth noting that South DIG Asad Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire.
“The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body.
“The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.</p><small>2026-01-21 18:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/212126105ec97c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968236/pakistan-7-muslim-countries-announce-decision-to-join-trumps-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, 7 Muslim countries announce decision to join Trump’s Board of Peace</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and seven other Muslim-majority countries on Wednesday released a statement announcing their decision to join US President Donald Trump’s so-called ‘Board of Peace’.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Qatar welcomed the invitation “extended to their leaders” by Trump.
“The ministers announce their countries’ shared decision to join the Board of Peace. Each country will sign the joining documents according to its respective relevant legal and other necessary procedures, including Egypt, Pakistan, and the UAE, that have already announced to join,” the joint statement said.
It should be noted that all eight countries had worked with Trump in October last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. The UAE had announced its decision to join the board on Tuesday while Pakistan and Egypt had separately announced it on Wednesday.







“The ministers reiterate their countries’ support for the peace efforts led by President Trump, and reaffirm their countries’ commitment to supporting the implementation of the mission of the Board of Peace as a transitional administration, as set out in the Comprehensive Plan to end the Gaza Conflict and endorsed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803, aimed at consolidating a permanent ceasefire, supporting the reconstruction of Gaza, and advancing a just and lasting peace grounded in the Palestinian right to self-determination and statehood in accordance with international law, thereby paving the way for security and stability for all countries and peoples of the region,” the statement said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working with regional partners for peace in Gaza.
“Pakistan has been and will continue to work with our brotherly Arab- Islamic countries for lasting peace in Gaza and for ensuring the right to self-determination of our Palestinian brothers and sisters,” he said on X.







The development came hours after a separate announcement by the Foreign Office (FO) said Pakistan had accepted US President Donald Trump’s invitation to join the so-called “Board of Peace” with the view to “achieving lasting peace in Gaza”. The invitation for Pakistan to join the Board of Peace was extended last week.
“In response to the invitation extended to Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif by President of the United States Donald J. Trump, Pakistan would like to announce its decision to join the Board of Peace as part of its ongoing efforts to support the implementation of the Gaza peace plan under the framework of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803,” the FO said in a statement.







The statement added that Pakistan was hopeful that with the creation of this framework, “concrete steps will be taken towards the implementation of a permanent ceasefire, further scaling up of humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, as well as reconstruction of Gaza”.
“Pakistan also hopes that these efforts will lead to the realisation of the right to self-determination of the people of Palestine, through a credible, time-bound political process, consistent with international legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions, resulting in the establishment of an independent, sovereign, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital,” the statement read.
The FO concluded the statement, saying: “Pakistan looks forward to continuing to play a constructive role as part of the Board of Peace for the achievement of these goals as well as to end the suffering of our Palestinian brothers and sisters.”
Trump had originally proposed establishing the board when he announced his plan last September to end the conflict in Gaza. But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlined a broad role for the body in ending conflicts globally.
A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.
The inclusion of a ‘charter’ in the invitation letter triggered concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.
Meanwhile, Financial Times has reported that the Trump administration plans to expand its Board of Peace into a permanent global entity to rival the UN.

 

According to the charter sent to prospective members, the board is designed to be a “more nimble and effective international peace-building body” chaired by Donald Trump himself.
The board would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts, according to the charter’s copy seen by Reuters.
The draft charter grants broad executive authority to Trump and allows him to serve as chairman indefinitely, subject only to voluntary resignation or removal due to incapacity confirmed by a unanimous board vote.
The document gives the chairman the authority to appoint and remove member states — decisions that would require a two-thirds majority vote to overturn. According to the text, Trump would hold effective veto power over board decisions. The charter states rulings will be “made by a majority of the member states present and voting, subject to the approval of the chairman”.
It also grants him the “exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities” to fulfill the board’s mission.
The charter critiques current international structures and advocates for pragmatic judgement, common sense, and courage to abandon often ineffective methods and institutions for lasting peace.
Only a few, including Hungary, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have so far accepted the invitation to join the board without reservations.

Speaking to the media, Gohar said that it was wrong to say that negotiations would only be held on specific topics.
“It is wrong to say that negotiations will be held on this topic but this topic cannot be included in negotiations,” he said.
“If you want to hold dialogue, you should speak on all topics,” he said. At the same time, the PTI chairman said that he did not have the authority to negotiate with the government.
He said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas — who were recently appointed opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate, respectively — had been given the authority to hold talks with the government.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has stated that PTI founder Imran Khan has given Achakzai and Abbas the responsibility of making decisions — be it about talks with the government or protests.
“I will give them my consultation if they require it,” Gohar said.
He further said that if the government wished to “shake the hand” of the opposition, it should do so with both of its hands.
“The stick and carrot policy does not work. [Throwing] a punch with one hand and extending the other one does not work,” he said.
Gohar also said that PTI founder Imran was facing a multitude of cases, adding that the ex-premier’s lawyers should be allowed to meet him.
He said that a PTI delegation had held a meeting with National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and highlighted the fact that meetings with Imran were not being allowed.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
However, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran.
Meanwhile, in his maiden speech as the National Assembly opposition leader on Monday, Achakzai had extended an olive branch to the government and offered “unconditional support” to empower Parliament.
PTI rejects NA’s passage of bill seeking to amend Elections Act
Separately, the PTI rejected the passage of the Elections (Amendment) Bill 2026 by the National Assembly, terming it a “direct assault” on the fundamental principles of the right to information, transparency, and accountability.
“This bill grants parliamentarians the ability to hide details of their assets from the public under the vague and undefined guise of ‘security concerns,’ which essentially provides a legal shield for the current ruling class,” the party said in a statement.
“Such laws do not strengthen democracy; instead, they weaken it and severely undermine the public’s trust in the government,” it said.
The PTI alleged that parties which claimed to champion democracy, transparency, and parliamentary values were now legislating to “conceal the ill-gotten wealth” they had accumulated through “corrupt practices and misuse of power”.
“The nation is well aware of the sources of their illicit wealth; it is the result of corruption, looting, and the abuse of authority,” it said.
“The public is fully informed, and no law can hide the truth. This bill is an affront to the consciousness of the people.
“These parties, who repeatedly preach about accountability, good governance, and democratic values, are practically erecting walls of immunity and protection for themselves,” it stated.
The PTI contended that such laws proved that some political parties represented not the public but their own personal and class interests, and the dual standard was hollowing out Pakistan’s democratic system from within.
“If any member of parliament has genuine security concerns, the solution is not to hide assets, but for the government to ensure the protection of their life and property,” it said.
“Keeping asset details hidden from the public opens the door to corruption and provides the political elite with unjust protection for their ill-gotten wealth,” it said.
The PTI said that this bill contradicted the global principles of transparent governance and was a “conspiracy” to push Pakistan further into the quagmire of unchecked corruption.
“In line with the vision of PTI’s leader Imran Khan, the party has always been a strong advocate for transparency. Therefore, this controversial amendment must be immediately revoked,” it said.
“The nation has the right to be informed about the sources of its representatives’ wealth. Transparency is not a privilege but the foundation of democracy,” it added.</p><small>2026-01-21 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646461-pakistani-national-deported-from-us-after-green-card-interview-family-appeals-for-review' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani national deported from US after green card interview; family appeals for review</strong></a><br><p>
