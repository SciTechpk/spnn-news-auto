It was only days ago that the airport was said to have turned into “a place of embarrassment for international travellers and daily humiliation for Pakistani citizens thanks to basic operational incompetence” where one officer was expected to manage three parallel lines at immigration.  
The passengers were constantly pointing out the problems to the airport staff, but there neither seemed to be the willingness nor the capacity to fix things.  
The bags which had already been passed through a scanner once were being scanned again before being sent to baggage, which was a complete waste of time and effort.  

PAA spokesperson admits immigration process remains ‘most frequently raised concern among passengers’

But was that an alternate universe where passengers also claimed that airport staff had demanded money from them in exchange for use of luggage carts? And what of those unending queues facing closed doors outside at international departures? Well, they aren’t there anymore.  
Seeing three travellers squatting near a pillar on Wednesday, one asked them if they had been waiting there for long. “Yes, we reached here about half an hour ago,” replied one of them as he eyed the electronic board to see if check-in for their flight had been announced. Another passenger en route to Jeddah said that he arrived four hours before his flight “because I always do that”.  
There was also no apparent shortage of luggage carts or trolleys at the passenger drop-off area, contrary to what had been reported earlier. Airport staff were seen bringing more freed up trolleys from the departure lounge which they had neatly lined up.  
A group wearing identical brown cross body bags gathered to say goodbye to family members who had come to see them off. All looked relaxed and happy as they loaded their bags on the trolleys, posed for pictures and enjoyed the sweetmeats being distributed among them by a family member.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said while occasional peak-hour pressures can occur in a high-volume gateway like Jinnah International, “the immigration process managed by the FIA remains the most frequently raised concern among passengers. Reports of any difficulties with trolley availability, on the other hand, have been very limited and appear to reflect an isolated occurrence rather than a recurring issue.

He was chairing a meeting at the Central Police Office to review the implementation of reform measures in the Punjab Police under the ‘Fast, Fearless, Transparent Justice’ initiative.
He said that panic buttons were being installed outside police stations so that citizens could immediately lodge complaints in case of any misconduct or lack of hearing.
He directed that at all police stations, offices, checkpoints, and Khidmat Marakaz, citizens should be addressed respectfully as “sir or madam” and “sahib or sahiba”. He said that counseling and training of officers and personnel would be arranged to improve the overall perception of Punjab Police’s conduct.

IGP also speaks to citizens through 1787 Complaint Centre

It was made clear that officials involved in corruption, abuse of authority, and misconduct would face immediate and strict accountability.
The IGP directed that CCTV cameras installed in all police stations be kept fully operational and backup systems be ensured.
A modern control and monitoring room was being activated at the Central Police Office for effective monitoring of police stations, while through the Safe Cities mechanism, direct monitoring of police stations, SHOs, moharrirs, and investigation rooms would be carried out.
He emphasised on making core policing, supervision, and the command system more effective for crime control and said that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was herself overseeing all police reform measures.
The meeting also issued instructions to strictly enforce traffic laws and to continue the crackdown against violations.
He said that the investigation process and the activities of citizens visiting police stations would be fully recorded and that key performance indicators (KPIs) scorecards would be implemented in practical terms. He said that he was himself calling applicant citizens from the Central Police Office to obtain feedback.
He directed RPOs and DPOs to initiate direct contacts and meetings for redressal of citizens’ grievances, while in cases of abuse, harassment, and violence, investigations involving affected women and children should be conducted within the bounds of complete civility and respect. Instructions were also given to resolve cases of women and children on a priority basis with the help of data from Virtual Women Police Stations and the Center for Child Safety.
Meanwhile, the IGP initiated direct contact with citizens through the 1787 Complaint Center and spoke with several citizens via phone calls. He obtained information about the duration of redressal of received applications and complaints, police response, and overall conduct.
Citizens also shared their feedback regarding the actions taken and responses by the police.
Mr Kareem directed RPOs, DPOs, and other supervisory officers to take immediate action on citizens’ applications and provide relief without delay.
He further directed that all complaints received via phone calls, SMS, email, and other channels be resolved immediately in accordance with the prescribed timelines and SOPs.
He urged citizens to register complaints on 1787 in case of any irregularity or misconduct by the police force.
The IGP received a detailed briefing on the 1787 dashboard and complaints from across the regions.
During the briefing, Punjab Additional IG Imran Arshad, Additional IG (Internal Accountability) Imran Mehmood, Additional IG (Logistics) Fawad-ud-Din Qureshi, AIG Inspection, AIG Operations, and other officers were also present.
Published in Dawn, February 12th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-12 04:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698d3d953647e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972654/super-tax-at-a-cost' target='_blank'><strong>Super tax at a cost</strong></a><br><p>SUPER tax, an additional tax imposed on the highest earning taxpayers, was recently upheld by the Federal Consti­tut­ional Court (FCC). The government’s victory may prove Pyrrhic as it will likely have an adverse effect on economic growth.
Super tax is an additional charge imposed on top of a taxpayer’s normal income tax liability once their income crosses a certain threshold. The idea is simple and politically attractive: the highest income earners should contribute more to help the country through fiscal stress. On paper, it sounded fair. In practice, the reality is not so straightforward. For example, assume a business earns Rs300 million in revenue in a year. And let’s assume that after expenses and other deductions, its taxable profit comes to Rs120m.

 

Under the normal corporate tax rate of around 29 per cent, the business would pay roughly Rs34.8m in income tax, leaving about Rs85.2m. Because its income falls within the slab attracting 4pc super tax, a further Rs4.8m is taken as super tax, money that could otherwise have gone into expansion, job creation, or new investment.
Recently, after prolonged litigation, the FCC upheld the constitutionality of super tax imposed under Sections 4B and 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. With the exception of limited and narrow relief granted to a handful of petroleum companies — primarily due to sovereign guarantees contained in their agreements with the state — the court dismissed all challenges brought by taxpayers.
The message was clear: super tax is lawful and constitutional and arrangements should immediately be made by taxpayers to pay the outstanding liabilities. Of particular concern was the court’s approval of the retrospective application of super tax. Amongst other things, businesses plan their investments, hiring and expansion based on the tax laws in force during a given year.
Yet under this approach, once the year has ended, the law can be changed and applied retrospectively — suddenly imposing a tax that did not exist when those decisions were made. The result is a disruption of business planning, destroying predictability and undermining confidence in the tax system. When taxes can be rewritten after the fact, financial certainty — the backbone of investment — crumbles.
The entities paying the bulk of super tax are already Pakistan’s highest taxpayers — large corporations, banks, telecom companies, manufacturers, and energy firms that collectively contribute a major portion of total tax revenue. These are also the same entities that employ thousands of workers, invest billions in infrastructure, and drive exports and services.

A tax that looks fair in theory may turn harmful in practice.

Imposing repeated additional levies on the same pool of compliant, high-performing taxpayers is a risky strategy. When profitability is penalised year after year, businesses do not simply absorb the cost indefinitely. They react. Some scale down operations. Some delay expansion. Some shift investments abroad. Others restructure in ways that reduce taxable income. In the worst cases, they exit altogether. The result? A shrinking tax base.
In such circumstances, the economy as a whole suffers — including the government’s own revenue streams. A tax that looks fair in theory can become harmful in practice if it undermines the engines of economic growth. Ironically, the very tax meant to extract more revenue from successful businesses can end up reducing long-term collections by discouraging growth and investment.
Pakistan’s tax base remains relatively small compared to the size of its economy and population. At present there are around 8m registered taxpayers which constitute only about 5pc of adults in Pakistan. Pakistan’s real challenge is not squeezing more out of the same limited group of taxpayers. It is broadening the tax base, documenting the econo-my and ensuring that those who currently pay little or nothing are brought into the system.

 

There is another consequence to the imposition of super tax, which is harder to measure but equally important, ie, investor confidence. When profitable enterprises are repeatedly subjected to new and retrospective tax burdens, the signal sent to both local and foreign investors is one of unpredictability. Businesses thrive on stability.
They can plan around high taxes, but not around constantly shifting fiscal goalposts. Super tax, particularly with its repeated extensions, expansions and retrospective application, risks reinforcing the perception that success in Pakistan is something to be taxed punitively rather than encouraged.
The real issue is no longer legality but economic wisdom. If Pakistan’s most productive businesses slow, relocate or shut down, no tax can replace the jobs, investment and growth that disappear with them. An economy is strengthened by nurturing its base, not by draining its strongest pillars.

The petitioner argued that despite being the senior-most qualified officer, he had been bypassed for the post of chief fire officer, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, in favour of a junior officer transferred from another department in violation of service rules.
The court declined to adjudicate the merits. Instead, it directed the mayor of Karachi to examine the petitioner’s service record and, if found eligible, consider him for promotion along with other candidates — within three months. No decision followed.
Six months later on the night of January 17, 2026, barely a kilometre from the constitutional court as the crow flies, at around 10 pm, a massive fire erupted at Gul Plaza, once one of the city’s most significant commercial spaces. Spread across four floors and more than 200,000 square feet, the complex housed approximately 1,200 densely packed shops.

What the Gul Plaza inquiry did not do is far more revealing than what it did. By treating the blaze as an isolated tragedy rather than a recurring risk, it erased institutional memory and accountability

For decades, Gul Plaza had been a rare equaliser in a divided city—serving customers across class lines with an unmatched mix of garments, fabrics, carpets, household goods, toys, jewellery, furniture, electronics, and everyday necessities.
As journalist Aniqa Khan noted in an earlier Dawn article, Gul Plaza’s singular appeal lay in its promise of completeness. It was one of the few places in Karachi where affordability, convenience, and variety converged, allowing class distinctions to quietly dissolve.
That promise went up in flames within hours.

 

The fire spread rapidly, fuelled by an exceptionally high combustible load and exacerbated by dry January weather. At temperatures of 250–300°C, concrete begins to lose strength; between 600–1,000°C, reinforcing steel fails. Beyond this point, materials — and people — do not merely burn; they are incinerated. Roof slabs collapsed in succession as firefighters struggled against severe shortages of water and chemical suppressants. By dawn, Gul Plaza was reduced to smouldering ruins. Lives were lost. Thousands of livelihoods were erased overnight.
Predictably, outrage followed. Equally predictably, so did scapegoating.
In a knee-jerk response, the municipal commissioner of KMC was removed, as was the DIG traffic Karachi — though the latter’s transfer may have been coincidental, given reports of unrelated inquiries. What did not follow was any serious reckoning with the systemic failures that made the disaster inevitable.
On January 19, the Sindh government constituted an inquiry committee comprising the Commissioner and the additional inspector general of police, Karachi. Within nine days, the committee submitted a 21-page report with 17 findings and five recommendations. It reviewed CCTV footage, recorded 16 witness statements, and incorporated reports from five departments responsible for fire prevention and response.
What it did not do is far more revealing than what it did.
Acts of omission
The inquiry confirms that the fire spread rapidly due to flammable materials and poor ventilation. It documents dispatch timings, lists the number of fire tenders and snorkels mobilised, and recounts police and district administration responses. It narrates the disaster—but never interrogates it.
There is no forensic determination of the fire’s cause. No technical analysis. No assessment of compliance with building or fire safety regulations. No acknowledgment that Gul Plaza had suffered multiple previous fires, including major incidents in 2008 and 2016. By treating the blaze as an isolated tragedy rather than a recurring pattern of risk, the inquiry erases institutional memory—and with it, accountability.

 

Responsibility is conspicuously absent. The report does not examine the conduct of approving or inspecting authorities. It does not identify ownership or management structures with clarity. It assigns no liability to the building’s owners or management committee. No findings of negligence or breach of duty are made. No civil, criminal, or administrative action is recommended.
Those legally responsible for public safety are treated as bystanders.
Operational failures are acknowledged but never examined. Water scarcity — central to the disaster — is mentioned without serious analysis of hydrant availability, water pressure, or decades of corruption in a neglected fire-fighting infrastructure. There is no assessment of the combustible load, unsafe storage practices, or structural vulnerabilities that accelerated collapse.
The report is also silent on the future. It offers no framework for compensation, rehabilitation, or protection for displaced traders. In a city where disasters have often cleared the ground for lucrative redevelopment, this omission is not benign. The shop-owners and traders of Gul Plaza are rendered invisible at the very moment their vulnerability is greatest.
To understand the depth of this failure, some historical context is instructive.
The question of water
M.A. Jinnah Road — formerly Bunder Road — was constructed in 1915. Walker, the colonial engineer overseeing its construction was criticised by the Bombay Presidency for building a road deemed excessively wide. He defended the decision, insisting that a road leading to the port must be at least as wide. He insisted that a port city required infrastructure built for the future.
Crucially, hydrants connected to subsoil wells duly covered for public safety and marked with steel plates with standard inscription SSW 10’ (subsoil well within 10’ radius) were installed along the road, serving both fire-fighting and washing Bunder Road — at a time when Karachi’s formal water supply system did not yet exist.
More than a century later, those priorities have been abandoned. On the night of the Gul Plaza fire, large sections of an increasingly encroached upon M.A. Jinnah Road were dug up for years-long BRT construction. Fire tenders, lacking water at nearby stations, were forced to shuttle more than 15 kilometres each way to the NIPA hydrant. Time was lost. Structures collapsed. People died.
Gul Plaza itself is no planning accident. Built on Plot No. 32 in Preedy Quarters, the property has passed through multiple owners and regularisations. Originally approved for fewer floors, additional storeys were legalised under successive political regimes—without meaningful fire safety audits. No-objection certificates were issued despite the absence of even rudimentary fire suppression systems.
This is not bureaucratic oversight. It is governance by abdication.
Administratively, city falls under the authority of the commissioner and the additional IGP Karachi. Rather than fixing responsibility where it belonged, both were tasked with “assigning responsibility at the earliest” — a formulation that ensured precisely what followed: nothing.
The Gul Plaza inquiry reads less like an investigation than a damage narrative. It reflects institutional self-protection, not a commitment to preventing the next catastrophe.
Yet, Gul Plaza is not an anomaly. It is a warning.
What the city should aspire towards
Karachi’s disaster management capacity remains severely constrained by the absence of a unified incident command structure, inadequate emergency service coverage, weak enforcement of building regulations, poor risk-informed urban planning, insufficient protection for vulnerable livelihoods, and the lack of independent post-disaster accountability.
For a dense, resource-constrained Afro-Asian megacity, preparedness benchmarks must be realistic, affordable, and scalable — drawn from cities facing similar constraints. The goal is not perfection, but systems that are good enough to save lives consistently.
Fire services must meet basic urban standards. Response times should average no more than six to eight minutes in dense areas, with stations spaced every three to four kilometres. Special-risk zones — ports, industrial areas, high-rise clusters, old city precincts — require dedicated coverage. Most importantly, stations must be self-sufficient for at least 24 to 48 hours during disasters. Unfortunately, 17 out of 28 fire stations in Karachi has no water connection provision for its storage.
Equipment standards need not be extravagant: one to two foam-capable fire tenders, rapid-response vehicles for congested streets, basic rescue tools. High-risk areas should share aerial ladders and Urban Search and Rescue units.
Most importantly, Karachi must prioritise rugged, repairable vehicles built on proven local truck platforms, not over-specialised imports that fail under local maintenance conditions. Staffing must be adequate, led by a senior station chief and 18-24 firemen manning three shifts. They must be trained monthly — not annually — and supported by reliable water supply, functional hydrants, and dedicated radio communications. During disasters, radio — not WhatsApp — saves lives.
But hardware alone will not save Karachi.
Leadership crisis
What the city lacks most is executive leadership during emergencies — a unified incident command with legal responsibility as well as authority to override routine bureaucracy, mobilise all civil agencies, and requisition para-military support when civilian capacity is overwhelmed. Disaster response cannot be run by committees or parallel press briefings. Fragmented authority costs time — and time costs lives.
Preparedness is political. Disasters in Karachi are not acts of fate; they are foreseeable governance failures. Less than a month since the incident, the Gul Plaza fire already appears to be fading from the public discourse. However, it did not merely expose broken infrastructure. It exposed a system unwilling to assign responsibility, enforce standards, or learn from tragedy.
Given that key approvals and regularisations occurred during the tenures of MQM’s senior minister in Sindh Farooq Sattar and Jamaat-i-Islami mayor Naimatullah Khan, the current Sindh government may have found it politically expedient to seek a judicial inquiry. Yet inquiries of the kind required after the Gul Plaza fire demand more than legal formality.
They require specialised technical expertise, an understanding of Karachi’s uniquely complex socio-political and historical context, and — above all — carefully framed terms of reference that determine whether accountability is pursued or quietly evaded.
It may be a high time that a city as heavily barricaded and policed by federal and provincial law enforcement agencies as Karachi, need to refocus itself on actual public safety.
Until that changes, the next siren will arrive too late.

Analysts say a decisive result is crucial for steady governance in the nation of 175 million, as the deadly anti-Hasina protests triggered months of unrest and disrupted key industries, including the garments sector, the worlds second-largest exporter.
It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.
The contest pits two coalitions led by former allies, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with opinion polls giving an edge to the BNP.
In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.
“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”
Hasina’s Awami League is banned, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi deteriorate.
Unlike previous elections marred by opposition boycotts and intimidation, more than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, are vying for 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.
Voting in one constituency has been postponed due to the death of a candidate. At least 50 parties are contesting in total, a national record.
“This election is not just another routine vote, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of an interim government installed after Hasinas ouster, said this week.
The public awakening we witnessed against long-standing anger, inequality, deprivation and injustice finds its constitutional expression in this election.
In parallel, there will be a referendum on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and imposing a two-term limit on the prime minister.
Despite the crowded field and expectations of a close race, the campaign period remained largely peaceful, barring a few incidents.
The crucial test for Bangladesh now will be to ensure the election is conducted fairly and impartially, and for all parties to then accept the result, said Thomas Kean, a senior consultant with the International Crisis Group.
If that happens, it will be the strongest evidence yet that Bangladesh has indeed embarked on a period of democratic renewal.
On election day, more than 100,000 soldiers from the army, navy and air force will assist nearly 200,000 police in maintaining law and order.
Early start, late finish
Polling opened at 7:30am (0230 GMT) and closes at 4:30pm. Counting will begin soon after, with early trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, Election Commission officials said.
Nearly 128 million people are registered to vote, 49% of them women. But only 83 female candidates are contesting.
Corruption and inflation are the biggest issues among voters, a recent survey found.
The two prime ministerial candidates are the BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman. They are not related.
Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election.
Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.
But some are determined to cast their ballots.
“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.</p><small>2026-02-12 04:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972653/extra-regional-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Extra-regional threat</strong></a><br><p>THE UN Security Council Monitoring Team’s regular reports point to the threats terrorist groups continue to pose across the world. These reports have long painted a grim picture of the situation in Afghanistan vis-à-vis the permissive environment in that country for violent outfits.
The latest document suggests that the banned TTP may potentially pose an extra-regional threat. Pakistan has been suffering from the brutality of TTP violence for nearly two decades. But if the warning is not heeded, the terrorist group may spread its tentacles to other states. The UN report also warns about the presence of IS-K terrorists at locations along the Pak-Afghan border.
The latest document presents an unflattering yet unsurprising picture of the terrorist milieu in Afghanistan. For example, it says that the TTP is “one of the largest terrorist groups in Afghanistan”, while it is accorded “greater liberty and support from the de facto authorities” (the Afghan Taliban).

 

The report also expresses apprehensions that the TTP may expand cooperation with Al Qaeda, which, too, enjoys cordial ties with the Kabul regime. And while IS-K is under “sustained counterterrorism pressure”, the violent outfit retains “significant operational and combat capability”. One bloodstained example of these capabilities was witnessed in the shape of the Feb 6 imambargah bombing in Islamabad. Notably, the UNSC report says that while the Afghan Taliban authorities say no terrorist groups are active in their country, “no Member State supported this view”.
As the report illustrates, there is a need for immediate action where the terrorist threat emanating from Afghanistan is concerned. Pakistan has borne the brunt of the TTP’s barbaric campaign, losing thousands of valuable lives to the group’s terrorist attacks.
If the TTP is not stopped in its tracks immediately, other countries in the region may be next on the terrorist group’s hit list. That is why, as this paper has consistently argued, there is a need to address the problem of Afghanistan-based militancy collectively, with all of Kabul’s neighbours sending the same message to the Taliban: they must take action against violent groups on Afghan soil. Many would have thought that the Taliban would have learnt a lesson from hosting Al Qaeda during their first stint in power, thereafter paving the way for the US invasion following 9/11.

 

But this is clearly not the case as Kabul’s rulers continue to host bloodthirsty militants, even as they fight IS-K — purely for ideological reasons since IS-K does not recognise the Taliban’s legitimacy. Afghanistan’s neighbours must be unambiguous in stating that if Kabul wants regional recognition, trade and integration, it must rein in terrorist groups. Further, Pakistan must stay alert and prevent the infiltration of IS-K terrorists and neutralise their cells and collaborators in the country.

Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation.
“Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources, combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee.
Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.” 
He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.”
During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics.
Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States.
Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups.
When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere.
The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect.
The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests.
He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific.
Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence.
At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said.
Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people. 
She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute.
Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable.
Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces.
“We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.</p><small>2026-02-12 03:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698d3ec3cbc61.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972656/net-metering-fiasco' target='_blank'><strong>Net metering fiasco</strong></a><br><p>IF you are trying to follow the discussion around the government’s attempt to reduce net metering rates and find it too technical or too confusing, don’t worry. You’re not alone, and more importantly, as an ordinary consumer, you don’t need to get into the technicalities. All you need, as a user of electricity, is a clear and firm idea of where your specific interests lie.
Around 10 years ago, the electricity in my bills cost me Rs20 per unit, including taxes and everything. Today, the same cost is around Rs60 and sometimes as high as Rs70. All of us have been hit by this tsunami of inflation. Some of us tried to cope with it by investing in a rooftop solar system in the hopes that once it pays itself off, it will provide us with some protection from the skyrocketing price of electricity.
These prices did not skyrocket because of anything we did. They rose for two reasons. First, because the rupee fell against the dollar, and most of our electricity prices are indexed to the dollar since we rely on imported fuel and equipment in order to generate it. Second, the bureaucrats cannot run the power system and won’t let anyone else run it either. The most visible marker of their failure to operate the power system is the rise of the circular debt.

 

So they kept taking the costs of their failures and passing them on to us. When their failures to run the power system led to the rise of the circular debt in the years since 2005, they moved to make the rest of us pay the interest cost of carrying this debt. In 2014, they succeeded, and we have had interest payments on the circular debt as part of our bills ever since. This is just one example, though a stark one. In 2016, they decided to make costs of raising a CPEC security force a ‘pass-through item’, meaning it would be part of the costs of a project that consumers pay through their bills. In 2023, they also started applying a withholding tax on income from net metering benefits. Good luck getting this refunded at the end of the year when you come around to filing your tax returns!

Either way, we had no choice but to pay. We were prisoners inside this grid.

The story goes on and on. Over the years, so many costs were bundled into the system — some visible in the bills but many tucked away as ‘pass-through’ items from generation companies which you cannot see but that are inside the variable charges of your bill — that the power system be­­came too large and too unwieldy for the bureaucrats and its losses mounted.
In 2007, when I was covering the rise of the circular debt, it made headlines when it crossed Rs30 billion. By 2024, it had crossed Rs2 trillion. There were many contributing factors behind this rise, including system losses, but also larger macroeconomic mismanagement by the government, which led to devaluation of the rupee and hikes in dollar-indexed payments, as well as higher interest costs. None of this was our fault, yours or mine. But the costs of it all were billed straight to us.
Then came the real killer: the devaluations of 2022 and 2023. As the rupee plummeted against the dollar, power bills skyrocketed. In rupee terms, my bills more than tripled in this period. In dollar terms, they barely rose a few cents.
Either way, we had no choice but to pay. We were prisoners inside this grid. Look at your bills over the past decade and work out what percentage of your household income was going to pay for electricity. The sharply rising proportion is your prisoner tax, and left to its own devices, this would have continued indefinitely, forever.
But the prison walls were breached at some point with the arrival of rooftop solar. At first, it moved slowly, between 2016 and 2020, as power utilities stonewalled people’s net metering licence applications. But once the stonewalling ended, a stampede ensued.
The sheer scale with which solar adoption grew in Pakistan post-2020 made global headlines. The scale of the defection from the grid was like a prison break, with people fleeing in growing numbers as the price of electricity spiralled out of control in the inflationary fire of 2022 and 2023.

 

The bureaucrats are angry because their best prisoners have found an alternative source of supply and can reduce their reliance on the grid. They are demanding that these people be rounded up and brought back and be made to buy the expensive electricity from the grid that has so many costs bundled into it that you need two separate Master’s degrees to be able to understand them, one in finance and the second in engineering.
You don’t need to get into the technical issues to get this. You just need to know your own mind. Are you happy paying for all those ‘fixed costs’ the bureaucrats want to saddle you with in their grid? If not, then make your exit.
The solar revolution has entered its next phase with the arrival of batteries. If the grid wants to pay me Rs11 for my electricity and charge me Rs60 for its electricity, I have a solution: simply store my electricity and use it myself. In the years ahead, more grid defections will take place and these will be permanent. The bureaucrats will probably try to halt these too, by adding sharp taxes and duties on batteries, but they will be unsuccessful because the local production of batteries has already begun.
The grid is in terminal decline. It would be better to just admit that and start managing the transition rather than thrashing around like this to first spur solar adoption, then swivel around to try and stop it. The state looks rather foolish now, first announcing a solar policy, then grinding its teeth at those who opted for it.

LAHORE: A report by the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Deve­lopment and Transparency (Pildat) has highlighted structural barriers limiting women’s leadership roles despite constitutional guarantees, saying women are denied power despite ample representation.
Highlighting this disparity on the eve of National Women’s Day (Feb 12), the report titled ‘Women in Public Service in Pakistan: Barriers and Recommen­da­tions’ examined the structural and institutional barriers limiting women’s leadership despite constitutional guarantees and affirmative measures.
Supported by Interloop Limited, the report was presented at a dialogue in Lahore attended by women leaders from politics, the civil service, law, media, and civil society, along with Pildat President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob and Provincial Ombudsperson for Protection against Harassment Nabila Hakim Ali Khan.

 

Participants emphasised that informal power structures, weak accountability, and inconsistent enforcement of laws continue to restrict women’s influence.
The report said women hold 22 per cent of seats in the National Assembly, yet only one is a federal minister in the 31-strong cabinet. Similarly, barely 10 per cent of standing committees are chaired by women lawmakers.
The findings showed that women comprised just 5.1pc of the federal civil service (mostly below BS-17), 3.2pc of the police service, and 18pc of judges overall — yet only 5.5pc serve in superior courts. While 85pc of respondents noted improved representation over the past decade, only 35pc felt women’s voices were adequately reflected in decision-making, and just 19pc believed women wielded genuine authority.
Nearly four in five respondents reported experiencing or witnessing barriers, including socio-cultural norms, work-life balance pressures, exclusionary networks, unsafe workplaces, and weak enforcement of equality and anti-harassment laws.

DEMOCRATIC Congressman Ro Khanna revealed six previously redacted names from the Justice Department’s investigative files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, triggering international fallout from London to New Delhi, CBS News reported.
During his speech on the House floor on Tuesday, Khanna revealed the names of billionaires including Leslie Wexner, the former chief executive of Victoria’s Secret parent company, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the Dubai-based chief executive of the global logistics giant DP World.
The list also included Salvatore Nuara, Zurab Mikeladze, Leonic Leonov and Nicola Caputo.
Khanna and Republican congressman Thomas Massie had viewed the unredacted documents at the Justice Department on Monday.
While the newly disclosed records do not appear to allege specific criminal wrongdoing against the individuals named, Khanna criticised the department for withholding names “for no apparent reason”.
“And if we found six men that they were hiding in two hours, imagine how many men they are covering up for in those 3 million files,” he said.
The DoJ’s spokesperson defended the redaction process asserting that errors were inevitable within millions of pages and some redactions might have been accidental.
The scrutiny of the department’s handling of the files culminated on Wednesday during a heated House Judiciary Committee hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Congressional Democrats accused Bondi of conducting a “cover-up” regarding the Epstein records, Reuters reported.
Rep Jamie Raskin, the ranking member, criticised the pace of the release and argued the redactions violated the Epstein Files Trans­pa­rency Act, which mandates the disclosure of associates who are not victims.
Raskin further accused the dep­artment under Bondi of becoming President Donald Trump’s “instrument of revenge” by pursuing political opponents, AFP reported.
Separately, Raskin told Axios on Tuesday that searching the unredacted database for Trump’s name produced “more than a million results”.
Raskin clarified that he searched for the terms “Trump,” “Donald” or “Don” and could not verify that every result referred to the president. However, Raskin said he found a 2009 email exchange regarding Epstein that seemingly contradicts Trump’s claim that he removed Epstein from Mar-a-Lago.
International fallout
The release of the names has already triggered international business consequences. Reuters reported that the United Kingdom’s development finance agency and Canada’s second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, have suspended new investments with DP World. Files review showed CEO bin Sulayem corresponded with Epstein regarding business, sex and plans to visit Epstein’s Caribbean island.
British International Investment told Reuters it was “shocked by the allegations” and would pause investments until DP World took action.
Meanwhile, India’s oil minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, admitted to parliament that he met Epstein “three or maximum four times” while working at the International Peace Institute in New York, Reuters reported.
Answering questions from opposition leader Rahul Gandhi regarding emails found in the files, Puri denied any involvement in wrongdoing. He stated his interactions with Epstein were focused on connecting with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoff­man to discuss business potential in India.

GENEVA: The United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday that Israel’s plans to tighten control over the occupied West Bank pave the way for further settlement expansion and represent a step toward consolidating “illegal annexation”.
Israel’s security cabinet on Sunday approved measures allowing Jewish Israelis to buy West Bank land directly and extending greater Israeli control over areas where the Palestinian Authority exercises power.
The plan further grants Israel the authority to administer certain religious sites located in areas under Palestinian Authority control. The plans, which have sparked international outrage, modify the administration established under the Oslo Accords in the 1990s.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said the decisions by Israel’s security cabinet were the latest in a string of measures to annex Palestinian lands.
“This is yet another step by the Israeli authorities towards rendering a viable Palestinian state impossible, in violation of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination,” Turk said in a statement.
“If these decisions are implemented, they will undoubtedly accelerate the dispossession of Palestinians and their forcible transfer, and lead to the creation of more illegal Israeli settlements.”
Turk noted that these measures would further deprive Palestinians of natural resources and restrict their human rights. He stated the moves will “further cement Israel’s control and integration of the occupied West Bank into Israel, consolidating unlawful annexation”.

 

The UN official warned that these policies are part of a wider context of increasing attacks by Israeli settlers and security forces, alongside a pattern of evictions, home demolitions, and land grabs.
“We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” Turk said. “These decisions must be overturned.”
Meanwhile, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas called for a “firm response” from the United States and the international community. Speaking during a visit to Oslo on Wednesday, Abbas said he discussed the issue with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.
“These serious violations require a firm response from the US administration and the international community because they hinder President Donald Trump’s efforts and constitute a violation of international law,” Abbas said.
Abbas also cited issues including Israeli settler violence and Israel’s freezing of funds intended for the Palestinian people.
Germany joined the chorus of criticism on Wednesday, with the foreign ministry calling the move “a further step towards de facto annexation.”
“Israel remains an occupying power in the West Bank, and as an occupying power it is a violation of international law to build settlements, including transferring certain administrative functions to civilian Israeli authorities,” a German foreign ministry spokesman said in Berlin.

Advocate Safdar, who was appointed amicus curaie to visit Adiala jail, told the media after submitting his report that he met the PTI founder and also visited his cell.
However, he refrained from divulging what he came across during his meeting or recommended in his report, saying his first responsibility was to submit his report to the SC.
On Thursday, a two-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, will resume the hearing of the case regarding living conditions of the ex-premier in Adiala jail.
Mr Safdar explained that PTI founder’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja “understood his compulsion that he could not talk to them about his report”, which was assigned to him by the court.
He made it clear that he did not inform any of them about the health or living condition of Mr Khan.
Advocate Safdar also denied making any statement on Mr Khan’s health on Tuesday, making it clear that if anything was attributed to him in this regard it was “misrepresented and misreported”.
Before the appointment of Advocate Safdar as ‘friend of the court’ on Tuesday, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan had informed the Supreme Court that he had “submitted a written response to the chamber in light of the order of Aug 24, 2023”.
The SC had directed the AGP to submit a report on Mr Khan’s living conditions in jail, he said, adding that the PTI founder was in Attock jail at the time of the order. “We had submitted a written report to the chamber on Aug 28, 2023,” the AGP said, adding that a medical report was also submitted.
Subsequently, the court appointed Advocate Safdar as amicus with direction to visit the Adiala jail and meet Imran Khan. In the court order, it was noted that the report submitted by the AGP pertained to the period when the ex-premier was imprisoned in Attock jail in 2023. Hence, the court considered it appropriate that a report regarding the present living conditions of the petitioner in jail be submitted.

Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, while announcing the new appointments, emphasised economic diplomacy as a central focus of Pakistan’s external engagement.
“Building on the momentum of the last two years of robust foreign policy engagement and international outreach, may our envoys carry this mission forward with clarity of purpose and wisdom, with a clear emphasis on economic diplomacy,” Mr Dar posted on X.







In Europe, Saadia Altaf Qazi, Pakistan’s ambassador to Norway, has been posted as ambassador to Thailand. She will replace Rukhsana Afzaal in Bangkok. Her transfer created a vacancy in Oslo, where Asim Ali Khan will replace her. Salman Sharif, presently serving at the Prime Minister’s Office, has been named ambassador to Germany. He will take over from Saqlain Syeda in Berlin.
Pakistan’s embassy in Sweden will be headed by Ahmed Amjad Ali, currently consul general in Los Angeles. He replaced Bilal Hayee in Stockholm.

Dar says clear emphasis on economic diplomacy, terms it central to external engagement

In the United Kingdom, where Pakistan maintains a high commission, Tipu Usman, currently chief of protocol at the Foreign Office, has been appointed high commissioner to London. He replaced Dr Mohammad Faisal, who will return to the FO.
At the United Nations in Geneva, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, who is serving as Foreign Office spokesperson, has been appointed Pakistan’s permanent representative. He replaced Bilal Ahmed. In a corresponding move, Mr Ahmed has been appointed as ambassador to Kenya, replacing Ibrar Hussain Khan in Nairobi.
In Central Asia, Irfan Ahmed, director general for Europe at the Foreign Office, has been posted as ambassador to Tajikistan. The position in Dushanbe had been vacant.
Meanwhile, Mudassir Tipu, currently Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, has been appointed ambassador to Uzbekistan, replacing Ahmed Farooq in Tashkent. His move cleared the way for Imran Ahmed Siddiqui, presently additional secretary at the Foreign Office, to take over as ambassador in Tehran.
In Africa, Hasnain Yousaf, currently director general of the Special Investment Facilitation Council at the Foreign Office, has been appointed ambassador to Tanzania, replacing Siraj Ahmed Khan in Dar es Salaam.
Ashar Shahzad, presently deputy consul in Houston, has been named ambassador to Uganda, replacing Hassan Wazir in Kampala.
In South Asia, Mohammad Aamir Khan, director general for the Americas at the Foreign Office, has been appointed ambassador to Nepal, replacing Abrar Hashmi in Kathmandu.
In addition to the ambassadorial postings, the government also announced appointments to several consul general posts. Ali Anser Zaidi has been posted to Frankfurt, Yasir Iqbal Butt to Guangzhou, Shahbaz Hussain to Kandahar, Siraj Ahmad Khan to Los Angeles, Awais Ahmad Khan to Mazar-e-Sharif, and Faisal Abro to Montreal.

ISLAMABAD: The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Wednesday deferred the consideration for the elevation of two additional judges to the Balochistan High Court from the provincial district judiciary.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the consideration was postponed in view of a constitutional question concerning the nomination of the representative of the Balochistan Bar Council. The members of the commission stressed the need for comprehensive consideration of the issue before proceeding further.
Names of six serving district and sessions judges (DSJ) were under consideration of the JCP for their appointment to the BHC. They were: Jan Muhammad Gohar, Pazir Ahmed Baloch, Allah Dad Roshan, Abdul Qayyum Lehri, Inayatullah Khan and Rehmat Ullah.
On Tuesday, the JCP was requested on behalf of vice chairman of Balochistan Bar Council, Jadain Dashti, to postpone its meeting until the finalisation and notification of clear rules and procedures governing the removal or replacement of those members of the commission who have lost confidence of their respective nominating authorities.
The two-page letter said that lawyers of Balochistan were deeply aggrieved and have lost confidence in the member representing Balochistan owing to serious allegations and concerns regarding his conduct and integrity.
The prevailing situation has created dissatisfaction within the legal fraternity of the province and has undermined the confidence reposed by the nominating authority, the letter said, adding that in the absence of finalised rules addressing such circumstances, the continuation of meetings of JCP may give rise to ambiguity and institutional complications.
The letter further said the matter directly concerns the authority, confidence, and representation of the nominating authorities, including provincial bar councils and, therefore, requires clarity and resolution before any substantive proceedings are undertaken.
In these circumstances, it is earnestly requested that the scheduled meeting be deferred until the relevant rules are duly finalised and notified, so that the proceedings of the commission may be conducted within a clear, transparent, and undisputed legal framework, the letter stated.
Meanwhile, the CJP also presided over the commission’s meeting to discuss the proposed framework for framing rules governing interviews of candidates at the time of their appointment as judges. After preliminary discussion, the commission resolved to defer the agenda to enable members to undertake further in-depth deliberations on the proposed regulatory contours.
SJC meeting
Separately, CJP Yahya Afridi also presided over a meeting of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and examined 59 complaints filed under Article 209 of the Constitution.
Among them were references related to IHC Justices Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, sources said. The complaint against Justice Khan was filed over his announcement of a judgement after reserving it for nearly three years.
Sources also said that a reference against former IHC judge Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri has been placed on the record as infructuous, as he had already been removed from office.
Insiders said that IHC CJ Sarfraz Dogar had recused himself when cases involving judges from his court were taken up. He was replaced by Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S M Atiq Shah for the relevant proceedings.
Sources also revealed that the SJC reviewed and filed to record references against the chief election commissioner, and other members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
According to an official statement, of the 59 complaints, 50 were ordered to be disposed of, six were deferred, and three were directed to be processed further in accordance with the law. The council also unanimously decided to defer the finalisation of draft rules on the code of conduct until its next meeting.

In a detailed decision under directives of the Lahore High Court, Privatisation Secretary Hammad Hashmi wrote that the entire process leading to the privatisation of the national flag carrier was completed under the law, and none of the objections raised by the workers’ union “Peoples’ Unity’ and others had any legal standing.
“None of the allegations raised by the petitioners/objectors establishes any constitutional violation, statutory breach, arbitrariness, mala fide, or infringement of fundamental rights. The privatisation of PIACL has been undertaken within the bounds of constitutional authority, statutory mandate, and settled principles governing the privatisation process under the privatisation laws and regulations. These petitions are dismissed,” he wrote, effectively closing all disputes.

Ministry rejects workers’ objections, cites compliance with law

On Jan 23, the Lahore High Court had ordered the petitioners to appear before the privatisation secretary who was required to hear them out and issue a speaking order.
The secretary rejected the objection that privatisation should have been placed before the Council of Common Interest as required under Article 154 of the constitution, saying the CCI approval was already in the field, given its inclusion in the sale list. “The transaction squarely falls within the executive authority of the Federation under Article 173 of the constitution, which expressly empowers the Federal Government to dispose of its property and to make contracts,” the order held.
Mr Hashmi also rejected the objection regarding a violation of Section 3(3) of the PIAC Conversion Act 2016, saying the said section was removed by Parliament through an amendment in 2023. The privatisation process, having been initiated after the removal of the statutory restriction, was, therefore, fully compliant with the prevailing legal framework.
The secretary also rejected the allegation of undervaluation of PIA’s international and domestic slots. The objectors had claimed a Rs270bn value for international slots and Rs19bn for domestic slots. However, the secretary noted that these assertions were unsupported by any credible material, independent valuation report, or admissible evidence. Bald figures stated in pleadings, without substantiation, cannot form the basis for judicial interference in a commercial transaction.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stepped in on Wednesday to seek a review of Nepra’s revised rules for rooftop solar users, while the power regulator simultaneously rubber-stamped a government plan to impose hefty fixed charges on residential consumers.
The premier also directed the Power Division to file a review petition against the regulator’s move regarding new solar regulations.
On Monday, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) revised the terms for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — on the pretext of rising solar penetration and the need to protect an expensive and inefficient state-run power network. The notification effectively ended the net-metering regime and shifted prosumers to net billing.
A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier had taken “immediate notice” of the matter, following criticism in the Senate from lawmakers across party lines, including ruling ally PPP and opposition PTI.







The PMO quoted the prime minister as directing the Power Division to file a review petition before Nepra “to ensure every possible safeguard of the existing consumer contracts”.
He was of the view that the “burden of 466,000 users benefitting from solar should not be put on 37.6 million domestic consumers” receiving electricity directly from the national grid. “Power Division should chalk out a comprehensive strategy in this regard,” he said.
The directives were issued during a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister on the new Nepra regulations. The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Power Minister Awais Leghari, Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Cheema, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani and the prime minister’s adviser Muhammad Ali.
Speaking in the Senate on Tuesday, Mr Leghari defended Nepra’s move, saying it was aimed at easing the burden on consumers. “Changing regulations according to the law and the Constitution is a regulator’s job,” he said, adding that he would not step back. “This is not policy; there should be clarity on that,” he maintained.
Stakeholders and policy experts have warned that the proposed Prosumer Regulations 2025 could undermine a decade of citizen-led expansion in clean energy.
Under the new regulations, registered prosumers will be immediately shifted to net billing in place of net metering, and their exported units will be credited for one month instead of the current three months. Other terms will remain unchanged until their seven-year contracts expire.
Under net billing, electricity generated by a prosumer is purchased by the relevant distribution company (Disco), and the consumer is billed for electricity imported from the grid at about Rs37-55 per unit (depending on the slab) after receiving credit for exports at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
The new rules bar prosumers from installing solar power systems for net metering beyond their originally sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Nepra approves fixed charges
Meanwhile, Nepra on Wednesday approved a government decision to impose about Rs132bn in fixed charges on more than 28.5m residential electricity consumers, at rates ranging from Rs200 to Rs675 per kilowatt per month of sanctioned load.
The regulator’s fast-tracked approval of the federal government’s Feb 4 decision will come into retrospective effect from February, increasing the effective unit price by up to 75pc for the lowest strata with a declining scale for higher consumption groups. The Rs132bn fixed charges do not include about Rs24bn general sales tax and other taxes, surcharges and duties.
This will adequately address cross-subsidy on industrial consumers, reducing their average tariff by Rs4.04 per unit as announced by the prime minister to make export products competitive in the global market. For the first time, the burden of cross-subsidy on the industrial sector has come to zero.
Given “the fact that the revised tariff proposed by the federal government is within the determined consolidated revenue requirement of all the XWDISCOs (ex-Wapda distribution companies) and already budgeted tariff differential subsidy (TDS) of Rs249bn for the calendar year 2026, the authority has no objection in approving the motion”, Nepra wrote in its decision to the government for formal publication in the Gazette of Pakistan.
The revised schedule of tariff shows that new fixed charges have been imposed on monthly consumption of up to 300 units, raised for the 400-600 unit slabs and slightly scaled down for higher users to discourage defection from the grid.
As a result, the average power tariff (including energy and capacity components) for both protected and non-protected consumers in the first 100-unit slab has risen by 76pc, or Rs8 per unit, and 73.5pc, or Rs16.5 per unit, respectively, following the imposition of fixed char­ges at Rs200 and Rs275 per kilowatt of sanctioned load.
More than 22m consumers fall into these two categories. “This is the highest-ever price hike for this consumer category since the creation of separate distribution, generation and transmission companies in the early 1990s,” a senior official told Dawn.
For protected consumers using 101-200 units, the average cost has increased by Rs4 per unit, or 31pc, due to a Rs300-per-kW fixed monthly charge, while the non-protected category in the same slab has seen a rise of Rs6 per unit, or 21pc.
Consumers in the 200-300 unit slab will face a Rs350-per-kW fixed charge per month, lifting their average price by 12.7pc, or Rs4.20 per unit. About 5.6 million consumers fall into this group.
The fixed rate for the 301-400 unit category has been doubled to Rs400 per kW from Rs200, raising average unit rates by 6.5pc, or Rs2.5 per unit, despite a slight downward adjustment in base tariffs. More than two million consumers are in this bracket.
Higher-consumption households will also face increases. The fixed rate for the 401-500 unit slab has been raised to Rs500 per kW from Rs400, and to Rs675 per kW for the 501-600 slab, resulting in a 5.8pc, or Rs2.30-per-unit, rise in average tariffs, even after a Rs1.25-per-unit cut in base rates.
For consumers using 601-700 units a month, the fixed charge has been reduced to Rs675 per kW from Rs800, while those exceeding 700 units will also pay Rs675 per kW instead of Rs1,000. Nevertheless, both groups will still see average-rate increases of Rs2 and Rs1.80 per unit, or about 5pc and 4pc, respectively.
Only time-of-use consumers with sanctioned loads above 5kW will benefit from an average reduction of about 7pc, or Rs3.30 per unit, after the abolition of their Rs1,000-per-kW fixed charge in view of peak rates of Rs47 per unit, excluding taxes and duties. Even they, however, will face a 6pc, or Rs2.5-per-unit, rise during off-peak hours.
An official said the Power Division had estimated that the fixed charges would generate an additional Rs132bn for distribution companies, although another calculation suggested the inflow could exceed Rs250bn because most residential subsidies had been eliminated.

The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation.
To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC).
A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes.
Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog.

LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds

Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn.
According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn.
The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn.
The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years.
The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives.
The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”.
Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records.
Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction.
A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025.
Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority.
The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million.
The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

Up until now, the minimum legal age for marriage in Punjab was 18 years for men and 16 years for women under the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929.
This has changed with the promulgation of the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Ordinance 2026, under which offenders could face up to seven years in prison and fines of up to Rs1 million.
The law comes into effect immediately across the province and was promulgated under Article 128(1) of the Constitution as the Punjab Assembly is not in session.
Under the new legal framework, nikah khawans (marriage registrars) have been barred from registering child marriages and could face imprisonment of up to one year and fine of Rs100,000 in case of violations.
Similarly, adults contracting marriage with a child will face rigorous imprisonment of up to three years but not less than two years, as well as a fine of up to Rs500,000.
The ordinance also criminalises cohabitation resulting from a child marriage as “child abuse”, carrying penalties of five to seven years’ imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs1 million.
It also introduces strict punishments for child trafficking linked to marriage and holds guardians accountable for promoting or failing to prevent underage marriages.
It further stated that if a guardian or any other person in any capacity, lawful or unlawful, committed any act to promote child marriage, child abuse or permitted child marriage to be solemnised, or intentionally or negligently failed to prevent it from being solemnised, they will be punished with rigorous imprisonment between two to three years and will also be liable to a fine of up to Rs500,000.
All offences under the ordinance have been declared cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable, and will be tried exclusively by Courts of Session, with cases to be concluded within 90 days.
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the ordinance is aimed at modernising child protection laws in Punjab, removing gender discrimination in minimum marriage age, and strengthening legal safeguards against exploitation and abuse.</p><small>2026-02-11 19:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11224141f760b56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972554/any-military-escalation-involving-iran-could-destabilise-region-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Any military escalation involving Iran could destabilise region: President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday appreciated efforts for easing tensions and promoting regional peace, warning that any military escalation involving Iran could destabilise the Gulf region, South and Western Asia.
He said this while addressing a ceremony hosted by the Iranian embassy in Islamabad on the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
“Any instability involving Iran, or any attempt to resolve issues through military means, carries grave risks. Such actions could … undermine global peace, and cause serious harm to the global economy. The stakes are far too high for confrontation,” President Zardari said.
He further stated that Pakistan opposed unilateral sanctions and coercive measures, including against Iran, and believed that “peaceful engagement best serves regional and global security”.
“Pakistan welcomes efforts aimed at easing tensions and encourages continued dialogue among relevant parties in a constructive spirit, with the objective of promoting peace and stability in the region,” he added.
Earlier, the president requested the participants of the ceremony to observe one minute of silence in the memory of victims of the recent blast in Islamabad, and the tragedies in Iran.
“Let’s pray that wars never come to us,” he said.
Referring to ongoing conflicts, terrorism, external interference and unresolved regional flashpoints in the region, the president said Pakistan firmly believed that such challenges could not be addressed through force or unilateral actions.
He also emphasised that Pakistan and Iran shared responsibilities as neighbouring countries and remained committed to cooperating on border management, counter-terrorism and “turning the shared frontier into a zone of cooperation, lawful trade and development”.
The president stressed that Pakistan valued balanced relations globally and was ready to play a constructive role in promoting restraint, dialogue and regional peace.
He extended his warm congratulations to the leadership and people of Iran.
“May our partnership continue to grow, and may our region move towards security, stability and shared prosperity,” he said.
The president added Pakistan and Iran were not just neighbours, but also “civilisational partners”.
“Our shared border reflects centuries of interaction, coexistence and mutual respect,” he stated. “Our relationship is rooted in faith, history and enduring cultural bonds that continue to shape our region.”
He noted that the Persian language and its great literary tradition had profoundly influenced Pakistan’s intellectual life, adding that for hundreds of years, it was the official language of some of the regions that were now a part of Pakistan.
“Its influence remains deeply embedded in our national consciousness. Pakistan’s national anthem itself reflects the deep imprint of the Persian language on our collective identity,” he stated.
The president remembered Sachal Sarmast, a renowned 18th-century poet in Sindh, on the occasion, saying that he composed poetry in Persian, which reflected “a shared spiritual and philosophical space”.
“Poets and thinkers such as Rumi, Hafiz, Saadi and Ferdowsi are widely respected in Pakistan, while Iqbal, who wrote much of his work in Persian, remains a shared symbol of dignity and renewal for both our societies,” he added.
In his welcome address, Iranian Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam said that despite facing various external pressures and challenges, Iran had made remarkable progress in key sectors, including technology, defence, science and the economy.
He noted that the Iranian nation had “consistently demonstrated resilience and self-reliance”, turning challenges into opportunities and continuing its journey of development with determination.
Moghadam said that Iran did “not seek war and believes in resolving disputes through dialogue and diplomacy”. However, he made it clear that if a war broke out, Iran would “fully retaliate in defence of its sovereignty”.
The ambassador appreciated the government and people of Pakistan for their support, particularly during “Israeli aggression against Iran”.</p><small>2026-02-11 19:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11235047d788238.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972556/ex-army-chief-qamar-javed-bajwa-hospitalised-after-fall' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa hospitalised after fall</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former chief of army staff Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa has been admitted to a military hospital after sustaining injuries in a fall at his home, according to an informed source.
Bajwa slipped at his residence and suffered multiple injuries, according to initial information. He was moved to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) for treatment and was reported to be in stable condition.
He was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit, though the extent of his injuries was not immediately clear.
It is not known exactly when or how the fall occurred. His family could not be reached for comment.
Bajwa, 65, served as the 10th chief of army staff from Nov 29, 2016, to Nov 29, 2022, with an extension in his tenure granted in 2019.

According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation.
The operation was conducted in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab police station following intelligence reports about militants’ presence in the area, it said, adding that the area was cordoned off before the search operation was initiated.
While the police party was returning, militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire, the statement said.
Four policemen were martyred in the attack and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire.
The officers who lost their lives included SHO Faheem Mumtaz, Constable Irfan Khan, Constable Ghulam Subhani, and Constable Wajahat, the statement said.
Paharpur Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Adnan and Assistant Sub-Inspector Tariq were injured in the attack.
A police spokesperson earlier said that the martyrs and the wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment.
Following the incident, the spokesperson said, a heavy contingent of police, led by District Police Officer Sajad Ahmed Sahebzada, reached the scene and launched clearance a search operation to apprehend the militants.
The police statement said that the area had been sealed off and the search and clearance operation was under way.
It added that efforts were being made to recover the bodies of the slain militants from the forest area, while security in nearby localities has been further tightened.
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack.
“Eliminating the cancer of terrorism sponsored from abroad from the country is the topmost priority,” the president was quoted as saying.
The statement added that he extended his prayers to the martyrs’ families and wished the wounded a swift recovery.







Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took notice of the incident and strongly condemned it. In a statement, he paid tribute to the sacrifices of the martyred personnel.
“The provincial government will provide all possible assistance to the affected families,” he said. He further said that the KP police were at the frontline in the fight against terrorism.
“Terrorism is a common challenge for the entire country. Actions against elements hostile to peace will be further intensified in the province,” he said.
He said police morale could not be dampened by such cowardly acts. CM Afridi said that a comprehensive and effective strategy was essential for the complete eradication of terrorism.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi expressed deep sorrow over the attack.
He said he was saddened by the deaths of the police personnel and praised the bravery and sacrifice of Dera Ismail Khan police in protecting the public and the nation.
The governor also directed that all possible medical care be provided to the injured officers and prayed for their speedy recovery.
PTI’s Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, the former chief minister of the province, also expressed profound grief over the incident, stating that the officers laid down their lives in defence of the country and the people.
He prayed for the swift recovery of the injured officers and extended his condolences to the families of the martyred personnel, while praying for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks.</p><small>2026-02-11 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/112215228679f42.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972550/trump-meets-netanyahu-with-us-iran-nuclear-diplomacy-topping-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>Trump meets Netanyahu, with US-Iran nuclear diplomacy topping agenda</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday, with the latter expected to press him to widen talks with Iran to include limits on Tehran’s missile arsenal and other security threats beyond its nuclear programme.
In his seventh meeting with Trump since the president returned to office nearly 13 months ago, Netanyahu was looking to influence the next round of US discussions with Iran following nuclear negotiations held in Oman last Friday.
Trump threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war. He has repeatedly voiced support for a secure Israel, a longstanding US ally and arch-foe of Iran.
In media interviews on Tuesday, Trump reiterated his warning, saying that while he believes Iran wants a deal, he would do “something very tough” if it refused.
Trump says no to Iranian nuclear weapons, missiles
Trump told Fox Business that a good deal with Iran would mean “no nuclear weapons, no missiles,” without elaborating. He also told Axios he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier strike group as part of a major US buildup near Iran.
Israel was concerned that the US might pursue a narrow nuclear deal that does not include restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missile programme or an end to Iranian support for armed proxies, according to people familiar with the matter. Israeli officials have urged the US not to trust Iran’s promises.

 

“I will present to the president our perceptions of the principles in the negotiations,” Netanyahu told reporters before departing for the US.
The two leaders could also discuss potential military action if diplomacy with Iran fails, one source said.
Iran said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions, but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.
“The Islamic republic’s missile capabilities are non-negotiable,” Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said on Wednesday.
Netanyahu’s arrival at the White House was lower-key than usual. He entered the building away from the view of reporters and cameras, and a White House official then confirmed he was inside meeting with Trump.
Gaza on the agenda
Also on the agenda was Gaza, with Trump looking to push ahead with a ceasefire agreement he helped to broker.
Progress on his 20-point plan to end the war and rebuild the shattered Palestinian enclave stalled, with major gaps over steps such as Hamas disarming as Israeli troops withdraw in phases.
Netanyahu’s visit, originally scheduled for February 18, was brought forward amid renewed US engagement with Iran. Both sides at last week’s Oman meeting said the talks were positive and further talks were expected soon.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said ahead of the Oman meeting that negotiations would need to address Iran’s missiles, its proxy groups, and its treatment of its own population. Iran said Friday’s talks focused only on nuclear issues.
Trump has been vague about broadening the negotiations. He was quoted as telling Axios on Tuesday that it was a “no-brainer” for any deal to cover Iran’s nuclear programme, but that he also thought it possible to address its missile stockpiles.
Iran says its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, while the US and Israel have previously accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
Last June, the US joined Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during a 12-day war. Israel also heavily damaged Iran’s air defences and missile arsenal. Two Israeli officials say there are signs Iran is working to restore those capabilities.
Trump threatened last month to intervene militarily during a crackdown on anti-government protests in Iran, but ultimately held off.
Israel wary of a weakened Iran rebuilding
Tehran’s regional influence was weakened by the 12-day war, losses suffered by proxies in the region and the ousting of its ally, former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
But Israel was wary of its adversaries rebuilding after the multi-front war, triggered by Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel.
While Trump and Netanyahu have mostly been in sync and the US remains Israel’s main arms supplier, Wednesday’s meeting could expose tensions.
Part of Trump’s Gaza plan held out the prospect for eventual Palestinian statehood, which Netanyahu and his coalition — the most far-right in Israel’s history — have long resisted.
Netanyahu’s security cabinet on Sunday authorised steps that would make it easier for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank to buy land while granting Israel broader powers in what the Palestinians see as the heartland of a future state. The decision drew international condemnation.
“I am against annexation,” Trump told Axios, reiterating his stance. “We have enough things to think about now.”</p><small>2026-02-11 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1121161017851fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972546/pm-announces-compensation-for-those-martyred-injured-in-suicide-attack-on-islamabad-imambargah' target='_blank'><strong>PM announces compensation for those martyred, injured in suicide attack on Islamabad imambargah</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday announced compensation for those martyred and injured in the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad last week.
The premier made the announcement while visiting the site of the attack.
On February 6, a suicide bomber ripped through the Friday congregation at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the outskirts of Islamabad. At least 38 people were killed in the incident and more than 150 were injured.
During the visit, PM Shehbaz announced a sum of Rs 10 million for Oun Abbas, who resisted the suicide attacker; Rs5m for each martyr; Rs3m for those critically injured and under treatment at the hospital; and Rs1m for those with minor injuries who had been discharged.







Speaking on the occasion, PM Shehbaz said, “These terrorists have no religion, and they have crossed all the limits of cruelty.”
Talking to the affected families, he said the entire nation was in a state of grief and saddened over the tragic incident, which resulted in the martyrdom of elders and kids while scores of others were injured.
He termed the incident the “worst kind of barbaric act”. PM Shehbaz said that all religious leaders had strongly condemned the incident with unity and praised them for foiling the nefarious designs of the enemies with solidarity.
The prime minister observed that the attempt to sow seeds of disunity in society had failed miserably.
He also commended the armed forces, law enforcement agencies and police force fighting against terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Later, the prime minister also visited Abbas’ residence to offer his condolences.

The auction ended after several unsold players were snapped up by the eight franchises. Earlier rounds of bidding saw major players auctioned off, including Fakhar Zaman, David Warner and Muhammad Amir.
Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.



Islamabad United
The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.
The team also scored New Zealand cricketer Mark Chapman after they bid Rs70m against Peshawar Zalmi’s Rs68.5m.
Mohammad Waseem Jr joined the team at the winning bid of Rs41m — a marked increase from his base price at 22m — against Quetta Gladiators.
The team secured Mir Hamza Sajjad as well at a winning bid of Rs7m.
Islamabad United also bagged Sameer Minhas at the bid of Rs19m after back-and-forth bidding against Quetta Gladiators. Sameen Gul also joined the team.

He made this statement while addressing the Balochistan Assembly, around 10 days after a spate of attacks on January 31 brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days. Security forces responded to the attacks by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1”.
Speaking about terrorism today, Bugti said there was, unfortunately, “confusion” on the issue in Pakistan. He linked this “confusion” to the use of “propaganda”, which he said was used to create distance between the state and the youth of Balochistan.

 


Moreover, he claimed, “a forced narrative has been created against Pakistan that is purely based on perceptions and devoid of reality”.
The minister decried that terrorism in Balochistan was linked to the lack of development in the province, adding that the problem of “unparalleled development” existed across the country.
Why were arms not being taken up elsewhere, the CM said, adding, “How are you rationalising violence?”
Again criticising the linking of terrorism with the lack of development, he remarked: “The monopoly of the right of violence is only with the state [sic]; be it whichever state in the world.”
The CM then emphasised that no one was allowed to take up arms and kill innocent people on any issue.
He said that those involved in terrorism in Balochistan wanted to “break the country and create a nation state on the basis of Baloch identity”.
Bugti further said the aim behind the creation of such a nation state was to employ it for the use of three “tools”.
“The first tool is of violence, the second is of social manoeuvre and legitimate voices, and the third is of social media,” he outlined, without elaborating any further on this.
Bugti said that the “Baloch are being pushed towards a futile war. What can be gained of this futile war except for bloodshed?” he said, reiterating that he “feels that attempts are made to rationalise violence”.
“This is very dangerous,” he added.
The CM said that the National Action Plan was the most important document after the Constitution. In the NAP, he added, terrorism in the name of religion had been recognised with consensus as an act of terrorism.
But, he continued, “terrorism in the name of so-called nationalism is treated differently”.
The CM said that as far as the prospect of dialogue was concerned, “what will be the end result? What do you want from it?”
He said he had requested the opposition in the provincial assembly multiple times to “take the lead” if they believed a resolution was possible through dialogue.
“I, on behalf of the state of Pakistan, am ready to talk. But I cannot talk to those who are talking to us with the barrels of guns, those who are killing us, those who are killing our innocent children, those who are killing our innocent teachers, our doctors, our policemen and our security forces.”</p><small>2026-02-11 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11204401b89c67c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972547/indias-oil-minister-denies-wrongdoing-in-epstein-links-says-met-him-3-or-maximum-4-times' target='_blank'><strong>India’s oil minister denies wrongdoing in Epstein links, says met him ‘3 or maximum 4 times’</strong></a><br><p>India’s oil minister said on Wednesday he had communicated with and met the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein during his time in the United States, but said he had no connection to any wrongdoings or crimes.
Hardeep Singh Puri, a career diplomat-turned-politician, said he was part of the International Peace Institute, a New York think tank headed by Norwegian diplomat and former cabinet minister Terje Roed-Larsen until 2020, and met Epstein “three or maximum four times” during his time there.







Roed-Larsen, 78, has apologised for his connection to Epstein and his wife, Mona Juul, a Norwegian ambassador, stepped down over her links to Epstein.
Puri’s comments came in response to questions by India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in parliament on Wednesday.
Gandhi said Puri’s name had been mentioned in Epstein’s emails and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to clarify what his dealings with Epstein were.

 

Puri, who served as India’s ambassador to the United Nations from 2009-2013, became a minister in Modi’s cabinet in 2017. He denied any wrongdoing.
Documents released by the US Department of Justice show emails between Puri and Epstein, mostly referring to Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, who Puri said he wanted to invite to India so he could explore the country’s potential for internet-based businesses.</p><small>2026-02-11 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650310-sho-among-four-police-personnel-martyred-in-di-khan-operation' target='_blank'><strong>SHO among four police personnel martyred in DI Khan terrorist attack</strong></a><br><p>

Asif’s rebuke came during a session of the lower house of Parliament, where he recalled Achakzai’s recent remarks and quoted him as saying that the army was a “force of four districts”. Asif did not elaborate on the context of the remarks attributed to Achakzai.
Terming it “highly irresponsible” and a “deliberate attempt to malign” the national institution, Asif asserted that the army was a national force.
“It is the force of the federation, with representation from all provinces,” he stressed. “It is the force of the entire country.”
During his address, the minister also shared data about the representation of different provinces in the army, reading out statistics from a document.
According to the document, seen by Dawn, the province-wise representation in consonance with the population of districts in the army as per the 2023 census was 51.1 per cent from Punjab, 16.28pc from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 20.52pc from Sindh, 6.04pc from Balochistan, 2.54pc from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan and 3.52pc from the minorities.
However, while reading out the numbers, Asif mistakenly stated that representation from Punjab was 91.1pc instead of 51.1pc. He also highlighted that the armed forces had rendered several sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
“Over the past five years, 3,141 personnel, including officers, junior commissioned officers, and jawans have embraced martyrdom in this fight,” the defence minister said, adding that those martyrs were from all regions of the country. According to data shared by Asif, those martyrs included 170 officers, 212 junior commissioned officers and 2759 soldiers.
He added that the opposition leader’s “irresponsible statement is an attempt to belittle these sacrifices and tantamount to attacking public sentiments”.
The minister said that the opposition leader’s position was a respectable one and such statements were not expected from Achakzai.
He further asserted that the fight against terrorism was not confined to any particular province or district, but “is a collective struggle of the entire nation”.
“Martyrs are our red line … We are indebted to the martyrs, who sacrificed their lives for our safety and protection,” he said.
Asif went on to say, “We are in the middle of a very bloody war. Daily …”
At this point, the NA’s live stream was disrupted for less than a minute. When the stream resumed, the defence minister said that “such attacks and behaviour, the spilling of blood is not allowed in our religion”.
“The bodies of our soldiers are decapitated after their martyrdom. This is also happening. It is happening in Tirah Valley,” he said.
Turning his attention to politicians, he said, “We are fighting a war for our political interests. If someone says that we are fighting for the country, then they are wrong. We are fighting a war for our political interests and power. Over the past 60-70 years, whenever someone was deprived of power, they fought for it, and there were no underlying principles in that fight.
“And then a voice is raised in this house that it (army) is a force of four districts. I don’t want to use any strong words for this house as it has earned me immense respect.”
But, he continued, if an individual crossed a “line drawn with blood” while safeguarding their political interests, they had no right to “sit in this house”.
The defence minister also said that “no voice is raised from Balochistan when Punjabis are shot after their identity cards are checked … I don’t believe in provincial discrimination, but I take strong exception [to Achakzai’s remark]”.
He also moved a resolution, which paid tribute to the armed forces for their “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism. The resolution was adopted by the house, which reaffirmed its commitment that the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain.
The resolution underscored that the nation was standing firmly alongside the armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
It further lauded the “professional capabilities, bravery and dedication” of the military, declaring full support for its continued efforts to safeguard national security, uphold stability and maintain peace across the country.
Achakzai, who joined the NA proceedings midway through Asif’s speech, responded to the defence minister, saying that he stood by his words and would continue to speak against the “enemies of democracy”.
“You have punished us for supporting democracy”, he remarked and raised the question that whether Parliament was supposed to “justify martial law”.
The opposition leader also commented that relations with Afghanistan could not improve until “we stop deeming the neighbouring country as our fifth province”.
PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan also spoke during the session, raising objection to his party being held responsible for terrorism in the country.
“Terrorists are our enemies wherever they are”, he said.
Gohar further criticised the government for “using the crutches of the establishment to rule the country”.
Gohar also reminded the defence minister that he used to openly criticise the army in the past and alleged that his statement in the house was “an attempt to divide the nation”.
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, however, contended that sharing data on the number of martyrs could not be termed an attempt to divide the nation.
NA passes 6 bills
During the session, the short of quorum NA also passed six bills amid an outcry from the opposition, with Speaker Sadiq refusing to order a count.
Just 66 members were present in the house at the time of passage of the bills after rules were suspended to take those up for immediate consideration.







The bills included the Pakistan Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2025, Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026, The Pakistan Names and Emblems (Prevention of Unauthorised Use) (Amendment) Bill, 2026, National Archives (Amendment) Bill, 2026, Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026 and Islamabad Capital Territory Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2025.</p><small>2026-02-11 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1114480443291f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972531/na-speaker-accepts-2024-resignation-of-bnp-m-chief-akhtar-mengal' target='_blank'><strong>NA speaker accepts 2024 resignation of BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal</strong></a><br><p>National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Wednesday accepted the resignation of veteran politician Sardar Akhtar Mengal, chief of his faction of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M).
Mengal, who was elected as an MNA from Khuzdar (NA-256) in the 2024 general elections, had submitted his resignation in September that year, citing the “prevailing situation in Balochistan”.
“PML-N has at last accepted my resignation after dragging its feet long enough to expose its own fear,” Mengal said in a social media post, referring to the speaker’s party.
“Was it the applause that unsettled you or the fact that I could draw crowds in Punjab’s core?” he asked, apparently referring to his participation in a charged discussion about Balochistan at the Asma Jahangir Conference held recently in Lahore.







At the event, Mengal had criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined.
He also expressed concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties.

 

In his post on X, Mengal said he had “not withdrawn one rupee” since he tendered his resignation, adding that he had vacated Parliament Lodges 17 months ago.
“For the record, not one rupee has been withdrawn since my resignation. Every amount remains in Parliament’s bank. The lodges were vacated 17 months ago and I have not resided there since. Adios!”
In a separate post, he said, “My resignation was submitted on 3rd September 2024 by choice and with full conviction.”
He said the decision was taken on principle, in response to the “unresolved grievances of Balochistan”.
“Instead of addressing those grievances, the authorities chose to suppress the issue, once again demonstrating that this federation has no real space for a Baloch voice,” he said.
“What is now public is not just my resignation, but the mindset of those in power toward Balochistan’s suffering and how my appearance in Lahore was enough to unsettle many egos. I stand by this decision,” he said.







The senior politician had resigned over security tensions in Balochistan after the Aug 26, 2024 deadly attacks across the province and increased protests against enforced disappearances.
Soon after the resignation was submitted, the government and the PTI beseeched Mengal to take back his resignation and continue to be a voice for Balochistan in the lower house of Parliament.
In July 2025, the BNP-M chief was barred from travelling abroad, with immigration officials at the Quetta airport info­rming him that his name had been placed in the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL), a temporary travel ban to stop people from going abroad.
Two months later, the Balochistan High Court had declared the travel ban illegal and directed authorities to immediately lift the restriction.
‘Marginalised and ignored’
In his resignation letter addressed to the NA speaker, Mengal had said the “prevailing situation in Balochistan has compelled me to take this step”.
“Our province has consistently been marginalised and ignored by this House. Each day, we are pushed further against the wall, leaving us with no choice but to reconsider our roles.
“The lack of genuine representation in this Assembly for the people of Balochistan has left voices like mine unable to bring meaningful change.
“It has become increasingly clear that our attempts to speak or protest are met with hostility, our people are either silenced, labelled as traitors, or worse, killed,” Mengal wrote in his letter.
“Under such circumstances, I find it impossible to continue in this capacity, as my presence here no longer serves any purpose for the people I represent,” Mengal wrote.</p><small>2026-02-11 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650299-economic-diplomacy-pakistan-announces-appointments-of-envoys-to-key-capitals' target='_blank'><strong>'Economic diplomacy': Pakistan announces appointments of envoys to key capitals</strong></a><br><p>

In written responses to Reuters, the SBP chief argued the recovery is broader and more durable than headline export data suggest.
The central bank raised its FY26 growth forecast to 3.75–4.75pc at its January meeting, 0.5 percentage points higher than its previous range, despite a contraction in exports in the first half of the year and a widening trade deficit.
The governor said differences in projections were not unusual and reflected timing issues, including the IMF’s incorporation of flood-related assessments in its latest outlook.

 

“All these sources and indicators, along with FY26-Q1 data, point to a broad-based recovery in all three sectors of the economy,” he said.
He added that the SBP believed that agricultural activity had remained resilient despite floods and “it is even performing better than its targets”.
He added that financial conditions had eased significantly following a cumulative 1,150-basis-point cut in the policy rate since June 2024, and that the full impact was still feeding through.
This, he said, was supporting growth while preserving price and economic stability.
The SBP last month held its benchmark rate at 10.5pc, defying expectations for a cut.
The divergence with the IMF comes at a delicate moment for Pakistan, which is emerging from a balance-of-payments crisis under a $7 billion IMF programme.
Export drag, remittance cushion
Pakistan’s previous growth spurts have often led to currency pressure and a decline in foreign exchange reserves, making the sustainability of the current rebound a key question for investors.
Ahmad said high-frequency indicators and 6pc growth in large-scale manufacturing in July-November point to strengthening demand, while agriculture has remained resilient despite last year’s floods, he said.
While exports declined in the first half of the fiscal year, Ahmad said the fall reflected low global prices and border disruptions rather than softer activity.
He said the current account deficit should stay within 1pc of the gross domestic product (GDP), as strong remittances offset the wider trade gap and lift reserves above programme targets, with further gains expected due to Eid-related inflows.
“Additionally, if the government decided to tap global capital markets for any debt issuance, then that would be on the upside of our current assessment,” he said.
Pakistan plans to issue panda bonds, a yuan-denominated debt sold in China’s domestic market around the upcoming Lunar New Year, as part of efforts to diversify external financing and broaden its investor base.

 

He said the SBP has been consistently purchasing dollars in the interbank market to strengthen foreign exchange buffers, with data published regularly.
He said that while economic stability has improved, structural reforms remain key to sustaining stronger growth and improving productivity.</p><small>2026-02-11 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650238-ramzan-moon-likely-on-february-18-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Ramadan 2026 in Pakistan: PMD reveals likely date when moon will be sighted</strong></a><br><p>
