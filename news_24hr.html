The military has said India was using its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry detailing “irr­e­futable evidence” of an Ind­ian military personnel’s involvement.
“Two terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,” Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.
“Fitna al Hindustan attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists’ firing,” the statement read.
The term “Fitna al Hindu­stan” is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
 






“The Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,” Rind asserted.
An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces “encircled” the terrorists, the government spokesperson added.
Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while a clearance operation was also underway, according to the statement.
Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.

The earthquake was recorded at 6:39am, with the epicentre 25 kilometres south-southwest of Lahore at a depth of 14 kilometres. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) spokesperson, tremors were felt in Kasur, Okara, Sheikhupura, Mureed and other districts of Punjab.
There have been no immediate reports of casualties. The respective administrations are inspecting buildings across the province for any sign of damage.
As per PDMA, the District Emergency Operation Centres across Punjab, including the Provincial Control Room of PDMA, have been placed on alert for the next 24 hours in case of any aftershocks.
PDMA has advised people to report damages to the 1129 helpline.
On June 30, another earthquake of 3.9 magnitude was recorded at 2:07pm, 35 kilometres west of Dera Ghazi Khan in Punjab at a depth of seven kilometres. The same day, Balochistan recorded a 4.8-magnitude earthquake at 11:11am, 40 kilometres southwest of Zhob at a depth of 20 kilometres.
Earlier on Sunday, a moderate 5.5 magnitude earthquake struck Musakhail, a remote district of Balochistan that borders Punjab, injuring five people and damaging dozens of mud houses. A day prior, low to moderate intensity earthquakes hit parts of Karachi and Pasni in Balochistan.
The country has experienced many low-intensity earthquakes over the past few months. Pakistan straddles the boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes.

Additional reporting by Imran Gabol.</p><small>2025-07-01 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0109581029a4a44.jpg?r=100155' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921393/trump-signs-order-lifting-sanctions-on-syria' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order lifting sanctions on Syria</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump signed on Monday an executive order terminating a US sanctions programme on Syria, allowing an end to the country’s isolation from the international financial system and building on Washington’s pledge to help it rebuild after a devastating civil war.
The move will allow the US to maintain sanctions on Syria’s ousted former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, people linked to chemical weapons activities, the Islamic State and ISIS affiliates and proxies for Iran, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters in a briefing.
Assad was toppled in December in a lightning offensive by Islamist-led rebels and Syria has since taken steps to re-establish international ties.
Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani said Trump’s termination of the Syria sanctions programme would “open door of long-awaited reconstruction and development,” according to a post by the foreign minister on social media platform X.
He said the move would “lift the obstacle” against economic recovery and open the country to the international community.
Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift US sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.
Some in Congress are pushing for the measures to be totally repealed, while Europe has announced the end of its economic sanctions regime.
“Syria needs to be given a chance, and that’s what’s happened,” U.S. Special Envoy for Syria Thomas Barrack told reporters in a briefing call. He described Monday’s move as “the culmination of a very tedious, detailed, excruciating process of, how do you unwrap these sanctions.”
The White House in a fact sheet said the order directs the Secretary of State to review the terrorism designations of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a rebel group that Sharaa led that has roots in al Qaeda, as well as Syria’s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism.
The White House said the administration would continue to monitor Syria’s progress on key priorities including “taking concrete steps toward normalising ties with Israel, addressing foreign terrorists, deporting Palestinian terrorists and banning Palestinian terrorist groups”.
Layers of US sanctions
A Reuters investigation published on Monday revealed the role of Syrian government forces in the killing of more than 1,500 Syrian Alawites over three days of massacres along the country’s Mediterranean coast in March. The Trump administration had no comment on the Reuters report.
It was not immediately clear if Washington was lifting the sanctions on any of the factions that Reuters found were involved.
Syrians hope the easing of sanctions will clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organisations working in the country, encouraging foreign investment and trade as it rebuilds.
In the aftermath of Trump’s announcement in May, the US Treasury Department issued a general license that authorised transactions involving the interim Syrian government as well as the central bank and state-owned enterprises.
However, the US has imposed layers of sanctions against Syria, some of which are authorised by legislation, including the Caesar Act. Repealing the measures is necessary for Syria to attract long-term investment without parties fearing the risk of violating U.S. sanctions.
“We are now, pursuant to the executive order, going to look at suspension criteria for the Caesar Act,” a senior administration official said.
Most of the US sanctions on Syria were imposed on Assad’s government and key individuals in 2011 after civil war erupted in the country.
The dismantling of the US sanctions programme on Syria includes terminating from Tuesday a national emergency declared in 2004 and revoking linked executive orders, according to the order signed on Monday.
The executive order also directs additional actions, including some with respect to waivers of export controls and other restrictions, the order read.</p><small>2025-07-01 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011430449c2425f.png?r=143054' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921419/undefeated-pakistan-storm-into-asian-netball-semis-after-defeating-maldives' target='_blank'><strong>Undefeated Pakistan storm into Asian netball semis after defeating Maldives</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan remained unbeaten in the Asian Youth Netball Championship after defeating the Maldives 49-39 on Tuesday to cruise into the semi-final.
Today’s play marked the Green Shirts’ fifth and final group match at the Jeonju Hwasan Gymnasium in South Korea, and puts them at the top of Pool B with 10 points.
The first quarter saw tough competition with Pakistan scoring 14-12 against the Maldives, who dominated in the second quarter to end at 24-26 at halftime.
Pakistan marginally took the lead in the third quarter at 35-32 before ending the match at 49-39.
According to the new format introduced by Netball Asia, the semifinals will be contested between the top four teams of both divisions: Group A (Gold Cup Division) and Group B (Plate Cup Division) with cross-group matchups: 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd.
Pakistan will face Japan again in the semi-final of the Plate Cup Division on Thursday, July 3, having previously defeated them 79-39 a day earlier.
Today’s match saw strong performances from Leya Raza Shah, Alisha Naveed, Sumayya Kouser, Haleema, Jasmine Farooq, and Farah Rasheed.
Senior officials of the Pakistan Netball Federation congratulated the team on their victory and unbeaten run in the group stage.
Pakistan opened the tournament with a strong 71-15 win over Saudi Arabia on Friday, followed by a 56-32 victory against Chinese Taipei a day later, and an impressive 91-6 win over South Korea on Sunday.

The interior ministry has written a letter to the Frontier Constabulary commandant in Peshawar to deploy “one platoon” of FC personnel at the residence of the JUI-F chief “to avoid any untoward situation”.
The decision has been taken on the directives of the prime minister for security purposes and recent incidents involving the JUI-F’s chief son, Asjad Mahmood.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently visited Fazl’s residence in Islamabad and expressed concern over the attack and attempted kidnapping of the JUI-F chief’s son, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The prime minister expressed deep concern over the assault and foiled kidnapping attempt on Mahmood and inquired about his health, according to a statement from the PM’s Media Office.
PM Shehbaz issued immediate directives to arrest those involved in the attack and ensure swift legal action.
JUI-F leaders have come under attack in recent years in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. On May 15, a powerful explosion targeted the vehicle of local JUI-F leader Maulana Noorullah near a seminary in South Waziristan.
Police said the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed. The JU-F leader was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.
On March 14 this year, a bomb exploded at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others, police said. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.
On April 25, a local JUI-F leader and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near Kalat district.
The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.
The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.
In another incident on March 2, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-07-01 09:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011318305be5a68.jpg?r=131834' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921415/cambridge-offers-students-free-resits-for-nov-exams-following-june-paper-leaks' target='_blank'><strong>Cambridge offers students free resits for Nov exams following June paper leaks</strong></a><br><p>Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) has offered students to resit exams in the November session free of charge if they were affected by any of the three exam papers leaked in the recent May/June session.
The CIE board, which conducts O- and A-level exams, admitted last month that parts of its question papers for examinations in June had been leaked, and that said students will be given extra marks for those questions.
Just days prior to CIE’s admission of the leaks, a parliamentary panel was assured on that findings of the inquiry report over the issue of alleged paper leaks of O/A level would be shared after June 16.
In a post on its Facebook page on Monday, CIE shared an update for students  who sat one or more of the three affected papers in the June 2025 exam series: Cambridge International AS and A Level Mathematics Paper 12, Cambridge International AS and A Level Mathematics Paper 42, and Cambridge International AS and A Level Computer Science Paper 22.
 


“The results for these syllabuses will be released as normal,” CIE said.
“We’re offering free syllabus entry resits in the upcoming November 2025 exam series for students who sat one or more of the three affected papers in June 2025.
“We have sent a message to all candidates and their families through schools and will provide further information following the release of our June 2025 exam series results,” CIE added.
“Candidates are asked to contact their schools should they have further questions, and thank you once again to all students and families.”
While the May/June session was ongoing, students and parents had complained of several papers being scheduled on the same day and demanded a revision in the date, claiming pressure on candidates who had to sit two or even three exams in one day.</p><small>2025-07-01 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0112454817fcc1a.jpg?r=124606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921395/two-traffic-policemen-gunned-down-in-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Two traffic policemen gunned down in Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>Two traffic policemen were martyred as unidentified gunmen opened fire on them in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Tuesday, according to police.
“The traffic cops were on their way to Tajazai Adda for duty on motorcycles when they were fired at on Longkhel Road near Gulbaz Dehqan village,” read a statement by Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Shahid Hameed.
“The martyrs include Israel and Sanaullah, both of whom hailed from the Longkhel [area],” it added.
The police cordoned off the area and initiated an investigation.
 
 

Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Mohammad Jawad Ishaq specified that the four attackers were riding on two motorcycles and stole the policemen’s submachine guns.
DPO Ishaq further said, “The traffic personnel were dressed in civilian clothes when they were targeted.”
Lakki Marwat has seen a rise in attacks in recent months that reflect an increasing militant presence in the area, although unrest dates back to the early 2000s. Militant activity has resurged in recent years, straining local peace efforts and heightening fears of renewed instability.
Last week, the leader of the Shahab Khel peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in Lakki Marwat.
In June, police said they destroyed several hideouts of terrorists in the forest located along the Kurram and Gambila Rivers in the district during a search and strike operation.
Earlier that month, three terrorists were killed while a cop was martyred in the district’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee.
2 suspected terrorists killed in Bannu
Meanwhile, two suspected terrorists were shot dead after an exchange of fire with police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) personnel in KP’s Bannu district, a police officer said on Tuesday.
Police and CTD conducted a joint operation against the criminals in Bannu’s Domel tehsil, leading to an exchange of fire from both sides for over 20 minutes, a statement by Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan read.
“Resultantly, two terrorists were shot dead, while their accomplices managed to escape after taking advantage of darkness and nearby bushes,” the statement added.
The suspects were identified as Hussain Ahmed and Inaam alias Tooru, a resident of North Waziristan’s Haider Khel village.
“The slain terrorists were involved in several major attacks and IED (improvised explosive device) blasts,” RPO Sajjad added.
The police recovered two AK-47 rifles, four hand grenades, six magazines, 150 bullets, and two mobile phones from the suspected terrorists.
 
 

The alleged terrorist Inaam was wanted by the police and CTD in five different cases for attacking and killing police officers, while Ahmed was wanted in three different terrorist incidents.
RPO Sajjad noted that the Bannu police and the CTD had averted a possible major terrorist attack due to timely action. He said an operation to arrest the escaped suspects has been intensified.
He asserted that the CTD and police were determined to establish law and order in the area and completely eradicate terrorism.
Last month, several suspects were arrested and a cache of heavy weapons was seized during a joint operation carried out by the police, CTD, and the army in Bannu.</p><small>2025-07-01 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011237045269ce1.jpg?r=125541' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921408/psx-crosses-128000-barrier-on-first-day-of-fy26' target='_blank'><strong>PSX crosses 128,000 barrier on first day of FY26</strong></a><br><p>Bullish momentum continued at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday as the market crossed the 128,000 barrier on the first day of the new fiscal year 2025-26.
The KSE-100 index rose by 2404.51 points, or 1.9 per cent, to stand at 128,031.82 points at 12:15pm, from the last close of 125,627.31 points.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, attributed the rise to easing geopolitical tensions and the market “pricing in a gradual decline in interest rates alongside improving economic stability”.
“Investors are also anticipating a strong corporate results season and are rerating the market’s price-to-earnings ratio toward more normalised levels, the analyst said.
He added that in his opinion, the market had entered phase two of the bull run — characterised by increasing public participation and a broad-based rally across a wide range of stocks.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said investors are increasing exposure in equities from fixed income due to the higher taxation rate imposed on fixed income in the recent budget, choosing high-dividend-yield stocks.
“Continuation of monetary easing due to falling inflation driven by fiscal discipline, strong external account and focus on structural reforms would keep equities in limelight,” Ashraf said.
He anticipated that sectors benefiting from monetary easing and structural reforms, particularly related to the energy chain, would remain prominent.
Yesterday, the PSX ended the final session of the outgoing fiscal year on a bullish note, with the benchmark KSE-100 index soaring to a record high above 125,000. The rally was driven by aggressive buying at attractive valuations and strong year-end fund flows.
Also on Monday, the government projected a positive export outlook and a moderate rise in inflation to a range of 5-7 per cent for 2025-26, citing improved global economic conditions and domestic recovery trends.
In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the Ministry of Finance said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan’s major trading partners — including the UK, US, Eurozone and China — were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.
For June, inflation is expected to remain between 3–4pc. The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. “The uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,” the report said.</p><small>2025-07-01 08:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011213536b55521.jpg?r=121359' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921261/six-karachi-policemen-get-life-imprisonment-for-trafficking-drugs' target='_blank'><strong>Six Karachi policemen get life imprisonment for trafficking drugs</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A sessions court on Monday sentenced six policemen to life imprisonment after 77 kilograms of charas were recovered from their official police van as the contraband was being transported from Jamshoro to Karachi for illegal supply.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Abdul Hafeez Lashari found six police officials of CIA Jamshoro — Ghulam Abbas, Muhammad Yaqoob, Aijaz Ali Mallah, Abdul Hameed, Rahib Hussain and Ahmed Nawaz — guilty of possessing a total of 77kg of charas. He sentenced them to life imprisonment and awarded an additional two-year sentence under Section 155-C of the Police Order, 2002.
“Evidence available on record established that all the accused, were serving police constables, and they misused their official position, uniform, weapons, and a government-issued police mobile to transport a huge quantity of Charas. This act directly attracts the offence under Section 155(c) of the Police Order, 2002, which deals with misuse of authority by a police officer for wrongful gain or to cause wrongful loss to any person.
The investigation officer produced official documents showing that the accused were posted at CIA Centre Jamshoro and that the mobile used in the offence was officially allotted to the Incharge CIA. Furthermore, the contraband was recovered from the government vehicle, and the accused were in police uniforms at the time of arrest. These facts establish that the accused committed an offence under Section 155(c), as they clearly abused their lawful authority to engage in illegal drug trafficking,” the court noted.
The judge observed: “This case strikes at the very heart of public trust, when those sworn to uphold the law instead betray it, the damage reverberates far beyond the courtroom. Police officers are not merely enforcers of justice but they embody the covenant between the state and its citizens. Their participation in criminal acts fractures that covenant, eroding faith in institutions meant to protect society. 
It is a profound violation, for when guardians of law became agents of corruption, the belief of people in justice itself fades. This betrayal demands more than legal consequences. It calls for systemic reckoning. For a society to heal, institutions must not only punish the guilty but restore their own integrity through transparency, accountability, and an unrelenting commitment to the rule of law. Only then can the shattered trust begin to mend.”
The court also imposed a fine over 500,000 each, on default they would serve additional imprisonment.
According to state prosecutor Shakeel Ahmed Abbasi, in July 2021, the Boat Basin police had received a tip-off that a police mobile was transporting a large quantity of charas for illegal supply. Acting on the information, a patrolling team intercepted the vehicle and apprehended six policemen. Two sacks containing charas, weighing a total of 77 kilograms, were recovered from the official police van.
During the trial, the defence contended that the seized narcotics produced in court had melted and were not in their original condition. However, the court observed that this objection held no legal merit and noted that charas is a substance that can melt or deform due to heat or pressure.
The accused, in their statements recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, claimed they had been arrested by the Rangers personnel at the Jamshoro Toll Plaza. The court dismissed their claim, stating it lacked any supporting evidence.
The court noted that the prosecution presented consistent and credible evidence — including the FIR and witness testimonies — clearly establishing that the arrests were made near Khayaban-i-Sahil, opposite Sunrise Apartments in Clifton, as mentioned in the FIR.
A case was registered at the Boat Basin police station under Sections 6/9(C) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act.

The operating theatres of four private hospitals were also sealed. Action was taken after the death of 20 children at the District Headquarters Hospital, Pakpattan, as the authorities had the view that these children were brought to the hospital in critical condition from “outside”.
The private maternity hospitals which were sealed included Maternity Home (22/SP, Pul Bahmni), Al-Farid Medicare Hospital (DHQ Road), Bashir Maternity Home (Metti Stop, Hota Road), Dastagir Hospital (Chowk Ariayan) and Imran Maternity Home (Sikander Chowk). The facilities were operated by Sajida Sabir, Muhammad Pervaiz, Sitara (LHV), and Muhammad Imran, etc.
Deputy Commissioner Maria Tariq told Dawn that operating theatres of four hospitals- Doctor Hospital, Green Town, Shahid Hospital, Ali Hospital and MMC Hospital located at DHQ Hospital Road were also sealed.
On the other hand, Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhter Zaman said that there appeared to be no direct connection between the ‘missing facilities’ at the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) Pakpattan and the tragic deaths of 20 children reported last week. He noted that the deceased infants had arrived at the hospital in critical condition “from outside”.

CS visits DHQ Hospital, finds no connection between missing facilities and children’s death

“But we are examining all aspects with close scrutiny and professional depth,” he stated during his emergency visit to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Pakpattan on Monday. He said his visit to the city was in connection with the reported fatalities that occurred between June 16 and 22 at the pediatric ward of DHQ Hospital. The incident was initially reported by Dawn on June 27.
While addressing the media, the chief secretary said a five-member committee, comprising senior medical professionals, had already been constituted to investigate the matter and it would submit its findings within two to three days.
“I have directed the commissioner and the committee to personally reach out to the bereaved families, listen to their concerns and ensure that their statements are officially recorded.”
Mr Zaman noted that the chief minister was closely monitoring the situation and directed him to visit Pakpattan. He hinted that the CM herself might visit Pakpattan or meet with the families affected by the tragedy.
During the hospital visit, the chief secretary inspected various departments, including the pediatric ward, and reviewed the availability of medical equipment and staff. He directly interacted with several parents, assuring them that all deficiencies in the hospital’s infrastructure would be addressed in the near future.
Earlier, Deputy Commissioner Maria Tariq rejected the internal inquiry report of the 20 deaths produced by a three-member committee formed by Medical Superintendent Dr Adnan, which was led by Dr Muddasir, chief consultant pediatrician at the DHQ Pakpattan. The internal committee controversially cleared the pediatric staff of responsibility, recommending only ‘refresher courses’ on documentation practices. The ward’s death register reportedly disappeared during the finalisation of the report, raising concerns.
Following this, Commissioner Dr Asif Tufail had instructed the principal of the Sahiwal Medical College to assemble an external investigation committee headed by Dr Muhammad Shahid, associate professor and ICU head, along with Dr Muhammad Rizwan Ishaq, head of Medical Unit II, SMC.
Chief Secretary Zaman concluded his visit with a stop at Baba Farid shrine and reviewed arrangements of the 783 annual Urs. He was accompanied by Commissioner Dr Asif Tufail, RPO Mahboob Rasheed and other officers.

The government of Telangana, where the facility is located, has formed a five-member committee to probe the incident, the cause of which is yet to be disclosed by the company.
“We are still clearing the debris […] The building has collapsed and fabricated completely,” GV Narayana Rao, director of Telangana fire disaster response emergency, told Reuters.
“Once we are all done with the clearing, only then we will be able to assess if any other body is still remaining under the debris or if it is all clear,” he said.
On Monday, an explosion occurred at a chemical facility of Sigachi Industries leading to a fire, the police said.
Police officials said more than 140 people were working in the plant when the incident occurred. Twenty-five of the deceased were yet to be identified, district administrative official P Pravinya said.
Sigachi, which makes microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), caters to clients in the pharma, food, cosmetic and specialty chemicals sectors in countries ranging from the US to Australia.
MCC is primarily used to prevent the formation of lumps in food products, to maintain texture of cosmetic products, and as a fat substitute in low-calorie foods.
The plant contributes a little over a fourth of the company’s total capacity of 21,700 million metric tonnes per annum. Its shares dropped about 6 per cent on Tuesday and were headed for their sharpest two-day drop since listing in 2021.
The company did not say what led to the fire, but said it was halting operations at the facility for 90 days, citing damage to equipment and structures within the plant from the fire.
In a separate incident on Tuesday, five people were killed and four others injured in a massive fire at a crackers factory in the Sivakasi manufacturing cluster in the southern Tamil Nadu state, a fire department official said. The incident is the latest in a series of fire accidents in the area.</p><small>2025-07-01 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611828-cambridge-offers-free-november-resits-following-exam-papers-leak' target='_blank'><strong>Cambridge offers free November resits following exam papers leak</strong></a><br><p>

At his home, tucked between wall-sized shelves stacked with everything from constitutional theory to crime thrillers, sat a book I once borrowed, and then shamelessly failed to return. ‘May It Please the Court: The First Amendment’ is a collector’s gem, a gripping compilation of real Supreme Court cases and the arguments that once gave weight to America’s promise of free speech. It captures a time when the First Amendment still held meaning in the so-called land of the free, before it was gradually emptied by national security paranoia and rebranded as a talking point to defend corporate power and demagogic bluster.
The book revisits the fierce courtroom battles fought to defend free expression, and upholding the First Amendment, the constitutional safeguard that promises freedom of speech, press, religion, assembly, and the right to dissent without fear or favour — the very foundations of the ‘American dream’.
Down the slippery slope
I was reading the book again recently, and it felt grimly ironic to recall those legal battles now, at a time when the US — once the loudest champion of free speech — is sliding into a state of quiet authoritarianism. Students are arrested for protesting, ICE stalks immigrants through digital footprints, and speech that challenges power is flagged, monitored, and punished. The very rights once argued for so passionately before the Supreme Court are now, seemingly, selectively applied, if not openly discarded.
In yet another chapter of the post-Trump erosion of civil liberties, the US government has formalised what many feared would become the global template for ideological policing: social media vetting as a precondition for entry.
All F, M, and J visa applicants from Karachi and Lahore, including students, researchers, and exchange scholars, are now required to surrender every social media handle used over the past five years and strip away any privacy settings.
The US Consulates in Karachi and Lahore issued a special advisory for F, M, and J applicants, emphasising that mandatory disclosure of social media identifiers is now part of the core screening process. An Instagram post by the consulates reads: “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to ‘public’ to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States.
“Omitting social media information on your application could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future US visas,” they warned.

In this latest avatar of surveillance rationalised as policy, online posts are treated like ideological contraband, combed through by consular officials for memes, captions, and hashtags that hint at dissent. It’s a quiet but chilling escalation, where political expression becomes a liability measured not by law, but by algorithms, suspicion, and the shifting whims of empire.
Tightening the screws
In the courtroom transcripts Kamran so cherished, lawyers once stood before the highest court defending the right to burn flags, mock presidents, and speak without fear. Today, those same freedoms, especially when exercised by immigrants or folks of colour, are surveilled, catalogued, and punished in silence. The First Amendment, once a shield against state overreach, now hangs limp in the theatre of selective liberties.
I feel this isn’t just a draconian border policy but a slow, deliberate erosion of the right to dissent and the right to be human online. The First Amendment, long considered the North Star of American civil liberties, seems to have been effectively shelved.
There is little ambiguity about where this began. The Trump administration’s obsession with digital spaces as ideological battlegrounds first gave rise to the idea that visa applicants should be screened for their online views. This idea, originally floated in 2017 as part of Trump’s larger anti-immigration fervour, was then institutionalised under the cloak of counterterrorism. In 2019, the State Department expanded the policy to cover over 15 million people annually. In 2025, the screws are being tightened. What was once a soft screening has now become an explicit demand: unlock your digital self or be denied entry.
According to a Reuters report citing an internal cable, US consular officers have been instructed to carry out “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all student and exchange visitor applicants, with a specific mandate to identify individuals who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.” The cable, dated June 18, was circulated to US missions worldwide just days before the policy was set to take effect.
The message is clear
Who defines hostility? What is considered a threat? Can criticism of American foreign policy constitute subversion? Could satire be seen as offensive, extremist material?
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had documented multiple cases during the previous Trump era in which Iranian students, despite holding valid US visas, were detained at airports and summarily deported under vague “national security” justifications, without explanation, legal recourse, or due process. Many had already cleared extensive vetting, only to be flagged at the last mile. This was also the period when visa forms were updated to demand applicants’ social media handles, turning online expression into a minefield of suspicion.
Recently, a Norwegian tourist was denied entry into the US after officials found a meme of Vice President JD Vance on his phone and questioned him about past drug use. Homeland Security cited his admission as grounds, though the incident raises concerns about digital content being used to screen travelers.
 
 

But let’s be honest, when even Elon Musk had to scrub his timeline and issue half-hearted apologies to keep the leader of the ‘free’ world calm, what chance does a 22-year-old student from Karachi stand? The message is clear: your digital footprint can follow you across borders, and in the land of filtered freedoms, speech is free only when it flatters power.
This policy fits squarely into the blueprint of what I have previously termed ‘The Outrage Machine’, a political-industrial complex where demagogues are at the helm and social media platforms function as their whips. In this architecture, disagreement is not dialogue; it is treason. If you question, mock, or contradict the orthodoxy online, you are no longer a user. You are the enemy.
This is textbook authoritarian logic, draped in the language of administrative procedure. And it is not being driven by data. A 2021 study by the Brennan Center for Justice found no credible evidence that social media screening has ever prevented a terror attack. On the contrary, it found significant racial and religious bias in how online content was interpreted and weaponised against applicants. The policy punishes not intent, but perception. And perception is deeply racialised.
Nowhere is this felt more acutely than in Pakistan. For young scholars and aspiring students, the US remains a coveted destination. But in 2025, that aspiration comes with a caveat: surrender your digital privacy.
And therein lies the quiet tragedy. The US, long a self-appointed champion of free speech and open society, is now importing the logic of surveillance states. It is hard to distinguish this from the digital authoritarianism practised in authoritarian societies where social media is routinely monitored for dissent. The difference is that the US does it while preaching democratic values.
Only the beginning
There is a strategic hypocrisy at play. The same government that warns against TikTok as a Chinese surveillance tool now demands access to the Instagram, Twitter and Facebook accounts of Pakistani students. The same administration that rails against digital censorship abroad is building a system to algorithmically screen beliefs at home.
Make no mistake: this policy will not remain confined to visa applicants. Surveillance logic never retreats. It expands. Already, we see private companies using AI to analyse employee social media. Governments across the West may be watching closely. What begins in Washington rarely stays there. What the US is doing in a bid to secure borders might just become a template for digital control.
Digital rights advocates have warned that policies like these do not merely violate privacy; they dismantle the foundation of the open internet. The right to express oneself without fear of retribution, to organise, to criticise power, all these freedoms are under siege when surveillance becomes a condition for movement. The right to privacy is not a luxury. It is a prerequisite for liberty.
Universities in the US must not remain silent. If academic freedom is to mean anything, it must include the right of students to think, speak, and post without being labelled a threat. If US campuses become ideological checkpoints, then the moral foundation of their global prestige collapses. This is not a war on terror, but a war on the unfiltered self. The kind of policy that makes students choose between their voice and their future. It is morally indefensible.
To conclude, I can say with near certainty that after authoring this, my future US visa applications are headed straight for the shredder. Tragic, I know. But thankfully, I’m not the sort who lets bureaucratic paranoia ruin my day. That said, if you’re feeling bold enough to share this article on your timeline, just a heads-up, your dreams of sipping overpriced coffee in Brooklyn and posting a selfie from Times Square might suffer a similar fate.
Choose rebellion wisely.

Salman Raja pleaded with the court in his letter, written on behalf of the PTI, to provide him the copies of each of the three sets of judgements, signed by all the 12 judges of the Constitutional Bench (CB). He said the website of the Supreme Court had posted only a short order with respect to the judgements signed by 10 judges, and not 12, of the CB.
The court order, signed by 12 judges of the CB who heard the review petitions against the July 12, 2024, Supreme Court judgement in the reserved seats case, has not been posted on the website of the Supreme Court, the PTI leader observed.
After an extended hearing on Friday, the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench overturned the July 12 majority judgement which had declared the PTI eligible for seats reserved for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies.
 
 

At the outset on June 27, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar had recused himself from the bench.
A majority of seven judges namely Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, Justice Musarrat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi had set aside the July 12 judgement on a set of review petitions, restoring the Peshawar High Court’s decision of March 25 last year which had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) of reserved seats in the assemblies.

Speaking at a press conference alongside senior party leaders at the National Press Club here on Monday, the MWM chairman said: “Azadari of Imam Hussain (AS) has been observed for centuries. It is a religious practice and a constitutional right of all schools of thought in Pakistan. Yet, every year, unnecessary hurdles and tensions are created for the people observing Muharram rituals.
“Punjab government officials are treating peaceful mourners as criminals and those officials’ performance can be gauged by the fact that ban on delivering of Muhar­ram Majalis speeches have been imposed even on some clerics and religious scholars who are now deceased.”
He condemned the FIRs being filed against organisers and participants of Majalis, as well as bans on entry of clerics and religious scholars in different districts and restrictions on the use of sound systems.

Minister says measures in place to ensure law & order this month

He described bans on Azadari processions and inspections of Im­­ambargah as hostile acts against the religious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution of the country.
 
 

“No one has the right to interfere with our religious rites. These are not just mourning gatherings of Imam Hussain; these are part of the faith for Shias as well Sunnis of Pakistan,” the MWM Senator said.
Senator Abbas appealed to the Federal Interior Minister to take serious notice of the Punjab government’s actions and ensure that Azadari continues without obst­r­uction in all parts of the country.
However, provincial minister Azma Bukhari defended her government’s measures. Addressing a press conference in Faisalabad, she claimed that comprehensive security measures were being ado­­pted across the province to ensure peace and  order during Muharram.
Ms Bukhari said the government was  committed to upholding interfaith unity and preventing any disruption to  the sanctity and solemnity of Muharram gatherings and processions.  However, public cooperation in this regard was imperative, she said  and appealed to religious scholars of all sects to play a role for the pea­ceful observance of  Muharram.

In online chats with Reuters on Sunday and Monday, the hackers, who go by the pseudonym Robert, said they had roughly 100 gigabytes of emails from the accounts of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Trump lawyer Lindsey Halligan, Trump adviser Roger Stone and porn star-turned-Trump antagonist Stormy Daniels.
Robert raised the possibility of selling the material but otherwise did not provide details of their plans. The hackers did not describe the content of the emails.
US Attorney General Pam Bondi described the intrusion as “an unconscionable cyber-attack”.
The White House and the FBI responded with a statement from FBI Director Kash Patel, who said: “Anyone associated with any kind of breach of national security will be fully investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
“This so-called cyber ‘attack’ is nothing more than digital propaganda, and the targets are no coincidence. This is a calculated smear campaign meant to damage President Trump and discredit honorable public servants who serve our country with distinction,” cyberdefense agency CISA said in a post on X.
 






Halligan, Stone and a representative for Daniels did not respond to requests for comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not return a message seeking comment. Tehran has in the past denied committing cyberespionage.
Robert materialised in the final months of the 2024 presidential campaign, when they claimed to have breached the email accounts of several Trump allies, including Wiles.
The hackers then distributed emails to journalists.
Reuters previously authenticated some of the leaked material, including an email that appeared to document a financial arrangement between Trump and lawyers representing former presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr — now Trump’s health secretary.
Other material included Trump campaign communication about Republican office-seekers and discussion of settlement negotiations with Daniels.
Although the leaked documents did garner some coverage last year, they did not fundamentally alter the presidential race, which Trump won.
The US Justice Department in a September 2024 indictment alleged that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards ran the Robert hacking operation. In conversations with Reuters, the hackers declined to address the allegation.
After Trump’s election, Robert told Reuters that no more leaks were planned. As recently as May, the hackers told Reuters, “I am retired, man.” But the group resumed communication after this month’s 12-day air war between Israel and Iran, which was capped by U.S. bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites.
In messages this week, Robert said they were organising a sale of stolen emails and wanted Reuters to “broadcast this matter”.
American Enterprise Institute scholar Frederick Kagan, who has written about Iranian cyberespionage, said Tehran suffered serious damage in the conflict and its spies were likely trying to retaliate in ways that did not draw more US or Israeli action.
“A default explanation is that everyone’s been ordered to use all the asymmetric stuff that they can that’s not likely to trigger a resumption of major Israeli/US military activity,” he said. “Leaking a bunch more emails is not likely to do that.”
Despite worries that Tehran could unleash digital havoc, Iran’s hackers took a low profile during the conflict. US cyber officials warned on Monday that American companies and critical infrastructure operators might still be in Tehran’s crosshairs.</p><small>2025-07-01 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611806-water-tanker-collision-kills-motorcyclist-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Water tanker collision kills motorcyclist in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

ISLAMABAD: The stren­gth of the ruling coalition in the National Assembly increased on Monday as a PTI-backed independent member joined PML-N.
The development came two days after the Supreme Court’s decision to deny PTI reserved seats in the National and provincial assemblies.
The decision was a se­­rious blow to the main op­­position party, which was facing numerous challe­n­ges, including internal di­­s­­­cord among its leaders.
MNA Chaudhry Usman Ali, who joined PML-N, also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday and congratulated him on the federal budget 2025-26.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Mr Ali expressed confidence in the government’s policies.
The lawmaker also discussed matters related to his constituency with the prime minister.
The MNA from Sahiwal had reportedly been awarded development grants worth Rs200 million for 17 uplift projects in his constituency.
These development schemes will be completed by the end of 2026.
Mr Ali won the 2024 general election as a PTI-backed independent candidate, defeating PML-N’s Chaudhry Muham­mad Ashraf, who had won the seat thrice.
Mr Ali secured 107,494 votes, compared to Mr Ashraf’s 96,174.
It was reported that Mr Ali also voted for the 26th Amendment introduced by the PML-N coalition government.
According to reports, more PTI-backed independent MNAs might follow Mr Ali and join the ruling party in the near future.
Talking to Dawn, PTI Infor­ma­tion Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that Mr Ali had alre­ady left the party as he was the only MNA who openly voted in fa­­vour of 26th Constitutional Amendment.
“Later, the PML-N led government gave him Rs 200 million for the schemes in his constituency,” he claimed. He said that Mr Ali’s uncle was a PTI ticket holder from Sahiwal, but later suggested the ticket be given to his nephew (Usman), who is a businessman.
Mr Akram claimed that the MNA had taken an oath never to deceive Imran Khan, and had even recorded a video to get votes from the people of his constituency.
But later, he started saying that the government was threatening him, which was also affecting his business. “He then said he was left with no choice but to support the government,” Mr Akram said.

• Power minister asks provinces to stop collecting electricity duty in bills
ISLAMABAD: The cost of electricity produced from gas-based power plants will go up by Re1 per unit as a result of the government’s decision to increase gas prices.
A public hearing held by the National Electric Power Regulatory Auth­ority (Nepra) on Monday was informed that the government has increased the price of gas for power plants by 17 per cent from Rs1,050 to Rs1,225 per unit from today (July 1).
The government team, led by Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) CEO Rehan Akhtar, added that even after the increase of Re1, power generation from gas-based plants would still be cheaper than imported coal and LNG-based generation.
Mr Akhtar told the public hearing that the CPPA had originally sought Rs0.1 per unit increase in monthly fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) for electricity consumed in May which has now been revised.
The cost of production was Rs7.49 per unit instead of Rs7.39 reference rate charged to consumers in May, leading to an added cost of Rs1.25bn.
He said overall fuel prices were in line with projections but two major nuclear power plants — Chashma-1 and Karachi Nuclear Power Plant — were on the periodic natural refuelling cycle, resulting in their non-availability.
He reported the settlement of about Rs5bn with independent power producers had been actualised and required to be surrendered to the consumers, with a benefit of about Rs1.43 per unit.
Since the consumers had been charged Rs0.93 per unit higher FCA during June, the actual benefit to consumers would work out to be 50 paise per unit in July.
Simplified electricity bills
Meanwhile, Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari has requested provincial governments to abolish the 1pc electricity duty charged in bills.
He said the move was aimed at “removing complexity arising from multiple charges, taxes, and duties being collected through consumer bills”.
The electricity duty on power bills has an inconsequential financial impact. For example, on a monthly bill of Rs5,200, the electricity duty would be about Rs53.
The minister, in separate letters to all chief ministers, stated the federal government was simplifying electricity bills to reflect the actual cost of power consumption, rather than serving as a mechanism for collecting various additional charges.
“As part of this initiative, the Power Division has decided to discontinue the collection of Electricity Duty through electricity bills starting from July 2025. We request provincial governments to explore alternative mechanisms for collecting provincial levies and duties, rather than relying on electricity bills as a collection channel”, the minister said, urging the provinces to cooperate.
Criticism of Power Division
On the other hand, the Power Division came under strong criticism from Nepra, K-Electric, and Karachi-based consumers for seeking a deferment of Rs4.69 per unit negative FCA adjustment for KE consumers on account of electricity consumed in April.
Nepra’s member law, Amina Ahmed, ruled the division had been in “a deep slumber” for the past two years when this issue was being discussed at length and had suddenly woken up to halt the mechanism.
She said the petition for negative FCA had been in the public domain for quite some time.
Now, the power division has sought a deferment without any approval from the federal cabinet and the prime minister, as required under the Constitution and past orders of the Supreme Court.
The hearing was also deferred earlier but the power division had failed so far to come up with a legal cover. Power Divison Additional Secretary Mehfooz Bhatti said the issue involved government subsidies and the government wanted to ensure uniform FCA across the country.
He said the case was in process for cabinet approval and a decision would be available in about 10 to 15 days.
Nepra Chairman Waseem Mukhtar and member, Ms Ahmed, indicated that such guidelines could be considered for future dispensation but the current process had to move forward because the power division was a non-entity without clear legal support from the government.
KE’s CEO Moonis Alvi questioned why a proposal for uniform FCA came up when KE consumers were already paying higher FCAs.
The regulator announced it would examine the matter from a legal standpoint before making a decision.

MOHAMMAD Yasin

ISLAMABAD: The upcoming UK-Pakistan Trade Dia­logue will prioritise reducing non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to enha­nce bilateral trade, British trade envoy to Pakistan Mohammad Yasin said.
“We’re launching the UK-Pakistan Trade Dialo­gue — a structured ministerial platform focused on reducing non-tariff barriers through practical cooperation, technical support, and regulatory alignment,” he said in a written interview with Dawn.
He expressed the hope that the dialogue would help accelerate progress in strengthening trade ties between the two countries.
Mr Yasin visited Pakistan last week to lay the groundwork for the trade dialogue, which is set to begin later this year. During his visit, he held meetings focused on investment opportunities, regulatory cooperation, and enhancing business-to-business linkages, particularly in high-value sectors such as tech­­­nology and pharmaceuticals.

British envoy hopes upcoming dialogue will help accelerate progress in strengthening bilateral ties

The dialogue aims to unlock the full potential of the bilateral trade relationship, which currently stands at £4.7 billion. It is intended to address persistent challenges in the business environment, diversify Pakistan’s export base, and improve market access to sectors beyond traditional textiles, including clean energy, digital services, and value-added manufacturing.
 
 

Key NTBs hampering Pakistan-UK trade include stringent UK technical standards, especially in textiles and pharmaceuticals, that many Pakistani small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle to meet due to the high costs of certifications. Add­itional barriers include sanitary and phytosanitary measures complicating agricultural exports, complex post-Brexit customs procedures leading to delays, and growing UK consumer demands for sustainably and ethically sourced products.
On Pakistan’s end, inefficient export procedures and infrastructure bottlenecks further impede trade. While Pakistani pro­ducts enjoy duty-free access under the UK’s Developing Countries Tra­ding Scheme, these non-tariff obstacles continue to limit growth, particularly in high-value sectors, preventing businesses from fully benefiting from the scheme.
Commenting on the prospects of a free trade agreement (FTA), Mr Yasin said: “While  FTAs require significant resources and time, this dialogue allows us to make faster, targeted progress on the issues that matter most to exporters to support growth. This work complements both countries’ economic priorities.”
There is currently no bilateral FTA between Pakistan and the UK. However, officials view the trade dialogue as a pragmatic step toward aligning standards and facilitating smoother market entry, potentially laying the foundation for a future agreement.
 
 

Mr Yasin also emphasised the UK’s commitment to supporting Pakistani SMEs, particularly in the tech sector. “We’re working through the UK’s REMIT programme to improve the business environment, enhance access to finance, and support digital transformation,” he said.
While noting that Pakistan’s tech and digital services sectors are among the most dynamic in its economy, the envoy said that the UK “wants to see more Pakistani tech companies use the UK as a springboard to access wider European and global markets”.
He highlighted the role of British development finance institutions in this effort. British International Investment is actively investing in Pakistan’s digital infrastructure and promoting financial inclusion, while UK Export Finance supports Pakistani firms seeking to expand exports or partner with the UK companies.
The UK is leveraging its development finance tools, Mr Yasin said, to help Pakistani firms expand their exports or partner with the UK companies.
Mr Yasin, however, parried questions about the impact of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor on UK-Pakistan trade and how the UK navigates geopolitical considerations while advancing economic cooperation with Pakistan.

The delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, is scheduled to hold talks with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and senior officials from other departments.
Talks between Pakistan and the United States, which have been ongoing for over a month, are expected to conclude this week, the Finance Ministry stated on Wednesday following a meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
The ongoing discussions, centred on reciprocal tariffs are part of a broader effort to “reset economic ties at a time of shifting geopolitical alignments,” according to Pakistani officials.
The finance ministry also noted that “a longer-term strategic and investment partnership is also under discussion.”
Pakistan currently faces a 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US. In 2024, Pakistan’s trade surplus with the United States was around $3 billion.
To ease tariff pressures and address the trade imbalance, Islamabad has offered to increase imports of American goods, including crude oil and expand investment opportunities for US firms, particularly in its mining sector.
“Both sides showed satisfaction on the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude the trade negotiations next week,” the ministry said.
Last week, the two governments co-hosted a webinar to promote investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector, highlighting the $7 billion Reko Diq copper-gold project in Balochistan.
Senior officials and US investors discussed public-private partnerships and regulatory reforms aimed at attracting foreign capital.
The US Export-Import Bank is currently reviewing financing proposals worth between $500 million and $1bn for the Reko Diq project.
In an interview with Fox Business, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration is negotiating trade deals with 18 “important trading partners” and expects several of them to be finalised in the coming weeks.
“If we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18 … then I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labour Day,” Mr Bessent said, indicating a more flexible timeline than the previously set July 9 deadline.
President Trump has already claimed he used trade as a leverage to stop hostilities between Pakistan and India in May.
US officials have said finalising trade agreements with both India and Pakistan could provide a much-needed stabilising influence and offer a path toward broader economic cooperation.

He said that after class on Sunday evening, the Qari called him into his room and locked the door behind him. “He took off my trousers and began to assault me. Despite my screams, he continued to assault me and then threatened to kill me if I tell anyone about it,” he said in the FIR.

This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the 15-member body and its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
Talking to Dawn, Pakistan’s Permanent Rep­resentative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, noted the challenges that define the current international landscape.
“Pakistan is going to assume the presidency of the United Nations Security Council at a time of global tumult marked by growing instability, escalating conflicts, complex geopolitical and geostrategic landscape, and serious threats to international peace and security,” he said.
 






A familiar role
While the presidency rotates monthly and does not carry executive authority, it allows the presiding country to influence the Council’s agenda and tone — a platform that matters at a time when the UNSC is increasingly seen as deadlocked, especially on issues like Gaza and Ukra­i­­ne. With global trust in multilateral mechanisms under strain, Pakistan’s leadership — even if brief — will be closely watched.
The ambassador underscored Pakis­tan’s commitment to its long-held positions on peaceful conflict resolution. “Pakistan has been a staunch and consistent advocate of dialogue and diplomacy… We will bring a principled and balanced perspective to the work of the Security Council,” he said, pledging to strengthen multilateralism and deepen cooperation with other UNSC members. “We seek to promote transparency, incl­u­sivity and responsiveness during Pakis­tan’s presidency,” said Ambassador Ahmad.  “We will closely work with other Cou­ncil members in a spirit of cooperation for collective and timely action… in line with the UN Charter and corresponding to the exp­ectations of the international community.”

In a late-night announcement, the Ministry of Finance said the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had reviewed and adjusted prices for petroleum products in view of fluctuations in the international market.
The ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) was increased by Rs10.39 per litre (four per cent) to Rs272.98 per litre from Rs262.59. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables. Transport fares seldom come down despite lower diesel rate.
The ex-depot price of petrol was set at Rs266.79 per litre against Rs258.43, up by Rs8.36 or 3.3pc. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle- and lower-middle class.

Petrol to be sold for Rs266.79/litre; HSD to cost Rs272.98/litre; LPG rate cut by Rs7.51/kg

 
 

At present, the government is charging about Rs100 per litre tax on both petrol and HSD, with fresh imposition of Rs2.5 per litre climate support levy with effect from July 1. Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, yet the government is charging Rs78 per litre petroleum development levy (PDL) on petrol, diesel and high-octane products that normally impact the masses.
The government is also charging about Rs19 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
LPG price cut
On the other hand, Ogra notified a decrease in the price of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs7.51 per kg or 3.1pc for the month of July. Ogra notified the new price for 11.8kg cylinder at Rs2,750.60 for July against Rs2,838.31 for June. It said the LPG producer price was linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate.
As compared to previous month, Saudi Aramco-CP price has decreased by 4.29pc, while the average dollar exchange rate slightly increased by 0.47pc, resulting in a decline in the LPG consumer price by Rs88.71 per 11.8kg cylinder (3.1pc).

GAZA: Women grieve amidst the rubble of Yaffa School, which was destroyed in Israeli strikes.—AFP

• Over 60 killed, including two dozen at seafront rest area; school sheltering refugees also targeted
• IDF admits ‘harming civilians’ at aid sites; claims new orders issued after ‘lessons learned’
• Israeli minister in Washington for talks, Netanyahu due to meet Trump soon for renewed peace push
GAZA / WASHINGTON: Israeli forces killed at least 60 people on Monday — in one of the deadliest days in weeks — as Israeli officials headed to Washington for a renewed diplomatic push to secure a ceasefire and the release of prisoners.
Following the resolution of Israel’s 12-day war with Iran, hopes for a halt to the fighting in Gaza have been revived, where more than 20 months of incessant bombing have created dire humanitarian conditions for the population of more than two million.
US President Donald Trump has recently urged Israel to “make the deal in Gaza”, while key mediator Qatar said Monday that “momentum” had been created by the truce with Iran last week.
But on the ground, Israel has continued to press its offensive across the Palestinian territory.
According to Gaza’s civil defence agency, 21 people were in a strike on a seafront rest area.
“The place is always crowded with people because the rest area offers drinks, family seating and internet access,” eyewitness Ahmed Al-Nayrab, 26, told AFP, recalling a “huge explosion that shook the area”.
 
 

“I saw body parts flying everywhere, and bodies cut and burned… It was a scene that made your skin crawl.” Another eyewitness, Bilal Awkal, 35, said “blood covered the ground and screams filled the air”.
“Women and children were everywhere, like a scene from a movie about the end of the world.”
Photojournalist Ismail Abu Hatab was among those killed in the strike.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that 27 others were killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire across Gaza, including “11 people killed near aid distribution points in the central and southern parts of the territory”.
Eyewitnesses and local authorities have reported repeated killings of Palestinians near distribution centres in recent weeks, after Israel began allowing in a trickle of aid at the end of May.
Samir Abu Jarbou, 28, told AFP by phone that he had gone with relatives to pick up food in an area of central Gaza around midnight.
“Suddenly, the (Israeli) army opened fire, and drones started shooting. We ran away and got nothing,” he said.
In the southern city of Khan Yunis, the dead and wounded were rushed to a hospital in an open-top trailer after aid seekers said they were fired on by Israeli forces in nearby Rafah.
“The targeting was deliberate, aimed at people as they were leaving,” eyewitness Aboud al-Adwi told AFP.
“There was no one among us who was wanted or posed any threat. We were all civilians, simply trying to get food for our children,” he added.
IDF admission
In a significant development, the Israeli military acknowledged on Monday that Palestinian civilians were harmed at aid distribution centres in the Gaza Strip, saying that Israeli forces had been issued new instructions following what it called “lessons learned”.
Since Israel lifted an 11-week aid blockade on Gaza on May 19, allowing limited deliveries to resume, the United Nations says more than 400 Palestinians have been killed while seeking handouts of aid.
“Following incidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted in the Southern Command and instructions were issued to forces in the field following lessons learned,” an Israeli military spokesperson said in a statement.
The statement said incidents in which Gaza civilians were harmed were under review.
It followed a Friday report in Israel’s Haaretz newspaper that Israel’s Military Advocate Gener­al had ordered an investigation into possible war crimes over allegations that Israeli forces deliberately fired at Palestinian civilians near the sites.
The spokesperson had no immediate comment on a Times of Israel report on Monday, citing the military, that artillery shelling intended to deter Palestinians from approaching certain zones near aid distribution centres had been inaccurate in at least three instances, resulting in 30-40 casualties, including several fatalities.
Ceasefire push
US President Donald Trump had said last week that he was hoping for a new ceasefire “within the next week”, and is reportedly pressing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the Gaza war.
Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari told journalists on Monday that “momentum” had been created by the Iran-Israel ceasefire on June 24.
“We won’t hold our breath for this to happen today and tomorrow, but we believe that the elements are in place to push forward towards restarting the talks,” he added.
 
 

Meanwhile, Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer is due to hold talks at the White House this week, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will visit the White House on July 7 for talks with President Donald Trump.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leav­itt said earlier that Netanyahu had “expressed interest” in what would be his third meeting with Trump since the Republican returned to power in January.
“I know that Mr Dermer is in Washington this week to meet with senior officials here at the White House,” she told reporters.
The spokeswoman said Trump’s “priority” was to “end this brutal war in Gaza”.
“It’s heartbreaking to see the images that have come out from both Israel and Gaza throughout this war, and the president wants to see it end,” Leavitt added.
Separately, Washington has announced the approval of a $510 million sale to Israel of bomb guidance kits and related support, after Israel expended significant munitions in its recent conflict with Iran.

In its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for June, the Ministry of Finance said Composite Leading Indicators (CLIs) of Pakistan’s major trading part-ners — including the UK, US, Eurozone and China — were all operating above their long-term average of 100, suggesting a likely increase in demand for Pakistani exports.
For June, inflation is expected to remain between 3–4pc. The ministry also forecast a positive outlook for Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) in the coming months, driven by robust trends in cement despatches and automobile sales. “The uptick in private sector credit reflects growing production activity and improved investor confidence,” the report said.
On the external front, rising remittances and exports are expected to keep the current account in surplus during FY25.
From July to May FY25, the current account posted a surplus of $1.8bn, in stark contrast to a deficit of $1.6bn during the same period last year.

Remittances, export growth and fiscal discipline drive economic optimism

Goods exports rose 4pc to $29.7bn, while imports increased 11.5pc to $54.1bn, widening the trade deficit to $24.4bn from $20bn a year earlier. Key export gains were seen in knitwear (14.5pc), garments (16.4pc), and bedwear (10.6pc). Major import increases were recorded in palm oil (26.3pc) and electrical machinery (13.6pc), while crude oil imports declined 1.7pc.
Service exports grew 8.5pc to $7.6bn, with imports rising 6.6pc to $10.3bn, resulting in a $2.7bn services trade deficit. IT exports surged by 18.7pc to $3.5bn.
Worker remittances saw a sharp increase of 28.8pc, reaching $34.9bn from $27.1bn in the same period last year, led by higher inflows from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Net foreign direct investment (FDI) stood at $2bn, slightly down from $2.1bn a year ago.
China remained the top investor with $790.4m, followed by the UK with $229m and Hong Kong with $215.2m. The financial services sector attracted the most FDI at $628.9m, followed by power ($562.8m) and oil & gas exploration ($265.6m).
However, foreign portfolio investment recorded net outflows, with $312.5m from the private sector and $311.9m from the public sector. As of June 13, the country’s foreign exchange reserves stood at $17bn, including $11.7bn held by the State Bank of Pakistan.
On the fiscal side, the report noted that revenue growth outpaced expenditure growth during July-April FY25, reflecting the success of the government’s fiscal consolidation drive.
The fiscal deficit declined to 3.2pc of GDP, down from 4.5pc in the same period last year, while the primary surplus improved to 3.2pc of GDP from 1.5pc a year earlier.

• Says Pakistan charting forward-looking course as world transforms from unipolar to multipolar
• FO welcomes The Hague court award, calls on New Delhi to resume treaty implementation
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan remains deter­mined to protect its rights and entitlements under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and firmly rejects India’s attempts to weaponise water for its narrow geopolitical objectives, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office also called on India to resume the functioning of the treaty, which it has held in abeyance since May.
Speaking at the 52nd Foundation Day ceremony of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI), Mr Dar said India’s illegal and unilateral action of putting the treaty “in abeyance” has no validity. He further said the mettle of the nation was tested again recently — with India’s unfounded allegations following the Pahalgam attack, and its unprovoked aggression in May 2025.
Islamabad swiftly retaliated to the Delhi’s escalation with a “quid pro quo plus” response — which is the “new normal” set by Pakistan if India insists on its dangerous notion of “limited war under the nuclear threshold”, he said.
‘Hinge moment’
The foreign minister further said Pakistan values the efforts of all friendly countries, including the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Türkiye that resulted in preventing further escalation with India and putting the ceasefire in place.
“Going forward, it is essential to consolidate the ceasefire, institute a reliable crisis management mechanism, and develop confidence-building measures that would help stabilise the regional security situation,” he remarked.
 
 

“It is our considered view that sustainable peace in South Asia remains contingent on a just and lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.”
Mr Dar said the world was passing through another “hinge” moment in history. He said the profound transformation was taking place in the world order and the globe was witnessing changes unseen in a century.
The peaceful rise of China, attempts to ‘contain’ China’s rise, resurgence of Russia, increasing salience of Eurasia in global geopolitics, emergence of ‘Middle Powers’, and the growing role of the ‘Global South’ are some of the prominent features of this transitional phase, he remarked.
He said that amidst global turbulence and transformation, from unipolar world to a multipolar one, Pakistan is charting a forward-looking course as a confident and self-assured nation.
Gaza and Iran
He observed that Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza continues to be a stain on the conscience of humanity.
“The wanton killing of children and women, use of starvation as an instrument of war, mass destruction of homes, schools, hospitals and critical infrastructure, and deliberate targeting of humanitarian workers have no parallels in history.”
“These actions are beyond condemnation,” he said.
“We condemned Israel’s completely unjustified aggression against Iran as well as the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities by the US”.
Mr Dar further said these actions, representing a highly dangerous escalation, have been in violation of the UN charter and international law.
He said Islamabad has consistently supported Iran’s legitimate right to self-defence under the Charter. “We appreciate the constructive and pragmatic approach that Iran adopted in finding a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue.”
Positive trajectory
He said that in recent months, Pakistan has purposefully made efforts to reset its relations with Afghanistan on a positive trajectory.
“Among other things, we agreed to upgrade our diplomatic representation to ambassadorial level and extend CPEC to Afghanistan,” he said.
 
 

“Having made sincere efforts in Afghanistan’s interest, it is our legitimate expectation that the Afghan interim government would take all steps necessary to ensure that Afghanistan’s soil is not used for terrorism against any state, particularly Pakistan.
India urged to restore IWT
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) has welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague to issue a “supplemental award” on its case over the Indus Waters Treaty.
“In a supplemental award announced on 27 June 2025, the Court of Arbitration hearing the Pakistan-India dispute over Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects has found that its competence remains intact, and that it has a continuing responsibility to advance these proceedings in a timely, efficient, and fair manner,” the FO said.
“The Court of Arbitration decided to announce this supplemental award in the wake of India’s illegal and unilateral announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.”
The FO urged India to “immediately resume the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and fulfil its treaty obligations, wholly and faithfully.”

In a two-page letter to the JCP secretary, Justice Mulakhail has raised an objection to the invitation extended to the former judge to participate in the JCP meeting.
The application highlighted that in line with constitutional practice, every time a nomination for the chief justice of a high court has been presented to the commission, the nomination of the former judge was made afresh.
For the nomination of Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel as BHC chief justice, Justice (retd) Qazi Faez Isa was nominated as a JCP member.

This was claimed by the think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) in its report for the second quarter of current year. The report claims that fatalities dropped from 900 in Q1 to 615 in Q2, 2025, a metric behind the reported 32pc reduction in violence.
The fatalities suffered by security personnel and civilians combined (282) were still less than the total number of outlaws’ fatalities recorded (333) – amounting to over 15pc less losses among civilians and security officials. Around 32pc and 40pc less violence was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces, respectively, compared to the first quarter.
The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was the main contributor to violence in KP, and Balochistan remained a parallel epicentre of unrest, marked by a deadly mix of separatist militancy and targeted violence, particularly against security forces of the country.

“The spread of militancy into previously calmer areas is also concerning. Pakistan’s largest province of Punjab, on the other hand, witnessed an alarming trend, recording a surge in fatalities by 162pc, though the number of fatalities was low; from 8 in Q1 to 21 in Q2, 2025. Notably, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which reported zero fatalities in Q1, recorded six deaths in Q2. Islamabad and Sindh remained largely unaffected with minimal fluctuations,” it said.
 
 

While the intensity of violence has eased in traditional hotspots, its spread to new or less-prepared regions will require continued attention and policy adjustments.
Civilians suffered 107 terror attacks, compared to security officials suffering 91 and outlaws targeted in 75 security operations. Moreover, they suffered 249 injuries compared to security officials suffering 120 injuries and outlaws with only 19.
Meanwhile, deaths among outlawed elements — militants and insurgents — fluctuated around 35pc during 2021 to 2024 but surged to around 55pc by Q2, 2025, indicating intensified and successful counter-terrorism campaigns.
