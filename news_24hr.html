Sources said that acting on an intelligence tip-off, police raided a hideout in Ambari village in Karak district. An exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the death of Nisar Hakim, a key IS-K commander.
Four policemen were also wounded in the shootout, that lasted around four hours.
According to sources, Hakim was believed to be the mastermind of a failed suicide bombing targeting the JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
Karak has long been under the radar of the security and intelligence apparatus for ISKP network and recruitment.

Mr Mamdani, who will become the Big Apple’s first mayor of Muslim and South Asian descent, has indeed created history, through a relentless campaign to convince the citizens of one of the world’s greatest and most diverse cities to give him a chance in the driving seat. His victory also gives progressive forces the world over some hope at a time when the far right is ascendant globally. Mr Mamdani is truly a citizen of the world; his parents have roots in the subcontinent, he was born in Uganda and later became a naturalised American citizen, while his wife is Syrian.
Domestically, his appeal to NYC’s working men and women, its immigrant communities and young voters helped pull off a stunning victory. The self-professed social democrat’s campaign promised to confront the cost of living crisis by raising taxes on the superrich. On the foreign front, he is a staunch supporter of Palestine.
 
 

After the euphoria fades and Mr Mamdani moves into City Hall, he will have his work cut out for him. After all, his progressive stances — and proud embrace of his religious and ethnic identity — have earned him strong detractors. Perhaps the most prominent is the US president, who has derisively referred to the mayor-elect as a ‘communist’, and had earlier threatened to cut federal funding of NYC if Mr Mamdani won.
Moreover, the Democratic Party establishment was slow in its endorsement, while NYC’s new mayor faced vile abuse targeting his religion, ethnic background, and even his eating habits, on the campaign trail. He was also accused of antisemitism for resisting the powerful Zionist lobby.
All these negative forces will continue to create obstacles in Zohran Mamdani’s way. Yet his victory — as well as Sadiq Khan’s success as London mayor — is a resounding denunciation of the far right’s demonisation of Muslims and immigrants.
These political journeys show that many young voters in the West are looking to back candidates that support social and economic justice platforms, and are least concerned about candidates’ ethnic or confessional backgrounds. Racists and Islamophobes may be on the march, but Mr Mamdani’s victory rekindles some hope.

• Says any cut in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 9.4pc share in NFC award unacceptable
ISLAMABAD: The PTI parliamentary party on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, after the chief minister was reportedly denied access on four occasions despite directions issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The resolution, which was later submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat, claimed that Mr Khan is the head of Pakistan’s largest political party and that it is the constitutional and democratic right of the KP chief minister to meet him in Adiala jail.
Members of the parliamentary party deman­ded that the IHC’s orders be implemented, terming the continued denial a violation of democratic norms and parliamentary mandate.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was present during the meeting.
Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi warned that the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment would amount to an attack on provincial autonomy.
He said that the KP government would take all possible steps to resist what he described as an attempt to roll back powers guaranteed to provinces under the Constitution.
He stated that the proposed amendment was “nothing but an encroachment on provincial rights” and that it would not be tolerated at any cost.
He added that PTI considered itself the guardian of the Constitution and would continue to protect it.
KP CM to visit jail again today
Responding to questions about his repeated attempts to meet the PTI founder in jail, Mr Afridi expressed disappointment that the IHC’s facilitation orders had not been implemented and said his democratic right had been violated.
He announced that he would visit Adiala jail on Thursday (today), noting that meetings with Mr Khan were officially allowed on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
About the NFC Award, Mr Afridi said that KP’s share of 19.4 per cent must not be reduced.
He argued that KP had rendered the greatest sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, with many of its residents martyred, and that decreasing the province’s financial share would amount to ignoring those sacrifices.
Post on Imran’s X account
Meanwhile, a post issued from Imran Khan’s account on the social media platform X, reportedly based on comments shared by his sister, claimed that the rule of law no longer prevailed in the country. It remains unclear who currently operates Mr Khan’s account; however, he has never publicly disassociated himself from posts made in his name.
 






The post described the current leadership as presiding over a period of “oppression” and alleged that incidents such as those of May 9, 2023, and the recent events in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Muridke represented abuses of state authority.
In a message directed at supporters, the PTI founder stated that a nation which embraces the principle of “freedom or death” cannot be stopped from attaining true independence.
He said that legal counsel Salman Akram Raja would transmit all party-related instructions and ensure their implementation.
PTI to oppose 27th Amendment
Separately, PTI Central Infor­mation Secre­tary Sheikh Waqas Akram reaffirmed that the party would go to any extent to block the proposed 27th Constitution Amendment.
 
 

He alleged that a non-representative government was pushing the amendment to weaken provincial autonomy, politicise state institutions, curtail media freedom, restrict judicial independence, and concentrate power.
He said the PTI would not allow the government to undo provincial rights, undermine parliamentary authority, or compromise on judicial oversight, stating that such measures would be unacceptable.

On Monday, Washington circulated the document among several Council members, proposing a mandate of at least two years, until December 2027, along with the possibility of extensions.
Diplomats privy to developments told Dawn that President Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan is attached to the resolution that all UN Security Council members formally received on Tuesday afternoon.
The resolution, one source said, contains several ambiguities.
The draft does not seek a UN mandate for the proposed ISF, which will operate under the newly proposed Board of Peace.
The ISF is also expected to disarm Hamas, but will have no authority over Israeli military activities. The resolution also makes no reference to a “pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” although the concept is included in Trump’s 20-point plan.
Pakistan was among the parties that received the draft resolution last week, although it has not yet taken a public position on it. Even Indonesia has conveyed that it will not send troops to Gaza if the objective is “only to disarm Hamas”.
Jakarta, like the rest of the eight-nation Muslim bloc, is also seeking a UN mandate for the mission — if not for the force — and wants the UNSC to have a role.

• SAEP maintains it is not on strike, can’t issue clearance certificates at passengers’ expense
RAWALPINDI: The PIA on Wednesday managed to “partially restore its flight operations” amid a protest by aircraft engineers under the umbrella of the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP).
The tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP has been going on for three days over the safety of aircraft, causing delays in the departure of domestic and international flights at multiple major airports. On Wednesday, the PIA cancelled six flights to adjust the schedule of already delayed flights.
On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, and hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
The PIA claimed that the engineers were on “strike” while the SAEP said that they were on duty but not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Against this backdrop, the PIA management called the SAEP president and general secretary for an inquiry on Tuesday, but they didn’t even show up on Wednesday.
A PIA spokesman confirmed that the two office-bearers were summoned by the PIA management for the final hearing as an investigation against them had been underway. The PIA will initiate legal action against them in line with the law, he explained. He said that PIA flight operations had been partially restored through alternative means, hoping that the situation would become normal very soon.
SAEP Secretary General Awais Jadoon said that they are on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances,” he explained.
He said that the engineers were not on strike, adding that they could not make compromises on the safety of travellers, as they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying.
When asked about their meeting with the PIA management, he explained that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.

• Observers see possibility of upgrading office of Chairman Joint Chiefs to enhance synergy between various military branches
• Legal experts split over whether statutory ‘rationalisation’ even requires changes to Constitution
THE debate over possible changes to Article 243 of the Constitution – as part of the planned 27th Amendment proposing major restructuring of financial, administrative and judicial systems – has once again drawn attention to the complex history of the provision, and how both political dispensations and dictatorships have used it to tilt the civil-military balance.
A closer look at the evolution of this provision shows that almost every amendment has mirrored the prevailing power struggle between elected governments and the military establishment, and the tug-of-war between them over control of top appointments in the armed forces, including the army chief.
Article 243 governs the relationship between the prime minister (as head of the federal government) and the president (as the head of state) in relation to the control and command of the armed forces.
While the federal government has the power to command the military, the “supreme command” of the armed forces vests in the president, a phrase inserted by Gen Ziaul Haq through the Revival of the Constitution Order (RCO) of 1985, ahead of the party-less elections that year.
Changes by successive regimes
A lawyer explained that this was the first major change to the article. Zia later went further, empowering himself through the 8th Amendment to appoint the service chiefs and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee “at his discretion”, sidelining the prime minister altogether.
These changes reflected a military ruler’s desire to concentrate authority over the armed forces in the presidency he occupied at that moment. In effect, the then-army chief arrogated the powers to appoint not only other service chiefs and chairman joint staff committee but also his successor.
This structure largely survived subsequent constitutional overhauls. Even the 18th Amendment, which aimed to restore the parliamentary character of the 1973 Constitution, did not remove the reference to the president as “supreme commander”.
 
 

Under the original arrangement, the president’s role was limited to formal functions such as raising and maintaining the armed forces and granting commissions, while appointments were made on the prime minister’s advice in accordance with Article 48.
Civilian leaders later tried to restore the earlier balance. In 1997, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif used the 13th Amendment to remove the phrase “in his discretion”, reinstating the prime minister’s authority over top military appointments.
But the change proved short-lived. Gen Pervez Musharraf’s 17th Amendment restored presidential dominance by replacing it with “in consultation with the prime minister” — effectively reducing the premier to a consultee whose advice the president was not bound to follow. By then, the general had already shifted to the presidency.
The pendulum swung back once again with the 18th Amendment, which repealed Musharraf’s changes and made these appointments explicitly subject to the prime minister’s advice, reaffirming civilian supremacy.
Each of these adjustments to Article 243 was more than a legal modification; these were a reflection of the shifting balance of power between elected governments and the military leaderships.
 
 

That said, constitutional experts across the board believe that the proposed changes to Article 243 — though still undisclosed — may run deeper than ever before and could prove far more consequential for the country’s power structure than any of the previous ones.
Yet, no one really has a clue as to what exactly is being proposed or why. The scope of the amendment remains unclear.
That uncertainty, however, has not stopped social media users from speculating wildly, each according to their political leanings. Even members of the government appear to be in the dark. A state minister was recently seen struggling to respond when asked about the matter during a television current affairs programme.
Role of the chief
The renewed discussion around Article 243 may be linked to the increase in the army chief’s tenure to five years, extendable for another five, through the controversial 26th Amendment. However, this change created fresh confusion.
The present army chief – who was recently elevated as field marshal, a ceremonial title not provided for in Article 243 – was appointed under the earlier law providing a three-year term extendable for the same period.
Legal experts now hold two conflicting views: one side argues that since the law has been amended, the term automatically stands extended to five years, while the other contends that because the appointment was made under the previous rules, a fresh notification would be required to extend it under the new provisions.
Some lawyers believe the proposed constitutional amendment could be aimed at removing this uncertainty and ensuring clarity regarding the current army chief’s term.
Others see it as a broader move to institutionalise the existing civil-military balance (or imbalance) by giving constitutional cover to certain powers or offices.
Still more speculate that it might be about creating a new position on the pattern of some other countries, where the Chief of Defence Staff is the permanent chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, and is responsible for ensuring ‘joint-ness’ and synergy between the army, navy, and air force.
Such a position can be created by law without altering the Constitution, one lawyer pointed out. “If a new position is being considered here, its role must first be defined. The posts of the service chiefs are statutory, not constitutional.”
Whatever the motive, the history of Article 243 shows that even small textual changes carry deep implications. Each amendment has marked a moment when the delicate balance between civilian and military authority shifted one way or the other. If fresh changes are indeed being contemplated, they will likely have a similar effect, shaping not only the legal framework of command but also the broader political dynamics that have long defined Pakistan’s civil-military relationship.
Changing nature of conflict
Even the ‘rationale’, offered by military sources for the upcoming changes in this article, offers little in the way of concrete information; it simply stresses that the nature of warfare has changed significantly in recent years.
Conflicts are no longer limited to the traditional battlefield or restricted military spheres, it argues, while maintaining that the emerging security environment is characterised by hybrid, cyber, informational, and space-based threats.
These changes necessitate a reconsideration of the existing defence structure, according to security officials, without specifying the proposed changes.
The ‘impugned’ article is also only discussed once, in terms of the structure of the armed forces; military sources argue that this was formulated according to the requirements of a different era. The framework was primarily designed in the context of conventional warfare and separate service boundaries, but the the demands of modern warfare require far greater integration and synergy.
Joint planning, inter-service cooperation, and strategic alignment at the central level have now become indispensable, they argue, adding that a lack of such synergy affects the effectiveness of collective defence capabilities and the speed of response.
Therefore, in their view, a balanced institutional review is necessary to align the armed forces with current threats.
Security circles believe that the review is a refinement of the effective implementation of constitutional command and control. The objective, in their view, should be to adapt institutional structures to modern, multi-dimensional warfare realities. It is through this evolutionary process that Pakistan can make its defence posture effective, unified, and reliable.
More questions than answers
If anything, the statement raises more questions than it answers. Is a constitutional amendment to Article 243 really required for this purpose? Or could such structural reforms, if genuinely aimed at integration, be achieved through ordinary legislation or internal reorganisation of the armed forces?
Prominent lawyer Sameer Khosa argues that, from the rationale offered by security sources, it seems a joint head of services is in the offing – a Chief of Defence Staff-type position. “But it’s a very vague statement [of purpose], which does not shed light at all on what kind of amendment is required in Article 243 for this purpose.”
He is of the view that the changes in the control and command structure don’t require an amendment to Article 243 per se, which primarily concerns the federal government’s control over the armed forces and the appointment of the heads of the army, navy, air force and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee.
“Operational matters and the organisation of the services are governed by the Army Act and the Army Rules. So, unless an amendment touches on the appointment of these four service chiefs, Article 243 need not be changed. For operational or organisational issues, the article doesn’t need to be amended.”
Many agree with him. Even if the armed forces want to create a structure in line with that seen in other countries, i.e. headed by a single officer, it doesn’t require a constitutional amendment, explained another lawyer.
“You can change the structure of the armed forces through ordinary legislation. If a new position is being created, its role must first be defined. The posts of the service chiefs are statutory, not constitutional. You can establish such a position through law and then, if necessary, insert a provision in the Constitution specifying that the appointment, like the rest of the top appointments, will be made by the president on the advice of the prime minister.”
Amendment ‘isn’t the only way’
Waqqas Mir, an advocate of the Supreme Court, doesn’t see the rationale offered by security sources as a helpful basis for anyone to gauge the scope of potential amendments to Article 243.
“[However], if the aim is to set in place a legal foundation for impactful strategic and structural changes, then a constitutional amendment is the best way to go about it. Statutory rules can be easily undone so they don’t provide as solid a foundation as an amendment to the Constitution.”
He thinks that Article 243’s diktat that command and control of the armed forces lies with the federal government, and that the president is the supreme commander of our armed forces, is not something that is likely to see any formal change.
Yet, he feels that “it is possible that the advice of certain high ranking military officials could be given a role in certain strategic matters; but it would be surprising if an amendment addresses such micro level matters.”
Some think that the change in Article 243 could essentially be an attempt to entrench the existing civil-military balance, or imbalance, so that the current status quo is preserved.
Mr Khosa thinks this could be the case. “For that reason, it appears unlikely that either of the coalition parties — the PML-N or the PPP — will oppose this amendment, as doing so could risk destabilising the government as the coalition depends on the establishment’s support to stay in power.”
Mr Mir, however, differs slightly. “I trust the PPP will thoroughly debate the proposal and its micro elements. The party that impressively piloted the 18th amendment will have to make some important calls on changes to the federal governing bargain while preserving the provincial autonomy it has always admirably pushed for.”
“Many of us have lived in Pakistan long enough to realize that the Constitution does not always reflect our lived reality as a polity. Similarly, the Constitution is a political document dependent on how various actors shaping the civil-military relations interact. The nuance or complexity of this is at times far more complex than the text of the Constitution,” Mr Mir argues.
“Far beyond the 27th amendment, the important question is this: how do we want power to be distributed between and exercised by the highest offices in the country? That’s a much longer conversation than one amendment,” Mr Mir concluded.

A parliamentary delegation of opposition parties led by Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who has also been nominated as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, visited the JUI-F chief’s residence in Islamabad.
 






The delegation also included Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Allama Raja Nasir, who has been nominated as the leader of the opposition in the Senate, and PTI’s Asad Qaiser, the former speaker of the National Assembly.
A statement posted by the JUI-F on social media platform X said that the leaders discussed the prevailing political situation.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, Rehman warned those in power against making the Constitution a “plaything”. He said that a little over a year later, the government was pushing through another constitutional amendment in the same manner as before.
 
 

“When amendments are made under coercion, how can the people continue to have faith in the Constitution?” he questioned.
“My fear is that if this continues, public trust in the Constitution will be completely eroded,” he said. The JUI-F said that during deliberations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the government was “forced to withdraw 34 clauses that would have undermined key constitutional protections”.
“But now preparations are once again underway to do the same,” he lamented. He further said that the opposition had not yet received the draft of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, questioning how the legislation could be tabled in Parliament in such a scenario.
“But opposition parties will develop a unified stance on it collectively,” he said. The Maulana further said that the political environment was deliberately being pushed towards confrontation.
“One minister has been working on this amendment for three months. It means that the contents of this amendment came from somewhere else,” the JUI-F chief alleged.
He also accused Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar of deceiving the people, saying that up until recently the PML-N leader had been saying that there was no need for another amendment.
Meanwhile, PTI’s Qaiser said that the JUI-F chief had supported Achakzai’s stance.
“We will look at the 27th Constitutional Amendment collectively. The opposition will be united in the House,” he said.
He further maintained that Achakzai should be notified as the leader of the opposition in the lower house of Parliament as soon as possible.
Speaking to Dawn prior to the meeting, MWM’s Nasir said that there were two main reasons behind the opposition’s criticism of the proposed amendment.
“First, the 26th Constitutional Amendment is currently under litigation and is considered a controversial document,” he pointed out.
“We also oppose the 27th Amendment because we do not know what it entails. How can we support something we are completely unaware of?” he asked. Nasir slammed the incumbent government, saying that it had made a mockery of the state, the democratic system and the nation by showing a lack of transparency.
The meeting of the opposition leaders came the same day that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that clarity on a consensus over the proposed 27th Constit­utional Amendment was expected within two to three days, after which the legislation was likely to be tabled in Parliament next week.
Earlier this week, the PPP said the government had sought its support for the proposed changes to the Constitution. According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals for this new amendment include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
On Tuesday, Deputy PM Dar had confirmed the 27th Constitutional Amendment would be brought before Parliament “soon” but insisted it would not be rus­hed and denied “external hand” in the amendment.</p><small>2025-11-06 03:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/060753576b0f361.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953376/pakistan-among-nations-using-water-inefficiently' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan among nations using water ‘inefficiently’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan is one of six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use amid increasingly arid conditions, contributing to the annual global loss of 324 billion cubic metres of freshwater, according to the first edition of the global water monitoring report by World Bank.
The report, “Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future,” says about one-quarter of inefficient water consumption in rain-fed agriculture and one-third in irrigated agriculture are concentrated in regions experiencing declining freshwater availability.
These hot spots, where water inefficiency coincides with drying trends, are most pronounced in Western Asia, Eastern Europe, and North Africa.
On a national level, the highest share of inefficient agricultural water consumption under drying conditions is observed in Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Pakistan, Thailand, Tunisia and Romania, the report says.

WB report reveals world is losing 324 billion  cubic metres  of freshwater every year

Drawing on two decades of satellite data enhanced through new modelling techniques, the report provides an unprecedented view of how land and water management decisions are shaping water availability.
The past two decades have seen a global shift toward the cultivation of more water-intensive crops. Among drying countries, 37 have transitioned to more water-intensive agriculture, including 22 located in arid and semi-arid regions. This structural shift, coupled with inefficiency, further intensifies water demand in already water-stressed countries.
More than two-thirds of the inefficient irrigation in drying areas is linked to the cultivation of water-intensive crops, underscoring the need for smarter crop choices that align agricultural practices with water sustainability.
The report reveals that the world is losing 324 billion cubic metres of freshwater every year, enough to meet the needs of 280 million people annually. These losses are driven by worsening droughts and unsustainable practices, including poor pricing policies, weak coordination, deforestation and wetland degradation.
Global water use has risen 25 percent since 2000, with a third of that increase occurring in areas already drying out.

• Rahul hopes to repeat his UP success in Bihar with Lalu’s party
NEW DELHI: Two-stage state polls for the 243-seat Bihar assembly starting today (Thursday) are being seen as critical for the durability of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s minority government.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) party crucially shores up the Modi government, in which the BJP stands reduced to 240 seats from the 2024 general elections, well below the halfway mark of 272 in the Lok Sabha.
Mr Kumar’s JD(U) with 12 MPs and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu with 16 Telugu Desam MPs hold Mr Modi’s fate in their palms. Mr Modi, heading the ruling National Democ­ratic Alliance (NDA), has merely 21 MPs above a simple majority, and the two allies from Bihar and Andhra Prad­esh together add up to 28 MPs.
 
 

The NDA is widely seen as being held together in a quid pro quo arrangement whereby Mr Modi’s BJP supports the minority government of Nitish Kumar in Bihar, and he supports Mr Modi. Any setback to Mr Kumar’s hold over Bihar in the assembly polls — a scenario not being ruled out by pollsters — could adversely impact Mr Modi’s hold on Mr Kumar’s support for him. Mr Naidu too is a hard bargainer who began his political career as a Youth Congress leader.
However, much more is making the Bihar state polls on Nov 6 and 11 so crucial for everyone in the fray.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi made a significant comeback for his party in 2024, a gain that elevated him as the leader of the opposition in the Lok Sabha. But the laurels were won in lockstep with allies, chiefly in Uttar Pradesh where, together with the Samajwadi Party, the Congress was able to pare down Mr Modi’s numbers drastically.
Uttar Pradesh was principally responsible for the BJP’s loss of majority under Mr Modi’s watch. Rahul Gandhi is hoping for an encore, to upset the BJP in Bihar, this with the alliance he has formed with former chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav’s son. To their advantage, Bihar is the only Hindi-speaking state where the BJP has not been able to take power from its allies.
The question is, given the dire threats and pressures on both sides, would the BJP allow the opposition to gain the leg up. Mr Gandhi not for the first time may have put the finger on the nub of the matter. He has accused the election commission of working in cahoots with and for the BJP to steal the Bihar election.
 
 

He asserts this with the support of what appears to be the election commission’s fudged voters lists in recent state polls in Haryana where the Congress was unexpectedly trounced and in Maharashtra, where a Congress alliance was allegedly robbed of victory, were rigged with the connivance of the election commission.
The core of the charge concerns the excessively powerful election body’s drive to carry out a nationwide Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter’s list like the one that was carried out amid controversy in poll-bound Bihar. Mr Modi had changed the rules for nominating the election commissioner thereby giving himself a freehand to choose his man.
The opposition alleges that the election commission is helping the BJP by deleting voters perceived to be opposed to the BJP, primarily Muslims. The issue has galvanised opposition governments in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala who have joined hands with the Congress to widen the allegation into a movement.
The most threatened by any arbitrary act to tweak the voter’s list is West Bengal where the Mamata Bannerjee government enjoys more than a handy support of Muslims. Curiously, the BJP-ruled states of Assam and Tripura have been left out of the coming round of revision of the voter’s list. Opposition has cried foul over the exclusion.
So, what is going to happen in Bihar? Its caste arithmetic is as crucial as it is murky. The state abuts Nepal with which it shares an open border. Recent events in the landlocked country are being watched in Bihar. Gen Z voters are at the heart of this election campaign in Bihar: the state has India’s largest proportion of youth population.
“Nearly 58 per cent of Bihar’s population is under 25 years of age and hence belong to the Generation Z cohort,” says The Wire. “In terms of voters, one in every four voters is a Gen Z. Of them, 1.47 million are first-time voters.”

According to a quarterly report released by the Power Division, the new fiscal year began with Rs1.614tr, compared with Rs2.467tr in the same period last year. It said payables to power producers increased to Rs944bn at the close of September, up from Rs861bn at the start of the fiscal year on July 1. The payables to power producers had amounted to Rs1.688tr as of end-September last year.
The report said past debt parked in the Power Holding Company of the Power Division remained unchanged at Rs660bn during the first quarter of the fiscal year. It stood at Rs683bn by the end of the first quarter last year.
The power division reported that circular debt increased by more than Rs170bn due to inefficiencies and inadequate bill recovery by the Distribution Companies (Discos). However, this was significantly lower than the Rs239bn under the same account and period of the last fiscal year.

Power Division blames Rs79bn rise on inefficiencies, seasonal factors

The report showed that circular debt had increased by Rs73bn in the first quarter of last year, compared to Rs79bn this year. This was despite the fact that the finance ministry had disbursed Rs19bn in budgeted subsidies, compared to Rs28bn in unreleased subsidies during the same period last year. This was on top of Rs178bn in additional recoveries from consumers due to prior-year adjustments.
Excluding the above Rs198bn in additional funds from subsidies and prior-year adjustments, the circular debt would have increased by Rs276bn on account of Rs67bn in interest charges, Rs5bn in pending generation costs, Rs87bn due to distribution companies’ inefficiencies, and Rs84bn in under-recoveries.
The report claimed Rs229bn in receivables from K-Electric as of end-September 2025, including a principal amount of Rs42bn and about Rs187bn in markup.
 
 

The power division in a statement, however, tried to dispel the impression caused by its own report that an increase in circular debt by Rs79bn in the first quarter of the new fiscal year was a renewed upward trend, contrary to the government’s commitment to contain circular debt accumulation.
A Power Division spokesperson said the increase of Rs79bn in the first quarter “should be viewed in full context”. It said during the same quarter last year, circular debt had increased by Rs73bn, but by the end of that fiscal year, the overall stock of circular debt was reduced by Rs780bn. “The current quarterly rise is therefore attributable to seasonal and operational factors that typically influence monthly flows and are expected to reverse over the course of the year,” he said.
Importantly, Disco’s inefficiencies (losses and low recoveries) during July-September were reduced by Rs67bn to Rs171bn, compared to Rs239bn in the same period last year, underscoring the government’s firm commitment to improving operational performance and maintaining financial discipline in the power sector.

• Justifies changes to Article 243 as defence needs ‘have changed’
• Latest tweaks not meant to roll back 18th Amendment, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tells NA
ISLAMABAD: Clarity on a consensus over the proposed 27th Constit­utional Amendment is expected within two to three days, after which the legislation is likely to be tabled in parliament next week, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday.
Separately, the National Assembly was also assu­red that the 18th Amen­dment would not be rolled back through the new legislation.
Speaking to Geo News, Mr Asif said consultations were underway on amendments to the law governing the armed forces as the government considers constitutional changes. He stressed that discussions on amending Article 243 were ongoing because “defence requirements have changed”.
 
 

Article 243 of the Constitution provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces” and that “the supreme command of the armed forces shall vest in the president”.
Earlier, speaking to the media outside parliament, Mr Asif said he could not share details about reservations or discussions concerning the 27th Amendment.
He added that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had every right to express his views and that the government was enga­ging other parties in the same spirit to seek input.
‘Guesswork’
Meanwhile, responding to points raised by opposition members in the Nati­onal Assembly, Minis­ter for Parliamentary Aff­a­irs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry urg­ed an end to “negative and false propaganda” and den­­­­o­unced attempts to ma­ke the 27th Amen­dm­ent controversial ba­sed on “ass­­u­­mptions and gues­s­work” as an official draft has yet to see the light of day.
He said there was no plan to take control of provincial educational institutions or boards. “We are just talking about a uniform syllabus,” he said.
The minister said no step would be taken that weakened the federation, the provinces or their relationship. “The purpose is to improve governance, bolster defence and stre­ngthen ties between the federation and the provinces,” he remarked.
He added that allies and all stakeholders wou­ld be taken on board and that matters relating to the NFC would be decided through consultation.
Regretting that the 26th Amendment, passed last year, had also been portrayed as an attack on judicial independence, he said a separate constitutional court, as proposed in the 27th Amendment, would help reduce case backlogs. He noted that establishing such a court had been agr­e­ed upon in the Charter of Democracy, signed by the PML-N and the PPP in 2006.
He stressed that constitutional amendments req­u­ire a two-thirds majority, not consensus, and said the spirit of the Consti­tution would be upheld.
Call for consensus
Earlier, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said constitutional amendments should be passed with consensus, as happened in the neighbouring country in the past.
He argued that the 27th Amendment would run counter to the spirit of the Constitution and warned the government against dividing the nation. “It will further jeopardise the independence of the judiciary,” he said.
Barrister Gohar said the government was putting the federation at risk by pushing the amendment, adding that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces.
“These subjects were devolved to the provinces with the passage of the 18th Amendment,” he noted. He also questioned why a draft of the 27th Amendment had been leaked.
He said the opposition had proposed Mahmood Khan Achakzai as leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, submitting his name to the speaker’s office with signatures of 72 MNAs. “As per rules, the speaker should name the opposition leader; otherwise, I shall request Mr Achakzai to occupy the seat himself,” he said.
He also recalled the Supreme Court’s 2022 judgement directing the federal government to legislate within 45 days to provide civilians convicted by military courts the right to appeal in the civilian judiciary, and called for its implementation.
In his speech, Malik Aamir Dogar demanded that the chair immediately name Mr Achakzai as leader of the opposition under the rules.
Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa, who was chairing the proceedings, suggested the opposition visit the speaker’s office to discuss the issue, as a case in this regard was in court. 
Journalists’ walkout
Also on Wednesday, reporters covering the proceedings of the National Assembly also staged a walkout from the Press Gallery before start of Question Hour, to protest recent sacking of employees from a number of TV channels and curbs on media freedom.
Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah sent Information Minister Attaullah Tarar to negotiate with the protesting journalists.
Speaking on the occasion, Parliamentary Reporters Association (PRA) MB Soomro expressed his serious concerns over the recent sackings of a number of media workers from TV channels and various media organisations. He also in a forceful manner drew the attention of the minister towards the suspension of the government advertisements to Daily Dawn.
Later, speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, the minister expressed concern over the dismissal of journalists by several media organisations without prior notice or valid justification. He said the issue would be raised during a meeting with media owners scheduled for next week.
“We have ensured that timely payments are made to media houses, and we expect that these financial benefits will also reach working journalists and media staff,” he said.
Mr Tarar said a delegation of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) had met him to present a charter of demands. These demands will be discussed with media owners, including the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and All Pakistan Newspaper Society (APNS), in the upcoming meeting to find a lasting solution, he added.

Delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday for the two-day negotiations being hosted under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar. The talks follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
In this round, Pakistan’s delegation is being led by Lt Gen Asim Malik, director general of the ISI, and includes senior officials from the military, intelligence agencies, and the Foreign Office.
The Afghan Taliban’s delegation, meanwhile, includes General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq, Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani, Qahar Balkhi, Zakir Jalali, and Afghanistan’s chargé d’affaires in Ankara.
A diplomat from one of the mediating countries, while talking to Dawn on anonymity, said the two sides will review the implementation of the commitments reached during the previous round of talks and attempt to finalise the modalities for the monitoring and verification mechanism agreed in principle last week.
At the conclusion of the last round, a joint statement released by the Turkish foreign ministry had said that “all parties have agreed on continuation of ceasefire” and “to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and impose penalty on the violating party”.
The communique had further said that “the principals” from both sides would reconvene in Istanbul on Nov 6 to discuss implementation.
Despite the interim agreement reached at the previous round, officials in both capitals have kept expectations low about the upcoming dialogue.
Pakistani military and intelligence officials have stated that Islamabad’s position remains unchanged, that Afghan soil must not be used for terrorism against Pakistan.
“The Pakistan military and intelligence service have a single-point agenda — the end of terrorism,” military spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said earlier this week. Another security official, speaking on anonymity, said Islamabad seeks “concrete, verifiable guarantees”.
Earlier in the day, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said, “The delegation has gone today and the negotiations will begin tomorrow morning. Let’s hope Afghanistan makes use of wisdom and peace is restored in the region.”

Member administration of NHA, Omar Saeed Chaudhri, has also been repatriated to his parent department, the Ministry of Defence.
The Establishment Division issued two separate notifications regarding the removal of the NHA chairman and the repatriation of the member to the Ministry of Defence.
When contacted, the NHA spokesman said no one in the NHA and the Ministry of Communication was aware of the reason behind the chairman’s sudden removal. “The chairman worked in the office today (Wednesday) till 6pm, and the decision came in the night that stunned all in the NHA,” he added.
The removal of the chairman is believed to be the fall of the biggest wicket in the NHA amid the Carec controversy, as before this development, PM Shehbaz had already suspended eight senior officials of the NHA for being involved in irregularities in the award of Carec Tranche III project, including ghost tendering, by the authority.
Meanwhile, a source in the NHA told Dawn that the chairman was removed mainly because of the Carec controversy.
The Carec Tranche-III project has also come under scrutiny in five standing committees of the Senate and the National Assembly and the Public
Four days ago, the inquiry committee, formed by PM Shehbaz to investigate irregularities Carec project, had submitted its report.
A source in the Prime Minister’s Office had said the findings had been submitted to the premier in a sealed envelope, who is likely to decide the fate of the probe in “a day or so”.
In August, the premier had suspended eight senior NHA officials and formed a committee to probe irregularities in the award of the contract, including ghost tendering, by the authority.
PM Shehbaz had tasked inquiry to review NHA’s current practices related to blacklisting contractors; examine whether the NHA undertook due diligence during the opening of technical bids of Carec Tranche-III project; assess whether the NHA conducted the grievance redressal in the instant process transparently and judiciously; evaluate all stages in the award of the project so far to ascertain unnecessary delays, if any; suggest a way forward on the current process; and review any other matter ancillary to the above.
In September, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs Division recommended blacklisting a joint venture of three firms, which were awarded a project by the National Highway Authority in violation of the rules.
The Senate panel meeting also recommended sending a letter to the donor, the Asian Development Bank, to apprise them that the bids were “technically invalid and were manipulated due to the mala fide intention of the NHA officials and contractors”.
Carec is an Asian Development Bank-supported initiative that was created in 1997 to encourage economic cooperation among countries in the Central Asian region.

People were stuck in traffic jams for hours during the peak evening rush after the main thoroughfare of MA Jinnah road near Numaish Chowrangi was closed by police for security reasons.
The city’s traffic police had announced different diversions after the closure of the route, leading to traffic chaos, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to take notice.
Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) Deputy Inspector General Pir Mohammed Shah told Dawn that all traffic officers were present on the roads.
He said a portion of the main MA Jinnah road was closed for traffic, which had caused the traffic jam.
The city traffic police chief admitted that the citizens were facing immense inconvenience due to gridlocks. He said the roads near Numaish Chowrangi were closed for traffic because of security reasons, and diversions were provided to the citizens for the smooth flow of traffic.
CM Shah directed Karachi’s additional inspector general of police to restore the flow of traffic. “Traffic police should be activated immediately for restoration of the traffic flow,” he said, and summoned a situation report.
CM Shah warned officers of strict action if the traffic flow was not restored.
“Wherever there is a traffic jam, responsible officers will face action,” he declared, directing timely action for the convenience of the general public.</p><small>2025-11-05 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05224201ac352e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953324/pakistan-to-tap-loss-and-damage-fund-despite-reservations' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to tap loss and damage fund despite reservations</strong></a><br><p>As the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD) opens for business at COP30 later this month with money grossly insufficient to address damage caused by climate change, Pakistan is expected to submit proposals to the tune of $10-20 million to the FRLD board despite reservations.
Three years after its operationalisation at COP27 in Egypt, the fund has about $300 million in total and pledges of $700m by the Global North countries. Intended as a rapid response fund, the fund, with its interim secretariat based in the World Bank, has failed to disburse even a single penny to the affected countries, said civil society leaders spearheading the ‘Fill the Fund’ campaign.
Climate minister Musadik Malik also confirmed that Pakistan did not receive a single dollar from the loss and damage fund despite the catastrophic losses it has faced due to global warming.
 
 

Speaking to Dawn, Malik said the fund decided to operationalise $250m for its call for proposals at COP30 in Belem and 50 per cent of this amount was exclusive to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
“This means about $100-150m is set aside for the rest of the world, including Pakistan,” he said, adding the government was working on some projects in light of this call for proposals.

He said it was too early to share details as these ideas required time to shape up, adding that proposals worth up to $20m were under consideration.
The call for proposals came after the FRLD’s seventh board meeting (B7) in Manila last month, in which the board approved interim rules for its operationalisation while deferring some key decisions, leaving the fund reliant on insufficient resources.
North-South ideological divergence
Like all other climate negotiations, the meeting was fundamentally defined by a North-South ideological “divergence over the speed and mechanism of financial disbursements”.
 
 

One of the key criticisms against the fund is its “slow, bureaucratic design and complex rules for access”, which are completely at odds with the need for immediate relief, according to ‘Fill the Fund’ campaigners.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s climate minister said the hypocrisy of the Global North is daunting, as they are trying to shift their burden to the developing economies instead of paying for the damage they caused to the climate during their development.
It is very bizarre how these negotiations work out, he said while speaking about bureaucratic procedures that mar the climate talks.
Speaking about divergence between the North and the South, he said the developed world is seeking compliance from the developing states, while the latter are asking for a resource pool, technology and finance.

“But commitments are not worth the piece of paper on which they are published unless they are resourced… We say put your money where your mouth is because you have made this money by consuming the climate over the 100s of years,” the minister said.
Musadik pointed out that excessive bureaucracy and hypocrisy evident at climate talks defeat the purpose of such a rapid response fund. However, he said, Pakistan will cash in on all opportunities since its needs are dire.
At the UN climate conference, the country will continue to seek its rightful share in climate funds, highlight western hypocrisy, fight against red tape and make a case for ease of allocation and drawdowns from the loss and damage fund.</p><small>2025-11-05 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0522330363ae50a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953329/putin-orders-proposals-on-possible-russian-nuclear-test' target='_blank'><strong>Putin orders proposals on possible Russian nuclear test</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his top officials on Wednesday to draft proposals for a possible test of nuclear weapons, something Moscow has not done since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
The order — responding to President Donald Trump’s announcement last week that the United States would resume testing — was a further signal that the two countries with the world’s largest nuclear arsenals are rapidly nearing a step that could sharply escalate geopolitical tensions.
“I am instructing the Foreign Ministry, the Defence Ministry … the special services and relevant civilian agencies to do everything possible to collect additional information on the issue, analyse it at the Security Council and make agreed proposals on the possible start of work on the preparation of nuclear weapons tests,” Putin said in televised remarks.
Russia-US relations have deteriorated sharply in the past few weeks as Trump, frustrated with a lack of progress towards ending the war in Ukraine, has cancelled a planned summit with Putin and imposed sanctions on Russia for the first time since returning to the White House in January.
Putin issued his instruction at a meeting of his Security Council, where parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin departed from the official agenda of transport safety to ask how Moscow would respond to Trump’s plans to carry out US nuclear testing for the first time in 33 years.
The question, though meant to appear spontaneous, triggered a series of clearly prepared interventions.
Top officials urgent swift Russian response to US decision
Defence Minister Andrei Belousov told Putin that recent US remarks and actions meant it was “advisable to prepare for full-scale nuclear tests” immediately.
Russia’s Arctic testing site at Novaya Zemlya could host such tests at short notice, Belousov added.
General Valery Gerasimov, head of the General Staff, told Putin: “If we do not take appropriate measures now, time and opportunities for a timely response to the actions of the United States will be lost, since the time required to prepare for nuclear tests, depending on their type, ranges from several months to several years.”
No country apart from North Korea — most recently in 2017 — has carried out explosive tests of nuclear weapons in the 21st century. Security analysts say a resumption of testing by any of the world’s nuclear powers would be destabilising, as it would likely trigger a similar response by the others.
“Action-reaction cycle at its best. No one needs this, but we might get there regardless,” Andrey Baklitskiy, senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, posted on X.
 






Russia and the US are by far the biggest nuclear powers by numbers of warheads, followed by China, France, Britain, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea, according to the Federation of American Scientists.
No deadline set for drafting proposals on nuclear testing
State news agency TASS quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying Putin had set no specific deadline for officials to draft the requested proposals.
“In order to come to a conclusion about the advisability of beginning preparations for such tests, it will take exactly as much time as it takes for us to fully understand the intentions of the United States of America,” Peskov said.
Trump has yet to clarify whether the resumption he ordered last week referred to nuclear-explosive testing or to flight testing of nuclear-capable missiles.
Russia last month tested its new Burevestnik cruise missile, which is nuclear-powered and designed to carry a nuclear warhead. It also held nuclear launch drills and tested a nuclear-powered Poseidon super-torpedo.
Testing delivery systems for nuclear weapons does not involve a nuclear explosion. Such blasts were regularly staged by the nuclear powers for decades during the Cold War, with devastating environmental consequences that campaigners fear could be unleashed once again if explosive tests resume.

According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals for this new amendment include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
Addressing the National Assembly today, the PTI chairman spoke about the proposed amendment, remarking that when the 26th Amendment was being passed, the PTI “made great efforts” with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
“Maybe this time we won’t need to visit his (Fazl) home, or sit with you in committee,” Gohar said, directly addressing the deputy speaker, who was chairing today’s session. “We will raise our voice against it as it is an attack on the House.”
Gohar added: “Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs.”
 


The PTI chairman said the 27th Amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urging that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts.
“Amending the Constitution is this House’s right, and in this House, it is the right of those exact people who have the people’s mandate,” Gohar said. “Our democracy is very fragile; the people have no faith in the courts.”
He told the deputy speaker that when the 18th Amendment was passed in 2010, it was “passed with consensus and unity with the people”.
“The world acknowledged and celebrated it,” Gohar said. “However, when you presented the 26th Amendment, you brought 56 amendments, which were reduced to 25, then 18. We strongly opposed four of those amendments, including the constitutional bench, the tenure of judges and the preservation of the Election Commission.
“This is a time when the nation is very divided; tensions are high, terrorism is on the rise, the deficit is rising and people cannot bear further problems. Please, be concerned about Pakistan’s security.”
27th amendment not meant to rollback 18th amendment: Tariq Fazal Chaudhry
Responding to some points raised by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry called for bringing “negative and false propaganda” to a halt.
He assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th amendment.
He denounced the attempts to make the 27th amendment controversial even before the official draft saw the light of day on the basis of assumptions and guesswork.
He said there was no plan to take over the control of educational institutions and education boards in the provinces. “We are just talking about a uniform syllabus,” he remarked.
Chaudhry said no step that weakened the federation, provinces and the relationship between them would be taken. “The purpose is to improve governance and bolster defence and strengthen the relationship between the federation and the provinces,” he remarked.
He said allies and all stakeholders would be taken on board and matters regarding the National Finance Commission award would also be decided through consultation.
He regretted that the 26th Amendment had also been dubbed as an attack on the independence of the judiciary. He noted that a separate constitutional court would help reduce the backlog.
The minister pointed out that the establishment of the constitutional court had been agreed upon in the Charter of Democracy signed between the PML-N and PPP in 2006.
He said amendments to the Constitution required a two-thirds majority and not consensus. He said the spirit of the Constitution would be followed.
About the demand for the KP chief minister’s meeting with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he said there was a procedure under the jail manual. He said Imran’s family members and counsels kept meeting him.
PTI submits resolution in NA
A resolution was submitted by PTI members in the National Assembly to arrange a meeting between KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Imran Khan, with PTI members signing the resolution.
“This House affirms that consultation between elected representatives and their political leadership is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy,” stated the resolution.
Recognising that lmran remains the head of the largest political party in the KP Assembly, the resolution said that the CM, as the constitutional head of the provincial government, “must be able to consult his leader on matters of governance and public mandate”.
“This House considers the denial of such access a violation of democratic
norms and an affront to the constitutional spirit that upholds dialogue and accountability,” it said.
Through the resolution, the PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the orders of the Islamabad High Court pertaining to the CM’s meeting with Imran in letter and spirit.
“This House further declares that such a meeting shall constitute an official
and legitimate consultation between the Chief Executive of the Province and the Leader of the largest parliamentary party, consistent with the principles of representative democracy and federal comity,” the resolution stated.
Last Thursday, CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the fourth time since assuming office.
Afridi has termed consultation with Imran as crucial in order to announce his new provincial cabinet after he was elected as the chief minister in October.</p><small>2025-11-05 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05202155dceb79e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953320/islamabad-atc-issues-arrest-warrants-for-omar-ayub-asad-qaiser-shibli-faraz-5-other-pti-leaders' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad ATC issues arrest warrants for Omar Ayub, Asad Qaiser, Shibli Faraz, 5 other PTI leaders</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad on Wednesday issued arrest warrants for eight PTI leaders, including Asad Qaiser, Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub and Ali Nawaz Awan, in a case registered under terrorism provisions.
Today’s hearing was presided over by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, with none of the PTI leaders appearing before the court despite being repeatedly summoned.
Expressing displeasure over their continued absence, the judge ordered their arrest and directed authorities to produce them before November 11. The hearing was subsequently adjourned until the next date.
The case was registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) against the PTI leaders under relevant sections of the anti-terrorism act with charges of involvement in activities falling within the ambit of terrorism-related offences.
Non-bailable arrest warrants for Gandapur
In a separate development, Additional District and Sessions Judge Nasruminallah Baloch issued non-bailable arrest warrants for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the audio leak case.
The judge expressed anger over Gandapur’s failure to appear for indictment proceedings, noting that neither he nor his legal representative attended the hearing.
The court had fixed the proceedings for indictment; however, the process could not be completed due to Gandapur’s absence. The judge postponed the hearing and adjourned the case until December 5, directing the police to arrest Gandapur and produce him before the court.
The case against Gandapur was registered at the Golra Police Station after an audio leak surfaced in which he was purportedly heard asking about the number of weapons, licences and people for a PTI protest.
The recording reportedly prompted a police investigation into the nature and intent of the conversation.</p><small>2025-11-05 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0515360210fe9d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953300/president-zardari-offers-expansion-of-defence-collaboration-to-qatari-emir' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari offers expansion of defence collaboration to Qatari emir</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in Doha on Wednesday and offered to expand bilateral cooperation in the areas of defence and defence production between Pakistan and Qatar, a statement issued by the Presidency said.
According to the statement, the Qatari emir “responded positively” to the offer and said he would instruct the relevant authorities to initiate discussions with Pakistan in this regard immediately.
The bilateral meeting was held on sidelines of the  Second World Summit for Social Development, which is being held in Qatari capital Doha from November 4 to 6. President Zardari is representing Pakistan at the moot.
The Presidency’s statement said that the Qatari leader also “expressed satisfaction at the recent Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence agreement”.
 






“It was a welcome and timely step that should have happened earlier,” the statement quoted al-Thani as saying. He also noted Pakistan’s “unique position as a country maintaining strategic ties with China, the West and the Gulf states at the same time”.
In September, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hinted that it was rooted in current world affairs and reflected the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.
On the matter of recent clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Qatari emir expressed “hope that Pakistan and Afghanistan would resolve their current issues and move beyond recent challenges”.
Qatar is one of the two mediators in talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, which were held in Doha and Istanbul following border clashes between the two sides last month. Another round of talks between them is set to begin tomorrow (Nov 6) in the Turkish capital.
According to the Presidency’s statement, al-Thani told Zardari that “Qatar is proud of Pakistan and its achievements, and deeply values the contribution of the Pakistani community to Qatar’s development”.
He expressed the desire to see their number “increase significantly” in the coming years, the statement said.
For his part, President Zardari conveyed “warm greetings and best wishes” from the government and people of Pakistan to the Qatari emir, expressing “deep admiration for Qatar’s remarkable progress and visionary leadership”.
Moreover, the statement said that President Zardari also “proposed enhancing cooperation in agriculture and food security” during the meeting. He also welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two nations.
He lauded Qatar’s growing global role as a “centre of dialogue and humanitarian diplomacy and paid tribute to its leadership in advocating a ceasefire and humanitarian relief for the people of Gaza”.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the Gulf nation, he highlighted Islamabad’s “strong condemnation” of Israel’s aggression against Qatar and its continued diplomatic support for Qatar’s sovereignty at international forums.
The president welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two countries under the Qatari emir’s leadership, the statement said.
The president “also commended the contributions of the Qatar Fund for Development, the Education Above All Foundation, and other Qatari humanitarian initiatives, paying special tribute to  Sheikha Moza bint Nasser and Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad Al Thani for advancing education and cultural exchange,” the statement read.
It added that President Zardari further appreciated Qatar’s role in hosting and facilitating the UN-led Doha Process meetings on Afghanistan, including the first and second rounds held in May 2023 and February 2024, which have supported international coordination on humanitarian, development and security issues.
He invited the Qatari emir to Pakistan to further strengthen “partnership with Qatar for regional peace, progress, and shared prosperity”, the statement said, adding that the Qatari leader said he would visit Pakistan early next year.
Both leaders also discussed ways to further strengthen cooperation in political, economic and cultural spheres, the statement said, adding that they “reaffirmed the historic and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar, rooted in faith, mutual trust and shared aspirations for peace, prosperity and the advancement of the Muslim Ummah”.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was also present during the meeting, the statement said.
Meeting with Qatari defence minister
The president later met Qatari Defence Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani and underscored the close and historic ties between their two countries, particularly in the field of defence and security cooperation.
“He expressed satisfaction over the existing collaboration between the armed forces of the two countries in training, capacity building and defence production.
“President Zardari emphasised the importance of expanding cooperation in joint exercises, defence technology and exchange of expertise, noting that such initiatives would further enhance regional peace and stability,” said a statement from the PPP.
 






The Qatari defence minister commended the professionalism of the Pakistan Armed Forces and reaffirmed his country’s commitment to deepening defence relations with Pakistan.
He reiterated Qatar’s interest in joint defence production and collaborative defence projects, expressing readiness to expand such initiatives in the future. He also assured Qatar’s support for facilitating peace and stability in the Afghan conflict.
The president appreciated Qatar’s continued support and said that Pakistan remained committed to further strengthening its strategic partnership with Qatar in diverse fields, including defence and security.
Meeting with Chinese vice president
Earlier, the president also met Chinese Vice President Han Zheng in the Qatari capital who appreciated Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability, a separate statement issued by the Presidency said.
According to the statement by the Presidency, during his meeting with the Chinese vice president, Zardari recalled his recent visit to China, saying that Pakistan and China were “iron brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners”.
“He thanked China for its consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan through all challenges, reaffirming that friendship with China remains the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” the statement said.
 






The president also commended “China’s continued partnership in the successful implementation of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has now entered its second phase of high-quality development,” it added.
For his part, the statement said, Han Zheng  appreciated “Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability” and reaffirmed the “enduring strength of the Pakistan-China friendship”.
The vice president also conveyed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s warm greetings.
He stressed that China would “continue to support Pakistan’s economic development under the second phase of CPEC, particularly in transport and infrastructure, information technology, agriculture, and vocational training”.
According to the statement, the two leaders “reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership based on mutual trust, respect, and a shared vision for regional peace and prosperity”.
“They also agreed to continue close cooperation on issues of mutual interest at regional and international fora,” the statement added.
President Zardari was accompanied by MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Pakistan’s ambassador to Qatar during the meeting.</p><small>2025-11-05 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051955132199565.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953318/gaza-hospital-says-received-15-palestinian-bodies-under-ceasefire-exchange-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Gaza hospital says received 15 Palestinian bodies under ceasefire exchange deal</strong></a><br><p>Gaza’s Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Yunis on Wednesday said it had received the bodies of 15 Palestinian prisoners under the US-brokered ceasefire exchange deal.
“The tenth batch of the bodies of Palestinian martyrs has arrived at Nasser Medical Complex in the Gaza Strip, numbering 15 martyrs,” the hospital said in a statement, noting that 285 bodies were received under the agreement in total.
They were returned in exchange for the latest hostage body handed back from Gaza on Tuesday, that of Israeli-American soldier Itay Chen.
Under the terms of the US-brokered agreement in effect since October 10, Israel returns 15 bodies of Palestinians for every body it receives of an Israeli hostage who had been held in Gaza.
At the start of the truce, Hamas held 48 hostages in Gaza — 20 alive and 28 deceased.
The militants have since released all the surviving captives, as well as 21 of the deceased’s remains.
Israel has accused Hamas of dragging its feet in returning the bodies of deceased hostages, while the Palestinian group says the process is slow because many are buried beneath Gaza’s rubble.
The group has repeatedly called on mediators and the Red Cross to provide it with the necessary equipment and personnel to recover the bodies.</p><small>2025-11-05 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632252-pti-vows-to-oppose-27th-amendment-calls-it-robbery-on-provincial-autonomy' target='_blank'><strong>PTI vows to oppose 27th Amendment, calls it 'robbery of provincial autonomy'</strong></a><br><p>

The incident occurred on Tuesday as Sheinbaum walked to an event near the presidential palace, shaking hands and taking pictures with people along the way, videos on social media showed.
The man approached Sheinbaum, put his arm around her shoulder and with the other hand, touched her hip and chest while attempting to kiss her neck. A member of the presidential security detail pulled away the man, who appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
Despite his behaviour, Sheinbaum treated the man politely, agreeing to take a picture with him, then patting him on the back.
Security authorities later reported that the man had been arrested.
The head of Mexico’s Ministry of Women — a department created by Sheinbaum – commented on the incident.
“We condemn the act that our president experienced today,” Minister Citlali Hernandez said in a post on X that also slammed what she called macho attitudes that normalise unwelcome intrusions on women’s personal space and bodies.
 






The events highlight a latent problem in Mexico.

The arguments are set to begin at 10am EST (1500 GMT) after lower courts ruled that Trump’s unprecedented use of a 1977 federal law meant for national emergencies to impose the tariffs exceeded his authority. The challenge involves three lawsuits brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-led.
Trump has heaped pressure on the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, to preserve tariffs that he has leveraged as a key economic and foreign policy tool. The tariffs could add up to trillions of dollars for the US over the next decade.
If the justices strike them down, “we would be defenceless, leading perhaps even to the ruination of our nation”, Trump wrote in a social media post on Sunday.
Highlighting the importance of the case to the administration, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent plans to attend Wednesday’s arguments in person. Trump earlier had spoken of attending but decided against it.
If the Supreme Court rules against Trump, these tariffs are expected to remain as the administration switches to other legal authorities, Bessent told Reuters.
While the Supreme Court typically takes months to issue rulings after hearing arguments, the Trump administration has asked it to act swiftly in this case.
Pushing the boundaries
 
 

The justices will consider Trump’s actions invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner. The law allows a president to regulate commerce in a national emergency but does not specifically mention the word tariffs.
Trump is the first president to use IEEPA in this manner, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials and domestic military deployments.
The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to impose taxes and tariffs. Trump’s Justice Department has argued that IEEPA allows tariffs by authorising the president to “regulate” imports to address emergencies.
The IEEPA-based tariffs have generated $89 billion in estimated collections between February 4 and September 23, when the most recent data was released by the US Customs and Border Protection agency. Trump has imposed some additional tariffs, invoking other laws. Those are not at issue in this case.
The Supreme Court has backed Trump in a series of decisions issued this year on an emergency basis. These have let Trump policies that were impeded by lower courts amid questions about their legality proceed on an interim basis, prompting critics to warn that the justices are refusing to act as a check on the president’s power.
The tariffs case marks the first time the court has heard arguments on the legal merits of one of Trump’s policies this year. It heard arguments in May in a case concerning Trump’s effort to restrict birthright citizenship, but focused not on the legality of his policy but on the authority of federal judges to block actions nationwide.
Global trade war
 
 

Trump instigated a global trade war when he returned to the presidency in January, alienating trading partners, increasing volatility in financial markets and fueling global economic uncertainty.
He invoked IEEPA in slapping tariffs on goods imported from individual countries to address what he called a national emergency related to US trade deficits, as well as in February, as economic leverage on China, Canada and Mexico to curb the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the US.
Trump has wielded tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a cudgel to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters. These have ranged from Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, India’s purchases of Russian oil that help fund Russia’s war in Ukraine, and an anti-tariff ad by Canada’s Ontario province.
‘An unusual and extraordinary threat’
IEEPA gives the president power to deal with “an unusual and extraordinary threat” amid a national emergency. It had historically been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs. In passing IEEPA, Congress placed additional limits on the president’s authority compared to a predecessor law.
The Supreme Court is reviewing two rulings against Trump. The Washington-based US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with challengers, including five small businesses that import goods and the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont. A Washington-based federal judge sided with a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources.
“It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs,” the Federal Circuit said.
The Federal Circuit also said that the administration’s expansive view of this law violates the Supreme Court’s “major questions” doctrine, which requires executive branch actions of vast economic and political significance to be clearly authorised by Congress. The Supreme Court applied this doctrine to strike down key policies of Trump’s Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.</p><small>2025-11-05 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0517334252caeb4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953309/mqm-p-demands-inclusion-of-local-govts-autonomy-in-27th-amendment-as-promised-earlier' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P demands inclusion of local govts’ autonomy in 27th Amendment as promised earlier</strong></a><br><p>The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Wednesday demanded that local governments (LGs) be given autonomy in the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment.
After the PPP revealed key features of the proposed amendment for which the government sought its support, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said yesterday that the legislation for the tweaks will soon be tabled in Parliament.
MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar presented his party’s demand today while addressing a press conference in Islamabad, alongside party leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
Sattar asserted that after provincial autonomy had been granted under the 18th Amendment of 2010, the “next step naturally is local autonomy, so it’s turn must come”.
 


“The important thing that we also said at the time of the 26th Amendment, that our constitutional amendment package be included,” he said, referring to its agreement with the PML-N to empower local governments.
“But it did not happen,” Sattar lamented, calling for the matter to be included in the 27th Amendment.
The PML-N and the MQM-P had signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2024 under which LGs would draw powers directly draw powers from the federation instead of provinces.
When talks of the 26th Amendment gained momentum, the MQM-P also tied its support for the legislation to the inclusion of LG-related provisions. However, the final version — passed with MQM-P lawmakers voting in its favour — featured no such provisions.
 
 

Sattar contended that the Constitution’s Article 140A, which provides that the provinces will establish LGs, needed to be amended so that laws enacted by local bodies would not contradict it.
“The Constitution is a sacred document, but not a divine scripture; it is a living document,” the MNA contended. He added that it should not bring worry or surprise if amendments were needed in it “as per the requirements of the time and situation, and for the country’s stability”.
Sattar also voiced support for constitutional courts, which were initially planned to be formed through the 26th Amendment but only constitutional benches were established in the end.
Meanwhile, about the proposed Constitutional tweaks, Siddiqui said: “We are only telling the key features, and have presented what the government told us and what we understood.
“Even from us, especially Article 243 … this year has created the need for it to be harmonised with national unity, strong defence, and modern requirements of defence,” he said, referring to the provision related to the command of armed forces.
 
 

Siddiqui called for local governments to also be “considered a government”, with the Constitution guaranteeing nazims and mayors’ elections and tenures, without the prime minister needing to issue orders for it.
“The Constitution should decide that. The Supreme Court should monitor it,” the education minister said, proposing a caretaker set-up for the two roles.</p><small>2025-11-05 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/05174036e54b11e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953314/fbr-extends-deadline-for-filing-returns-manually-until-nov-30' target='_blank'><strong>FBR extends deadline for filing returns manually until Nov 30</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Wednesday issued a notification announcing that the deadline for taxpayers filing returns using manual forms rather than its web portal has been extended until November 30.
According to the notification, the tax body stated that it is discontinuing the use of manual forms to file returns in favour of digitising all of its data. However, it recognised that until last year, a “small fraction of people” were still filing tax returns manually.
“As a special dispensation, it has been decided that a cell in each tax office of Pakistan dealing with such taxpayers (manual filers) will provide all legal and technical support to such taxpayers,” the notification read.
“Such taxpayer’s return filing date is hereby extended till [November 30], in exercise of the powers conferred under Section 214A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, for smooth completion of the process.”
The notification requested that taxpayers filing manually contact their respective tax offices, where they would receive assistance in registration and return filing free of cost.
“Even if they require legal assistance, the FBR field office will provide them [the] service of a lawyer free of any cost this year,” the notification read.
On October 31, the FBR announced that it received a record 5.9 million tax returns for the tax year 2025 compared to 5m returns filed in the same period last year — an increase of 17.6 per cent.
Out of the filed returns, 3.6m taxpayers filed returns with tax payments, reflecting an 18.6pc rise in taxpayers who contributed revenue along with their returns, compared to the same period in 2024.</p><small>2025-11-05 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632236-karachi-leads-new-york-follows-sindh-cm-on-mamdanis-historic-win-as-nyc-mayor' target='_blank'><strong>'Karachi leads, New York follows': Sindh CM on Mamdani's historic win as NYC mayor</strong></a><br><p>

The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had indicted the two in the case last week. Both had denied the charges. The court had summoned all prosecution witnesses for today’s hearing.
The judge presided over the hearing today in which Chattha expressed a lack of confidence in the court, to which ADSJ Majoka said the case could have been transferred if the lack of confidence had been expressed before the couple’s indictment.
He added that only the high court could transfer the case now.
“The judge seems to be under pressure,” Chattha said, to which ADSJ Majoka expressed his disagreement.
Mazari said that the two should be indicted first, adding that the charges had not even been read out to them, to which the judge said he had already done so and they should ask their lawyer.
The judge said he would go ahead with the hearing, since the law permitted him to do so, to which Mazari said the couple would boycott the proceedings if Majoka continued hearing the case.
“If you want to boycott the court proceedings, then of course you can,” the judge said, to which Chattha replied that the couple’s lawyers were in the high court and thus some time should be provided.
Reconvening after the break, Mazari informed the judge that her lawyer had withdrawn the power of attorney, to which ADSJ Majoka said the counsel should come to court and confirm it.
“If you are changing the lawyer, you should submit the request yourself on your behalf,” he said, to which Mazari pointed out that she was not changing her lawyer, but he had withdrawn himself.
To this, the judge reiterated that the lawyer should come to court and confirm it himself.
Meanwhile, Chattha replied: “My lawyer is on his way and will appear in court. The prosecution is in a hurry in this case. What is the hurry to record the evidence without the presence of the lawyer?”
The judge said he would wait and told the two to call their lawyers.
He subsequently issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the couple and adjourned the case till tomorrow.

According to Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar, Rano was transported to the capital on a Pakistan Air Force C-130 aircraft, which took off at 8:30am and landed at the Nur Khan Airbase a little after 11:30am.
From the Karachi Zoo, the bear was first taken to Faisal Base in a wooden brown crate on a cargo pickup truck, which Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) officials said she entered willingly and without having to be sedated.
“At just three calls, she walked from the sleeping area in her enclosure and into the crate,” said Sana Raja of the IWMB in a video. She added that Rano did not show any signs of distress and was also eating well.

Meanwhile, Mahar said that the team continuously monitored the bear on the flight, while Rano, despite the roar of the C-130 engine, caught up on lost sleep. “The technical staff at the Nur Khan Airbase helped with offloading Rano,” he added.
She was then taken to the IWMB bear rehabilitation facility, where she was given food and moved into a quarantine area. “Her stay here could last up to a month for examination and other protocols, after which she will be taken to a larger area,” said Anees, an official of the wildlife board, in a video shared by Mahar.
In the clip, a curious Rano could be seen sniffing her new, green home. Her otherwise heaving and panting body looked calm and at peace. She will be kept at the rehabilitation centre run by the IWMB before finally returning to her natural habitat in Gilgit Baltistan.
 






For years, Rano had languished at the Karachi Zoo, first inside a Victorian-era pit and then in a barren cage, a cell where she paced restlessly day and night on worn-out, hard flooring. Her situation had prompted animal rights activists to approach the Sindh High Court (SHC) seeking her relocation to the sanctuary in Islamabad.
Earlier this month, the SHC had ordered the bear’s relocation to the bear sanctuary. The court had also formed a committee to ensure her safe relocation, which included members of the IWMB, who had previously visited Karachi to train Rano.
Ray of hope
Mahera Omar, co-founder of the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society, said that zoos were unable to meet the complex psychological and behavioural needs of wild animals, nor could they replicate the ecosystems that are their rightful home.
“Zoos must be phased out and the animals rehabilitated in appropriate species-specific sanctuaries,” Omar said.
“Animals are not meant for our entertainment,” said Omar. “They deserve to live freely in their own habitats across protected national parks.”
She added that Rano’s rescue offers a ray of hope for the many other innocent animals silently suffering in captivity across Pakistan.
Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir, who fought Rano’s case in the SHC, called her relocation a win for all animal rights activists and journalists who covered the bear’s suffering and raised their voices over the years. He also thanked the court for bringing Rano’s suffering to an end.
“Rano’s case is not an isolated one. Many animals have perished and continue to suffer at Karachi Zoo due to its inadequate facilities, apathetic and ill-trained staff,” he stressed. “Karachi Zoo was originally a botanical garden, and that is the purpose it should serve as opposed to being a living hell for animals.”
“For the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, the zoo is only a cash cow, and they justify its existence as a cheap source of entertainment for Karachiites. We need to educate our children about animals, not reduce them and their misery and suffering as a source of entertainment,” he added.
Years of neglect
In March 2017, the bear was transferred from a breeding farm and research centre to the Karachi Zoological Gardens under an animal exchange programme. Not having owned bears for 16 years, Rano was confined inside a Victorian-era pit that last housed Emma, a Balochistan black bear said to have gone mad in captivity.
Housed with Rano was an Asiatic black bear that died in 2020, leaving Rano in solitary confinement. That year, Rano’s suffering came to the fore after a video of her panting and leaning against the wall of the cement pit went viral on social media.
Subsequently, a petition was filed in the Sindh High Court seeking Rano’s transfer to a sanctuary. In response, however, the zoo officials shifted her to another cage, not any better than the previous one. Over the years, her condition worsened, reaching the point of psychosis.
Earlier this year, activists rallied for Rano’s freedom once again after the bear underwent treatment for a head injury — an old wound that seemed to have been infested by maggots due to lack of care.
Animal rights activist Jude Allen Pereira petitioned the SHC, through his counsel Nasir, stating that the bear was deprived of species-specific environmental enrichment, suitable climatic conditions and necessary medical care.
When a two-judge bench comprising Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Justice Syed Fiaz-ul-Hassan Shah took up the matter on Oct 14, the court ordered the brown bear be shifted from the Karachi zoo to the IWMB bear sanctuary within 48 hours.</p><small>2025-11-05 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632230-does-govt-have-magic-number-to-pass-27th-constitutional-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Does govt have magic number to pass 27th Constitutional Amendment?</strong></a><br><p>

According to CBS, Mamdani received 1,035,645 votes (50.4 per cent) against 854,783 (41.6pc) for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 146,127 (7.1pc) for Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa.
Mamdani will become the first Muslim mayor of the largest US city. He defeated Democratic former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, who ran as an independent after losing the nomination to Mamdani in the primary election. The campaign served as an ideological and generational contest that could have national implications for the Democratic Party.
Democrats won two key state governor races, sending an early warning signal to Republican President Donald Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms.
The clean sweep among several ballots nationwide has boosted morale among Democrats bruised by Trump’s return to the White House and has set alarm bells ringing among Republican circles.
Mamdani, the youngest to serve in more than a century, was born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin and has lived in the United States since he was seven, becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2018.
The Democratic socialist’s victory came in the face of fierce attacks on his policies and his Muslim heritage from business elites, conservative media commentators and Trump himself, who had made an eleventh-hour intervention in the race, calling Mamdani a “Jew hater“.
“Hope is alive,” Mamdani declared in his victory speech. “We won because New Yorkers allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible. We won because we insisted that no longer would politics be something that is done to us. Now, it is something we do,” he said.

Mamdani said New York would no longer be a city where one can “traffic in Islamophobia and win an election”, adding that the city will be a light “in this moment of political darkness”.
He pledged a city hall “that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of anti-Semitism, where the more than one million Muslims know that they belong”.
He quoted Jawaharlal Nehru, saying, “A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.”

The Democrat also gave a message to the US president, who is also a New Yorker, saying, “Donald Trump, since I know you are watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!”
Mamdani said he would put an end to the “culture of corruption” that has allowed billionaires like Trump to “evade taxation and exploit tax breaks”.
“We will stand alongside unions and expand labour protections because we know, just as Donald Trump does, that when working people have iron-clad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed,” he said.

Promising to fight for all New Yorkers, Mamdani said his administration would represent “immigrants, members of the trans community, Black women fired by Trump from federal jobs, single mothers struggling with rising costs — anyone with their back against the wall”.
He concluded his speech by thanking New Yorkers, saying, “This power is yours. This city belongs to you.”
His emphatic speech concluded with Bollywood song ‘Dhoom Machale’ blaring over the speakers.

Turnout was high in this year’s vote with 2.06 million ballots, or 98pc of votes cast, counted by 12:31am on Wednesday — more than the total number of voters in the 2021 race.
“The next and last stop is City Hall,” Mamdani said in a video posted to X after his victory was declared.
 






Congratulations for Mamdani
Ex-president Bill Clinton congratulated Mamdani. “I’m wishing you success as you work to transform the passion of your campaign into building a better, fairer, more affordable New York,” he said.
 






The former US First Lady and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that “more people voted in New York City’s election this year than they have in 50 years”.
 






US Senator Bernie Sanders said Mamdani had “pulled off one of the great political upsets in modern American history”.
“Yes. We CAN create a government that represents working people and not the 1pc,” he said.
 






Former US president Barack Obama congratulated all the Democrat candidates who won on Tuesday, calling it a reminder that “when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win”.
“We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” he said.
 






In New York, one group exclaimed “Mamdaniiiiii“, substituting the 34-year-old’s name for the customary “cheese” as they posed for a photo at a Brooklyn bar watch party.
Voters gathered there in cautious optimism, sporting Mamdani merch as they anxiously awaited the evening’s results, classic songs such as Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” and edgier tracks from Lou Reed blasting from the speakers.
It was a “local victory” that offered a means of “resisting and pushing back” against the political establishment in Washington, 40-year-old Ben Parisi told AFP, adding that the night stood in stark contrast to Trump’s victory a year ago.
“A lot of us worked hard in one way or another to make this happen,” Parisi said, “and here we are… we get to celebrate“.
Ghazala Hashmi becomes first Muslim woman to win statewide office in US
Meanwhile, Ghazala Hashmi defeated Republican writer and conservative talk show host John Reid in the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race on Tuesday, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States
Hashmi maintained a steady lead over Reid throughout the campaign, though polling tightened in the final days before election day. She secured 747,773 votes (53.8 per cent) against 659,421 (46.4pc) for her Republican rival.
Earlier in June, Hashmi narrowly clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and state Senator Aaron Rouse in a closely contested primary.
 
 

A member of the party’s progressive wing, Hashmi enjoyed strong support from prominent figures such as Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who backed her during the primary campaign.
Born in Hyderabad, India, Hashmi moved to the United States in her youth and later earned a PhD in English from Emory University. She began her career in academia, teaching English for over two decades at community colleges in Virginia before entering politics.
Her election to the state Senate in 2019 marked her as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Virginia legislature, a milestone she has now extended to statewide office.
Democrats win Virginia, New Jersey governor races
In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger easily won the election for governor, becoming the first woman elected to serve in that role, while Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States. And in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race.
 






Spanberger defeated Republican Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race, flipping control of the state and making her the first woman ever to serve as the state governor.
A former congresswoman and CIA officer, Spanberger maintained a consistent lead over Earle-Sears through most of the campaign, buoyed by strong fundraising and strong support in the state’s suburban counties. Her victory gives Democrats a significant boost as they seek to regain political footing following their 2024 national election losses.
Spanberger, 47, centred her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well as public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her loyalty to Trump. Earle-Sears, 61, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message.
 






“We sent a message to the world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger said in her victory speech. “We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.”
“You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,” she said.
Separately, Democrat Sherrill won New Jersey’s election for governor. Sherrill, a US representative and former Navy pilot, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli and will succeed Democratic Governor Phil Murphy.
 






It is the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms.
Uphill battle
The races offered the beleaguered Democratic Party a test of differing campaign playbooks a year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.
Since Trump’s win last year, Democrats have found themselves locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find the best path out of the political wilderness.
Reacting to Republican losses, Trump cited unspecified pollsters who attributed the loss to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump not leading the ballot.
“‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Prominent business people, including Bill Ackman, had noisily attacked Mamdani and funnelled cash to his rivals, while conservative media, including The New York Post, published blanket negative coverage.
 
 

Mamdani’s improbable rise highlights the Democratic Party’s debate over a centrist or a leftist future, with some leading national figures offering only tepid endorsements of Mamdani ahead of voting.
Syracuse University political science professor Grant Reeher said ahead of the result that Mamdani would face an uphill battle.
“Everybody’s got their knives out, and it’s a very difficult city to govern,” he told AFP.</p><small>2025-11-05 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/051438098262c79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953301/finance-minister-terms-population-climate-change-as-existential-issues-pakistan-faces' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister terms population, climate change as ‘existential issues’ Pakistan faces</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday termed population and climate change as “existential issues” that Pakistan must address to realise its potential.
Pakistan is home to a vast population of over 251 million, according to the World Bank. The Bank states the annual population growth rate for 2024 at 1.5 per cent, with the government’s 2023 census showing that the population grew by 2.55pc from 207.7m in 2017 to 241.5m in 2023.
“I am very clear: we cannot realise the potential of this country unless we address two existential issues — population and climate change,” Aurangzeb said while addressing a gathering of the business community in Karachi.
“Only saying that we do not make emissions but have to adapt, so demonstrate it,” he said, referring to Pakistan’s oft-repeated argument that the country contributes less than 1pc to global carbon emissions but faces catastrophic climate change-induced events.
“We have funding. First utilise the funding we have,” the finance minister stressed as he responded to a reporter’s query.
He went on to note that population was “not only about the high-level” but also child stunting and learning poverty, which “is girls out of school”.
 


“These are all areas on which the federation and the provinces have to work together,” Aurangzeb said.
He said economic issues were “immediate” and would be solved in a few years, but climate change and population were “existential issues and are now urgent enough to address now. Now.”
Last month, lawmakers from across Pakistan called for declaring the rapid population growth a national emergency and integrating population welfare into all development and policy frameworks.
The Council of Islamic Ideology has endorsed birth spacing and recommended involving religious leaders more actively in disseminating messages on its permissibility.
Need for wheat, sugar to be deregulated
Replying to another question, Aurangzeb asserted that the government was “very clear” on the matter of deregulation of wheat and sugar.
“My view and that of the prime minister and the cabinet is very clear that the government should opt out of whatever matters it can,” he said. The minister noted that wheat had an element of “strategic reserve” as it was a staple food; otherwise, it should also be deregulated.
 
 

“Both these policies are coming,” he said. The government last month introduced the ‘Wheat Policy 2025–26: Transitioning to a Market-Based System’ that set a minimum support price to support flood-hit farmers.
“There was a situation due to the floods this time; otherwise, they (policymakers) did the right thing,” he said.
“Deregulation has to be end-to-end. It cannot happen that we deregulate a certain element in the value chain but maintain control over another. The government has to get out of the entire value chain, so that’s where we are headed,” Aurangzeb said.
During his media talk, the minister also noted, “We have definitely faced losses in rice [exports] this year because its fields in Punjab were damaged. But they are also hovering between $3-4 billion of agricultural exports.”</p><small>2025-11-05 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632212-in-meeting-with-qatari-emir-president-zardari-pushes-to-expand-defence-collaboration' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Qatari emir, President Zardari pushes to expand defence collaboration</strong></a><br><p>

A sale would mark a significant policy shift, potentially altering the military balance in the Middle East and testing Washington’s definition of maintaining Israel’s “qualitative military edge.”
Saudi Arabia made a direct appeal earlier this year to US President Donald Trump and has long been interested in Lockheed Martin’s fighter, one of the people and a US official said. The Pentagon is now weighing a potential sale of 48 of the advanced aircraft, the US official and the person familiar with the talks told Reuters.
The size of the request and its status have not been previously reported.
The US official and a second US official, who acknowledged the weapons deal was moving through the system, said no final decision has been made and several more steps are needed before the ultimate nod, including further approvals at the Cabinet level, sign-off from Trump and notification of Congress.
The Pentagon’s policy department worked on the potential transaction for months, and the case has now progressed to the secretary level within the Defense Department, according to one of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Pentagon, White House and State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said military sales are government-to-government transactions and the matter is best addressed by Washington.
Washington weighs weapons sales to the Middle East in a way that ensures Israel maintains a “qualitative military edge”. This guarantees that Israel gets more advanced US weapons than regional Arab states.
The F-35, built with stealth technology that allows it to evade enemy detection, is considered the world’s most advanced fighter jet. Israel has operated the aircraft for nearly a decade, building multiple squadrons, and remains the only Middle Eastern country to possess the weapons system.
Saudi Arabia, the largest customer for US arms, has sought the fighter for years as it looks to modernise its air force and counter regional threats, particularly from Iran. The kingdom’s renewed push for what would constitute two squadrons comes as the Trump administration has signalled openness to deepening defence cooperation with Riyadh.
The Saudi Air Force flies a mix of fighter aircraft, including Boeing F-15s, European Tornados and Typhoons.
The F-35 issue has also been intertwined with broader diplomatic efforts. The Biden administration previously explored providing F-35s to Saudi Arabia as part of a comprehensive deal that would have included Riyadh normalising relations with Israel, though those efforts ultimately stalled.
Trump has made arms sales to Saudi Arabia a priority since returning to office.
In May, the United States agreed to sell the kingdom an arms package worth nearly $142 billion, which the White House called “the largest defence cooperation agreement” Washington has ever done.
Congressional scrutiny could also pose challenges to any F-35 sale. Lawmakers previously questioned arms deals with Riyadh following the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and some members of Congress remain wary of deepening military cooperation with the kingdom.
The potential sale also comes as Saudi Arabia pursues ambitious economic and military modernisation plans under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 agenda. The kingdom has sought to diversify its defence partnerships in recent years while maintaining its decades-long security relationship with Washington.</p><small>2025-11-05 07:38</small></div><hr>
