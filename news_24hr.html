The PTI alleged that she was arrested in Islamabad last night.
 






Her lawyer, Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, confirmed to Dawn.com today that she was arrested in the fake videos case.
“My team and I will appear in Lahore District Court tomorrow in Falak Javed’s case. We will provide full legal assistance in Falak Javed’s case. If NCCIA applies for Falak Javed’s physical remand, we will oppose it. The case is being reviewed from all angles,” he said.
 
 

The Punjab minister had sought action last year in July against the persons involved in sharing her edited images on social media. She alleged that Falak edited and spread her images on social media. She said a request was made to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) under the Peca (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) to take action against Falak and others, but the agency did not take any action.
The minister argued that she had been defamed on social media and that her constitutional rights had been violated. Her petition asked the court to order the FIA to take action against the respondents and submit a compliance report.</p><small>2025-09-24 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24182625101ffbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944350/cii-clarifies-no-final-decision-yet-on-withholding-tax-issue' target='_blank'><strong>CII clarifies no final decision yet on withholding tax issue</strong></a><br><p>The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) on Wednesday clarified that no final decision had been taken yet on the issue of withholding tax on money transfers and withdrawals after the body earlier declared it to be “un-Islamic”.
The CII made the earlier decision and others at its 243rd meeting today, presided over by CII Chairman Allama Dr Muhammad Raghib Hussain Naeemi, the press release read. “The council declared the withholding tax imposed on withdrawal or transfer of money as excessive and declared it un-Islamic,” the press release said.
As per the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), withholding tax is an advance payment of tax deducted at the time of economic activities specified under certain sections of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 and Sales Tax Act, 1990.
However, a clarification issued later read: “Regarding today’s meeting of the CII, there was an impression that the council had formed a final opinion on the withholding tax, whereas in fact, a few members had an initial discussion on it, in which the members had different opinions. The members said that they would consult experts on this in the next meeting.
“Therefore, it was decided that in the upcoming meeting of the council, it should be discussed in detail and the opinions of the relevant experts should be sought. The council did not take any decision on the issue under discussion.”
As per the earlier press release, decisions were also taken on matters including components in insulin made from pork, the amendment of the diyat law (blood money) and keeping copies of the Holy Quran clean after they have been used for testimony.
“The council did not agree with the proposed amendment bill [to] the diyat law. The council is of the opinion that the Islamic amounts of diyat, namely gold, silver and camels, should remain included in the law, while the bill has deleted silver and made the un-Islamic amount of gold a standard,” the press release read.
Separately, the [CII] expressed reservations over the decision of a two-member bench of the Supreme Court on September 11, 2025, saying that “making iddah and maintenance mandatory for a non-consummated woman in the event of divorce is against the Quran and Sunnah”, the press release read.
In a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court ruled that a woman’s right to maintenance (Nafaqa) was neither contingent upon consummation or ‘Rukhsati’ (bridal departure) nor was it subject to her husband’s discretion.
Additionally, the CII declared that human milk storage institutions can be established under specific conditions, but noted that there needs to be mandatory legislation first, with the council included in the process, to “prevent corruption”.
At the request of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the council also recommended that a ringtone should be developed that instructs citizens to respect flags and banners with holy words on them during the month of Rabbiul Awwal.</p><small>2025-09-24 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625341-pakistan-urges-afghan-govt-to-act-decisively-against-terrorist-groups' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges Afghan govt to act decisively against terrorist groups</strong></a><br><p>

Police responded to reports of the shooting at the office in northwest Dallas at about 6:40am local time (4:40pm PKT), the Dallas police department said on X.
The suspect opened fire on the office from an adjacent building, according to the preliminary investigation, police said.
Two people were transported to a hospital with gunshot wounds, while a third person died at the scene.
 






ICE officers were not injured, but it was not clear whether the victims included ICE detainees, local security or local law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an interview on Fox News’ ‘Fox & Friends’.
Investigators are looking at the possibility that the shot came from the rooftop of a nearby apartment building, McLaughlin added.
“Those details are still murky. It looked like it might have been a sniper or some sort of a long-form shot,“ McLaughlin said.
She also said the shooting took place at an ICE field office, not a detention facility, where ICE officers conduct short-term processing of recently-arrested detainees.
The incident comes two weeks after the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk by a sniper during an event in Orem, Utah, which fueled fears of a new wave of political violence in the United States.
US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other administration officials have blamed, without proof, liberal organisations for fomenting unrest and encouraging violence against the right.
On Monday, Trump signed an executive order declaring the anti-fascist movement Antifa as a domestic terrorist organisation despite the fact that there has been no evidence made public linking Antifa to Kirk’s death.
The Trump administration’s aggressive use of ICE agents as part of its crackdown on undocumented immigrants has sparked outcries from Democrats and liberal activists.
ICE detention facilities have increasingly become sites of conflict, with heavily armed agents deploying pepper ball guns, tear gas and other chemical agents in clashes with protesters.
An ICE facility in suburban Chicago, where protesters have gathered daily since a Trump administration immigration surge began earlier this month, erected fencing on Monday after several demonstrators, including the mayor of Evanston, Illinois, were injured in a clash with agents last week.
In July, an ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas, was the target of a coordinated protest that saw multiple gunshots fired and one police officer injured.</p><small>2025-09-24 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625335-13-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-di-khan-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>13 Indian-sponsored terrorists killed in DI Khan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

On Tuesday, Pakistan won by 5 wickets after restricting Sri Lanka to 133-8 to register their first win in the Super Four stage of the men’s Asia Cup in Abu Dhabi.
Earlier, Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by four wickets in their match in Dubai on Saturday.
The top two teams from the Super Four will play the Asia Cup final in Dubai on September 28.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted the operation in the Daraban area, upon the reported presence of terrorists “belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij”.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], 13 Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
The ISPR added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area.
The statement added that these terrorists were involved in “facilitation [of] a suicide bombing attack in Daraban in December 2023, [the] abduction and target killing of government officials and innocent civilians”.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
On September 21, security personnel launched an IBO in the same district, where they killed seven terrorists, including three “Afghan nationals”. In a statement, the ISPR said that the operation was carried out in the Kulachi area upon the presence of “khawarij”.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], seven Indian sponsored khwarij, including three Afghan National khwarij and two suicide bombers, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government, run by the Afghan Taliban, to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil to carry out acts of terror.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-09-24 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24185900013b3fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944348/pakistan-womens-team-start-training-in-sri-lankas-colombo-for-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan women’s team start training in Sri Lanka’s Colombo for World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan women’s team on Wednesday started training for the Women’s Cricket World Cup, in Sri Lanka’s Colombo, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The Women in Green arrived in the Sri Lankan capital late on Tuesday as the tournament is set to start on September 30 in India’s Guwahati.
The eight-nation showpiece will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from Sept 30 to Nov 2. However, Pakistan — under an International Cricket Council (ICC) hybrid model decided by the ICC due to political strains between New Delhi and Islamabad — will play all their matches of the event in Colombo.
“The team on Wednesday participated in its first training session at the Ranasinghe Premadasa Stadium,” APP reported.
The session focused on batting, bowling, and fielding under the guidance of head coach Muhammad Wasim, APP added.
Before the World Cup begins, Pakistan will play two crucial warm-up matches.
Their first encounter will be against Sri Lanka on September 25, followed by a match against South Africa on September 28.
Despite losing the recent one-day International (ODI) home series against South Africa, Pakistan were well prepared and had no extra pressure to face arch-rivals India in the forthcoming ICC World Cup, captain Fatima Sana said on Tuesday.
The Fatima-led team won the third and final ODI against South Africa in Lahore on Monday, but the tourists took the series 2-1.
 
 

“There is no extra pressure [on us] for the match against India as all the World Cup games carry similar pressure. Therefore, we will take that match [against India] as any other game,” Fatima told reporters in Lahore before leaving for the tournament.
“We will try to take a good start [to the World Cup] against Bangladesh and then move forward with a good momentum.”
 
 

Fatima insisted that the way Pakistan tried to chase a 300-plus target in the second ODI against South Africa showed the hosts were heading in the right direction. The Green Shirts lost that close match by 25 runs.

The observation was made in a detailed verdict, issued on Tuesday, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, in a case pertaining to the contempt proceedings against Additional Registrar (Judicial) Nazar Abbas.
Three Sup­reme Court judges had initiated conte­mpt proceedings against the senior staff member in January for not fixing a case regarding the jurisdiction of regular benches. The case pertained to whether regular benches of the Supreme Court could determine the constitutionality of Article 191A of the Constitution, under which the Constitutional Bench was established after the 26th Amendment.
The detailed verdict issued today, authored by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, said that by virtue of holding a constitutional position, sub-article (5) of Article 199 of the Constitution granted immunity to SC and high court judges for acts performed within their judicial and administrative capacity.
“The constitutional scheme of immunity to the judges of the superior courts is to secure the independence of the judiciary, which is the command of Article 2A [Objectives Resolution to form part of substantive provisions] of the Constitution. It is for this reason, a judge of the same court cannot issue any kind of writ nor can take any action against another judge of the same court.”
The verdict further said: “It is well settled that a judge of the Supreme Court or of a high court is not answerable to a judge of the same court. If a judge of the superior court cannot issue a writ to another judge of the same court, how can a judge be given power to issue a direction or initiate proceedings under Article 204-2 [contempt of court] of the Constitution against a sitting judge of the same court and punish him for committing contempt of court?”
The detailed order observed that the superior judiciary were generally protected by judicial immunity for their judicial work and administrative functions with respect to the affairs of their respective courts.
However, it added that this protection was not absolute as it did not shield them from the consequences for misconduct, which was a matter of judicial administration or discipline.
It said that allegations of misconduct against superior court judges could only be dealt with under Article 209, which pertains to the powers of the SJC, by the council itself.
“Sub-article (7) of Article 209 of the Constitution bars any other forum from inquiring into matters of misconduct against a judge of the Supreme Court or of a high court. This is a substantive provision and salient feature of the Constitution,” the order noted.
The order said the “intention” of the law was “evident” that it never intended to permit a judge of a court to take any action against a judge of the same court. “Thus, no action for the contempt of court could lie against judges of the SC and of high courts by their fellow judges, respectively,” it added.
It said the superior judiciary possessed the same status and power within its hierarchy and no one was superior or inferior to issue a direction against or punish another.
The order pointed out that permitting the superior judiciary to initiate contempt proceedings against each other would “militate against the necessity of maintaining a high degree of comity amongst them”.
“The maintenance of cordial relations amongst members of the superior judiciary is important for the smooth functioning of courts. Issuing a process of contempt of court by a judge against his fellow judge would create internal conflicts, grievances and grudges amongst themselves. There would be anarchy and justice system would crumble … hence, will erode public trust. No legal system can permit the judicial system to collapse,” the order said.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had withdrawn the contempt notice against Abbas on Jan 27 and referred the matter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to deliberate whether a full court was needed to decide if contempt proceedings were needed against two committees of the apex court — the regular committee constituted under Sec­ti­on 2 of the SC Practice and Pro­cedure Act, and the constituti­o­nal committee set up under Arti­cle 191(A)(4) of the Constitution.
Section 2 of the 2023 act deals with the constitution of the benches and states that every cause, appeal or matter before the SC will be heard and disposed of by a bench constituted by the three-judge committee, consisting of the CJP, the next most senior SC judge and a SC judge nominated by the CJP from time to time.
On the same date, a six-member bench comprising Justices Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Athar Minallah, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Shahid Waheed and Musrrat Hilali had disposed of Abbas’s intra-court appeal requesting the court to quash the contempt proceedings initiated by the two-judge bench.
The directions made in the judgement of the two-judge bench had left the members of the six-judge bench to wonder how a smaller bench could hold judges of the appellate bench in contempt without even following the procedure meant for contempt of court.</p><small>2025-09-24 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2418244493df46f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944351/diamonds-and-drones-fbrs-new-monitoring-cell-scans-social-media-for-tax-evasion' target='_blank'><strong>Diamonds and drones: FBR’s new monitoring cell scans social media for tax evasion</strong></a><br><p>Diamond sets and a drone light show at a near-million-dollar wedding have become evidence for tax authorities under a new “Lifestyle Monitoring Cell” tasked with scanning social media for lavish spenders, officials said.
A team of 40 investigators from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has started scouring Instagram, TikTok and YouTube posts this week, to match influencers, celebrities, realtors and businesspeople with disproportionate filings.
“It’s open-source their Instagram accounts are a public declaration,” one senior FBR official said, adding that tax evasion cases can be opened up in a matter of hours.
The FBR did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
 
 

The monitoring cell has been formed to address the country’s chronic inability to meet revenue collection targets, and to help meet tougher goals set in this year’s International Monetary Fund-backed budget.
Pakistan has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in Asia, a chronic weakness that has forced the country into nearly two dozen IMF programmes. Less than two per cent of the population pays its income tax.
The unit was formally set up this month, according to an internal document seen by Reuters, which said its mandate was to “systematically monitor, scour and analyse data from major social media platforms” and identify people who display wealth but are either not registered for tax or declare income that appears incongruous with their expenditures and assets.
According to the document, the cell will build digital profiles of suspects, assess the money behind their lifestyles, and prepare reports that can be used for tax or money laundering investigations.
It will maintain a central database of evidence, including screenshots and timestamps, the document said.
Diamonds, drones, DJs, and databases
Officials said one wedding under review carried a price tag of nearly Rs248 million ($878,000).
Documents seen by Reuters showed nearly $283,000 spent on diamond and gold sets and $124,000 on bridal outfits by leading South Asian designers.
Guests entered through a hallway of floral arches as drones lit up the sky, before sitting down to multi-course meals prepared for 400 people.
The celebrations featured top makeup artists, DJs and traditional qawwali music bands, while international consultants helped choreograph the six-day affair that officials said epitomised the kind of extravagant spending now in their crosshairs.
The wedding is just one of several cases under review, officials said.
Investigators are also examining videos of luxury cars, high-end property tours and influencers flaunting expensive lifestyles.
“People themselves tag the event managers, the caterers, the jewellers, etc. It makes our work easy,” another official said, adding that the expenditure of the two families involved did not match their income declaration.
Despite its recent formation, the new unit has already shortlisted multiple files for deeper scrutiny, officials said.
Past efforts to net high earners fizzled, but officials say the new focus on social media offers stronger leads and quicker ways to flag undeclared wealth.</p><small>2025-09-24 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24163627604f9c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944341/shaheen-sends-asia-cup-warning-as-third-india-clash-looms-in-final' target='_blank'><strong>Shaheen sends Asia Cup warning as third India clash looms in final</strong></a><br><p>Pace spearhead Shaheen Afridi has declared that the Green Shirts will reach the Asia Cup final and can beat India if the arch-rivals clash again.
Pakistan kept their campaign alive with a five-wicket win over Sri Lanka in a Super Four clash in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.
Pakistan and India have met twice in this edition of the regional competition, but the two teams have never played against each other in an Asia Cup final.
The regional tournament, played this time in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) under the Twenty20 format, started in 1984, and this is its 17th edition.
Bangladesh, who face India on Wednesday and Pakistan on Thursday, stand in the way of the great rivals facing off in Sunday’s decider in Dubai. India are the current holders and beat Pakistan in both previous matches, but Shaheen was in a bullish mood after taking 3-28 against Sri Lanka.
 


When asked about Pakistan and India not facing off in any of the finals of the previous editions and the possibility of both rivals meeting in the final, Shaheen said, “They have still not reached the final. When they do, we will see accordingly.
“We are here to win the cup; whichever team comes in the final, we are ready to beat them.”
 
 

Asked about criticism regarding the players showing aggression on the field, the left-arm pacer said, “Honestly, our job is to play cricket and win tournaments … everyone is respectable and people think according to their own mindset.
“We came here to win the tri-series and won that. Now we are trying our best to win the tournament (Asia Cup) and make the nation happy.”
If both teams reach the final, India will once again start as favourites, having won 12 of 15 T20Is between the two countries. India has also won the last seven internationals against Pakistan since September 2022, four T20Is and three one-day internationals.
Pakistan still has a lead in the overall record against India across all three formats, with 88 wins against India’s 79 victories.
India skipper Suryakumar Yadav had claimed that India-Pakistan “is not a rivalry anymore”.
In both wins for India in the UAE, there were no handshakes, adding another layer to an already intense rivalry.
“It is his opinion that, let him say that,” said Shaheen of Suryakumar’s comments.
“When they reach the final, then [they] will see. Our job is to win the Asia Cup, and we will make a complete effort to do that.“</p><small>2025-09-24 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24170101f43a9bc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944342/uk-police-arrest-man-over-hack-that-affected-european-airports' target='_blank'><strong>UK police arrest man over hack that affected European airports</strong></a><br><p>British police said on Wednesday that a man had been arrested as part of an investigation into a ransomware attack against Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, which knocked check-in systems at airports offline and caused widespread travel disruption across Europe.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) said in a statement that the man, in his 40s, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act and had since been released on conditional bail.
“Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,” NCA Deputy Director Paul Foster said.
It remained unclear which criminal group was behind last week’s hack. An NCA spokesperson declined to provide further details.
Ransomware gangs routinely publicise attacks and leak stolen data on dark web “leak sites” but websites that monitor those portals had not, as of Wednesday, detected any group claiming the hack.
Ransomware is malicious software used by cybercriminals to encrypt a company’s data and demand payment for its release.
They typically operate in the shadows, and many try to avoid targets which might earn them unwanted attention from law enforcement agencies.
The attack on Collins Aerospace was the latest in a string of online hacks in Europe which have had significant offline consequences.
 
 

Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors, said on Tuesday it was extending the closure of its factories until October 1 following a hack this month that has left its operations paralysed and smaller suppliers struggling.
Berlin airport, one of several airports across Europe to have been impacted by the Collins Aerospace hack, said on Wednesday that it may take several more days before it had functional and secure software again, operator BER said in a statement.</p><small>2025-09-24 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/241056222336f5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944307/pm-shehbaz-urges-imf-to-consider-flood-impact-in-next-review-of-pakistans-economy' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz urges IMF to consider flood impact in next review of Pakistan’s economy</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday stated that Pakistan was steadily meeting its International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme commitments, but urged the lender to take into account the recent flood damage in its upcoming review for the country.
The prime minister made the remarks during a meeting with Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the IMF, on the sidelines of the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
According to a Topline Securities’ report, Pakistan is on track to meet all seven Quantitative Performance Criteria (QPC) set by the IMF ahead of the September 25 review of its $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF),  which was approved in May this year. The review will assess Pakistan’s performance for the March–June quarter of 2025.
However, massive floods in the country have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery.
A statement issued by the Press Information Department (PID) following today’s meeting between PM Shehbaz and Georgieva said: “While emphasising that Pakistan was making steady progress towards meeting the various targets and commitments under the IMF programme, the prime minister said that the impact of the recent floods on Pakistan’s economy must be factored into the IMF’s review.”
 






The government had been optimistic about 2026, pencilling in 4.2 per cent growth on the back of a rebound in farming and manufacturing after the economy was stabilised under the IMF bailout. Instead, record monsoon rains since late June, amplified by dam releases from India, have submerged large swathes of Punjab and Sindh.
While waters have yet to recede in many districts, officials and analysts warn the hit could be deeper than in 2022, when a third of the country lay under water, due to dual shocks to agriculture and manufacturing.
A report from the agricultural monitoring initiative GEOGLAM estimates at least 220,000 hectares of rice fields flooded between August 1 and September 16. In Punjab, 1.8 million acres of farmland have been inundated, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.
According to the PID statement, Georgieva expressed her sympathy to all people affected by the floods.
“She noted the importance of the damage assessment to underpin recovery priorities,” the statement said, adding that the official commended PM Shehbaz’s commitment to pursuing sound macro-economic policies and reiterated the IMF’s continued support as Pakistan advances the necessary economic reforms to ensure sustainable long-term economic growth.
During the meeting, the premier also appreciated the IMF’s longstanding constructive partnership with Pakistan.
He acknowledged the IMF’s timely support under various instruments, including the Stand By Arrangement for $3bn in FY 2024, followed by the EFF of $7bn and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) of $1.4bn, per the statement.
“Today, with the institution of deep-rooted structural reforms, Pakistan’s economy [is] showing positive signs of stabilisation and is now moving towards recovery,” the premier was quoted as saying.
Premier meets World Bank president
Separately, PM Shehbaz also met World Bank (WB) Group President Ajay Banga and praised the bank’s support to the country, according to a separate press release issued by the PID.

While appreciating Banga’s leadership, the premier briefed him of the government’s “comprehensive reform agenda, encompassing resource mobilisation, energy sector reforms, privatisation and measures to build resilience against climate change”.
“He reiterated that the reform agenda had steered Pakistan towards macroeconomic stabilisation, restored investor confidence and promoted sustainable and inclusive economic growth,” the statement added.
PM Shehbaz also appreciated the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF), providing $40bn for Pakistan, reaffirming commitment to ensure its effective implementation in close coordination with provincial governments, it added.
 






The WB president appreciated Pakistan’s reform measures and reaffirmed commitment to the country’s development agenda. “He emphasised the bank’s readiness to extend continued support for advancing economic reforms and undertaking long-term initiatives on climate resilience under the new CPF,” the press release added.
It further stated, “Both sides reiterated their resolve to further strengthen cooperation under the CPF in order to advance Pakistan’s development priorities.”

Her statement comes a day after Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the provincial government would issue relief cards to the flood victims in their personal names using its own resources instead of using BISP to assist them. Over the past month, the PPP has repeatedly urged the Centre to disburse stipends among displaced citizens via the “efficient and proven” BISP.
BISP is a national safety net programme in Pakistan that provides cash assistance to poor and vulnerable families, particularly targeting women.
In a post on X, Aseefa said that over four million people had been impacted by the “unprecedented floods” in Punjab. She termed the BISP as the “fastest and most effective way” to distribute aid to those affected.
“Not utilising one of the state’s key organisations, which has both the data and the capacity to deliver assistance, would be irresponsible,” she said.
 






Over the past weeks, the PPP chairman and senior leaders have encouraged the use of the flagship income support initiative to provide relief to thousands of citizens affected by the monsoon floods.
PPP Vice President Sherry Rehman had “strongly and repeatedly” advocated the use of BISP for the purpose in a Senate committee meeting.
In yesterday’s press conference, Azma Bukhari had said that the relief cards would ensure that help reaches the right people, adding that the government was focused on “serving, not politicising” the issue.
The minister, taking a jibe at PPP’s insistence over BISP use, remarked, “Should we take advice from those who have turned Sindh into archaeological ruins?”
At present, the Punjab government has announced a compensation package for the flood-hit families, which includes Rs20,000 per acre for crop loss, Rs1 million for completely destroyed homes, Rs500,000 for partially damaged homes, and Rs500,000 for the loss of cattle.
On September 18, PML-N leader and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah had ruled out the use of BISP in helping flood-affected people, calling it unviable for a cash-strapped government. Rana Sana said the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped.</p><small>2025-09-24 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24160230c819a3c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944339/karachi-police-arrest-8-after-gun-battle-at-gulshan-i-iqbal-call-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police arrest 8 after gun battle at Gulshan-i-Iqbal call centre</strong></a><br><p>Eight people were arrested on Tuesday night after a gun battle broke out between two groups of people at a call centre in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal neighbourhood, it emerged on Wednesday.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was filed at the Gulshan-i-Iqbal Police Station a day ago against the eight suspects under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common
object), 337A (punishment for assault), 337H(ii) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement), 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 25 (use of a firearm to commit a criminal offence) of the 2013 Sindh Arms Act.
The incident occurred because workers at the call centre took the complainant’s daughter, another employee, hostage, according to the FIR.
“My daughter works at the call centre, but she has been harassed by the branch manager for the past three years,” the complainant stated. “She was frustrated by it, so she told my son. My nephew also called the branch manager and told him to stay away from her.
“When my daughter went to work on September 23 (Tuesday), the manager called my nephew and said, ‘You didn’t come to me, do whatever you want’,” the complainant added. “My sister, nephews and I went to the office at 9pm, but the doors were locked. They were keeping my daughter hostage.”
The complainant alleged that the branch manager hurled abuse while another person drew a gun on them and fired shots when he and his nephews broke down the door and entered the premises.
“My nephew returned fire, while the office guard also drew his weapon and began firing,” the complainant said.
According to the FIR, someone reported the gunshots on the police helpline and personnel soon arrived at the scene, arresting five people for the firing, while three others were detained for causing the incident.
It added that the police also seized weapons and ammunition from the suspects.
In February, a young man was arrested in Karachi’s DHA after shooting and wounding two policemen while resisting arrest in connection with a kidnapping for ransom case. The shooter was later sent on remand by an anti-terrorism court for the incident and has a litany of charges against him, including cybercrime and the attempted murder of a journalist.</p><small>2025-09-24 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/241538419c3a09e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944334/whatsapp-twitch-and-reddit-among-sites-that-could-face-australia-under-16s-social-media-ban' target='_blank'><strong>WhatsApp, Twitch, and Reddit among sites that could face Australia under-16s social media ban</strong></a><br><p>Tech companies, including WhatsApp and Reddit, as well as streaming giant Twitch and gaming firm Roblox, could be among more than a dozen sites added to Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, the country’s regulator said Wednesday.
Platforms such as Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube were already included in the ban —  a world-first.
But the head of Australia’s eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, has written to 16 more companies to “self-assess” whether they fall under the ban’s remit.
The list also included Pinterest as well as Lego Play, streaming company Kick and gaming platform Steam.
Companies will need to make a case if they believe their platform should be exempt from the ban, the national broadcaster ABC said.
Inman Grant told the network that while some cases were “pretty clear”, the regulator would “give them the due diligence process”.
“We need to hear them all out,” she said.
The regulator said it will initially focus on platforms with the greatest number of users, where there are higher risks of harm.
Australia has been a leader in global efforts to prevent internet harm, but current legislation offers almost no details on how the ban will be enforced – prompting concern among experts that it will simply be a symbolic piece of unenforceable legislation.
The eSafety Commission will be able to fine social media companies up to Aus$49.5 million ($32.6m) for failing to comply with the rules.
Social media companies have described the laws as “vague”, “problematic” and “rushed”.
Canberra has struggled to pin down how precisely platforms will verify the ages of their users.
This month, Communications Minister Anika Wells conceded that firms would need to self-regulate.
An independent study ordered by the Australian government found this month that age checking can be done “privately, efficiently and effectively”, though it admitted no single solution would fit all contexts.
The regulator has also introduced a number of rules taking effect in Australia in the coming months to protect children from “lawful but awful” content, including online pornography and AI chatbots capable of sexually explicit conversations.
This month, Roblox agreed to curb the risk of adults grooming children on its platform in Australia.</p><small>2025-09-24 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2415185552668ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944333/farooq-sattar-takes-aim-at-sindh-govt-murtaza-wahab-over-delay-in-karachis-development-projects' target='_blank'><strong>Farooq Sattar takes aim at Sindh govt, Murtaza Wahab over delay in Karachi’s development projects</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Dr Farooq Sattar on Wednesday took aim at the Sindh government and Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab over the delay in development projects in the metropolis.
Karachi’s key development projects —from the long-delayed K-IV water supply scheme and Red Line bus corridor to stalled roadworks like the Karimabad underpass and Malir Expressway—remain stuck due to chronic funding gaps, utility relocation issues, regulatory hurdles, and weak inter-agency coordination, leaving the city’s residents waiting years for essential infrastructure.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Sattar said, “They cannot conceive a development project, nor can they deliver it.”
During the presser, the MQM leader talked about the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. Recently, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), backed by the PPP-led Sindh government, halted the federally funded Rs6 billion project of the Green Line Bus extension, citing the PIDCL’s failure to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from municipal authorities before restarting the work.
“An excuse was made that a NOC was not obtained, and that is why work was stopped. I think this is all an inter-departmental problem. The KMC is a government department, and the Sindh government has been elected by the people,” he said.
He questioned the need for delaying work on the project even if an NOC was required, adding that all the necessary approvals had been obtained in 2017.
He alleged that the reason for stopping work on the project was that the credit was going to the MQM, which the Karachi mayor “could not digest”. He said that Wahab had made hundreds of promises to the residents of the metropolis but had not fulfilled even a single one.
“If the PPP-led provincial government or the Karachi mayor does something right, then there should be an award worth thousands of dollars for them,” he quipped.
He further said that the provincial government had failed to complete several projects, including the K-IV project that was launched in the 2000s to ease Karachi’s water woes.
“From 2008 to 2022, they sat on this project similar to how a chicken sits on an egg for 21 days. However, after 21 days the egg hatches […] they sat for 14 years on the first phase of the K-IV project […] but they did not complete it.”
He further said, “This is an infertile [sic] government. You should not expect them to complete any project. You should not expect them to give relief to the people.”
He said that an underpass being constructed at Karimabad was being ignored, while work had been abandoned on an underpass in Gulistan-i-Jauhar. He added that a flyover had been promised for the Korangi Causeway in 2022, which had also not been followed through on.
He also highlighted the damage done to Shahrah-i-Bhutto during the recent rainfall.
“Pray for thanks that some of it was damaged while it was being constructed. What would have happened if it had occurred after it had been constructed? How many lives would have been lost? How many cars would have been damaged?”
He called on the Sindh government to seek forgiveness from the people of Karachi due to the state of affairs in the city and to make up for their lapses.
Last month, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had called out the Centre over the inordinate delays in the K-IV water project, saying he had expected the premier to demonstrate the “same speed and efficiency in Karachi as he does in Lahore.”
The Sindh government has expressed strong reservations over the “inadequate allocation” in the federal budget, saying it was taking the matter “very seriously” and in the process of reviewing the entire budget.</p><small>2025-09-24 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2409440891c6d85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944191/global-lessons-from-a-press-in-peril' target='_blank'><strong>Global lessons from a press in peril</strong></a><br><p> 


EVERY year of my journalistic career of nearly half a century, I have known only a free and independent press in the United States.
My professional start was in the 1970s. Those were years when Americans could see clearly how the press served democracy.
With the publication of the Pentagon Papers, first by The New York Times, the American public learned of the failures its government had covered up during a long war in Vietnam that cost so many lives.
Then there was Watergate, an investigation spearheaded by The Washington Post. US citizens learned how their president had weaponised the government against his political adversaries, abusing his powers and sabotaging the Constitution.
In the decades since those revelations, I took for granted that my country would always enjoy press freedom — and that the First Amendment of our Constitution would guarantee it.

We now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between ‘true’ and ‘false’; we cannot even agree on how to determine ‘a fact’

I no longer take any of that for granted. I no longer assume that the constitutional order will hold in the United States. Or that the rule of law will prevail. Or that free expression — not just for the press, but for all Americans – will endure.
That is because we have a president who has demonstrated disdain for traditional restraints on his power. Because a majority in Congress remains servile. Because a majority on the Supreme Court has handed this president extraordinary authority and immunity. Because the president appears determined to lay siege to institutional pillars of democracy, with the press as a high-priority target. And it is because those institutions are proving to be more fragile and faint-hearted than I imagined possible.
And perhaps most concerning to me is that we now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between what is true and what is false. It is only natural — and, in a democracy, expected — that we will disagree about which policies are best. Yet today we cannot agree on how to determine a fact. All of the elements we have historically relied upon to establish facts — education, expertise, experience and, above all, evidence — have been denigrated, dismissed and denied.
How can democracy flourish, or even survive, when we can’t determine the most basic facts. If democracy is in danger, a free press is, too. An independent press cannot survive without a democracy. And there is a corollary to that. A democracy cannot survive without a free press. There has never been a democracy without a media that is free and independent.
The playbook of aspiring authoritarians is well-established. High on their to-do list is crushing the press, an institution that can shed light on what political leaders are up to and that might hold them to account. Their repressive practices extend well beyond the press, however: They seek to abolish free expression altogether: The right of musicians, authors, artists, playwrights and screenwriters to express themselves as they wish. The right of the public to listen to, see and read what they feel they should. The right of business executives, academics, activists and political leaders to advocate for the policies they believe in. The right of every one of us to speak freely with family, friends, neighbors and colleagues without fear of surveillance and reprisal.
The rights that the press strives to safeguard are no different from the rights most people want for themselves — the freedom to inquire into facts, to share what they’ve learned, to communicate what they believe.
Much more is at risk than the freedom to express opinions. The real target of autocrats is truth itself. They aim to extinguish all independent arbiters of fact, whether they happen to be judges, scholars, scientists, statisticians or journalists. In nations tilting toward authoritarianism, heads of state claim sole ownership of the truth. And they rig, suppress or erase data to advance their lies.
 
 

That is what is happening now in the United States. Facts are under attack while government demands that its fictions be unquestioningly repeated.
For decades, the United States was a bastion of free expression of all types, with constitutional protections seemingly secured. That is no longer the case. We were a model for citizens in other nations who yearned for similar liberty. We no longer are. We were a forceful champion for these freedoms elsewhere. Civil rights activists, democracy advocates and independent journalists worldwide often counted on our support when faced with repression. They no longer can expect it.
In a famous 1941 speech about four essential human freedoms, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt listed “freedom of speech and expression” as the very first. And he pointedly added the words: “everywhere in the world.”
Today, with an aspiring autocrat as president, the United States is failing to embrace the freedoms that Franklin D. Roosevelt considered indispensable for a better world. Independent media was already in peril globally, a casualty of diminished confidence in democracy and the rise of a new generation of authoritarians. Our president has placed the press worldwide — and freedom of expression generally — in even greater jeopardy.
What President Donald Trump and his allies contemptuously disregard is why the founders of the United States drafted the First Amendment to the Constitution. James Madison was the principal author. And in describing the role of the press and of free expression, he spoke of the “right of freely examining public characters and measures.”
The word “examining” deserves special attention. Here is how the dictionary defines its meaning: “To inspect closely,” “to inquire into carefully/investigate,” “to test by questioning in order to determine progress, fitness, or knowledge.”
Apply that to journalists, and it means we are not stenographers. Nor should we be. We go behind the curtain and beneath the surface – to learn who did what and why, who will be affected and how, who influenced those decisions and with what intent.
The purpose of journalism, in my view, is to provide the public with the information it needs and deserves to know so that people might govern themselves. Embedded within that mission is a particularly high calling: Holding powerful individuals and institutions to account.
Those with power have the capacity to do enormous good. When they do, and when ordinary individuals do, we in the press should make that known. Praiseworthy efforts to improve society should be shared with others.
At the same time, some wrongs can be committed at extraordinary scale. Often the fault lies with those who possess disproportionate power, including the means to cover up their misdeeds. Immoral or unlawful conduct can go undetected for years, or decades. Ordinary people can suffer severe harm. Victims are often ignored or muzzled.
 
 

So, the public has much at stake in the struggle for free expression and an independent press. People must have a right to voice their grievances. The media should be prepared to listen and investigate.
When there is grave wrongdoing, often no one but journalists will explore the facts. When there are no journalists to report on corruption, inevitably there is more of it, with ordinary citizens paying the greatest price. When no independent media exists to draw attention, those who possess immense power seize the opportunity to acquire more. Their interests are served, the public’s needs are not.
As the US government abandons the cause of freedom worldwide, my hope is that citizens in other countries now will become a model for Americans who took their own freedoms for granted. They can show us how best to struggle against a repressive government. And in the difficult fight to uphold the fundamental democratic principles of free expression and an independent press, they can provide inspiration.

A separate source told AFP that the Italian supporters were carrying sticks, shovels and knuckle dusters around the city centre on the French Riviera.
The prefecture said that more than 400 police officers will be present for Wednesday’s group stage match.
“Since yesterday, more than 200 personnel, including two mobile units, were deployed in the city centre of Nice to prevent all types of public disorder and proceeded with the arrest of 102 individuals identified as Roma ultras, carrying weapons,” it said on Wednesday, before later revising the number of arrests down to 101.
“These individuals were taken into police custody,” it added.
The local authorities have banned Roma fans from displaying visible signs of their allegiance in the city between 1300 GMT (6pm PKT) Tuesday and 1000 GMT (3pm PKT) on Thursday.</p><small>2025-09-24 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24125611e410fa1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944320/massive-sinkhole-in-bangkok-street-forces-evacuations' target='_blank'><strong>Massive sinkhole in Bangkok street forces evacuations</strong></a><br><p>A portion of a busy road in Thailand’s capital caved in early on Wednesday, leaving a hole dozens of metres deep in front of a main hospital and forcing people nearby to evacuate.
Just outside a local police station and Vajira Hospital in a residential district of Bangkok, a roughly 50-metre (160-foot) hole pulled down power lines and exposed a burst pipe gushing water, AFP journalists saw.
Dozens of police and city officials cordoned off the site, while a pickup truck teetered precariously on the edge of the hole.
Suriyachai Rawiwan, director of Bangkok’s disaster prevention department, told AFP at the scene that the collapse was likely linked to recent heavy rain and a leaky pipe.
“There was a leak in the water pipe — water from the pipe eroded (earth) under the road so this incident happened,” he said, adding that there were no known casualties.
“The water that eroded brought some soil that dropped down to an under-construction subway station, causing the collapse,” Suriyachai added.
The tunnel is part of an underground service being built by the state-run Mass Rapid Transit Authority, which said it would investigate the cause of the cave-in.
Suriyachai said the local police station facing the collapsed road was evacuated.
Senior police officer Sayam Boonsom also said he had ordered the evacuation of nearby apartment blocks.
“The location is at a station, and the soil was sucked into the site … it collapsed,” Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt told AFP at the scene.
A video posted on social media and verified by AFP shows several people running from a construction area on Samsen Road as the street cracks open and collapses, revealing a water-filled hole.

Vajira Hospital, a teaching facility for one of Thailand’s top medical universities, said in a Facebook post it was suspending outpatient services, adding that they would “resume as soon as possible”.
Noppadech Pitpeng, a 27-year-old hospital staffer who lives in a nearby building, said he was frightened by a rumbling sound on Wednesday morning that woke him up.
“The sound was like an electricity pole collapsing and my whole flat shook,” he said, while carrying clothes in a large bucket out of his building.</p><small>2025-09-24 09:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24130652aac11c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944321/coordinator-to-pm-urges-locals-in-kps-tribal-areas-not-to-provide-refuge-to-terrorists' target='_blank'><strong>Coordinator to PM urges locals in KP’s tribal areas not to ‘provide refuge’ to terrorists</strong></a><br><p>The Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan has said that terrorists are being “facilitated and given refuge to” in the tribal areas of the province, because of which security forces are compelled to carry out operations.
The remarks come days after alleged aerial strikes in KP’s Tirah valley killed at least two dozen residents, including women and children. The incident prompted protests in the region, with local tribesmen, as well as the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, calling for an inquiry into the matter.
On the other hand, officials claimed that the explosions that led to the killings were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.
During an interview on the DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Wali was questioned about the PTI-led government in KP criticising the security situation in the province, with some suggesting the party was on board with military operations, while others claimed the party opposed the measures. He was asked how he viewed this apparent contradiction.
In response, Wali said, “Our brothers, sisters, friends, sons, children, and elders in tribal areas should not give refuge to people targeted in military operations.”
“Do not make people who are wanted by the state your guests,” Wali asserted.
When asked if he meant locals were sheltering the terrorists, Wali replied: “It certainly cannot be an outsider. How would the terrorists be operating in these areas otherwise?”
 
 

“Someone has to be giving refuge to them and facilitating them. And when operations are carried out, our citizens also lose their lives.”
At this point, Wali was asked to confirm if he was saying that locals of tribal areas were giving refuge to terrorists.
To this, Wali did not respond in the affirmative but instead repeated his claim, saying, “There certainly has to be facilitation from some side.”
The country, mainly KP and Balochistan, has lately witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, particularly after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a peace deal with the government and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement personnel.
Earlier this month, at least one person was killed in a bomb blast while a cricket match was being played in KP’s Bajaur district on Saturday, according to the police.
In May, four children were killed and five others, including a woman, were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan district, prompting locals to protest against frequent strikes.
Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice.
While earlier this year, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.</p><small>2025-09-24 09:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2412593153d508c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944317/typhoon-ragasa-takes-aim-at-china-after-leaving-14-dead-in-taiwan-lashing-hong-kong' target='_blank'><strong>Typhoon Ragasa takes aim at China after leaving 14 dead in Taiwan, lashing Hong Kong</strong></a><br><p>Typhoon Ragasa, the world’s most powerful tropical cyclone this year, barreled towards tens of millions of people in southern China on Wednesday after killing 14 people in Taiwan, leaving scores missing and lashing Hong Kong with ferocious winds and heavy rains.
Some 129 people are missing in Taiwan’s eastern Hualien county, after a barrier lake overflowed and sent a wall of water into a town, the Taiwan fire department said on Wednesday, with Ragasa’s outer rim having drenched the island since Monday.
Many residents in the tourist town of Guangfu complained there was insufficient warning from Taiwan authorities, who are used to moving people out of potential danger zones swiftly on the island, which is frequently hit by typhoons.
 






As rains inundated Taiwan, Hong Kong grappled with huge waves that crashed over areas of the Asian financial hub’s eastern and southern shoreline, breaking into white-water streams as they rushed along pavements and submerged some roads alongside residential properties.
At the Fullerton hotel on the island’s south, videos on social media showed a torrent of seawater surging through its glass doors before flooding the floor area. Calls to the property remained unanswered on Wednesday.
China’s marine authority issued its highest “red” wave warning for the first time this year, forecasting storm surges of up to 2.8 metres (9 feet) in parts of Guangdong province, as Ragasa charges towards the densely populated Pearl River Delta.
Ragasa formed over the Western Pacific last week. Fueled by warm seas and favourable atmospheric conditions, the tropical cyclone rapidly intensified to become a Category 5 super typhoon on Monday with winds exceeding 260kph (162mph). It has since weakened to a Category 3 typhoon, which is still capable of bringing down trees and power lines, shattering windows and damaging buildings.
“Authorities have taken lessons from Hato and Mangkhut, which both caused billions of dollars in damage in 2017 and 2018,” said Chim Lee, a senior energy and climate change specialist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.
“The Pearl River Delta is one of the best-prepared regions for typhoons, so we’re not expecting major disruptions. One change this year is that the Hong Kong stock market has stayed open during typhoons — a sign of how resilient the infrastructure has become,” he added.
That said, Zijin Gold International (2259.HK) delayed its $3.2 billion IPO in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
China braces for rainfall
After passing around 100 km (60 miles) south of Hong Kong over the next few hours, Ragasa is expected to make landfall along the south Chinese coast in the late afternoon.
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan and Dongguan, the largest cities in the storm’s path, are home to around 50 million people.
The emergency management ministry dispatched tens of thousands of tents, folding beds, emergency lighting equipment and other rescue supplies to Guangdong on Tuesday, Chinese state media reported, while over 770,000 people have been evacuated.
Some shops and restaurants in the province parked large rented trucks in front of their storefronts in a bid to shield them from the storm, local media reported.
“We live on an upper floor and saw there wasn’t too much danger, so I brought the kids out to experience this heavy rain and wind,” a 40-year-old Shenzhen resident surnamed Liang said. “We walked along the open road to make sure to stay safe.”
A crowd chasing the storm under the Shenzhen Bay Bridge were moved on by traffic police, a Reuters witness observed.
“The typhoon was really intense, but I’ve not been out long,” said an electric scooter delivery driver who goes by the name of Tim and was using his vehicle to move around and assess the damage.
“It’s a lot of fun, but it’s also dangerous. I wanted to ride around the waterfront, but it’s too dangerous, so I had to come back onto the bridge.”
China’s marine authority warned of a high risk of flooding in Shenzhen, especially in low-lying areas, with a storm surge alert expected to remain in effect until Thursday.
A woman and her five-year-old son were swept into the ocean on Tuesday after watching the typhoon from the Hong Kong waterfront, according to the South China Morning Post, which said they were now in intensive care.
Hong Kong lowered its typhoon signal to 8 from 10 just after 1pm (0500 GMT) on Wednesday, keeping the city locked down.
The hospital authority said at least 50 people had been injured by the typhoon, while the government had opened 50 temporary shelters, within which 791 sought refuge.
In the gambling hub of Macau next to Hong Kong, casinos were forced to shutter their gambling areas. Guests are not able to leave their property if they are staying there.
One user on China’s Xiaohongshu app showed videos of doors being sealed at a casino resort for protection against gales and debris.</p><small>2025-09-24 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625259-opposition-alliance-suffers-blow-after-hamid-raza-resigns-from-ttaps-info-secy-post' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance suffers blow after Hamid Raza resigns from TTAP's info secy post</strong></a><br><p>

In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
Having received the TCO certification, the national carrier announced that it would now be allowed to operate direct flights and carry not only passengers but also cargo.
“In the first phase, flight operations to Manchester will be resumed, after which Birmingham and London will be included in the B network,” the statement read, adding that the carrier was informed about the approval a day prior.
“The same day, the British Department of Transport also issued PIA Security and Cargo ACC3 certificates for five years,” PIA added.
“These certificates, issued by international aviation organisations, are a manifestation of complete confidence in PIA’s air operations and safety.” it said.
In a post on X, the national carrier expressed gratitude to the prime minister, foreign minister, defence ministry and Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority for their assistance in getting operations resumed.
 






The carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people.
The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”.
The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.</p><small>2025-09-24 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/24123528eba446c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944315/google-expands-new-ai-plan-to-40-more-countries-including-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Google expands new AI plan to 40 more countries, including Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Google on Wednesday announced the rollout of its ‘Google AI Plus plan’ in 40 more countries, including Pakistan.
The plan was first launched in Indonesia earlier this month with “positive” reception. According to Google, the new plan opens up “more access to powerful AI tools to help people level up their productivity and creativity at an accessible price”.
“Pakistan’s digital landscape is vibrant and growing, and we’ve been inspired by the creativity Pakistanis have shown in adopting AI tools,” said the Country Director of Google Pakistan, Farhan Qureshi, in a statement.
“With the launch of Google AI Plus, we are making these tools even more accessible to more people across the country. This is a core part of our commitment to fuel Pakistan’s digital transformation, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to enhance their productivity, creativity, and learning with AI,” Qureshi was quoted as saying.
The plan includes the following features:

Higher limits for image generation and editing (Nano Banana) in the Gemini app
More access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google’s most capable AI model for complex queries
Access to Veo 3 Fast, Google’s video generation model, in Gemini, Whisk, and Flow
Gemini integration in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more
200 GB of storage across Photos, Drive, and Gmail

Moreover, the statement added: “Users can share all of these benefits — from Gemini in Workspace to the 200 GB of storage — with up to five other family members.”
This, as per Google, is “an easy way for everyone to enjoy an upgraded Google experience with a single plan”.
“Google AI Plus is available in Pakistan starting today for Rs1,400 per month,” said the statement. “For a limited time, first-time subscribers will get 50 per cent off for the first six months.”
In July, Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja met with Google’s Regional AI Developer Ecosystem and Communities team to explore strategic collaboration in advancing Pakistan’s AI landscape.

Most of the rain, as much as 251.6 mm (9.9 inches) in 24 hours, fell during the early hours of Tuesday and was the heaviest witnessed in the city since 1988, said HR Biswas, the regional head of India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Kolkata.
Police said nine people died in Kolkata, with most of the deaths due to electrocution. Two people drowned, they added.
The rains brought the state capital to a standstill, seriously hampering preparations for the upcoming Durga Puja — the biggest annual festival of Hindus in West Bengal state.
Many pandals, temporary structures built with bamboo and other materials for the festival, and clay idols of the deities also suffered damage across the city.
 






Roads were submerged under waist-deep water in some areas, stranding vehicles and forcing commuters to wade through flooded streets.
Road, train, and air traffic were severely disrupted, with several flights and trains cancelled or delayed. Power outages affected multiple areas for hours, compounding residents’ difficulties.
“I got stranded in my hotel as my flight got cancelled and the roads were all waterlogged,” said Ranjan Panda, a water and climate expert.
Authorities said they have deployed water pumps to clear streets and railway tracks, with relief measures, including food distribution and emergency services, underway.
 
 

The IMD predicted more rain in the state and eastern India over the next few days due to the formation of a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal.
The state government declared schools and other educational institutions closed on Wednesday and Thursday before the holidays, for the festival to take effect from Friday.
Officials said conditions will normalise by Wednesday evening while urging residents to remain cautious as water levels gradually recede in low-lying areas.
“This should not have happened after four hours of rain. West Bengal is not in a good condition,” Sandip Ghosh, a resident in Kolkata, told Indian news agency ANI, in which Reuters has a minority stake.</p><small>2025-09-24 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625247-time-for-action-is-now-dpm-dar-urges-unsc-to-halt-gaza-bloodshed' target='_blank'><strong>'Time for action is now': Pakistan urges UNSC, OIC to halt Gaza bloodshed</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, IHC judges — Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahan­gi­­ri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Sam­an Rafat Imtiaz — went to the Supreme Court, where four of them filed petitions concerning the internal affairs of the high cou­rt. The registrar of the Su­­preme Court later rais­­ed multiple objections to the petitions.
The judges separately met senior lawyers Faisal Siddiqui and Abid Zubairi on Monday and Tuesday.
Advocate Siddiqui had earlier argued on their behalf during the hearing of a petition filed against the transfer of incumbent Chief Justice Sardar Moh­ammad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif.
He was initially enga­ged by former Islamabad High Court Bar Assoc­ia­tion (IHCBA) president Riasat Ali Azad to defend the five judges’ case, but that petition was withdrawn by his successor. Mr Azad, however, retained him as counsel while filing another identical petition through four former IHCBA presidents.
 
 

The Supreme Court’s Registrar Office on Monday raised administrative objections to the petitions separately filed by the five sitting IHC judges. The judges had appeared in person before the Supreme Court last Friday to institute constitutional petitions challenging the exercise of administrative powers by the IHC chief justice.
In their pleas, the judges sought a declaration that the  administrative powers of the IHC chief justice could not be exercised in  a manner that undermined judicial authority. They argued that once a  bench was seized of a matter, the CJ-IHC was not empowered to transfer  cases, reconstitute the bench, or exclude available judges from the  roster at will.
According to the objections, the petitioners invoked the apex court’s original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights, but the grievances raised were of an individual nature and thus not maintainable in view of the 1998 Zulfiqar Mehdi case. In that judgement, the Supreme Court had held that Article 184(3) could not be pressed into service for redress of personal grievances.

• Boasts of stopping ‘seven wars’; questions the need for a global watchdog
• Criticises European immigration policies, offers his own crackdown on immigrants as a model to follow
• Jokingly complains about malfunctioning escalators, teleprompters
UNITED NATIONS: In a combative, wide-ranging speech before UN General Assembly on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump railed against climate change, and told world leaders their countries were “going to hell” because of their immigration policies.
The 56-minute speech was a rebuke to the world body and a return to form for Trump, who routinely bashed the UN during his first term as president.
Trump, who has cast himself as a peacemaker in a bid to win the Nobel Peace Prize, complained that the United Nations did not support his efforts to end conflicts around the world.
 


“I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help,” he said.
“What is the purpose of the United Nations? The UN has such tremendous potential … but it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential. All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war. The only thing that solves war and wars is action,” he said.
However, in a meeting with the UN chief after his speech, Trump struck a softer note, saying: “Our country is behind the United Nations 100pc… I may disagree with it sometimes, but I am so behind it”.
In a moment of levity, Trump jokingly complained that a UN escalator had abruptly stopped as he and First Lady Melania Trump were halfway up and then the teleprompter in the General Assembly did not work.
“I can only say that whoever’s operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” he said. These are the two things I got from the United Nations a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.” a UN official said the White House operated the teleprompter.
After Trump finished speaking, UNGA President Annalena Baer­bock said: “The UN telep­r­o­mpters are working perfectly.”
‘Pet’ topics
But much of his speech was dominated by two of his biggest grievances: climate change and immigration.
President Trump called climate change a “con job” and urged a return to a greater reliance on fossil fuels as he mocked renewables as a “joke”.
The “carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions, and they’re heading down a path of total destruction,” he insisted.
“We’re getting rid of the falsely named renewables, by the way, they’re a joke, they don’t work, they’re too expensive,” he said at another point, calling wind technology “so pathetic, so bad,” and boasted that he had instead “unleashed” massive efforts to drill for new oil, gas and coal reserves. “Immigration and their suicidal energy ideas will be the death of Western Europe,” he said. Trump also offered his US immigration crackdown as a case study for what other world leaders should do to curb mass migration he says is altering the fabric of nations.
He also mocked Nato allies for not shutting down purchases of Russian oil.
“They’re funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one? In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs,” he said. Scientists and world leaders reacted sharply to the US president’s barbs.
“President Trump and his administration continue to spew lies and disinformation about climate science and the overwhelming benefits of clean energy, a grave disservice to the American people,” said Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Conc­erned Scientists.
“Climate change is here, it’s costly, and people need real solutions, not propaganda designed to boost the profits of fossil fuel polluters,” she argued.

LAHORE / DADU: The Punjab government on Tuesday announced a relief package for people affected by recent floods, but stopped short of giving a date for its distribution.
“A sum of Rs1 million will be given to the owner of a destroyed house and Rs500,000 for partially damaged houses,” Punjab Inform­ation Minister Azma Bokhari told a press conference.
She said that farmers whose land had been submerged would receive Rs20,000 per acre, while compensation of Rs500,000 would be provided for each cow or buffalo lost.
“All these payments are being made from the Punjab government’s own resources without seeking external aid,” she said, taking a jibe at the PPP that has been pressing the federal government to appeal to the international community for help.
Ms Bokhari said that “relief cards” would be introduced so that the flood victims could receive aid without standing in long queues.
She said 10,000 employees had been deployed to conduct surveys in flood-affected areas, but no timeframe had been set for compensation payments.
The minister said that more than 4.7 million people and 2.1 million livestock had been affected across 27 districts and 4,794 villages, including areas along three rivers. “For relief and rescue operations, 2,213 teams are still working in the field,” she added.
Ms Bokhari said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had visited every flood-hit area and claimed the provincial government had set an example in relief and rescue operations, while criticising opposition parties for politicising the issue.
Breaches in Sutlej embankment
Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding triggered by three breaches in the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the river Sutlej has inundated vast swathes of Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts, leaving thousands homeless and critical infrastructure severely damaged.
The embankment gave way at three locations — Noraja Bhutta union council in Jalalpur Pirwala, Bahadurpur and Jhangra. One breach widened to 400 feet, while two others stretched 30 to 40 feet.
The breaches diverted the Sutlej’s flow into nearby villages, submerging dozens of settlements, including Jhan­gra, Bahadurpur, Noraja Bhu­tta, Kotla Chakar, Tarut Bash­arat, Basti Lang, Basti Kanu, Depalpur and Khairpur Dha.
The floodwaters also damaged the M5 motorway and Gilani Road, creating a lake between the two roads. Authorities carried out a controlled breach at Gilani Road to divert water towards the Chenab River.
A senior irrigation official said 70,000 to 80,000 cusecs of water was still flowing in the Sutlej and could reach the area within a day or two. He said efforts were underway around the clock to plug the breaches, which could take up to 12 days to seal completely.
He said that the authorities were also diverting the water to the canals at Sulemanki and Islam headworks and 20,000 to 25,000 cusecs of water in the Sutlej would further decrease near Noraja Bhutta, which would take the usual course to enter the Chenab River.
Meanwhile, the residents of these union councils were forced to live on Gilani Road and other embankments under the open sky, many without tents or food.
Shakir Kanu of Basti Kanu told Dawn that water would not recede in their areas until the breaches at the Noraja Bhutta dyke were plugged.
He said that most houses in his locality were destroyed or collapsed, while some were under threat due to the continuously rising water.
 
 

“The government is making efforts to save the motorway and bringing heavy stones, but no effort is being made to save our areas,” he lamented.
Mr Kanu further said that the people and cattle heads were not getting proper food and they were also facing medical issues.
On CM Maryam Nawaz’s instructions, 44 additional machines were dispatched to the breach site in Lodhran, with senior ministers overseeing the operation.
Punjab Relief Commi­ssioner Nabil Javaid said that 4.7 million people had been affected across 27 districts, with 271 relief camps and 300 medical camps set up, while over 2.6m people and 2.1m animals had been moved to safety.
According to Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Dire­ctor General Irfan Ali Kathia, the overall water flow in Punjab’s rivers is normal and water levels in flood-affected areas are significantly receding, where rehabilitation measures are ongoing.
Dadu villages submerged
In Sindh, as a medium flood passes through the Kotri Barrage, several parts of Jamshoro district have been submerged.
These include parts of Sehwan, Laki Shah Sadar, Amri, Sun, Manjhand, Lakha, Indpur, Budhapur, Aliabad, Khanot, Petaro, Kotri, Khanpur, and Karokho, among others.
Homes , infrastructure and agricultural land in these regions has suffered extensive damage. In Sehwan, 10 more villages have come under floodwater. The flood has crossed the bridge on Indus Highway and reached the historic Lal Bagh area. Water has also entered the graveyard near Lal Bagh and inundated nearby homes.
Electricity supply has been completely suspended in the riverine areas, leaving residents in a lurch, while road links have been severed as connecting thoroughfares remain under water.
In addition, several parts of Manjhand are under water. Villagers from Goth Detha, located near the shrine of Shah Owais Qarani, are stranded after their road link was severed by rising floodwaters.
The area’s plight was depicted in a video shared on social media, showing a funeral procession trudging though three to four feet of water.

• Imran’s lawyer opposes video link arrangement for PTI chief, will appeal ATC order
• Plea in IHC seeks enforcement of conjugal rights for incarcerated ex-PM, spouse
RAWALPINDI: The prosecution is likely to conclude its evidence against former prime minister Imran Khan and other PTI leaders next week in the case pertaining to a violent protest outside the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) on May 9, 2023, following the arrest of Mr Khan in a corruption case.
During the hearing, ex-PM Imran Khan also marked his attendance from the Adiala jail via video link, but connectivity issues marred the PTI leader’s appearance before the court.
On Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi recorded the statements of eight prosecution witnesses, after the defence sought deferment of the proceedings to challenge the order requiring Mr Khan’s appearance through video link. The order was passed in pursuance of a Punjab government notification directing trial proceedings be held via video link, citing security concerns.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah on Sept 19 ruled that the trial would be conducted on the court premises instead of in Adiala jail, with Mr Khan’s attendance to be mar­k­ed through video link. When the hearing resumed on Tuesday, the defence counsel requested an adjo­u­rnment, informing the judge that the legal team intended to file an appeal against the Sept 19 order.
The prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum. The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement.
The court recorded statements of eight prosecution witnesses, incl­uding three officers of the Fed­eral Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crimes Wing, who testified regarding tweets and other social media posts of the PTI leaders ahead of and during the May 9 protests.
Two Islamabad magistrates, Awais Bhatti and Abdullah Khan, also testified that they had recorded statements of PTI local leaders Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Wasiq Qayyum and Omar Tanveer Butt, who affirmed the allegations against Mr Khan and the party leadership.
According to Raja Ikram Ame­en Minhas, the head of the prosecution in the GHQ case, the testimony of 41 prosecution witnesses has been completed so far, while the remaining nine witnesses will be produced at the next hearing.
He said that the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses would start afterwards.
The court adjourned the case till Sept 27.
Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since 2023, faces multiple cases, including GHQ protest case. He was indicted in December last year and was arrested in this case by the Rawa­lpindi police in January 2024.
Conjugal rights
Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued notices to the authorities concerned on a petition seeking permission for Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while incarcerated in prison.
Justice Arbab Tahir took up the petition filed under Article 199 by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and Imran’s supporter.
The court issued a one-page written order, directing the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Punjab government, Punjab’s inspector general of prisons, and the jail superintendent, among others, to submit their replies before the next hearing.
During proceedings, the petitioner’s lawyer argued that Section 545A of the Criminal Proc­edure Code supported the protection of family life and provision of facilities for marital relations to prisoners as a basic need.
He argued that denial of conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous judicial rulings. It also cites a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh Home Department in compliance with Supreme Court directions, allowing convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. Additionally, the petition relies on a landmark Shariat Court judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement.

NEW YORK: After an antagonistic speech at the UN General Assembly, where he opposed a growing global push towards the recognition of a Palestinian state, US President Donald Trump met Muslim leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to present his plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza.
The meeting, held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA at United Nations Headquarters, brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia.
Ahead of the meeting, in a televised interaction with Muslim leaders, Trump said: “We have to get the hostages back… This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world… so it’s an honour to be with you.”
“We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started,” he said, before the start of formal consultations with world leaders.
Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani thanked the president for hosting such an important meeting at such an important time, saying that they were only there to stop the war and bring the prisoners back.
“We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” the Qatari leader said.
‘Stop the war immediately’
Earlier, in his speech at the UNGA, Trump said that greater recognition for Palestine would amount to rewarding “horrible atrocities” by Hamas.
He called on world powers to focus instead on securing the release of prisoners held in Gaza.
Trump said the US wants a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ deal that would see the return of all remaining prisoners, alive and dead.
“We have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to immediately negotiate peace,” he said.
Reacting to Trump’s address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US leader’s “commitment to establishing peace in the world,” saying it showed he was “indeed a man of peace”.
He also recalled that Trump and his team had “played a crucial role in preventing a potentially devastating war between India and Pakistan,” adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.”
 
 

The remarks came ahead of the multi-lateral meeting with Muslim leaders, where Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also accompanied PM.
When asked about the upcoming meeting by reporters, PM Shehbaz refused to comment, saying: “It is not the right time; I will speak about it only after the meeting is over.”
The PM Office also released pictures showing PM Shehbaz in a meeting with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
Both the White House and Pakistan’s mission in Washington were expected to hold a briefing after the meeting, but no formal statements were issued until going to press.
Plan for peace
According to the White House, Trump’s plan envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of regional peacekeeping troops, and an internationally supported transition and reconstruction process for the battered enclave.
Quoting diplomatic sources, Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios reported that while the plan had not been drafted by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been made aware of its outlines.
 
 

It envisages a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), but not for Hamas, which both Washington and Tel Aviv insist must be dismantled.
Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported.
Ahead of the multilateral meeting, Sec­retary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that the only way to a permanent solution to the “challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement”.
Describing the possible deal, he said it would be “one in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.”
In separate remarks to CBS News, he described the multilateral meeting as “one last shot” at ending the conflict in Gaza, getting all remaining prisoners released, and putting in place a humanitarian relief programme.
