National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) spokesperson Imran Shah confirmed to Dawn that the M5 was closed from 6am to 11:30am due to foggy conditions.
The M5 is part of the Lahore–Karachi Motorway network and is operational up to Sukkur. Tuesday’s temporary closure forced thousands of travellers to shift to the National Highway to reach their destinations.
Following the closure, traffic was diverted onto the National Highway from Zahir Pir to Uch Sharif, Alipur and Muzaffargarh to access Multan and Rahim Yar Khan.
The disruption inconvenienced commuters travelling to Jalalpur Pirwala and Shujabad tehsils of Multan district.
Heavy traffic congestion was also reported near several interchanges, including Zahir Pir, Uch Sharif, Jhangra, Jalalpur Pirwala and Shujabad, after the motorway closure.
In a statement released earlier in the day, the NHMP spokesperson said the decision to close a section of the M5 was taken to ensure the safety of motorists as visibility had dropped significantly along the affected stretch.
The spokesperson said lane violations during fog could lead to serious accidents and urged motorists to strictly adhere to lane discipline.
He advised citizens to travel during the daytime between 10am and 6pm. He also instructed motorists to use fog lights, avoid unnecessary travel, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles and refrain from overspeeding.</p><small>2025-12-09 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/090804010367f8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960098/imf-sees-pakistan-stepping-back-from-default-risk' target='_blank'><strong>IMF sees Pakistan stepping back from default risk</strong></a><br><p>The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections for Pakistan suggest that the immediate risk of economic free fall has eased but the country remains locked into a narrow stabilisation path marked by weak growth, heavy debt and limited relief for households.
Projections by the Fund, which late on Monday approved a fresh disbursement of around $1.2 billion to Pakistan, showed that Pakistan’s economic growth was projected to inch up from 2.6 per cent in FY2024 to 3.2pc by FY2026, a pace that barely matches population growth in the country of 240.5 million people.
With a per capita income of $1,677, this trajectory points more to economic containment than recovery.
Pakistan’s population also continues to grow at a high pace, with mid-2025 official figures citing 2.55pc, while World Bank data points to 1.8–1.9pc. Though slightly lower than past peaks, the rate remains a significant development challenge.

 

Pakistan, however, appears to have made the most striking turnaround in inflation. After averaging 23.4pc in FY2024, consumer prices are estimated to have fallen sharply to 4.5pc in FY2025, and projected to rise to 6.3pc in FY2026.
End-period inflation is also projected to ease from 12.6pc in FY2024 to 3.2pc in FY2025, before climbing to 8.9pc in FY2026. The disinflation reflects tight monetary policy, lower subsidies and compressed demand under the IMF programme, though the projected rebound suggests price stability remains fragile.
Labour market conditions offer limited comfort. Unemployment is projected to fall only modestly from 8.3pc in FY2024 to 7.5pc in FY2026, underscoring the weak job-creating capacity of the current growth path.
On the fiscal front, the adjustment underway is substantial. Government revenue and grants are projected to rise from 12.7pc of the gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2024 to 16.3pc by FY2026, while expenditure is expected to remain near 20pc of GDP.
As a result, the budget deficit is projected to narrow from -6.8pc to -4.0pc of the GDP. Pakistan is also projected to maintain a primary surplus rising to 2.5pc of the GDP, a central IMF benchmark.
Despite this tightening, the public debt burden remains heavy. Total general government debt, including IMF obligations, is projected to hover around 72–73pc of the GDP, while government and guaranteed debt is expected to stay near 76pc.
Domestic debt accounts for nearly half of the GDP, keeping interest costs elevated amid high domestic borrowing rates.
External pressures have eased but vulnerabilities persist. The current account balance is projected to remain close to zero, shifting from a 0.6pc of GDP deficit in FY2024 to a 0.5pc surplus in FY2025, before slipping back into a small deficit in FY2026. Foreign exchange reserves are projected to rise from $9.4bn in FY2024 to $17.8bn by FY2026, lifting import cover from 1.6 months to 2.7 months — an improvement, but still short of comfortable levels.
Foreign investment, however, remains subdued. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is projected at just 0.5–0.6pc of the GDP throughout the period under review, pointing to persistent investor caution despite improved macro stability.
Monetary conditions also remain tight. Broad money growth is projected in the 14–16pc range, while private sector credit growth, though improving from 6pc to 15pc, remains constrained by high interest rates. The six-month treasury bill rate stood at 21.5pc in FY2024, reflecting the heavy cost of domestic borrowing.
Meanwhile, the 15.4pc real effective appreciation of the rupee in FY2024 signals a shift towards currency stability after a period of sharp depreciation, though it also carries risks for export competitiveness in an economy where textiles, valued at $17.3bn, remain the dominant export.
Taken together, the IMF projections depict an economy that has regained short-term stability through sharp fiscal and monetary adjustment, but remains burdened by high debt, weak investment and slow employment growth.
The immediate crisis may have passed, but the challenge of translating stabilisation into sustained, inclusive growth remains unresolved.
‘Stability achieved, more efforts needed for growth’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed the latest IMF disbursement a “proof that Pakistan is making progress in implementing the necessary steps for economic stability and growth”, according to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan.  
A statement carried by Radio Pakistan further quoted the premier as saying that “the IMF’s expression of satisfaction with the effective implementation of economic reforms and measures in Pakistan is a clear testament to the hard work of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his team”.
The statement added that the PM also acknowledged that Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir “played a key role in supporting the implementation of the reform agenda and paving the way for Pakistan’s economic development”.  
He said that steering the country from the brink of default toward stability and growth was a “challenging phase, requiring collective sacrifice from everyone”.
“Political parties sacrificed politics, and the nation endured economic hardships to make the impossible possible,” he was quoted as saying.
Moreover, PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction that Pakistan’s economic reforms and digitisation [process] had “become a successful case study and an example for the world”, the statement said, adding that the premier also expressed the confidence that the “dream of Pakistan’s economic development will soon be realised”.
He said that while “stability had been achieved, more efforts are needed to move the economy toward growth”.
The PM expressed his “firm commitment to working diligently for the prosperity of the people and completely freeing the country from foreign debt. He is confident that time is not far when Pakistan will achieve economic self-sufficiency after getting rid of debt”, the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-09 06:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638252-kp-risks-governors-rule-if-provincial-govt-resists-cooperation-kundi' target='_blank'><strong>KP risks governor's rule if provincial govt resists cooperation: Kundi</strong></a><br><p>

Each side has blamed the other for the clashes, which have derailed a fragile ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump that ended five days of fighting in July.
Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said two civilians had been killed overnight, taking its death toll to six. One Thai soldier has died in the fighting.

 

In a statement on Tuesday morning, the Thai Navy said Cambodian forces had been detected inside Thai territory in the coastal province of Trat and military operations were launched to expel them, without providing further details.
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said late on Monday that Thailand “must not use military force to attack civilian villages under the pretext of reclaiming its sovereignty”.
Earlier, Cambodia said it had not retaliated even after its forces came under sustained attack.
The Thai Navy said Cambodian forces were increasing their presence, deploying snipers and heavy weapons, improving fortified positions and digging trenches, adding it saw the actions “as a direct and serious threat to Thailand’s sovereignty”.
Monday’s clashes were the fiercest since a five-day exchange of rockets and heavy artillery in July, when at least 48 people were killed and 300,000 displaced, before Trump intervened to broker a ceasefire.
Thailand evacuated 438,000 civilians across five border provinces and authorities in Cambodia said hundreds of thousands of people had been moved to safety. Thailand’s army said 18 soldiers were wounded and Cambodia’s government reported nine civilians injured.
Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817-km (508-mile) land border, with disputes over ancient temples stirring nationalist fervour and occasional armed flare-ups, including a deadly week-long artillery exchange in 2011.
Tensions rose in May following the killing of a Cambodian soldier during a skirmish, which led to a major troop buildup at the border and escalated into diplomatic breakdowns and armed clashes.</p><small>2025-12-09 05:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638241-tip-ncps-2025-finds-economy-stable-police-tendering-seen-as-most-corrupt' target='_blank'><strong>TIP NCPS 2025 finds economy stable; police, tendering seen as most corrupt</strong></a><br><p>

Now students with arts background at the matric level can also be enrolled in pre-medical, pre-engineering and in ICS etc. The decision was made by the Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) at its 183rd meeting held in Karachi a few days ago, sources told Dawn.
The forum made another major policy decisions for O/A level students. Students who passed two major subjects in O/A level will be given equivalence in science group instead of humanities. The meeting also discussed abolishing the science and arts groups at the matric level by replacing it with standards Secondary School Certificate (SSC) with flexible choice of elective subjects. However, a final decision on abolishing groups at the matric level was not made as this will be further debated later.
The sources in Karachi said the forum was of the view that due to the bar at the matric level many brilliant students could not get admission in accordance with their choice at the inter level.

Under new policy, students with arts background at matric level can also be enrolled in pre-medical and pre-engineering

When contacted, IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah confirmed the two major decisions.
“Yes, IBCC forum has decided to give open choice to students for getting admission in first year in their favouirte groups. Similarly, the forum also decided that students of O/A level, who passed two major science subjects, should also be given equivalence in the Science Group,” he said and added that discussion also took place regarding replacing science and arts groups at the martic level with a standardised SSC certificate under which all students, besides compulsory subjects, will have flexible choice of elective subjects.
Dr Mallah while presenting rational behind these decisions said that due to some illogical bars, the growth of many shining students was halted.
“For example, in any school of far flung area of the country, students due to some reasons including shortage of science teachers could not study science, so as per pervious practice, they had no choice to get admission in engineering, medical and computer fields, which was a big injustice with them,” he said and added that now all fields are open for everyone and if students have the potential, capability and talent, they can pass pre-engineering and pre-medical at the inter level without studying these subjects at the metric level.
“Now world is changing and there is need of making changes to help students growth,” he said.
“Let me appreciate all members of IBCC and curriculum councils, who with collective wisdom made these students centric decisions,” Dr Mallah said.
Asked when these decisions will be implemented, he said at the IBCC level, “From today [Monday] we started issuing equivalence in science group to all those students who passed two majors science subjects in their O/A levels exams. Just a moment ago, we issued first equivalence certificate to a student who had passed physics and match in their O/A level.” He added that earlier such students were granted equivalence in humanities groups for not studying one more subject in science. “But, there was no encouragement for them for studying two science subjects,” he said.
“As far as admission in first year with open choice is concerned, I guess, this will be started from upcoming admission session. A decision had already been made and soon we will write a letter to all colleges, universities and boards for implementation,” he said.

After the joint parliamentary party meeting held in the federal capital, the PTI leaders discussed the recent political developments concerning the former ruling party and the ban on meetings with Imran.
The meeting was attended by PTI lawmakers from both houses of parliament, including party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Barrister Ali Zafar, Ali Muhammad Khan and MNA Shahid Kattak.
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who is the PTI nominee for the National Assembly opposition leader slot, also participated.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar told Dawn that the meeting discussed the current political situation and recent developments, including the unannounced ban on meetings with Imran.
He said the participants of the meeting were of the opinion that Imran Khan was not a security risk, as claimed by the government and the army spokesperson.
“Khan sahab is essential for Pakistan’s stability, democracy, and future. His continued exclusion only weakens the political system and deepens national uncertainty,” he said, adding that the opposition lawmakers were united and resolute on this issue.
“We will use every constitutional, legal and parliamentary forum to secure the release of our leader. The entire parliamentary party stands firmly behind Imran Khan,” he said.
According to Barrister Zafar, the participants of the meeting demanded that they must be allowed unrestricted access to meet the party founder in jail. They were of the view that denying elected representatives and their right to meet their leader was unconstitutional, undemocratic and unacceptable.
“The solitary confinement and isolation of Bushra Bibi is a grave injustice. Subjecting a woman who has no political role to mental torture violates fundamental human rights and goes against our cultural and moral values. Such treatment is unprecedented and deeply disturbing,” he said while sharing the details of the meeting.
Barrister Zafar added that the PTI parliamentary party will remain the strongest pillar of the ongoing movement.
“The party will continue leading the democratic and constitutional struggle for justice, political freedom, and the restoration of the people’s mandate,” he said.
It may be noted that political tensions have been increasing across the country, especially after the press conference of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, who claimed that Imran was promoting a narrative against the armed forces.
He also used disparaging remarks against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, prompting the PTI to seek an apology from the army spokesperson.
On the other hand, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that negotiations would not be held with the PTI and in case the government agreed to talks, it would be held in parliament and without Imran Khan.
Last week, Barrister Gohar had extended an olive branch, saying there was a need to soften tones to break the political deadlock.</p><small>2025-12-09 04:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69375c9908b30.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960049/rahuls-cinderella-challenge' target='_blank'><strong>Rahul’s Cinderella challenge</strong></a><br><p>SO, Rahul Gandhi was not invited to the state banquet for Russian President Vladimir Putin. We are told Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ensured that the leader of opposition in parliament’s Lower House — the shadow prime minister in the British system — wasn’t allowed to make even a courtesy call on the visiting dignitary. Rahul took his exclusion demurely, calling it a reflection of the government’s insecurity. He didn’t seem too bothered. When he travels abroad, he said, he finds it difficult to meet senior leaders because they had been advised to not interact with him.
Modi’s peevishness with the Gandhi family is well recorded, but there is evidently more to it than the challenge of competing with Jawaharlal Nehru’s legacy and the palpable inferiority complex the combat engenders.
His spite for Rahul can be linked to 2005 when Modi was denied visas by the US and European countries. The Congress government headed by Manmohan Singh had taken over the previous year from a BJP-led coalition of prime minister A.B. Vajpayee. Modi’s tourist visa to the US was revoked during Congress rule. The American embassy cited his alleged role in the 2002 communal violence in Gujarat when he was chief minister of the state.
Did PM Singh indeed have a role in instigating foreign embassies to stall Modi’s travels abroad? If so, it was a foolish and counterproductive idea. If there was indeed a case against Modi, and Zakia Jaffri swears there were several, then the Indian state should not have taken refuge behind foreign governments. If the Congress didn’t have the courage to impound his passport or send him to jail — assuming it had clinching evidence of Modi’s role in the 2002 carnage — it showed cowardice bordering on complicity.

 

Modi hasn’t a care for diplomatic finesse. When two women journalists were assigned to interview Putin at the Kremlin before his Delhi visit, they came across as Modi’s envoys. Which Indian prime minister in Putin’s view had contributed the most to cement India’s ties with Russia? The host wasted no time in ticking off the journalists for asking an “indecent” question.

Rahul Gandhi is not unaware of the risks of calling out Modi on issues of high corruption, electoral fraud and divisive politics.

The visit was said to be essentially about optics for both sides. However, the aspect made public was gross. Struggling to cope with Delhi’s acrid air, Putin walked bravely on a red carpet that seemed to have been rented from the lowest (or highest) bidder. As for the comparison of himself with Nehru Modi never stops making, one needs to regard a slice of history.
For contrast, consider Indira Gandhi’s class. Minutes before the Non-Aligned Movement’s summit was to begin at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan in March 1983, Mrs Gandhi walked over to the packed press enclosure. It was a complex international event delicately involving 100 countries. Ziaul Haq and Fidel Castro came calling for opposing ideological corners.
Mrs Gandhi didn’t breeze into the press enclosure to take advantage of the presence of global media. She headed straight to the cafeteria, instead, to ensure her fabled housekeeping rules. “Soggy sandwiches,” she declaimed, ordering frantic officials to remove the trays and get a fresh lot quickly. She then walked back briskly to the summit to take the gavel from Castro.
Regardless of the spite rivals like Z.A. Bhutto, Richard Nixon or George Fernandes reserved for her, Indira Gandhi was an authentic world leader accustomed to the grace and competence required of an Indian PM. She could regale Queen Elizabeth with colonial history in Goa or reward Ronald Reagan for his warm reception at the White House with an adroit but cheerful thank you address. She didn’t position Indian photographers to impress the world when Leonid Brezhnev broke protocol to receive her at the head of an entire Soviet politburo when she landed in Moscow, defying bilious Western reproach. In 1972, Mrs Gandhi chose to overlook the slurs Bhutto had hurled at her in an interview with Oriana Fallaci and concluded that signing the Shimla Accord was more important than getting even.
Indira could speak better French than her father but lacked the intellectual heft of Nehru. But practically all of Modi’s predecessors were better educated than him. And Nehru, his bugbear, wrote brilliant books on Indian and global history, that too during his days in colonial prisons. As prime minister, Nehru negotiated a perilously polarised world and displayed great sagacity at a dire moment in history. Nikita Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy were close to destroying the planet before they struck up an enviable friendship. And they both courted Nehru equally. Khrushchev sought his friendship when they visited each other in 1955. Kennedy made a display of his respect for Nehru by climbing the plane’s ladder to welcome the visitor to the US. It was for his widely acknowledged political integrity that Moscow, Washington and Beijing agreed to India’s intervention in the Korean War to negotiate a tricky moment in ending the bloody conflict. Putin knows this even if Indian journalists don’t.
Next, Rajiv Gandhi who was happily married to Italian-born Sonia Maino and enjoying being the father of their two children. He shunned limelight and was pleased with his lack of ambition or pugnacity of his younger brother. If anything, he was content to be a skilled commercial pilot. After Sanjay Gandhi died in a plane crash and his mother was assassinated in a hail of bullets, Sonia urged her husband not to walk into the dangerous power vacuum. She was right. He was assassinated after a tormented tenure despite an unparalleled 414 seats in the 543-member House.
Rahul Gandhi is not unaware of the risks of calling out Modi on issues of high corruption, electoral fraud and divisive politics. When a peeved Modi excluded him from a state banquet, he signalled Rahul’s larger challenge. Unlike Cinderella’s struggle with those who envied her presence at the royal ball, Rahul knows well that there are no fairy godmothers in cutthroat politics to bail him out.

The decision came in a move triggered by a public outrage after a three-year-old boy drowned in an uncovered nullah near NIPA.
“And this is in addition to the manhole covers placed by the KWSC (Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation) and the streetlights fixed by the KMC,” Mayor Murtaza Wahab told Dawn, clarifying that the city administration is not abdicating its responsibility for covering manholes and fixing streetlights, but is instead giving some financial powers to the UCs to help keep them maintained.
The announcement came directly from Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who said that the new mechanism had been designed to give fiscal space to the union committees, which are currently receiving Rs1.2 million each per month, an amount recently enhanced from half a million rupees.
Under the new summary approved by Mayor Wahab on Monday, each of the 246 UCs across the city would receive additional Rs100,000 every month to maintain the manhole covers and streetlights in their neighbourhoods.

Mayor Wahab says KMC is financially empowering UCs for infrastructure upkeep

Although the manhole covers are provided by both the KWSC and the KMC, he said, it was deemed necessary to take an additional step. Therefore, the KMC has decided to provide additional money to every UC, specifically and exclusively for streetlight maintenance and manhole cover requirements, he added.
An official told this reporter that according to the newly-passed summary by the mayor, the KMC would disburse Rs24.60 million every month to 246 UCs across the city and almost Rs300 million in a year for the maintenance of manhole covers and streetlights.
“The KWSC has already notified all towns and UCs for smooth supplies of the manhole covers and for the public-level engagement. The mayor has also set up helpline 1334 and email complaint@kmc.gos.pk, asking people to identify any open manholes and report them,” he added.
The move marks the first direct financial intervention by the KMC at the UC level since June 2023, when the current local government system was put in place. Since then, the KMC has largely relied on departmental coordination and inter-agency mechanisms to manage routine tasks, avoiding decentralised financial allocations to the UCs.
The decision comes against the backdrop of intense public outrage following the NIPA tragedy, which reignited criticism over the local government system’s failure to maintain essential civic infrastructure. However, despite releasing funds to the UCs, the authorities have not shared any mechanism to monitor or ensure that the money is spent for its intended purpose.
The official said the new allocation will be released from the Municipal Utility Charges and Taxes (MUCT) account, enabling each UC to respond quickly to the complaints, improve neighborhood infrastructure and deliver essential municipal services more effectively. Implemented in August 2024, the KMC aims at generating an annual income of Rs4 billion through the MUCT being collected through K-Electric (KE) bills.
Mayor Wahab hopes that the fresh initiative would help prevent “unfortunate incidents” in the city and to ensure that municipal issues at the local level are addressed promptly and effectively.
“The safety and well-being of Karachi’s citizens remain the city administration’s top priority, and this decision marks another stride toward building a safer, well-lit, and efficiently managed Karachi,” he added.

Judges of superior courts, senior bar members, officers of the Federal Judicial Academy and the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) attended the ceremony.
Federal Shariat Court Chief Justice Iqbal Ham­eedur Rehman was seen in the front row, whereas Justice Muha­mmad Karim Khan Agha represented the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) at the oath-taking ceremony.
Supreme Court Regi­strar Muhammad Sohail Laghari conducted the proceedings, while a slew of high court judges were also in attendance.
“This is the first of its kind ceremony in which such a large number of people, be it representatives of different high offices, senior lawyers or court staff, have turned up,” said a senior lawyer who wished not to be named.

Justice Mulakhail sworn in as BHC chief justice

The attendance of all IHC judges, despite apparent division among them, was noticed by almost everyone at the ceremony, he said. This shows, he said, Justice Aurangzeb was among the most respected judges of the superior judiciary. “After all he had been their colleague while serving at the high court,” he remarked.
His observation came in view of the overcrowded hall that was full of chairs to accommodate the guests who came in large numbers. Since all the seats were occupied, many were seen standing inside the hall to witness the ceremony.
BHC chief justice
Separately, Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail was sworn in as the Chief Justice of the Balochistan High Court (BHC) at a ceremony held at Balochistan Governor House on Monday. Earlier, Justice Mulakhail was serving as acting chief justice.
Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail administered the oath to him at a ceremony, which was attended by Justices Iqbal Ahmed Kasi, Shoukat Ali Rakhshani, Gul Hassan Tareen, Muhammad Aamir Nawaz Rana, Sardar Ahmed Haleemi, Muh­ammad Ayub Khan and Najamuddin Mengal, judges of subordinate courts, police chief, bar representatives, political leaders and tribal elders.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday appro­ved electricity projects for Gilgit-Baltistan and Gwadar, including a 100 MW solar project in GB to en­sure interrupted, affordable and sus­­tainable power supply to the area.
Presiding over a meeting on power sector initiatives in Gwadar and Gigilt-Baltistan, the prime minister approved immediate implementation of a comprehensive plan to resolve issues in the power supply to Gwadar Port City.
All relevant institutions should work in complete coordination to ensure uninterrupted, affordable and reliable power supply to Gwadar Port City, the prime minister directed.
Issuing special directions for the immediate initiation of the 100-megawatt solar project in GB, PM Shehbaz also directed that the project must ensure uninterrupted and sustainable provision of clean and environmentally friendly electricity.
“The welfare and economic dev­elopment of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is among the top priorities of the federal government,” he said, adding that every possible measure was being taken to promote industrial activity, investment and economic growth in GB.
“Uninterrupted electricity supply in Gwadar will certainly enha­nce national economic activity and investment,” the prime minister said. He said electricity supply for industries and investors in the country should meet regional and international standards.
Briefing the meeting, Minister for Energy Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari said that due to the ministry’s prompt actions, power supply disruptions in Gwadar had already been reduced by
42 per cent.
After resolving outages, a comprehensive plan has also been prepared to stabilise the voltage of supplied electricity in Gwadar within the next six months, the minister said, adding that effective and productive steps were being taken to ensure electricity supply to domestic and commercial consumers in Gwadar.
Among short-term projects, 9.7 megawatts of solar capacity will be installed in major government institutions within the next 8 to 12 months, while in the long-term projects for Gwadar, a 40-megawatt project will be installed to ensure sustainable power supply.
The meeting was informed that due to ongoing industrial and economic development, expansion of Gwadar Port, and growth in urban areas, electricity demand in Gwadar was expected to increase by 30 per cent in the coming years. The 100-megawatt solar project in Gilgit-Baltistan consists of two components: an 18-megawatt rooftop solar programme and an 82-megawatt utility scale solar project.
The rooftop and utility scale solar projects in Gilgit-Baltistan will be completed by 2027 and joint projects between the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan and the Ministry of Energy will save the government Rs1 billion annually, the meeting was told.
The meeting was further informed that the GB government would ensure timely provision of land, communications, infrastructure, and other facilities for electricity projects.
Development projects
Presiding over another meeting later, Prime Minister Shehbaz underscored that transparent and timely completion of nationally important development projects remains the government’s top priority.
He directed officials concerned to devise an across-the-board refo­­rm strategy covering all stages of development projects, from appro­val and planning to procurement and human resource deployment.
PM Shehbaz said he would personally chair a steering committee comprising federal and provincial stakeholders to oversee reforms in the development planning and execution framework.
He thanked development partners, particularly the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for their support and technical assistance in advancing reforms aimed at ensuring the timely completion of projects critical to national development.
Meeting with US doctors
PM Shehbaz also met a delegation of Pakistani-origin doctors residing in the US and instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to prepare and present a workable roadmap for investment in the country’s health sector in consultation with doctors. He asked for resolving all issues related to investment in Pakistan’s medical sector by Pakistani physicians living in the United States.
The delegation, led by Dr Samir Shafi, comprised Dr Jawad Shah, Dr Tajammul Hussain, Dr Nauman Haider, and Rana Zahid Amir.

If anything, the surge in these costs despite austerity measures — usually the withdrawal of pro-poor subsidies — job cuts and the ongoing overhaul of federal ministries and departments suggests that the problem is structural.
New finance ministry data shows that the cost of running the government jumped 13pc in the July-September quarter this year — notwithstanding the move to abolish thousands of civil service posts, which the finance minister expects will save Rs56bn annually. Meanwhile, the long-overdue pension reforms will not yield immediate results. In fact, legacy pension payments, which have spiked by 125pc in five years, will take generations and further reforms to decline.
Against this backdrop, the relentless hike in general administration costs is even harder to justify, with the state trying to cope with a severe financial crunch, mounting debt servicing and reduced development spending. The 80pc spike in civil administrative costs since the first quarter of FY22 underlines the failure to tackle the structural budgetary issues that could deliver quicker fiscal relief.
For years, the government has blamed its fiscal stress on the seventh NFC Award, insisting that higher provincial shares have squeezed its ability to finance debt servicing, defence and other obligations. A recent planning ministry report seeks to reinforce this narrative, claiming that the federal deficit has averaged around 7pc of GDP since the Award’s implementation in 2011, up from 4pc in the preceding years. To compensate for its reduced share from the divisible pool, the centre has imposed billions in development levies on petroleum products and gas, and is now attempting to fully or partially take back the financial resources it had ceded to the provinces or shift major expenditure responsibilities to them.

 

However, attributing its fiscal problems to the NFC Award is an attempt to obscure the deeper expenditure problems embedded in the federal structure. Islamabad’s fiscal challenges stem less from the NFC formula than its own inability or unwillingness to reform. Blaming the provinces for its budgetary distress will not solve the structural weaknesses driving federal finances into deficits.
With recurrent federal spending climbing, the centre needs a comprehensive and targeted reform plan that goes beyond symbolic austerity to tackle the institutional drivers of its fiscal strain. This includes right-sizing an oversized bureaucracy, shutting down ministries already devolved to the provinces, and fast-tracking the privatisation of SOEs to contain its wasteful costs. The government must also implement serious tax reforms to lift the tax-to-GDP ratio to 18-20pc instead of attempting to chip away at provincial shares. The centre is mistaken if it thinks that there is an easy way out.

The humanitarian appeals’ immediate priority is to save 87 million lives with $23bn in funding, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said. Ultimately, in 2026, the aim is to raise a total of $33bn to support 135m people through 23 country operations and six plans for refugees and migrants.
The appeal, titled ‘2026 Response Plan’ earmarks $64.9m to provide assistance to 1.9m people in Pakist­­an. The aim of the appeal, called ‘Life by Life’, is to reach 135m in 50 countries in 2026, the UN agency said.
UNOCHA noted that in 2025, 98m people received help despite funding cuts and attacks on aid workers.

Occupied Palestinian Territory gets the largest individual plan — $4.1bn for three million people

In 2026, the largest individual response plan is for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, where $4.1bn is needed to assist 3 million people who have experienced shocking levels of violence and destruction. In Sudan, the world’s largest displacement crisis, $2.9bn is needed for 20 million people. The largest regional plan is for Syria, with $2.8bn targeted for 8.6 million people.
The highly prioritised appeal follows a year in which humanitarian lifelines were strained and, in some places, snapped due to severe funding cuts. Funding for the 2025 appeal — $12bn — was the lowest in a decade, resulting in 25 million fewer people being reached compared to 2024.
Amidst this devastation, civilians endured blatant disregard for the laws of war, and more than 320 aid workers, the vast majority of them local staff, were killed. The consequences were immediate: hunger surged, health systems came under crushing strain, education collapsed, mine clearance stalled and families suffered blow after blow, with no shelter, no cash assistance and no protection services.
“This appeal sets out where we need to focus our collective energy first: life by life,” said UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher. “The Global Humanitarian Over­view 2026 is grounded in reform, evidence and efficiency. We are shifting power to local organisations, putting more money directly into the hands of those who need it, and, behind all, renewing and reimagining hu­­manitarian action with idealism, humility and hope.”

This news agency spoke to teenagers and adults around the world about the Australian ban, which comes in on Wednesday. Here are some of their reactions:
Mumbai: ‘Nothing is black or white’
At the seafront in India’s Mumbai, 19-year-old Pratigya Jena scrolls with her friends through Instagram videos of a posing influencer and a camel at a beach. Social media “should be partially banned because according to me nothing is either black or white”, the student said.
“Gen Z are very active, they are doing really well on social media. And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,” Jena said. At the same time, children watching adult content online “has a very bad effect”.
At a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia’s move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have “great benefits” in India too.
Berlin: ‘Help to detox’
In the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.
“Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,” she said of the ban.
Another teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: “I’m 15 so for me the ban would
definitely come into effect. I can’t really imagine giving it up completely.
“A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.”
Doha: ‘Really stupid’
An AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.
Razak is not in favour of a ban. “It’s really stupid, honestly,” although “there’s not really much we can do as 16-year-olds” if governments decide to act, she said.
The families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so “it’s going to be so much harder to talk to them”.
Also in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia’s were “a bit harsh” and hard to enforce.
“We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,” he said.
Lagos: ‘We were born with it’
At a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom — where phones are banned — students in uniform sit at separate desks. “I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,” Okinedo said.
Even so, “we were born with it”, the 15-year-old added. “And I don’t think it’s something I want to stop.” Her mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents “don’t have time to monitor their children all day”.
Mexico City: ‘Express yourself’
Young Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.
Without it, “I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn’t really have a good way to spend my time,” she said.
Santiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.
“Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,” said Rojas. But “there are many kidnappings that begin online” and “younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable”.
Sydney: ‘Not going to have any impact’
In Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go. “I don’t think the government really knows what they’re doing and I don’t think it’s going to have any impact on children of Australia,” said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.
But his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children “have better, more authentic relationships”. “They’ll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,” she said.

However, the HEC claimed, it had never verified Justice Jahangiri’s law degree at any stage, nor had the judge ever approached the commission for verification.
The report was filed after a bench comprising IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan directed the HEC to provide complete academic record of Justice Jahangiri in a case pertaining to his eligibility to hold judicial office.
During the hearing, the court was requested to summon the original academic record directly from Karachi University, which had cancelled the LLB degree awarded to the judge though the university decision was later suspended by the Sindh High Court.
Chief Justice Dogar obs­e­rved that the matter invo­lved a serious allegation and must be examined strictly on the basis of the record. Since the HEC is the regulatory authority for all universities in Paki­s­tan, the bench would first evaluate the commission’s report before deciding whether KU should be iss­u­­ed a notice, he remarked.
In its submission, the HEC enclosed KU’s inquiry report that revealed glaring discrepancies in the judge’s academic record. It stated that candidate ‘Tariq Mehmood’ obtained an LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968, but records showed that another student, Imtiaz Ahmed, had been enrolled under the same number in 1987, while the transcript for LLB Part-I was issued in the name of ‘Tariq Jahangiri’.
The report added the judge had also enrolled for LLB Part-I under a second enrolment number, 7124 — a violation of the university’s rules, which permit only one enrolment number for the entire duration of a degree programme.
The inquiry committee refrained from labelling the degree as ‘bogus’, but it declared the credentials invalid on account of multiple identities and conflicting enrolment records.
The KU alleged the judge “used and appeared in LLB examinations on false identities having different enrolment numbers of Karachi University in collusion with university staff”. It further stated that he had “personified different other regular/ex-regular students of Islamia College, i.e., Mohammad Naeem­uddin, son of Mohammad Moinuddin, and Imtiaz Ahmed.”
As a result, the university declared the candidate guilty of using unfair means, cancelled the result, and imposed a three-year ban, allowing him to reappear in examinations in 1992.

 

The controversy has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.

He was the saviour the country had pinned all their Olympic aspirations on when he flew to Paris last year, ultimately creating history for a nation facing a medal drought at the most spectacular sporting show on Earth.
No sooner had the Olympic champion emerged in the PNS Karsaz ground that he was greeted by the dusty Karachi winter heat and pockets of fans swarming him for selfies every two metres. He obliged, as he always has to his fans. Read: Man of the people.
Athletes abandoned their warmup to snap a photo with him, cramming into a single frame lest they miss the historic opportunity. Young women squealed in delight and adjusted their hair before posing for the camera, while older technical officials — the vanguard of Pakistan athletics well before Arshad was born — took his hand in both of theirs as they blessed him with a long life and more prosperity for the nation. One boy even pinched his kameez away from his body for Arshad to sign.
This is what the nation had been waiting for. Arshad was home.
Not home in the sense of Lahore, where he relocated from hometown Mian Channu some years prior, but home in the sense of the people he dedicated every victory to.
He was competing on home soil for the first time since his Olympic feat, and his very presence was the spectacle the people had come to behold. They had not come to see him compete; the gold medal was his even if he threw the javelin blind-folded. They had come to see him perform, to give them a trace of the magic he had produced in Paris in front of an international audience in the Stade de France.

Now, they were just inches away from the Greek mythology-like figure whose superpowers were a product of sheer raw talent, tutelage from coach Salman Butt, and a faith in Allah above all else.

“Take photos and videos, keep a digital memory of this moment, that Arshad Nadeem was here to compete and you witnessed greatness with your own eyes!” the commentator boomed over the speaker, as though he were selling tickets to a circus performance.
Sure enough, all spectators and non-officiating technical officials had pulled out their phones for an amateur shot while more than a dozen TV cameramen lined the periphery of the javelin vector.
Arshad’s first throw of 78.74m was further than the national record he set at the 2016 South Asian Games to win bronze for Pakistan, his first of many international accolades for the nation.
But he has come a long way since then. While a 90m plus throw was absent all year, the 28-year-old looked miffed with his throw, that was rumoured to be his one and only.
A second throw at 77m — still miles ahead of second place Yasir Sultan, who bagged silver behind Arshad at the Islamic Solidarity Games last month — began to agitate Arshad.
Still, the effusive praise flowed freely from the commentators’ stands. The audience cheered and crowded closer to see the action despite officials pushing them back. Schoolchildren who had skipped afternoon classes stood ready with notebook covers peeled back to a fresh page and a ballpoint pen clicked open for an autograph.
As the field continued on with their throws, Arshad debriefed on the side of the field with coach Salman Butt, gesticulating throwing technicalities. The 60-something-year-old was also giving advice to Arshad’s younger brother Aleem, who was nowhere near that standard, since Arshad orbits in a league of his own.
Homage was also paid to Yasir and the other top medal contenders as the commentary rolled on throughout the hour-long session, that had all but ended once Arshad breached the 80m mark on his third and final throw of the day.
He let out a warrior cry and pumped his fists in the air, smiling as he walked away from the run-up path after hearing 81.81m. Self-satisfaction was what he was really after.

         View this post on Instagram            

His work for the day done, Arshad was at ease. He continued to entertain requests for selfies and autographs from the dozens of multiethnic faces crammed together in Karachi for the national sporting spectacle.
“This is one of the biggest events for the youth of our country, and it’s where I began participating, as I did today; this is where I began my journey,” he said after the medal ceremony.
“There’s plenty of athletes coming out of these games that will compete for Pakistan next year at the Commonwealth Games or Asian Games, for example. The way I make Pakistan proud when I compete abroad, so will they,” he said to murmurs of “Ameen, Ameen” from the crowd.
One media personnel crouched beneath and held up a bouquet of microphones above his head to catch words of wisdom from the javelin guru.
No sooner had footage of his throws gone viral on social media that it was flooded with criticism from armchair analysts disappointed with his sub-92m throws — unbeknownst to Arshad, who explained his 80m throws anyway.
“See, athletes adjust to where they’re competing. I was a bit loose today because I didn’t want to risk injury again with a big throw, so my goal was to just win gold,” Arshad said.
He seems to have had to explain himself a lot this year. The Athletics Federation of Pakistan had interrogated coach Salman on Arshad’s “disappointing performance” at the Tokyo world championships before slapping a lifetime ban on the former, sending shockwaves across global and international news. The “improper, premature, and harmful” decision, as the Pakistan Sports Board called it, has been annulled since then.
“I’m just happy that justice has been served,” Salman said as he clasped his hands in front of him. “I’d like to now get back to the work I do.”
In an exclusive interview with Dawn, Salman spelled out the duo’s plans for 2026, which include at least three Diamond League events, the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the forthcoming, exclusive and star-studded Ultimate Championships, which carry a hefty prize pot.
Throws seen, words heard, the people only barely eased up on crowding around Arshad. They walked in his footsteps, literally and figuratively, until they followed the messiah to the promised land of international sporting glory for Pakistan.</p><small>2025-12-09 02:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0907372724021c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960063/exports-to-five-central-asian-states-contract' target='_blank'><strong>Exports to five central Asian states contract</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exports to five central Asian countries (CACs) shrank 9.59 per cent year-on-year during the first four months of the current fiscal year.
The country’s exports to the region have yet to attain their full potential. Similarly, imports from Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to Pakistan have dipped 63.59 percent despite regular high-profile visits to increase the volume of bilateral trade.
In absolute terms, the value of Pakistan’s exports to the five central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — dipped by 9.59pc to $62.545 million in July-October 2025-26 from $69.183m. Imports from the region dipped by 63.59pc to $15.795m in 4MFY26 from $43.392m. The majority of these imports came from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.
Pakistan’s trade with CACs is between $400 and $500m annually via Afghanistan. Uzbekistan has already implemented its transit trade agreement with Pakistan. Under the agreement, Uzbekistan has started importing goods under the transit agreement as well.
The exports to almost all countries posted a negative growth except Uzbekistan. Similarly, imports dropped during the first four months of the current fiscal year.
Exports to Turkmenistan stood at $0.505m in 4MFY26 from $0.663m over the corresponding months last year, showing a decline of 23.83pc. Imports from Turkmenistan rose 12.64pc to $3.92m against $3.48m over the corresponding months last year.
The export to Uzbekistan surged 51.63pc to $32.95m in 4MFY26 against $21.73m in the corresponding months last year. Imports plunged by 73.85pc to $8.49m from $32.47m.
Shipments to Kazakhstan dropped 16.72pc to $24.54m in 4MFY26 compared to $29.47m. Imports stood at $0.263m against $0.313m over the corresponding months of last year.

ISLAMABAD: With the main opposition PTI threatening to boycott parliamentary proceedings if the government continued to push it against the wall, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Monday reiterated his offer to mediate between the government and the party.
Responding to the points raised by PTI interim Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the NA speaker noted that dialogue was the only way forward.
He asked the opposition to consult on his offer and said he would also make a request to the government.
“What can be achieved by criticising the institutions. The army not only defends the borders but also fights terrorism in the country,” Mr Sadiq rema­rked. He added that while his previous efforts to resolve issu­es between the between government and the opposition had not succeeded, he was still ready to play his role.
‘En masse resignation’
Earlier speaking in the House, Barrister Gohar called for defusing tensions and warned that if would not be possible for them to sit in the House if the prevailing situation continued.
He also made it clear that the “minus-one [PTI founder Imran Khan] formula” would not work at all. The PTI leader indicated that all the party’s members would resign if there were any attempt to implement the minus-one formula.
He said the enemies of Pakistan and democracy wanted a fight between “tita­ns and gladiators”, and that the country’s enemies would benefit if a major political party and a state institution came face to face.
“It will be very unfortunate if the ongoing tensions in the country is not defused. There should be tolerance and not anarchy in politics,” he added. The PTI leader said the whole nation had been concerned since last Friday — when Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general held a press conference, wherein he launched a scathing attack on the PTI founder.
Without naming the DG ISPR, Barrister Gohar said certain press conferences were very “disappointing”.
He regretted that the PTI founder had been labelled a security threat, saying that it was unexpected.
“Press conferences are not addressed like this,” he remarked. He maintained that Imran Khan was a guarantee for the continuation of democracy and not a threat to national security.
Barrister Gohar said they had been demanding the PTI founder’s release, but a ban on meetings with him had now been placed.
“We never desire that infighting in the country starts after Pakistan’s victory against a hostile neighbour,” he said. He asked the speaker and parliament to play their roles in defusing the tensions.
Financial position
Earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the House that the government’s efforts to broaden and deepen the tax base were yielding results and the tax-to-GDP ratio had entered double digits after a long time.
“It was 8.5 per cent in 2023-24 and 10.3pc last year. We are hopeful that it will be 11pc this year,” he remarked. He added that the total tax collection last year was Rs 11.7 trillion — a 27pc year-on-year increase.
The minister continued that income tax collection increased by 28pc, sales tax by 26pc, federal excise duty by 33pc, and customs duty by 16pc. He added that revenue collection figures till November this year showed a 10.3pc increase.
The minister said sugar and cement were the first two sectors where production was being digitally monitored through artificial intelligence. He elaborated that from July to November this year, Rs7bn in additional revenues from the sugar industry and Rs10bn from the cement sector had been collected compared to the same period last year.
Mr Aurangzeb said digital monitoring would be ex­­panded to other sectors, including tobacco and beverages. “Technology is a big equaliser. It brings transparency. Technology brings a world which is no place to hide,” he said.
The NA on Monday passed ‘The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025’ and ‘The Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2025’. ‘The National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) (Amendment) Bill, 2025’ was also introduced in the House.

Separately, it wrote to the Punjab Police to trace the mobile phone numbers of the suspects, who had created the fake website and disseminated the fraudulent link.
The PSCA took action when the link, containing fraudulent pending e-challans, was sent to citizens. The link urged recipients to visit the fake website and follow the steps to pay fines.
The authority said that the website and link were not legitimate and confirmed that it was a phishing scheme.


A collage of fraudulent text messages sent to citizens, urging them to pay traffic fines.

PSCA Managing Director Ahsan Younas told Dawn that scammers use the internet for online fraud and apply various tactics to deceive citizens for financial gain.
A team of experts conducted the inquiry and found that a man in Karachi had generated “the alert message with a voice note,” Younas said.
The PSCA then launched an “awareness campaign on a large scale” on social media and alerted citizens that the authority “sends e-challan alerts from the official number 8070” only, Younas added.
It also asked citizens to be careful and verify links via the official authority’s number to avoid online fraud.
A closer look at the contents of the messages revealed the use of the word “urgent,” which the official PSCA website or messages did not use, he said, adding that the domain name of the fake website was different from the original, gop.pk.
PSCA Chief Operating Officer Mustansar Feroz said an investigation found that the mobile number used by the scammer was registered in the name of a woman with no involvement in the fraud.
He added that the suspects acquired mobile phone numbers, SIMs and CNICs of citizens from vendors, saying that this was an alarming situation.
The request submitted to the NCCIA to launch the probe also included action against the scammers for damaging the reputation of the authority, Feroz said.</p><small>2025-12-08 22:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638209-new-usefp-building-symbolises-spirit-of-collaboration-in-pak-us-educational-ties-minister' target='_blank'><strong>New USEFP building symbolises 'spirit of collaboration' in Pak-US educational ties: minister</strong></a><br><p>

Athletics at the Games began not with a traditional pistol’s pop, but with the sharp, unexpected report of a rifle cutting through the cool Monday morning at the NPT&SC.
It was an omen. This would be a day of raw, unvarnished struggle, where the starting command itself felt like a call to battle.
The dust from the inaugural men’s 5,000m had barely settled before the December sun perched mercilessly over the open field. It transformed the arena into a kiln, making the very air an opponent.
In the women’s 10,000 metres, the drama was medical: Athletes wilted, fainted and were stretchered away — vanquished not by rivals, but by the searing haze.
Wapda’s Maria Bibi, who would emerge the quickest in 44 minutes and 21 seconds ahead of Navy’s Mumtaz (47:10.11), later stated the obvious with exhausted clarity.
“The heat felt extreme during the race and that’s why the athletes fainted,” Maria told Dawn. It was a race of survival, where the medal was, as Maria put it, “a cherry on the top” of simply finishing.
Amidst this brutal theatre of attrition, a sight unfolded that turned struggle into spectacle, and pain into pure wonder: Nine-year-old Kainat from Sindh running with a rhythm that seemed borrowed from a breeze.
While finishing was a task for veterans, she moved as if she had been training for precisely nine years.
On the final lap, she found a sprint that would have contended in a much shorter race, crossed the line third, and laid down on the track. The stadium’s cheer wasn’t just for a medal; it was a roar of sheer, unadulterated fascination.
After the medal ceremony, the media scrum proved more daunting than 25 laps.
“What do I say? I don’t get it,” the bronze medalist sighed, shrugging, turning her palms upward in helplessness. Coaxed by her coach, she found her voice, slow and sure the second time.
“My name is Kainat Khalil and I compete in long distance running. This is my first time competing at nationals,” the shy nine-year old told Dawn.
Then, the truth she made her own. “This was not possible but I made it possible,” she parroted what her coach had gently said to her just seconds before.
What goes through a child’s mind during such an ordeal? “Just that I need to run. However much there is to run, I will.”
Asked if she enjoyed this masochistic craft, the doll-sized athlete nodded a vigorous “yes!” Her advice to her peers was timeless. “Work really, really hard to get what you want.”
Before the sweat had dried, her eyes were already set on the Karachi marathon and then an international stage, where she dreams of gold for Pakistan.
ARSHAD’S SOARING JAVELIN
In her staggering feat, one could see the raw, uncut diamond of a potential that follows in the wake of the nation’s established stars — a lineage that leads directly to the global podium where Pakistan’s javelin star, Arshad Nadeem, has already shown what such belief, paired with supreme talent, can achieve.
The Paris 2024 winner Arshad, according to everyone’s expectations, clinched the gold medal with a 81.81m throw on his third and final attempt.
“This is one of the biggest events for the youth of our country, and it’s where I began participating” Arshad told Dawn, “That’s how I began my journey. There’s plenty of athletes coming out of these games that will compete for Pakistan next year at the Commonwealth Games or Asian Games, for example. The way I make Pakistan proud when I compete abroad, so will they.”
Around Kainat, who had a whole future ahead of her, and Arshad who reached the pinnacle, there were other champions who painted a chorus of adult burdens.
The women’s 100m saw Olympian Faiqa Riaz reclaim her title as Pakistan’s fastest woman, screaming in delight after battling back the self-doubt that followed her Olympic debut.
Self-doubt had overtaken her confidence after she lost two major local championships following her Paris 2024 debut, she told Dawn after the race.
“I’ve just reclaimed my national games title and I’m immensely proud,” she vowed, a veteran rewriting her own narrative.
She bagged gold for Wapda in 11:70 while Khoula Umer Khan of HEC won silver in 12:03 and Army’s Tameen Khan settled for bronze in 12:10.In the men’s 100m, Samiullah of Wapda won gold with a hamstring pulled a month prior, his triumph laced with private struggle. “I had to pay for all of my medical expenses on my own,” Samiullah, who finished in a modest time of 10:30, revealed to Dawn.
Army’s Usman Ali (10.40) and Rashid Riaz (10.45) bagged silver and bronze medals, respectively.
In the 3000m steeplechase, Talha Saleem spoke of a year’s singular focus. “I took no day off for six months,” he told Dawn, his gold medal a product of monastic sacrifice.
Their stories — of injury, doubt, isolation and financial strain — formed the hard ground of elite sport.
From the shot put circle, Nabeela Riaz, dominating the national circuit for four years, threw a personal best of 12.48m to claim another gold for Army.
But she lamented, while talking to Dawn, competing only “once or twice a year” — a champion from a small town of Sarai Alamgir in Gujrat district pleading for more stages to prove her might.
The day’s action ended with the pole vault in fading light as US-based Noreen Hussain, leaping for Army and for the image of a Pakistan she loves, took gold with a leap of 2.90 metres.
“Just the opportunity to compete in Pakistan when you are from here is quite fascinating,” she told Dawn.
ARMY ON TOP
Medals were clinched across the city on Monday with Pakistan Army strengthening their position at the top of the table with 46 golds to Wapda’s 14.
Army swept all golds on offer in the taekwondo poomsae event.
The men’s gold medals were secured by Aqdasullah Qadeer and Mohammad Sarmad Waheed (Under 30 Pair), Shahbaz Gul and Ibrar-ul-Haq (Over 30 Pair), and Aqdas, Haris Deedar, and Ahmad Shahzad (Under 30 Team). Ameer Hamza added an Over 17 freestyle gold.
On the women’s side, Naila and Zeena Sheraz won the Under 30 Pair, while Mehrun Nisa and Urooj Bashir dominated the Over 30 Pair. Other winners included Zymal Naqvi (Over 17 Freestyle), and the army’s mixed pairs also took home gold medals across different categories.
In the shooting competition, Pakistan Olympian Gulfam Joseph won gold along with Kaleemullah and Azhar Abbas in the 50m Pistol team event for Army. Pakistan Navy’s Shahrukh Khan took gold in the category’s individual event.
Army’s Mehr Khaliq, Zikra Shoukat and Captain Aqsa Shabbir won the gold medal in the 10m Air Rifle team category while Mehr took the individual honours.
In rugby, Wapda claimed both the men’s and women’s gold medals defeating Army 19-0 and Punjab 15-0 respectively.
The fencing competition at NED University saw Naeem from Punjab clinch the gold medal in the men’s Sabre event. Ali Ahmed from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) took home the silver, while Shoaib of Sindh and Baryal from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shared the bronze.

According to a statement in the official Saudi press, the “high-speed electric passenger railway” would connect Riyadh and Doha. The Saudi cities of Al-Hofuf and Dammam are also expected to be on the network.
The train would reach speeds exceeding 300 kilometres per hour and the trip would take roughly two hours between the two capitals. A direct flight between the cities clocks in at around 90 minutes.
The project, set to be completed in six years, expects to serve 10 million passengers per year, the statement said.







The agreement was signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani during the latter’s visit to Riyadh.
The deal is just the latest in a series of moves marking the dramatic improvement in ties between the Gulf countries in recent years.
Saudi Arabia and its allies, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, had cut all diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017.
The four nations accused Doha of backing radical extremists and seeking closer ties with Saudi Arabia’s arch-rival Tehran — allegations that Qatar vehemently denied.
Relations were fully restored in January 2021 after a summit in the Saudi desert city of Al Ula.
Prince Mohammed visited Doha in December 2021 for the first time since the thaw in ties, as part of a regional Gulf tour.
Since then, leaders from the two monarchies have met regularly and joined forces to back diplomatic initiatives, including calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Riyadh also threw its support behind Qatar following Israeli strikes on Doha over the summer.</p><small>2025-12-08 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08213126487b1fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959951/pakistan-did-not-benefit-from-pti-project-aqeel-malik' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan did not benefit from PTI ‘project’: Aqeel Malik</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik on Monday stated that Pakistan did not benefit from the PTI “project”, arguing that it aimed to destroy the country.
In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
The PTI emphatically deplored the “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson, saying the party founder was “not a security threat” and lamented the weakening of democracy in the country following the passage of recent constitutional amendments.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the minister highlighted that during its tenure, the PTI government “ran a campaign against the country, writing to the IMF and lobbying US politicians”.
“Has the PTI taken a single beneficial step for Pakistan?” Malik asked, further questioning what development projects are underway in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the party is running the provincial administration.
“When it comes to sovereignty and national security, we (PML-N) have never compromised,” he added. “There is a night and day difference between the policies of the PTI and the PML-N.”
Malik pointed out that Imran himself claimed, when he was in power, that the army chief was akin to the “father of the nation” and that nobody could speak out against him.
“Look at what Imran Khan is saying on Twitter,” he added, referring to posts against Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“I can say that the youth have introspected and found that countries cannot progress on hollow words, hollow promises and pure popularity,” Malik added.
“I am not denying that there are questions around the 2024 general elections, but did Nawaz Sharif write any letters to the IMF? Was he involved in foreign lobbying?”
Later, PTI Chief Whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar joined the programme and was asked about allegations labeling Imran a “security threat” by senior political and military leadership.
“Who is (Information Minister) Atta Tarar to say these things about us?” Dogar replied. “He is a Form 47 politician who has only 16,000 votes, and now he’s lecturing the party of the country’s legitimate leader.”
“No power can stop Imran Khan. They cannot stop us from speaking or protesting. We have endured so much over the past three years. What more can they do to us?”
Dogar then highlighted how PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif gave interviews to Indian journalists and asked whether those would be forgotten.
In response to a question about the PTI founder being called a security threat, Dogar said, “This is unfortunate and has been going on for 75 years. Fatima Jinnah, the mother of the nation, was once declared a security risk by Ayub Khan.”
He also cited the examples of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman being deemed a security threat by Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto being declared a security threat by Ziaul Haq, stating that the country’s most popular leaders have been targeted throughout Pakistan’s history.
“Where did all these people — Yahya, Ayub Khan — go? Political figures return in some way or another, because ideas never die,” Dogar stated.
“Under this hybrid system, Pakistan’s future has been imprisoned. Read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission; the situation is similar.”
Imran’s social media ‘not under’ party’s control
When questioned about Imran’s social media accounts, Dogar noted that the account is not under the party’s control, nor is it under Imran’s.
“Even today, in a parliamentary committee meeting, we agreed that messages from Imran in jail should not be disseminated like a vlogger outside the prison gates,” he said. “The party realises that we need to do whatever we can to ensure the release of our leader and workers.”
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn, said that Dogar’s statement had been misunderstood.
“He meant that there were several young members in the social media team, but after the crackdown they left the country and are now operating their accounts on their own,” he said.
Responding to a question, he said that whenever a leader or family member meets Imran Khan, the message is written on a piece of paper and then sent abroad, after which it is tweeted as it is.
“The messages are sent directly abroad and then tweeted. They are not issued through the party’s media wing, so the media wing has nothing to do with them,” he added.</p><small>2025-12-08 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638195-cannot-rule-out-treason-case-against-pti-founder-pms-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Cannot rule out treason case against PTI founder: PM's aide</strong></a><br><p>

The JMA reported that the epicentre of the quake was registered off the coast of Aomori at a depth of 80 kilometres at 11:15pm local time (7:15pm PKT).
On Japan’s 1-7 scale of seismic intensity, the tremor registered as an “upper 6” in Aomori prefecture — a quake strong enough to make it impossible to keep standing or move without crawling.
In such tremors, most heavy furniture can collapse and wall tiles and windowpanes are damaged in many buildings.
Tsunami warnings were issued for the prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate, and tsunamis from 20 to 70 cm (7 to 27 inches) high were observed at several ports, JMA said.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK World reported that a tsunami warning had been issued 10 minutes later, urging citizens along the northeast coast to evacuate. Waves were estimated to reach a height of three metres.
There have been no reports of casualties, but NHK reported that “abnormalities at nuclear power plants and other facilities in various locations” are being examined.
No irregularities were reported at nuclear power plants in the region run by Tohoku Electric Power and Hokkaido Electric Power, the utilities said. Tohoku Electric initially said thousands of households had lost power, but later lowered that number to the hundreds.
East Japan Railway suspended some services in the area, but as of 9pm PKT, there was little information on major damage from NHK.
“There is a possibility that further powerful and stronger earthquakes could occur over the next several days,” a JMA official said at a briefing.
The yen weakened against major currencies after news of the tremor, before regaining some ground.
Japan is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries, with a tremor occurring at least every five minutes.
Located in the “Ring of Fire” of volcanoes and oceanic trenches partly encircling the Pacific Basin, Japan accounts for about 20 per cent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.
The northeastern region suffered one of the country’s deadliest earthquakes on March 11, 2011, when a 9.0-magnitude tremor struck under the ocean off the coast of the northern city of Sendai.
It was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan and set off a series of massive tsunamis that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and killed nearly 20,000 people.
The 2011 tsunami also damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world’s worst nuclear disaster for 25 years.</p><small>2025-12-08 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/082011032884172.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959946/dumper-truck-kills-motorcyclist-in-north-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Dumper truck kills motorcyclist in North Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>In another fatal incident involving a heavy vehicle, a dumper of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board carrying garbage struck and killed a motorcycle rider in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi on Monday, according to police.
New Karachi Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Saud said the deceased, Hameedur Rehman, was riding a motorcycle under the Nagan bridge when the dumper crushed him to death.
People gathered at the spot where the incident occurred, caught the dumper driver, Allah Rakha, and beat him until the police arrived. The police then took the accused into custody.
The body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
The spot did not have closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to capture the incident, the SHO said and added that the incident occurred around 11:30 am.
Eyewitnesses, present at the scene, informed the police that the motorcyclist was driving on the wrong side of the road.
Rise in heavy vehicle accidents
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumpers and water tankers. Nearly 500 people lost their lives and 4,879 were injured in 2024 in road accidents resulting from various reasons, from reckless driving to construction activities, hospital data showed.
On November 4, angered citizens set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it killed a man and injured his wife, resulting in some people opening fire on them.
On October 12, a reckless dumper driver smashed into six vehicles, including three ambulances of the Edhi Foundation, near Merewether Clock Tower, killing a man and injuring two others. The driver, who possessed a “fake” licence, was arrested.
On August 10, two siblings were killed and their father was injured when a dumper truck ran over them on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall. A mob then set seven trucks on fire, which sparked protests from transporters.
August 15 recorded two accidents involving heavy vehicles, including one where a speeding water tanker ran over and killed a four-year-old boy in Orangi Town.
In another accident, a young couple lost their lives when a fast-moving dumper truck hit their motorcycle in the Sultanabad area on M.T. Khan Road.</p><small>2025-12-08 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638167-punjab-ig-places-province-on-high-alert-directs-sweep-and-combing-operations' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab IG places province on high alert, directs sweep and combing operations</strong></a><br><p>

Addressing a ceremony at GHQ, the newly-appointed CDF emphasised the need for a formal arrangement for tri-services integration and synergy and highlighted that the armed forces have to remain aligned with new aspects of warfare, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The CDF highlighted emerging spheres in warfare, such as cyberspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, outer space, information operations, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which Pakistan needs to keep up with.

CDF Field Marshal Munir further highlighted that the multi-domain operations carried out during the brief war with India in May have now become a textbook example and case study for future warfare.
“While addressing the officers of the tri services, [the CDF] reiterated the extraordinary courage and conviction displayed by the complete Pakistani nation, particularly the professionalism of the valiant men and women of the Armed Forces of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq,” the ISPR’s statement read, adding that he paid homage to martyrs.
State broadcaster PTV News reported that according to the CDF, all three services of the armed forces would maintain their “internal autonomy and organisational structure”.
He also emphasised that multi-domain operations must be improved under the unified armed services, in light of evolving security threats.
“The establishment of the Defence Forces Headquarters is an essential step towards this change,” Field Marshal Munir stated. “Each service will maintain its individuality for its operational readiness, [while] the Defence Forces Headquarters will integrate and coordinate the operations of the services.”
The CDF then turned his attention to India and Afghanistan, saying that the former should not “fall prey to any misconception, as Pakistan’s response will be much more swift and severe”.
“A clear message has been given to the Taliban regime that they have no option but to choose between the khawarij mischief-makers or Pakistan,” he said of Kabul.
The CDF reiterated Pakistan’s stance as a peaceful nation but warned that nobody would be allowed to test Islamabad’s territorial integrity or sovereignty
“Let everyone know that the idea of Pakistan is invincible, and its protection is ensured by the firm resolve of faithful, brave soldiers and a united nation,” Field Marshal Munir stated.
According to the ISPR, in his closing remarks, the CDF envisaged the armed forces as a “culturally futuristic, combat-ready military machine that deters aggression and enjoys [the] full confidence of the nation”.







Guard of honour
Earlier today, Field Marshal Munir was presented with a guard of honour at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.
Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief of the Air Staff of Pakistan Air Force Zaheer Ahmad Babar were also present at the ceremony.
According to state-broadcaster PTV, the army chief was presented with the guard of honour by contingents from all three armed forces, in recognition of his elevation to the position of CDF.







On Friday, the army chief was notified as the country’s first CDF, in what is considered the most sweeping restructuring of the military command since the 1970s.
The new arrangement consolidates operational, administrative and strategic authority in a single office established through amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment.
The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, shall appoint the chief of the army staff, who will concurrently serve as the chief of defence forces.
The amendment also abolished the office of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), dismantling the tri-service coordination system in place since 1976 and transferring joint command integration to the CDF.
To translate the constitutional overhaul into the military’s legal framework, the government amended the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) of 1952 in the wake of the 27th Amendment.
Sub-section (i) of PAA’s Article 8A now states that “for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces […], the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
It explains that upon the issuance of the notification for the first COAS-plus-CDF, the “existing tenure of the incumbent chief of the army staff shall be deemed to have recommenced from the date of such notification”.
Under sub-section (iii) of Article 8A, the “terms and conditions” of the COAS concurrently with the CDF shall be determined by the president on the prime minister’s advice.
Field Marshal Munir was appointed army chief on Nov 29, 2022, becoming the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government brought changes to the PAA, extending the tenure for all three services chiefs from three to five years, keeping the CJCSC’s tenure unchanged at three years. The same amendments allowed the services chiefs to be reappointed and/or their tenures to be extended for up to five years, instead of up to three years.
Therefore, in line with the restructuring under the 27th Amendment, the recent PAA changes allow the president, on the prime minister’s advice, to reappoint the COAS-plus-CDF for another five years, or extend his tenure by up to five years, creating legal space for him to retain his position till December 2035.</p><small>2025-12-08 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08135205a1c3200.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959918/indonesian-president-subianto-arrives-in-islamabad-on-2-day-maiden-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesian President Subianto arrives in Islamabad on 2-day maiden visit</strong></a><br><p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto arrived in Islamabad on Monday on a two-day official visit at the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
According to state broadcaster PTV News, the Indonesian president was received by PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari upon his arrival at the Nur Khan airbase.







In a post on X, the PM wrote that he was honoured to host the Indonesian president and noted that Islamabad and Jakarta “are bound together by a shared history, deep cultural affinity and a friendship rooted in mutual respect and solidarity“.
“Looking forward to our meaningful engagements tomorrow as we work to further strengthen this enduring partnership,” he added.







According to PTV News, children dressed in traditional attire presented flowers to Subianto upon his arrival.
“On this occasion, the Indonesian president exchanged pleasantries with the president … and the prime minister,” the broadcaster reported. “Children holding the flags of both countries extended a warm welcome to the esteemed guests. The Indonesian president was also given a 21-gun salute.”
Earlier, state-run Radio Pakistan reported that Subianto will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising key ministers and senior officials.
Yesterday, the Foreign Office (FO) said the Indonesian leader would be in Pakistan from December 8-9 to discuss a “wide-ranging agenda” with Pakistani leaders aimed at strengthening bilateral ties and “exploring new avenues of cooperation”.
According to the FO, this is the president’s first visit to Pakistan, as the last presidential visit was by ex-president Joko Widodo in 2018.
The FO also said that the visit carried added significance as it coincided with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
The statement said that during his stay, President Prabowo will hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz and meet President Asif Ali Zardari. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on Prabowo, it added.
Talks are expected to cover advancing bilateral cooperation in “trade, investment, defence, health, IT, climate, education and culture, as well as enhancing collaboration at regional and global levels”. The statement also said that several memoranda of understanding are expected to be signed during the visit.
Pakistan and Indonesia maintain strong bilateral relations rooted in shared religion and culture, with both countries cooperating in trade, education, and health.
In July, Indonesia’s Defence Minister Lt Gen (retired) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin met with Shehbaz in Islamabad, where he expressed his country’s desire to boost defence ties with Pakistan and explore areas for possible collaboration, particularly in defence production.
In June, the two countries decided to increase cooperation in areas such as vaccine production in Pakistan, the establishment of medical institutions in Indonesia, pharmaceutical development and human resource exchange.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08145937ea6ce36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959934/amid-criticism-over-delay-in-opposition-leaders-appointment-na-secretariat-seeks-details-of-pti-leader-omar-ayubs-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Amid criticism over delay in opposition leader’s appointment, NA Secretariat seeks details of PTI leader Omar Ayub’s cases</strong></a><br><p>Amid mounting criticism over the delay in the opposition leader’s appointment, the National Assembly (NA) Secretariat has sent a letter to PTI Chief Whip Malik Aamir Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning PTI’s Omar Ayub.
The letter says that the provision of the details in writing is necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.
Ayub, who had been the opposition leader in the Senate until his disqualification in August by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with his conviction in the May 9 cases, had challenged his de-seating by the electoral body in the Supreme Court.
The PTI had nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai for the role following Ayub’s disqualification, but his notification remains pending.
And while NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq has maintained regarding the delay in the appointment of a new opposition leader for the house that the matter is “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against it disqualification — the PTI leader has withdrawn his plea from the SC.
The letter written to Dogar, which is dated December 5, stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.







“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638153-7-year-old-dies-in-south-waziristan-due-to-lack-of-facilities-in-govt-hospital' target='_blank'><strong>7-year-old dies in South Waziristan due to 'lack of facilities' in govt hospital</strong></a><br><p>

Informed sources told Dawn that in the petition, Bugti cited the precarious law and order situation in the provincial capital and the suspension of internet services as the reasons for postponing the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) elections.
He also said people have migrated due to winters, affecting voter participation.
Earlier, the Balochistan government had requested the election commission to postpone the polls, citing similar reasons stated in today’s petition. The request was turned down.
In other districts of Balochistan, local government elections were held three years ago, and the current bodies’ term would expire in nine months, the sources said.
It is worth noting that the ECP completed all preparations for holding local body elections in Quetta, and the printing of ballot papers was currently underway.
On October 6, a bench of the Balochistan High Court (BHC) rejected constitutional petitions filed by numerous individuals regarding the postponement of the elections and directed the election commissioner of Balochistan to hold the local government elections as soon as possible.
In view of the BHC orders, the election commission had started preparation for holding elections in Quetta and announced the schedule for it on November 13.
Elections would be held in 172 union councils and 641 wards of the city, with 2,710 candidates contesting the elections in Quetta district.
The previous local bodies, elected in 2015, completed their tenure on January 27, 2019. Under the Elections Act 2017, local body elections should be held within 120 days after the expiry of the term. However, the polls were held in May 2022, more than three years after the expiry of the previous term.
The delay primarily resulted from a lack of consensus among political parties over proposed amendments to the Balochistan Local Government Act (BLGA), 2010, and issues concerning the delimitation of constituencies.
The LG elections in two major districts with sizeable urban populations in the province, Quetta and Lasbela, were delayed because of issues with the delimitation of wards. While the LG elections in Lasbela were held at the end of 2022, the elections in Quetta could not be held due to pending litigation in the BHC over the delimitation of wards in the district.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08152303633d949.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959936/punjab-transporters-call-off-wheel-jam-strike-after-talks-with-provincial-govt-acceptance-of-demands' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab transporters call off wheel-jam strike after talks with provincial govt, ‘acceptance of demands’</strong></a><br><p>Transporters called off a Punjab-wide strike on Monday after talks with the provincial government representatives, with one of the participants included in the negotiations confirming to Dawn that authorities had largely agreed to transporters’ demands.
The call for the strike today, which was also observed in Islamabad, was given by transporters’ bodies primarily in protest against a new traffic ordinance that significantly increased traffic fines.
To discuss the matter, talks were held between representatives from the Punjab government, who were led by the provincial transport minister, Bilal Akbar, and a delegation of the Mutahidda Transporters’ Association’s action committee.
After the meeting, action committee member Lala Yasir told Dawn that the transporters called off the strike after the government accepted their demands.
He said that apart from the revision of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, the transporters also demanded an end to the registration of first information reports against drivers and owners of heavy vehicles over even minor violations of traffic laws.
According to Yasir, the government agreed that no cases would be registered against or huge fines would be imposed on drivers and vehicle owners.
Moreover, he said, the government also agreed to form committees to  review and discuss the ordinance with transporters’ representatives, and subsequently make changes to the new law in light of recommendations by the representatives of transporter associations.
A meeting between the two sides has been scheduled for tomorrow as well, he said.
Earlier, Muttahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairperson Raja Muhammad Riaz told Dawn that while negotiations were under way, “the government is not interested in resolving the matter and even attempted to divide the [transporters’] association”.
Partial suspension of public transport in twin cities
In Islamabad and Rawalpindi, operations of public transport remained partially suspended earlier today as transporters observed a wheel-jam strike.
At the day’s start, lesser than usual traffic was seen on the roads in the twins cities following the call for the strike. There were also reports of school van owners joining the strike and passengers facing difficulties at main bus stands.
Pirwadhai General Bus Stand, one of the main bus terminals in Rawalpindi, also saw less than usual activity and vehicles for inter-provincial travel were seen lining the bus bays.
While public transport on main roads largely remained suspended, Qingqi rickshaws, small vans and small loading vehicles were operating in Rawalpindi’s commercial areas, including Raja Bazaar, and link roads.
The Goods Transport Association had also joined the strike, but Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi claimed while speaking to Dawn that goods-carrying vehicles remained operational “despite threats from associations”.
The official said the government “will facilitate the vehicles that will remain on roads”.
On the other hand, there were reports of the supply of food and essential items getting affected due to the suspension of goods transport at Grand Trunk Road — a major north-south artery that traverses the country.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638124-think-about-democracy-gohar-dismisses-minus-imran-notion' target='_blank'><strong>'Think about democracy': Gohar dismisses 'minus-Imran' notion</strong></a><br><p>

It was not lost on the 28-year-old that the crowd of a few hundred was delighted by his very presence at the PNS Karsaz ground, his throws the cherry on the top as they got to see an Olympic champion in action before their very own eyes.
A robust lineup of track and field events crescendoed with the start of the men’s javelin, headlined by Arshad. A dozen cameramen lined the javelin sector’s periphery to get the perfect shot of Arshad in action as the heat bore down on the synthetic rubber track, the sun climbing higher in the sky to signal the advent of afternoon.
The track reverberated with the soft thud of spikes and echoes of the commentators’ effusive praise for Pakistan’s sporting hero ahead of his first throw of 78.74m that, unsurprisingly, guaranteed him the lead.
“Yeh din Arshad ka hai (this day belongs to Arshad) because he’s the Olympic record holder, and we’re honoured to have him here,” the commentators said.
Praise and appreciation were meted out in equal measure for Yasir Sultan, silver medallist at the Islamic Solidarity Games last month and the closest athlete to potentially challenge Arshad for first place.
“Make videos, take photos, keep a digital memory of this moment — that Arshad Nadeem was here to compete and you witnessed greatness with your own eyes!” the commentator’s voice boomed through the speakers.
The injury-prone athlete was speculated to throw just once, but a sense of disappointment and a thirst for satisfaction was written on his face after two throws in the late 70s.
He wanted to breach the 80m mark — hardly a feat for him when his personal best stands at 92.97m — and he willed it into existence with his third and final throw of 81.81m as he pumped his fists in the air and a smile spread across his face.
Yasir’s lone throw of 70m was enough to secure silver and give Wapda a top-two podium finish as he avoided aggravating an injury, while Army’s Abrar Ali won bronze with a 67.68m throw.
Finishing in sixth place was Arshad’s younger brother Aleem, not quite the replica of the family jewel but perhaps a work in progress to reach that level of sporting excellence.
Arshad’s coach Salman Butt was giving him advice in between throws before pivoting back to Arshad with technical advice and motivation.
Arshad was showered with well-wishes and selfies and handshakes from the end of the event till the medal ceremony.
The international superstar looked just as pleased with the local stardom he radiates everywhere he goes, his very presence at an event marking it as historic.
“If this event were happening in any other South Asian country, people would be leaning out the windows to get a glimpse of his throw,” one of the commentators said.
“We’re thankful that the Olympic record holder is here competing among the younger players and inspiring the next generation. This day will be remembered for ages to come.”</p><small>2025-12-08 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638077-indonesian-president-subianto-arrives-in-islamabad-on-two-day-maiden-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesian President Subianto arrives in Islamabad on two-day maiden visit</strong></a><br><p>
