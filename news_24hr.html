PPP lawmakers from AJK had also met party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and President Asif Ali Zardari yesterday to mull options for the removal of the incumbent PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq.
Today’s development has made the PPP the single largest party in the AJK Legislative Assembly.
In the 53-member assembly, the PPP now enjoys the support of 27 members, followed by the PML-N with nine, PTI with five, and two regional parties with one member each. The group of PTI renegades led by Haq has been reduced to ten members.
This has significantly increased the likelihood of the PPP becoming the ruling party.
“Yes, we are now in a comfortable position to send the incumbent Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq packing and replace him with a new leader of the house from our ranks,” PPP lawmaker Chaudhry Qasim Majeed told Dawn.com by telephone.
He confirmed that by Sunday evening, ten PTI legislators had joined the PPP in joint and separate meetings with Faryal Talpur at the Zardari House in Islamabad.
Among them were five lawmakers from the camp of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood — including his son Yasir Sultan, brother-in-law Chaudhry Arshad, Chaudhry Akhlaque from the Mirpur division, Chaudhry Muhammad Rasheed from the Muzaffarabad division, and Sardar Muhammad Hussain from the Poonch division.
According to senior PPP leader Azhar Iqbal Baralvi, Sabiha Siddique, a female member of the president’s camp, did not immediately join the party due to reservations over the possible nomination of Haq’s successor.
Later, Zafar Iqbal Malik from Kotli also joined the PPP separately. Following in their footsteps, Abdul Majid Khan, Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim, and Asim Sharif Butt from the refugee constituencies, as well as Sardar Faheem Rabbani from Poonch division, met Talpur jointly to announce their inclusion in the PPP.
All ten of these legislators are part of Haq’s cabinet. Among them, only the three refugee legislators had earlier announced their resignations from the cabinet, though no official notification regarding their resignation had been issued.
PPP’s regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin was not present at any of these meetings with Talpur.
Majeed said the PPP parliamentary party held two meetings on Saturday — the first with Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, where it was unanimously decided to oust Mr Haq. Later, the team met with President Asif Ali Zardari to inform him of their decision.
Majeed claimed that more legislators were likely to join the PPP within the next two to three days.
Meanwhile, the PML-N has announced that it will sit on the opposition benches.
“We will not be part of the government formation process and will sit on the opposition benches,” said party’s regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir.
Majeed also confirmed that President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif were in contact regarding the ongoing political developments.
However, he said he was unaware of who would succeed Haq as the prime minister. “This decision rests with President Zardari and the party chairman,” he added.
Separately, Chaudhry Azhar Sadiq, Works and Communications Minister and a close confidant of PM Haq, said the prime minister had no plans to dissolve the assembly.
“Although the Constitution empowers him to do so, he will not take that step,” he told Dawn.com. “He [Haq] has consistently maintained that if his opponents gather 27 lawmakers, he will step down. If they have the required numbers, they can move the no-confidence motion — we will face it.”
However, Sadiq added, “There are many a slip between the cup and the lip.”
All PPP members were scheduled to gather at the President’s House on Sunday night to demonstrate their strength.</p><small>2025-10-26 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26205211051d67c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951382/azma-bokhari-dismisses-propaganda-about-restriction-on-inter-provincial-movement-of-wheat' target='_blank'><strong>Azma Bokhari dismisses ‘propaganda’ about restriction on inter-provincial movement of wheat</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari maintained on Sunday that there was no ban on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, terming the “ongoing propaganda in this regard baseless and contrary to facts”.
Her statement, carried by state-run APP, comes after the Punjab government faced criticism by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh governments for allegedly choking wheat flow to the two provinces.
In a letter dated October 23, the KP government asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province.
Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed.
Rejecting these “claims”, Bokhari clarified that the inter-provincial transportation of flour was “continuing transparently through official permits, ensuring a clear and traceable record of all consignments being transported out of the province”, the statement carried by APP said.
Criticising the KP government, she said that “if the province’s flour demand has exceeded its production capacity, the provincial government should release its own stored wheat or procure it” from the Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Services Corporation (Passco).
“Punjab cannot compromise the right of its people to affordable flour for the sake of another [party’s] political theatrics,” she said.
The minister claimed that over 200 flour mills in KP were currently non-operational and said the province’s chief executive should “focus on reviving these mills instead of staging protests outside Adiala Jail” — an apparent jibe at KP CM Sohail Afridi, who had staged a sit-in outside the prison after he was not allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
In May this year, the federal food minister had informed the National Assembly that the Passco was being abolished. The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy, but procurement modalities remain contested.
It was also said under the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat.
Reiterating in her statement that there was “no ban” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat or flour, she said under Article 18 of the Constitution and relevant laws, permits and digital monitoring had been made mandatory to prevent hoarding and profiteering.
The minister further said that the welfare of the people of Punjab remained her government’s top priority and  “the availability and affordability of flour for every citizen have been fully ensured”.
“This pro-people style of governance is what some elements find hard to digest,” she claimed.
Bokhari added that the Punjab government was “utilising taxpayer’s money to provide subsidised wheat to ensure public relief and avert any potential crisis during the dry months”.
“Punjab currently possesses 0.885 million metric tons of wheat reserves, valued at around Rs100 billion. This reflects the farsighted and organised policies of [Punjab] Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.”
Bokhari further stated that flour mills were being supplied wheat at Rs 3,000 per maund (40 kilogrammes) to “maintain steady availability and price stability in the market”.
Wheat restrictions
In the aftermath of floods, the Punjab government began tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage.
The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from politicians and flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement.
While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. Critics, however, argued that these mea­sures are against the spirit of a deregulated market.
In the KP govt’s Oct 23 letter, the province’s food department had said that the inter-provincial wheat restrictions were “inconsistent” with Article 151(1) of the Constitution, which guarantees “freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country”.
“Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, being a wheat-deficient province, heavily relies on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its daily wheat requirement of approximately 14,500 metric tonnes,” the letter read.
“The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,“ it added.</p><small>2025-10-26 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/262049377d7e91b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951381/multan-sultans-saga-a-test-case-for-pcb-chairman-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Multan Sultans saga a test case for PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>There is no precedent for it. But, there is never really a precedent for any development in Pakistan cricket.
The happenings of Pakistan cricket outsmart one’s wildest fantasies and the current controversy that the country’s cricketing landscape sees itself embroiled in is one such.
Since it has emerged that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) served a legal notice to Ali Tareen for the breach of the franchise agreement last month, the conflict between the two has played out publicly.
While Tareen, the owner of Multan Sultans, has doubled down his criticism on the social media, the board has dropped subtle hints on the path it plans to venture.
 






Sunday brought more developments as Tareen accused the PSL management for leaking the legal notice to “their favoured media”.
“For the record, we received the legal notice on 12th Sept,” the post said. “Our legal team sent them a detailed reply.
Since then, we had chosen to stay silent and not make the issue public. Because nothing could be more damaging to the league than this.
“But then, the PSL management decided to leak parts of the notice to their favoured media last week.
Perhaps they mistook our restraint for weakness. And one torn notice later, we are where we are. Lets (sic) see where it all ends up.”
An hour later, the PCB, in an update about the meeting between Mohsin Naqvi, its chairperson, and Ernst&Young, the independent audit firm hired for the valuation of the six franchises and the PSL’s brand value, reiterated that it would extend the franchise renewal offer to only those franchisees who have been in compliance with the franchise agreement.
 






Sources tell Dawn that Tareen has sought intervention of politicians and fellow franchisees to mediate with the PCB.
Tareen has been directing his criticism towards PCB in the lead-up to this year’s PSL. He, primarily, reiterated complaints of the ordinary fans by highlighting the substandard fan experience in stadia around the country and criticised the board for the lack of innovation in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), which he claimed resulted in the decline of the league.
He blamed the board for being content with “mediocrity” and questioned the credentials and ability of the PCB staffers.
With the PCB’s contracts with the six PSL franchisees, title and other sponsors, and broadcast right holders lapsing this year, Tareen’s frequent criticism of the league worried the PCB about its implications.
The PCB suspected that Tareen desired to sabotage the league to adversely affect the valuation process and bring down the market value of his franchise — which the board has stated in its legal notice to Tareen.
 






The board officials also lamented that rather than contributing in the PSL governing council meetings during which Multan Sultans owner and representatives remained silent, Tareen resorted to attack the decisions on the social media – again, something that the PCB wrote in its notice.
Tareen took over as the sole owner of Multan Sultans late 2023 after the passing of his uncle, Alamgir Tareen.
He and his uncle had bid USD6.3million — almost the double of the reserve price set by the PCB — for the team in 2019 after the PCB had terminated the franchise agreement with Schon Properties Broker LLC for their failure to meet the financial obligations. (PCB has pegged dollar at PKR170 for the annual franchise fee).
The PCB contemplated sending a legal notice to Tareen during this year’s tournament — which it also mentioned in the notice — but refrained from doing so, fearing it may harm the league’s image.
Tareen responded to the legal notice on 2 October, but the chances of a reconciliation seem bleak after he ripped the PCB’s legal notice on camera.
His act has publicly challenged PCB’s stature as the game’s governing body in the country and pushed its chief into a corner. There are many within and outside the country who are anticipating the response.
Naqvi is embroiled in a conflict with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the Asia Cup silverware matter.
The matter will rear its head once again next month when cricket chiefs gather for an International Cricket Council (ICC) conclave.
The BCCI will be keen to observe how Naqvi responds to the pressure publicly exerted by one of the PSL franchise owners back home and the outcome of this saga will provide a template on how far they can stretch Naqvi.
Similarly, it will also lay marker for other franchisees and stakeholders of the game within Pakistan.
It is unprecedented for an owner of a PSL team to launch searing diatribes against the PCB. And, the outcome of this stand-off will go on to lengthen the list of unprecedented developments in Pakistan cricket.</p><small>2025-10-26 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26195755bf31813.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951342/trump-oversees-trade-deal-flurry-on-first-asian-stop' target='_blank'><strong>Trump oversees trade deal flurry on first Asian stop</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump hit the ground running on the first leg of his Asian tour on Sunday, announcing a slew of trade agreements in Malaysia.
Within six hours of landing in Kuala Lumpur for the summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Trump announced trade deals with four countries, met regional leaders and held talks with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who said their teams would immediately start tariff discussions.
Trump also said he was confident of hammering out a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of an expected meeting on Thursday, as top trade officials from both sides met for a second day in Kuala Lumpur and agreed on a framework for a trade agreement.
Talks to de-escalate trade war
On arriving in Malaysia, Trump was greeted by Malaysia’s premier and a troupe of ceremonial dancers, stopping briefly on the red carpet to dance with performers.

As he mingled with other leaders, US and Chinese negotiators met on the sidelines to avert further escalations in a trade war between the world’s two largest economies.
US negotiators said the meeting had built a “successful framework” ahead of expected talks between Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi, in South Korea.
“I think we’re going to have a deal with China,” Trump told reporters, while Beijing’s top trade negotiator Li Chenggang said a preliminary consensus had been reached after “very intense consultations”.
Both sides are looking to avert an escalation of their trade war after Trump threatened new 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods and other trade curbs starting on November 1, in retaliation for China’s expanded export controls on rare earths.
Within hours of landing in Malaysia, Trump and the White House had announced six trade agreements with four countries, some unexpected, including deals involving critical minerals with Thailand and Malaysia, amid competing efforts from Beijing in the rapidly growing sector.
Malaysia agreed to refrain from banning or imposing quotas on exports to the United States of critical minerals or rare earth elements, the countries said. They did not specify whether Malaysia’s pledge applied to raw or processed rare earths.
Trump also announced detailed frameworks towards wider trade deals with Cambodia and Thailand, while the White House said an agreement had been reached with Vietnam to allow exporters in both countries “unprecedented” access to each other’s markets.
‘United States is with you 100pc’
The US would maintain a tariff rate of 19pc on most exports from Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia, while a 20pc rate on Vietnam will also be retained, the White House said. In all the agreements, those tariffs could be eliminated on certain products.
Addressing leaders of one of the regions hardest hit by tariffs, Trump said: “Our message to the nations of Southeast Asia is that the United States is with you 100pc and we intend to be a strong partner for many generations.”
Brazil’s Lula will aim to lower 50pc tariffs imposed by Washington on Brazilian goods amid simmering trade tensions. In a post on X, after meeting with Trum,p he said teams from both countries “will meet immediately to advance the search for solutions”.
 






Speaking alongside Lula, Trump expressed confidence in making “some pretty good deals for both countries”.
A meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was not on the cards after talks between the neighbours came to an abrupt end. Trump said on Saturday he was increasing tariffs on Canada by an additional 10pc “above what they’re paying now”.
East Timor, ASEAN’s newest member
Asia’s youngest nation, East Timor, became the 11th member of the ASEAN bloc on Sunday after a 14-year wait, a landmark for a former Portuguese colony that won full independence in 2002 following an at-times bloody quarter-century occupation by neighbour Indonesia.
Also known as Timor-Leste, the country of 1.4 million people is among Asia’s poorest and hopes to see gains from integrating its fledgling economy, which at about $2 billion represents only a tiny fraction of ASEAN’s collective $3.8 trillion GDP.
“This is not only a dream realised, but a powerful affirmation of our journey,” its Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao said.</p><small>2025-10-26 15:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/261856501db81ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951373/kp-cm-afridi-vows-to-strengthen-police-to-restore-peace-in-province' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi vows to strengthen police to restore peace in province</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday vowed to strengthen the police and provide them with modern equipment to restore peace in the province.
The remarks come a week after the newly elected CM blamed the “flawed policy” of the federal government for the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province.
Addressing a rally in KP’s Karak district today, he said, “We are investing in efforts to increase our police capacity and provide them with modern equipment,” promising to strengthen counter-terrorism efforts in the province.
 






“My purpose is to bring peace to KP in line with the vision of Imran Khan,” he said, announcing plans to invest in establishing a “special branch to enhance intelligence” in the province.
He detailed that the KP government had “ordered 70 bulletproof cars for police, out of which they had received 40 so far.”
Two days ago, CM Afridi signed the summary for the purchase of the vehicles after a row with the Centre over allegedly faulty vehicles.
A statement issued by the CM Office said Afridi had signed the summary for the purchase four armoured personnel carriers, 39 single-cabin, 34 double-cabin pick-ups, 15 pick-ups, two Revo pick-up trucks and seven other vehicles.
It quoted the CM as saying that the provision of bulletproof vehicles at a cost of Rs1.89 billion was already under way.
‘Centre building a narrative’
At the rally today, the newly-elected CM assailed the federal government for “meting out stepmotherly treatment to KP”.
“KP has been left behind because of it,” he remarked.
He said that during the merger of districts comprising erstwhile Fata into KP, the people of the region were promised Rs100 billion. But, “they never received it”, he claimed.
On the matter of the National Finance Commission (NFC), the KP CM expressed disappointment that an NFC meeting still had not been called and vowed to bring up the matter of KP’s share post-Fata merger at the session.
At a rally in Khyber yesterday, CM KP made similar remarks, claiming that the federal government owed the province Rs550 billion, and called for immediate reconvention of the NFC meeting.
CM Afridi further alleged today that the Centre was “building a narrative” against him, owing to my middle-class and tribal area background“.
“Top ministers have made accusations against me,” he said, reiterating that he was “a soldier of Imran Khan,” and had not said anything unpleasant in return.
He recalled that “when I went to Adiala jail to meet Imran Khan, I received a call from the prime minister, who congratulated me and I requested him to arrange a meeting with Khan … to which he said I will ask and then tell.”
“Who is he going to ask exactly?” the CM questioned.
On the matter of KP’s natural resources, the chief minister said he stood with the people of KP, stressing that “only the people of KP have a right to decide where their resources should go”.</p><small>2025-10-26 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/261911193fc09dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951364/pm-shehbaz-announces-reopening-of-new-gas-connections-to-domestic-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz announces reopening of new gas connections to domestic consumers</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Sunday the reopening of new gas connections after a ban of nearly four years, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported.
His announcement comes less than two months after the federal cabinet decided in September to lift the ban on domestic gas connections and supply regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG).
Speaking about the cabinet’s decision in a post-meeting press conference, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, flanked by Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik, had said PM Shehbaz decided to lift the ban on new gas connections imposed in 2021, addressing a longstanding public demand.
Addressing a ceremony related to the resumption of RLNG connections in Islamabad today, the premier reiterated that the government’s decision was in response to the “long-standing public demand”.
“In 2022, there was immense public pressure for [new] gas connections but the government was facing challenges,” Radio Pakistan quoted him as saying.
But, “with this landmark decision, the public will now be able to access affordable and quality fuel,” he added.
“Now, RLNG will be supplied throughout the country to a large number of applicants,” a report by state-run APP quoted him as saying.
According to the reports, a video message by Malik was also played during today’s ceremony, in which the petroleum minister said the government was committed to providing maximum facilities to the public.
He added that the Sui Northern Gas Company had brought down its line losses to 4.93 per cent while earning a profit of Rs29 billion in the previous fiscal year.</p><small>2025-10-26 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/261637051b03c7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951363/undefeated-pakistan-crush-china-to-make-volleyball-semis-at-asian-youth-games' target='_blank'><strong>Undefeated Pakistan crush China to make volleyball semis at Asian Youth Games</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan extended their winning streak to advance to the semi-finals of the boys volleyball event after defeating China in straight sets in the quarter-finals at the Asian Youth Games on Sunday.

Pakistan had earlier opened their campaign with a straight-sets victory over Mongolia before defeating hosts Bahrain 3-0 in their Group ‘A’ match. Pakistan then downed Uzebikstan in similar fashion on Thursday in their first Group ‘E’ match of the 1-8 Classification Round.
The team then defeated Saudi Arabia 3-1 on Friday to move top of the group, winning with scores of 25-16, 25-21, 23-25, 26-24. Khizar Hayat, Mohammad Yahya and Mohammad Anas were among the standout performers of the day.
 
 

Pakistan will now play the semi finals on October 27 (Monday) at 9pm local time (11pm PKT).
Pakistan sent a 53-member contingent for the ongoing games being held from Oct 22 to 31, bagging its first medal with a bronze in the boys kabaddi event.
In a post on social media, the Pakistan Volleyball Federation said the “proud achievement” was made possible by Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) Director General Muhammad Yasir Pirzada, “who organised the national training camp for the team’s preparation for this prestigious event.”

He made these remarks during a press briefing on Saturday, during which he was asked whether India had raised any concerns about the “stronger relationship” between the US and Pakistan.
“They really haven’t — I mean, we know they’re concerned for obvious reasons because of the tensions that have existed between Pakistan and India historically.  But, I think they have to understand, we have to have relations with a lot of different countries,” he said, according to a transcript of the briefing on the State Department’s website.
He continued, “We see an opportunity to expand our strategic relationship with Pakistan, and I think we’ve made — that’s our job, is to try to figure out how many countries we can find how we can work with on things of common interest.
“So, I think the Indians are very mature when it comes to diplomacy and things of that nature.  Look, they have some relationships with countries that we don’t have relationships with.  So, it’s part of a mature, pragmatic foreign policy.  I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India, which is deep, historic, and important.”
Rubio was also asked whether the recent improvement in ties between the US and Pakistan was based on Islamabad’s “recognition of the US role and President [Donald Trump’s] role in resolving and in avoiding potential war between India and Pakistan?”
“What do you think was the turning point?” a reporter asked him, according to the transcript on the State Department’s website.
To that, Rubio began his response with, “I think they appreciated.”
He then went on to say that “anytime you work with someone, you get to know them and you interact with them, and so I do think there was some sense of happiness about it.  But even before that conflict had started, I had already reached out to them and said look, we are interested in rebuilding an alliance, a strategic partnership with you.  We think there are things we can work together with them on”.
The secretary of state reiterated that the US was “fully aware of the challenges with regards to India and everything else, but our job is to try to create opportunities for partnerships with countries where it’s possible.  And we’ve had a long history of partnering with Pakistan on counterterror and things of that nature.  We’d like to expand it beyond that, if possible, understanding that there’ll be some difficulties and some challenges”.
“But I think it’s a very encouraging thing that that relationship has strengthened the way that it has, and I don’t think it comes at the expense, or instead of a good relationship with India, or anybody else for that matter,” he added.
Earlier this month, a Dawn report highlighted that Pakistan was entering a new phase in its economic and strategic partnership with the US, as the two allies move closer to implementing a deal for the export of rare earth minerals.
The improvement in ties and newfound partnership between the two sides was particularly seen after Pakistan acknowledged US President Donald Trump’s role in resolving a four-day escalation between nuclear powers Islamabad and New Delhi.
Following the development, Pakistan’s chief of army staff, Field Marshal Asim Munir, had gone to Washington on a five-day official visit in June. During the visit, he had met with President Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
During a subsequent visit to the US in August, Field Marshal Munir had termed his second trip to the US in a span of just a month and a half a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad.
In September, he accompanied Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session in August, during which regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters, were discussed.
Meanwhile, Trump has thanked both PM Shehbaz and “my favourite” Field Marshal Munir for their efforts in securing the ceasefire deal in Gaza.
Earlier today, he called PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir “great people” while stating that he would get the recent conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan “solved very quickly”.
Separately, American metals company US Strategic Metals (USSM) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country. It rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation, includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
In a statement, USSM described the delivery as “a milestone in the Pakistan–US strategic partnership,” noting that the MoU “establishes a roadmap for cooperation across the entire mineral value chain — from exploration and processing to the establishment of refineries inside Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-10-26 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26171453453b1cf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951365/security-forces-kill-25-terrorists-in-two-separate-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 25 terrorists in two separate KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, the military’s media wing said on Sunday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on 24-25 October 2025, security forces detected movements of two large groups of khwarij attempting to infiltrate Pakistan from Afghanistan near Ghaki in Kurram District and Spinwam in North Waziristan District.
“Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij, including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said.
It added that another ten infiltrating khwarij were killed in Ghaki, Kurram District, and a large cache of weapons, ammunition, and explosives was recovered from the slain militants.
Fitna al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement added that despite successfully thwarting the infiltration attempt, five soldiers sacrificed their lives during the intense firefights.
The fallen included Havildar Manzoor Hussain (35, District Ghizar), Sepoy Nauman Ilyas Kiyani (23, District Poonch), Sepoy Muhammad Adil (24, District Kasur), Sepoy Shah Jehan (25, District Vehari), and Sepoy Ali Asghar (25, District Pak Pattan), who embraced martyrdom while fighting gallantly.
“It is significant to point out that these infiltration attempts by Fitna al Khwarij are being carried out at a time when delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye; casting doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan Government with regards to addressing the issue of terrorism emanating from its soil,” the statement said.
It added that Pakistan had consistently been asking the Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations of the Doha Agreement and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij against Pakistan.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it said.
Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country, it said.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Last week, security forces neutralised 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP.</p><small>2025-10-26 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630593-25-terrorists-killed-in-cross-border-infiltration-bids-amid-pak-afghan-talks' target='_blank'><strong>25 terrorists killed in cross-border infiltration bids amid Pak-Afghan talks</strong></a><br><p>

The meetings underlined Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen ties with both the United Kingdom and the United States.
Relations with the UK have been revitalised through the resumption of flight operations after a five-year gap and initiatives like the newly inaugurated Centre of Excellence in Islamabad, a joint project enhancing Pakistan’s capacity to tackle transnational crime and streamline mutual legal assistance and extradition processes. At the same time, engagement with the US reflects growing collaboration on security and counterterrorism.
According to a post on the Interior Ministry’s X account, during the discussions, both sides emphasised enhancing cooperation in counter-narcotics, human trafficking, and security.
“Naqvi expressed gratitude to the British government and High Commissioner Marriott for resuming flight operations to the UK after a five-year hiatus,” the post said.
 






The Pakistan International Airlines operated its inaugural flight from Islamabad to Manchester on Saturday. The national flag carrier launched its flights to the United Kingdom after receiving the Third Country Operator (TCO) approval for flight operations. In the second phase, the flight operation will be extended to Birmingham and London.
Both envoys also lauded the Pakistan Navy’s recent anti-narcotics operation.
On October 23, Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea. According to the Com­bined Maritime Force (CMF) — a naval partnership that includes the US Navy — the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different ‘dhow’ sailing boats within 48 hours last week.
Marriott briefed the minister on the upcoming visit of the Director General of the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) next month. “During the visit, memorandums of understanding will be signed in the fields of immigration and counter-narcotics,” the post said.
Minister Naqvi highlighted projects like the Centre of Excellence, supported by the British High Commission, as crucial for enhancing the capacity of Pakistani institutions. “The initiative will further strengthen cooperation between Pakistan and the UK on mutual legal assistance and extradition matters,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The British High Commissioner reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to its ties with Pakistan, while Naqvi reiterated Pakistan’s determination to work with the international community to eliminate terrorism.
Meanwhile, Chargé d’Affaires Baker described Pakistan’s efforts against terrorism and extremism as commendable and pledged continued cooperation in security and counterterrorism.
In August, Acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Gregory LoGerfo and Baker participated in the US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue, advancing their shared resolve to combat the global threat.
According to a statement from the Foreign Office, the dialogue was co-chaired by Special Secretary (UN) Ambassador Nabeel Munir and LoGerfo, adding that the two delegations underscored the critical importance of developing effective approaches to terrorist threats, including those posed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p><small>2025-10-26 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26150104e68c1c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951357/mother-of-slain-journalist-arshad-sharif-passes-away' target='_blank'><strong>Mother of slain journalist Arshad Sharif passes away</strong></a><br><p>Riffat Ara Alvi, the mother of slain journalist Arshad Sharif, passed away on Sunday, according to her family.
Arshad, a prominent journalist who was awarded the Pride of Performance in 2023 by then-President Arif Alvi, was shot dead in Kenya on October 24, 2022. Politicians and media bodies demanded a probe into his death, but the lack of progress in the investigation has been decried by the Supreme Court and media.
“Arshad Sharif’s mother, who was demanding justice for her son, has passed away,” the deceased journalist’s wife, Javeria Siddique, posted on X today.
 






In a subsequent post, she said Alvi’s funeral prayers would be held today at the “H-11 graveyard [in] Islamabad at 9pm”.
 






Siddique, herself a journalist, in 2023 published a piece for Dawn.com on her husband’s death in which she called for an “independent, impartial, and immediate investigation” to ensure justice for Sharif.
“Everyone is watching, and yet, justice only seems to become more and more elusive,” she said in the article.
Condolences pour in
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed grief over the passing of Alvi.
“I am saddened by the passing of Arshad Sharif’s mother and pray for the forgiveness of the deceased,” a post on PPP Media Cell’s X account quoted Bilawal as saying.
 






Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari rued that Alvi “kept asking for justice till the very end but to no avail”.
“Cruel apathy of the judiciary,” she commented in a post on X.

Lahore has ranked as the world’s most polluted city for the past three days, with air quality plummeting to hazardous levels as smog blanketed the city and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) hitting 412, prompting health warnings and a province-wide crackdown on pollution sources.
The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a high alert across the eastern districts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur. According to Director General PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, the intensity of smog is expected to increase from November to mid-December, citing forecasts from the Meteorological Department.
The announcement was made by Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat on his X account, in light of the current smog situation.
“Winter school timing — 8:45am to 1:30pm”, the minister announced.
 






Separately, commenting on the smog situation, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said during a media briefing that the province now had a comprehensive digital and AI-based forecasting system in place.
She said it had been developed using data from previous years, adding that it was accessible to the public through the air quality portal and was released a day in advance by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Reflecting on opinions regarding the smog situation, she said, “First of all, all those who have suddenly become environmental experts these days and issue reports or make statements as they please, I want to clarify that smog is a seasonal phenomenon.”
She said the seasons last for only three months, when the easterly corridor from east to west causes temperature inversions and cold air forms a lid over the atmosphere.
“Within that lid, particulate pollutants become trapped because the air above is cold. That lid, together with atmospheric pressure, creates a haze that we call smog,” she explained.
Marriyum emphasised that the people of Lahore and Punjab must realise that “it cannot be that yesterday the AQI was 160 and today, because of local pollutants, it has suddenly jumped to 380.”
She explained that it is common for pollution levels to rise early in the morning due to colder temperatures, but as the day warms and upper-air conditions shift, the air becomes denser and “particulate matter starts to disperse.”
The minister said that smog guns were being used only as an artificial and temporary measure.
“Previously, smog was managed during the season by shutting schools, restaurants and imposing lockdown-style restrictions. But for the first time, we are not only managing smog in the season without resorting to closures; we are also improving Lahore’s Air Quality Index,” she added.
Marriyum said the government’s work extended beyond the smog season. “We are not only active during these three months,” she said, “but carrying out smog mitigation efforts throughout the year.”</p><small>2025-10-26 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26140120e4ca667.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951352/trump-says-will-get-pak-afghan-conflict-solved-very-quickly' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says will get Pak-Afghan conflict ‘solved very quickly’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he would get the conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan “solved very quickly”, calling Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir “great people”.
Tensions between Islamabad and Kabul flared up earlier this month over accusations of terrorism, as border clashes killed 23 Pakistani troops as well as 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists after an attack by Kabul, which it claimed was retaliation for Islamabad conducting air strikes in its territory. A first round of talks in Doha last weekend led to a ceasefire agreement, with both governments seeking to firm up the agreement in more talks yesterday.
Trump, who was previously involved in brokering a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in May of this year as well as a peace deal between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas, arrived today in Malaysia to attend a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Kuala Lumpur, while also co-signing a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia.
Addressing the border dispute on the sidelines of an Asean summit today, Trump referred to it as “one of eight wars that my administration has ended in just eight months”.
“We’re averaging one a month. There’s only one left,” he said. “Although I heard that Pakistan and Afghanistan have started up, but I’ll get that solved very quickly.”

He added, “I know them both … the Pakistan field marshal and the prime minister are great people, and I know we’re gonna get that done quickly. That one started up a few days ago.”
Referring to his own role in halting wars around the world, the US president said, “I just feel it’s something I can do. I do it nicely.
“I don’t need to do it, I guess,” he added. “But if I can take time and save millions of lives, that’s really a great thing. I can’t think of anything better to do.”
Trump had previously thanked both Shehbaz and “my favourite” Munir for their efforts in securing the ceasefire deal in Gaza, while Shehbaz praised Trump’s “exemplary [and] visionary leadership” and reconfirmed Pakistan’s plan to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize 2026.
When the fighting broke out between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the US president was quick to express interest in assisting with establishing peace, although he was at the time occupied with overseeing a hostage exchange between Hamas and Israel.
“I said, ‘I’ll have to wait till I get back. I am doing another one,’” he told reporters at the time. “Because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace, and it is an honour to do it.”</p><small>2025-10-26 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/261258009ec5485.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951349/trump-co-signs-thailand-cambodia-ceasefire-agreement' target='_blank'><strong>Trump co-signs Thailand-Cambodia ceasefire agreement</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump co-signed a ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Cambodia in Malaysia during the first stop on his Asia tour, which is expected to culminate in talks with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
The ceasefire, following a bloody border dispute, was signed by Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, as well as Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
The agreement will see the release of 18 Cambodian prisoners of war, a statement from Cambodia’s foreign ministry said.
 


Clashes between Thailand and Cambodia erupted in July, killing more than 40 people and forcing around 300,000 to flee their homes.
While the neighbours agreed an initial ceasefire in late July, they have since traded accusations of violations.
In their joint declaration witnessed by Trump, Anutin and Hun Manet reiterated their “firm commitment to refrain from the threat or use of force”.
“We reaffirm the unwavering commitment to peace and security between our two countries,” reads the deal, signed by both, who shared a strong handshake.
Trump congratulated the premiers.
“This is a momentous day for all of the people of Southeast Asia, as we sign a historic agreement to end the military conflict between Cambodia and Thailand,” he said.
The US president added that he had also struck “a major trade deal with Cambodia and a very important critical minerals agreement with Thailand”.
A final comprehensive peace pact between the Southeast Asian neighbours remains outstanding, analysts have said.
Malaysia’s Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan, who has been closely involved in the talks on behalf of Asean, has said the latest agreement centred around establishing regional observers in the conflict areas.
“We want there to be no more ceasefire violations because after July 28, although the ceasefire was in place, there were… minor violations,” Mohamad said.
“Both countries must withdraw their respective heavy weapons from the relevant areas, and secondly, both countries must make efforts to demine or remove and destroy the mines that have been planted in borders of both countries,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-26 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26150232c5f9bb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951355/sindh-records-439-dengue-cases-in-october-karachi-tops-with-188-health-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh records 439 dengue cases in October, Karachi tops with 188: health dept</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Health Department has released its latest report on confirmed dengue cases across the province, revealing that 439 new cases have been reported so far in October, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in 2025 to 1,083.
Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, remains a recurring health concern in Sindh — particularly during the monsoon season when stagnant water and poor sanitation accelerate its spread. The illness causes high fever and, in severe cases, can lead to life-threatening complications.
While the provincial health department puts the total number of dengue cases in Sindh this year at 1,083, figures from Oct 1 to 16 obtained from three major Karachi hospitals and a public sector laboratory with branches in Hyderabad suggested an outbreak-like situation, with the actual number exceeding 12,000 in just six weeks.
A statement issued by the Health Department, quoting Sindh Minister for Health and Population Welfare Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, said, “Karachi Division remains the most affected, with 188 cases reported this month, followed by Hyderabad Division with 154, Mirpurkhas with 83, Sukkur with 10, Shaheed Benazirabad with three, and Larkana Division with one case.”
Dr Pechuho clarified that the Health Department maintained complete records of all confirmed dengue cases received from government hospitals. “If a patient undergoes testing at a private laboratory, that report is not included in our official data,” she said, emphasising that the figures released by the department were verified and authentic.
She urged the public “not to believe unverified information or rumours circulating on social media,” adding that data of all patients admitted to hospitals or treated in outpatient departments (OPDs) is properly maintained by the department.
Dr Pechuho said the Sindh government was working seriously to curb dengue across the province.
“Anti-dengue measures, including fumigation, spraying, and drainage improvement, have been intensified in all districts,” the statement quoted her as saying. “Deputy commissioners and district health officers have been instructed to ensure that no stagnant water remains, as it serves as a breeding ground for mosquitoes.”
She added that equal attention is being given to both urban and rural areas, and separate dengue units have been established in all government hospitals where free treatment and testing facilities are being provided.
Grim situation in Karachi, Hyderabad
Last week, figures collected from three hospitals in Karachi — Indus Hospital (IH), Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) and the Sindh Infectious Diseases Hospital and Research Centre (SIDHRC) — showed that a total of 2,972 cases of dengue have been reported from Sept 1 to Oct 16. The fourth hospital — the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre — alone recorded 1,062 dengue cases from July to date.
The situation was no different at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) as sources confirmed a high number of dengue cases, comparatively larger than last year’s, and a few deaths.
Hyderabad was also facing an alarming situation as the figures obtained from the Diagnostic and Research Laboratory (DRL) of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), Jamshoro, and its branches showed 9,075 dengue confirmed cases from Sept 1 to Oct 14.
Questions raised over credibility of govt data
PMA-Sindh President Dr Bashir Ahmed Khaskheli had described the situation as “far more serious than what’s depicted by official data and said that official figures did not represent the ground reality.”
“There is no official mechanism in place to get feedback from private clinics operating in every nook and corner of a locality, as well as private hospitals, quacks and even hakeems. Many people constrained by their financial resources don’t even opt for laboratory tests,” he told Dawn.
Dr Faisal Mahmood, professor of infectious diseases and associate chief medical officer at the AKUH, also confirmed the surge in dengue cases, emphasising that the end of October was classically the season when most dengue cases were seen.
“It is important to note that dengue rates do vary from year to year, and this cyclic pattern of dengue peaks is something we have seen over the last decade or so. There are several reasons for this, including weather patterns and changes in the strains. What is driving this year is hard to say, though I would think the [rains] floods have played a part,“ he said.
Ineffective fumigation
Health experts have attributed the surge in dengue cases to a lack of fumigation and timely drainage of water accumulated after the heavy spells of monsoon rains.
“If rainwater remains accumulated, it has the potential to become a breeding ground for vectors,” Dr Mirza Ali Azhar of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) told Dawn.
“Entire rainwater doesn’t go into drains, and in many areas, water stands in the shape of ponds, only to serve as a home for mosquitoes,” he said.
Dr Khaskheli, the incumbent PMA-Sindh president, regretted that the high number of cases due to mosquito-borne illnesses could be easily prevented through effective vector control measures.
“It all has to do with the poor sewerage and drainage system. One could see pools of standing rainwater or sewage and heaps of garbage everywhere, providing breeding grounds of all kinds of germs and insects,” he said, pointing out that there were few government fumigation campaigns to effectively address the menace of vector-borne diseases.</p><small>2025-10-26 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26151647511f2ab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951358/brooks-defiant-ton-in-vain-as-new-zealand-beat-england-by-four-wickets-in-first-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Brook’s defiant ton in vain as New Zealand beat England by four wickets in first ODI</strong></a><br><p>New Zealand overcame a blitz from centurion Harry Brook to beat England by four wickets on Sunday in the opening game of their three-match one-day international series, with Daryl Mitchell and Michael Bracewell scoring half-centuries.
The hosts wobbled chasing 224, losing four quick wickets, including former captain Kane Williamson for a first-ball duck in his first match for the side since March, but Mitchell took them home with an unbeaten 78 after being dropped on 33.
Bracewell also earned a reprieve early on and ran himself out for 51 to open the door for England after the initial burst from Brydon Carse (3-45), but New Zealand got back on track thanks to Mitch Santner’s 27 and prevailed in 36.4 overs.
 






“There was still a lot in the wicket,” skipper Santner said.
“We lost a couple more than we would have liked in the chase but the intent was great … Daryl and Michael’s partnership was massive for us.”
England recovered from a disastrous start as captain Brook bludgeoned 135 from 101 balls and Jamie Overton made 46 to help their side finish on 223 all out in 35.2 overs for a fighting chance in the contest.
Asked to bat first at Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui, England were rocked early by New Zealand’s seamers as Zak Foulkes (4-41) and Matt Henry (2-53) reduced the tourists to 56-6 within 12 devastating overs in helpful conditions.
‘Great start’
“Yeah it was tough work in the end, but I think the way we started off, with wickets in the powerplay, it’s always a great start,” Santner said.
“We know Matt can do that and then Zak was outstanding, the way he swung it.
It looks like a nightmare facing him. Obviously long spells, but we knew wickets were massive because even when they’re four or five down they’ve got (batsmen).
“Getting Brook earlier would have been nice but he was outstanding today.”
Brook went into attack mode despite the carnage around him and brought up his fifty in 36 balls with a top-edged six off Nathan Smith, before Overton took his team’s total to three figures with another big hit off Jacob Duffy (3-55).
Overton shrugged off being hit on the helmet by Smith and closed in on his own half-century, but departed four runs short after a fine catch on the second attempt by Mitchell that ended the 87-run seventh-wicket partnership.
Consecutive sixes
Duffy removed Carse with the very next ball to leave England teetering again on 143-8, but Brook took control following Adil Rashid’s fall shortly afterwards, reaching his ton with three consecutive sixes and taking his side past 200 runs.
A belligerent Brook continued to deal in big shots, swelling his tally of sixes to 11, but was snared trying to sweep Santner out of the park as New Zealand stopped the bleeding to stay on top in the series opener.
“I felt I was in good touch,” man of the match Brook said.
“Obviously we didn’t get off to a great start and I tried to take it up on myself to have a counter-punch. Thankfully it came off today.
“I’ve done it a few times actually, it’s a do-or-die moment. I managed to get us a decent score to defend. We started nicely with the ball, but we just struggled to take wickets throughout the middle.”
The second game takes place in Hamilton on Wednesday, with New Zealand seeking another victory after losing the preceding rain-hit Twenty20 series between the teams 1-0.</p><small>2025-10-26 10:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26131737894db64.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951351/three-armed-men-killed-in-quetta-encounter-identified-as-kidnappers-say-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three armed men killed in Quetta encounter identified as ‘kidnappers’, say police</strong></a><br><p>Three armed men shot dead in a police encounter on the outskirts of Quetta were identified as members of a kidnapping gang, police said on Sunday, adding that weapons and a vehicle used in the abductions were recovered from the scene.
The incident occurred on Saturday in Quetta’s Killi Khali area, within the jurisdiction of the Brewery Police Station, where the suspects were killed during a shootout with police.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Serious Crimes Investigation Wing, Imran Qureshi, told Dawn.com that after identifying the men killed in yesterday’s encounter, an investigation was launched, which revealed that all three were involved in kidnappings.
“Two accomplices of the kidnappers managed to escape during the exchange of fire, while a police constable sustained injuries,” SSP Qureshi said.
“Two of the slain suspects were identified as Nawab Ali and Ahmed Sultan, while efforts are underway with the help of NADRA (National Database and Registration Authority) to find out the identity of the third suspect.”
According to the SSP, Police records and investigations showed that the suspects killed were wanted in several abduction cases by Quetta police and were part of a ransom-for-kidnapping gang.
Qureshi said the group had kidnapped Abdul Razzaq, the driver of the Gwadar University vice chancellor, releasing him after receiving Rs1.6 million in ransom. He added that Bashir Ahmed, a trader from Qila Abdullah, was freed after paying Rs8m, while Quetta resident Irfan Baig was released following a Rs10m ransom payment.
“The slain suspects were wanted in two cases registered at the Sadar Police Station, three at Jinnah Town Police Station, and one at Industrial Police Station.
“The Serious Crimes Investigation Wing is conducting further investigations into the case,” the SSP added.
Kidnapping for ransom in Balochistan remains a serious security challenge amid the broader insurgency and weak law-enforcement reach. In January, seven people, including an 11-year-old, were kidnapped from a picnic spot in the province, with Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti confirming that the victims were believed to have been taken for ransom and that efforts were underway to recover them.
In July, another incident occurred in the Sardhaka area, where passengers were abducted, prompting a large-scale rescue operation by provincial authorities.</p><small>2025-10-26 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630573-president-zardari-pm-shehbaz-discuss-ajk-govt-formation' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari, PM Shehbaz 'discuss AJK govt formation'</strong></a><br><p>

But he does not hold an absolute parliamentary majority after an ultra-Orthodox party quit in July, protesting against the government’s failure to pass a law to exempt its community from military service.
The summer parliamentary recess came at just the right time to shield the government, which now holds just 60 of 120 seats, from motions of no confidence.
But the resumption of the Knesset’s work on October 20 heralded the return of transactional politics and potential threats for the government.
Under pressure from US President Donald Trump, Netanyahu agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas that came into effect on October 10 after more than two years of Israeli assault on Gaza.
His far-right allies vehemently denounced the agreement, arguing that the military should retain control of the entire Gaza Strip and crush the Palestinian movement for good.
And while they are not abandoning the ship of government, they are raising the price to keep them on board.
June 2026 election?
“The coalition has been weakened by the ceasefire agreement,” said independent analyst Michael Horowitz. “For Netanyahu, the issue is no longer so much about preserving his coalition until the end as it is about positioning himself to win the next elections — even if they are brought forward,” he told AFP.
In a televised interview on October 18, Netanyahu said that he would run for office in the next elections and that he expected to win.
Those polls are required to take place by late October 2026, but Netanyahu, who has just turned 76, may call early elections or be forced into a fresh vote if another of his allied parties abandons the ruling coalition.
Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has already threatened to stop voting with the coalition if his bill calling for “the death penalty for terrorists” is not put to a parliamentary vote by November 9.
Netanyahu must grapple with ideological differences from his far-right partners, who favour resuming the war on Gaza with a view to taking over the territory, from which Israel unilaterally withdrew in 2005.
He must also contend with pressure from his allies in the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic Shas party, which has 11 lawmakers and has distanced itself from the government.
Without formally leaving the coalition, Shas ministers resigned from the cabinet in July over the issue of military service exemptions for ultra-Orthodox Jews.
The coalition’s other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, quit both the government and the coalition.
Several Israeli journalists, including the high-profile Amit Segal, who is known to be close to Netanyahu, have suggested the premier would opt for June 2026 for early elections.
For now, Netanyahu must overcome several obstacles to remain in power, most notably the issue of conscription for ultra-Orthodox Jews.
Shas says it will pull its support unless military service exemption is enshrined in law, while the far-right and many in Netanyahu’s Likud party want to force ultra-Orthodox conscription.
Likud in front
If the fragile ceasefire holds, Netanyahu will also have to find post-war solutions for Gaza that will satisfy his far-right partners.
They are demanding a vote on at least partial annexation of the occupied West Bank in return for what they see as the relinquishing of Gaza.
The Trump administration has repeatedly expressed its opposition to such a move.
Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist said that in a bid to shore up its unity, the coalition planned to swiftly pass laws that would give it a better chance of election victory.
Among them would be the lowering of the threshold of votes needed to be represented in parliament – an apparent gift to Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose far-right Religious Zionism party would not reach the required limit under current rules, according to several polls.
Another measure would be to lower the voting age to 17, which would give a demographic advantage to the ultra-Orthodox parties.
Netanyahu, who is on trial in several corruption cases, is assured of being re-elected as head of Likud at the end of November, as there are no other candidates.
And despite strong popular discontent with the government, his party remains the frontrunner according to all polls.</p><small>2025-10-26 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630572-punjab-revises-school-timings-amid-worsening-smog' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab revises school timings amid worsening smog</strong></a><br><p>

They, however, expect the situation to improve with supplies arriving from Swat and Sindh in the coming days.
 
 

“Although the rate of tomatoes has dropped slightly from Rs600 to Rs370–400 per kg, it is still unaffordable for the common man as it is a daily-use item,” said Rawalpindi Fruit and Vegetable Market Association President Ghulam Qadir Mir while speaking to Dawn.
Explaining the reasons behind the price hike, he said that floods during the monsoon season, the closure of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and the government’s negligence in bridging the demand-supply gap were the main factors.
 
 

He added that most of the tomato supply usually comes from Central Asia and Afghanistan, but border tensions had disrupted the trade. Meanwhile, local supplies from Punjab were also affected due to floods.
“Iranian tomatoes reached the market, but in limited quantities. Over the last two days, some supplies from Swat and Sindh have arrived, and we hope that the demand-supply gap will narrow, stabilising prices by next week,” he said.
Mr Mir urged the government to take immediate measures to import tomatoes to stabilise prices.
A senior official of the Punjab Agriculture Department said that tomato shortages typically begin in the winter season.
However, the Punjab government had launched a project last year to grow tomatoes in the off-season in some parts of the province.
He added that the devastating floods destroyed many of these areas, but farmers were expected to resume cultivation soon.
Meanwhile, the district administration has failed to enforce the official price list issued by the District Market Committee, as food items are being sold at inflated rates across the garrison city.
Price magistrates and other concerned departments appear helpless in implementing the directives.
 
 

According to market data, tomatoes are being sold at Rs370–400 per kg against the official price of Rs180 per kg. Ginger is available at Rs600 per kg (official rate Rs520), garlic at Rs380 per kg (official rate Rs350), potatoes at Rs90 per kg (official rate Rs78), onions at Rs95 per kg (official rate Rs88), eggs at Rs350 per dozen (official rate Rs333), and chicken at Rs350 per kg (official rate Rs313).
Residents of Rawalpindi have expressed anger over the unchecked price hike, particularly of tomatoes.
“The shopkeepers are charging excessively, and no one stops them. Who can afford to buy tomatoes at Rs370–400 per kg? Most people have stopped buying them,” said Niaz Ahmed, a resident of Mohanpura.
Muhammad Ayaz, a resident of Gawalmandi, said that the district administration had completely failed to control food prices. “People are struggling to buy sugar, wheat, meat, vegetables, and lentils,” he said.
He lamented that the common man’s income has not increased for years, while prices of essential commodities have multiplied. “There’s no one in the government to control this inflation,” he said.
Abrar Ahmed, a resident of Dhoke Khabba, said that managing a household budget has become nearly impossible. “With limited income, we can’t bear the inflation anymore. I now work two jobs just to make ends meet,” he said.
Shopkeepers, however, defended themselves, saying they too were affected by high wholesale rates. “We purchase goods at higher prices from the wholesale market, so it’s impossible to sell them cheaply,” one shopkeeper said.

The FII9 will convene global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth”. Thematic discussions will address global challenges and opportunities, focusing on key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts.
“At the invitation of His Royal Highness Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman, Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif will lead a high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, as well as senior Cabinet Ministers — to Riyadh from 27 to 29 October 2025 to participate in the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative (FII9),” the FO statement said.
“During his stay, the prime minister will engage with the Saudi leadership to explore avenues for enhanced cooperation in the trade, investment, energy, and human resource sectors. The discussions will also cover regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern.”
It added that on the sidelines of FII9, PM Shehbaz will also interact with leaders from other participating countries and heads of international organisations.
“These exchanges will highlight Pakistan’s investment potential and its readiness to pursue collaborations in sustainable development, in line with the ‘Think, Exchange, and Act’ model.”
According to the FO, the visit will underscore Pakistan’s commitment to advancing economic diplomacy and fostering strategic partnerships in investment, technology, and sustainable development.
Islamabad and Riyadh have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Last month, the two countries signed a defence agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
In 2024, they signed 34 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth $2.8 billion, following an earlier deal of 27 MoUs valued at $2.2bn.</p><small>2025-10-26 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/26120906279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951202/ihc-to-hear-plea-seeking-closure-of-imrans-x-account' target='_blank'><strong>IHC to hear plea seeking closure of Imran’s X account</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has fixed for hearing a petition seeking the closure of former prime minister Imran Khan’s X (formerly Twitter) account.
Meanwhile, a district court in the capital extended the interim bail of the PTI founder’s wife, Bushra Bibi, in a protest case.
 
 

According to the cause list issued by the IHC registrar’s office, the petition will be taken up on November 4 by Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir. The court has already issued notices to the PTI founder, the National Cyber Crime Agency, the superintendent of prisons and other relevant officials seeking written responses.
The petition filed by a citizen, Ghulam Murtaza, through Barrister Zafarullah contended that the PTI founder was allegedly broadcasting illegal and provocative messages from his X account while in prison. The petitioner maintained that such an online activity could incite public unrest and undermine law and order. It requested the court to order the removal of all unlawful or disruptive posts and to restrain any future dissemination of similar material.
 
 

Meanwhile, the district and sessions court extended the interim bail granted to Bushra Bibi in a case linked to a protest held on November 26. The hearing, scheduled before Judge Chaudhry Amir Zia, was postponed due to his unavailability.
The case, registered at the Ramna police station under multiple sections including the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act, accuses the PTI leadership of organising an unlawful assembly and inciting unrest. The court adjourned the hearing until November 15 and summoned the parties to present their arguments.
 
 

Imaan Mazari tweet case
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka on Saturday dismissed the objections raised by the defence to the supplementary challan submitted by the prosecution in the controversial tweet case against Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatta.
The court also rejected the prosecution’s miscellaneous application seeking voice matching of the accused and fixed October 29 for framing of charges.
During the hearing at the district and sessions court, the assistant counsel for defence lawyer Qaiser Imam informed the court that the lead counsel was engaged in other cases and would appear shortly.
The judge adjourned proceedings for a short break and resumed the hearing at 9:30am.
Upon resumption, Advocate Qaiser Imam appeared on behalf of Imaan Mazari, while Advocate Kifayat Wazir represented co-accused Hadi Ali Chatta.
Prosecutor Muhammad Usman Rana appeared on behalf of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which had registered the case.
Advocate Qaiser Imam presented detailed arguments opposing the supplementary challan, contending that a final challan had already been submitted earlier in the case, leaving no legal ground for an additional submission. He argued that the supplementary challan was “legally inadmissible” since the investigation was considered complete once the final report was filed.
The court had reserved its decision on both the defence’s objections and the prosecution’s voice-matching application earlier in the day.
Later, Judge Majoka announced the verdict, dismissing both requests and scheduling October 29 as the date for the formal indictment of the accused.
The case pertains to a controversial tweet allegedly posted by Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatta, which led the NCCIA to initiate proceedings under cybercrime and related laws.

Addressing a press conference at the party’s city office, Insaf House, Karachi, Sindh chapter president Haleem Adil Sheikh said that state institutions in the province had “ceased to function effectively”.
 
 

“Sindh is the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and hospitality, but today, oppression and lawlessness prevail,” he lame­nted, holding the PPP government responsible for the province’s deteriorating situation.
Citing a recent case of “pol­ice brutality,” he referred to the case of a young labourer, Irfan Baloch, who had come from Uch Sharif, Punjab, to Karachi for work, and was allegedly abduc­ted and tortured to death by the CIA police.

Haleem Adil says over 50 citizens killed by robbers this year

“No FIR has been registered yet,” he said, warning that if jus­t­ice was denied, it would pro­ve that “the police institution itself is complicit in this brutality.”
 
 

Accompanied by PTI Sindh leaders Jamal Siddiqui, Farukh Khan and others, the PTI provincial chief also highlighted the alarming rise in street crimes in the metropolis.
“In September alone, 199 cars, 3,698 motorcycles, and 1,542 mobile phones were snatched, while 51 citizens were killed resisting robberies this year,” he said.
Mr Sheikh questioned why the authorities had failed to take action against the patrons of 72 dacoits who recently surrendered in Shikarpur’s Katcha area, noting that “no hostages had been recovered”.
 
 

“The Katcha areas have tur­ned into no-go zones. Law and order in Sindh has collapsed, and police excesses are rampant,” he said.
Referring to the Auditor General of Pakistan’s 2024-25 report, the PTI provincial chief said that “financial irregularities worth Rs836 billion” had been unearthed in Sindh government departments.
“Seventeen years of PPP rule have pushed Sindh to the brink of destruction. Corruption has infested every institution,” he said.
He said the citizens were being “crushed under rising inflation” and that “corruption” had become routine.
 
 

“Flour, sugar, vegetables, pulses, ghee, electricity, and gas have all become unaffordable. People must break their silence, as remaining quiet now means abetting crime,” he warned.
Mr Sheikh also deplored the dismal state of education and healthcare in Sindh, saying that “more than six million children are out of school,” hospitals lack basic facilities, and dengue cases are surging.
He criticised the provincial government for “denying” citizens access to the Sehat Card and “exploiting” farmers who were not getting fair prices for their crops.
He further alleged large-scale corruption in the Sindh Solar Energy Programme, which is a Rs28 billion World Bank-funded project.
“Fake import documents were used, and the actual price of solar fans was $23.4 per unit, but the Sindh government contracted them for $151 per unit. On top of that, Rs127 million in fake tax claims were filed,” he claimed.

“PPP remains committed to respecting, empowering, and reviving the ag­­ricultural sector for a pr­­o­s­­perous Pakistan,” said the party’s Central Informa­tion Secretary Shazia Ma­­rri. She quoted PPP Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zar­d­ari as saying that no economy can be strong if its farmers are weak.
“Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari believes that strengthening the farmer means strengthening Pakistan itself,” Ms Marri said in a statement issued on Saturday.
Ms Marri said that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s vision was clear — the true measure of progress lies in the prosperity of farmers. She recalled that during the PPP government, Pakistan had moved from wheat shortage to becoming a wheat-exporting country, owing to farmer-friendly policies.
She said that the PPP chairman had always stood by the farmers, advocating for timely procurement and fair prices.
Highlighting the impact of climate change, the PPP leader said that it posed a serious threat to every Pakistani farmer. She added that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari emphasised the need for investment in sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture, envisioning a modern agricultural economy where small farmers could progress through technology and access to fair markets.
She said the PPP believed that insurance, credit access, and transparent governance were essential to protect farmers from the adverse effects of climate change.
Ms Marri appreciated the government’s decision to allow wheat procurement, terming it a longstanding demand of the PPP. She added that approving the support price for wheat was also a PPP demand; however, she noted that fixing the price at Rs4,000 instead of Rs3,500 per 40kg would have been more beneficial for farmers. She further said that reducing the income tax from 45 per cent to 15pc was an important relief measure for the farming community.

The understanding was reached during a meeting between Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and Iran’s Minister for Roads and Urban Development, Farzaneh Sadegh. Both sides underlined the importance of regional connectivity for expanding trade, investment and transport links.
The ministers discussed initiatives to enhance maritime trade, develop port infrastructure and improve logistical routes connecting the two countries by sea, land and rail.

Ferry service proposed to facilitate pilgrims, promote religious tourism

Mr Chaudhry proposed launching a ferry service between Pakistan and Iran to provide an affordable and efficient transport option for traders and pilgrims. He said Pakistani authorities would welcome Iranian companies interested in operating such a service, noting that Iran’s lower fuel prices could help reduce fares.
 
 

He added that in 2025, about 60,000 to 70,000 Pakistani pilgrims travelled to Iran and Iraq by air, and a ferry service could significantly increase those numbers. The minister also said a centralised pilgrim management policy would be introduced next year, requiring all pilgrims to travel through registered tour operators to improve safety and coordination.
Mr Chaudhry noted that expanding religious tourism could bring economic benefits to both countries and called for cooperation to develop the necessary infrastructure.
The Iranian minister welcomed Pakistan’s proposals and said both countries’ ports could serve as gateways for regional commerce. She reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to enhancing port-to-port cooperation and exploring trade routes in the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.
“The ports of both countries are key economic assets,” Ms Sadegh said. “By improving maritime and transport connectivity, we can open new opportunities for regional trade and economic cooperation.” Both sides reiterated their commitment to deepening collaboration in the maritime and transport sectors as part of broader efforts to promote the blue economy and strengthen bilateral relations.

Separately, a station house officer (SHO) was injured in Hangu during follow-up action after a bomb attack on Friday evening that killed SP Asad Zubair and two police guards.
In the Jhallar area of North Waziristan, security forces killed three militants and averted a “potential catastrophic attack” by destroying a vehicle being prepared for a suicide attack, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Acting on intelligence about the presence of “Khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al-Khawarij”, troops “effectively engaged” the militants’ location and destroyed the vehicle besides killing three militants.

SHO wounded in follow-up action after attack on SP

The state uses the term Fitna al-Khawarij to refer to militants of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“A sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored Kharji found in the area as a relentless counterterrorism campaign … by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the ISPR said.
Separately, security officials said a targeted operation in War Mamund tehsil of Bajaur left five militants dead and several injured.
The operation, conducted on intelligence reports about the presence of militants in the Badan area, continued over two days, according to residents who confirmed sustained movement by security forces.
 
 

Local sources claimed the militants were using a mosque built for refugees as a hideout. The ISPR did not immediately issue a statement on the Bajaur operation.
Leaders of the Bajaur Aman Jirga staged a demonstration in the Umary area on Saturday evening, demanding that authorities avoid harm to civilians during operations.
In Hangu, four militants were killed in an exchange of fire in the rugged mountains on Friday evening. The operation was launched after an improvised explosive device (IED) attack that martyred SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two guards. The SHO of the Doaba police station was injured in the ensuing action.
The area has witnessed repeated attacks attributed to the banned TTP in recent months.

Several institutions are organising the test, including the Uni­ver­sity of Health Sciences in Lahore, Suk­kur IBA University, Khyber Medical Uni­versity in Peshawar, Bolan Uni­versity of Medical and Health Scie­nces in Quetta, and Shaheed Zulfi­qar Ali Bhutto Medical University in Islamabad.
Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) President Dr Rizwan Taj said that all participating universities had assured him that the necessary arrangements for the test have been made.
“All universities conducting the MDCAT were advised to thoroughly review and implement all required arrangements to ensure the fair, tr­­a­­­nsparent, and secure conduct of the examination,” Mr Taj said. He added that security measures in­­­­­c­l­u­­de the installation of jammers to blo­­­ck unauthorised electronic devices.

Over 140,000 hopefuls compete for 22,000 spots

“Examination venues will be eq­­u­ipped with proper seating arra­ngements and adequate facilities to ac­­commodate all candidates co­­mfortably,” he said.
“Furthermore, universities are instructed to make ap­­­propriate arrangements for heating or cooling of the examination halls according to weather conditions and to ensure that drinking water is readily available to all candidates,” he added.
To ensure transparency and proper record-keeping, specific protocols have been established for the exam materials.
“Universities shall provide bubble sheets with carbon copies to the candidates and must ensure complete secrecy and confidentiality of all question papers,” Mr Taj stated.
“Question papers shall be ope­n­­ed only in the presence of witnesses to maintain transparency. After the conclusion of the examination, all bubble sheets must be collected promptly and kept in a safe and secured location”, he added
He also mentioned that the original examination papers of the MDCAT would be retained by the respective universities for a minimum period of 12 months from the date of the result declaration.
Mr Taj emphasised a swift and tra­­nsparent process for releasing results. The official answer key will be uploaded to university websites immediately after the exam, with full results expected within one week.

• Plea alleges officials implicated woman in criminal case
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court has ordered the constitution of a joint investigation team (JIT) to investigate into the alleged abduction of a woman and her three minor children, an episode now linked to a multimillion-rupee Naval Farms land scam recently unearthed by a joint enquiry committee (JEC).
Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the IHC issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by Muhammad Waqas and others.
 
 

The petition alleged that police officials, acting on behalf of unidentified people, abducted Sana Sohail, wife of Aleem Sohail, who worked in a private farm, along with her daughters — 12-year-old Harim, seven-year-old Laiba, and three-year-old Nimra — from Lahore on Sept 17.
It added that the officials later implicated the woman in a fabricated criminal case at the Tarnol police station in Islamabad.
According to the court order, CCTV footage dated Sept 17 confirmed that the woman and her children were taken into custody at around 7am with the assistance of the Punjab police and transported to Islamabad.
They were later shown as arrested in an FIR, which was registered three days later under various provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Arms Ordinance.
The judge observed that the incident occurred prior to the filing of the FIR, raising “serious questions about the legality of the police action”.
The investigation officer (IO) failed to identify those who had ordered the operation or to justify the presence of two Suzuki Alto cars and other vehicles recovered at the CIA centre in Islamabad.
The IHC directed the Islamabad police chief to appear in person on Oct 28 and explain the conduct of the Tarnol SHO and the IO.
The CIA centre SP was instructed to produce the vehicles and submit a detailed report describing how they were taken into custody.
Justice Kayani also summoned the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) director general and ordered the creation of a JIT to investigate into the alleged abduction, trespassing, and fabrication of criminal charges. The FIA DG was told to supervise the inquiry.
The order pointed out that Duty Jud­ic­ial Magistrate Yasir Mehmood Chaudhry had sent Ms Sohail to judicial custody and placed her children with the Child Pro­t­e­ction Bureau without the inquiry required under law concerning their welfare.
The member inspection team of the high court was directed to summon the magistrate for an explanation.
Land scam
The IHC proceedings are closely connected to a separate high-level probe by the JEC, comprising high ranking officials including Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, director generals of the Inter-Services Intelligence and Intelligence Bureau, a senior superintendent of Islamabad police as well as a naval commander, which earlier uncovered a sophisticated land scam involving 136 kanals of property in Mera Begwal, Islamabad.
The JEC found that the land had been illegally transferred through a manipulated general power of attorney (GPA) and fraudulent documents.
According to the JEC report, the GPA used for the transfer bore genuine signatures and thumb impressions of the landowner, Musharraf Rasool Cyan, but the sale clause was inserted later.
The inquiry also discovered fake stamp papers and affidavits and traced financial transactions exceeding Rs383.8 million.
Muhammad Waqas, the petitioner in the IHC case, was identified as Mr Cyan’s farm employee, who had received the funds from land provider Faisal Mumtaz and the Pakistan Navy Benevolent Association. Mr Waqas, who earned Rs50,000 a month, withdrew or transferred Rs326.95m.
Another employee, Aleem Sohail, and his wife Ms Sohail — the woman allegedly abducted — were also found to have received large unexplained deposits.
The JEC expressed astonishment that the PNBA and Mr Mumtaz paid such huge sums to a farm worker without verifying ownership or contacting the actual landowner.
It recommended the cancellation of the fraudulent mutation, legal action against those involved, freezing of assets, as well as reforms in property registration and biometric verification systems.

Once a political outsider, Mamdani’s campaign has surged, powered by young progressive volunteers and growing frustration over the city’s soaring cost of living.
His pledge to freeze rents for two million New Yorkers in rent-stabilised properties has resonated in a city where affordable housing is increasingly out of reach.
If elected, Mamdani would be New York’s first Muslim mayor — a historic milestone. Observers, however, note that his popularity stems primarily from his progressive and socialist positions rather than his faith.

Mamdani champions labour unions, wealth taxation, expanded public transit, and climate-friendly housing.  He also emphasises social inclusion, protecting undocumented immigrants through sanctuary city policies, defending LGBTQ rights, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare and education.
These stances earned him strong support from younger and diverse voters, including African American and Hispanic communities.
“Mamdani has energised people who feel shut out of traditional politics,” said Moviz Siddiqui of Queens. “He talks about fairness and affordability in a way that connects with everyone — Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists — it doesn’t matter.”
Opponents have sought to make his faith an issue. Responding, Mr Mamdani pledged to embrace his Muslim identity more openly, calling such attacks “racist and baseless”.
“The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated the same as any other New Yorker,” he told a Muslim gathering outside a Brooklyn mosque on Friday.
Mamdani, who has denounced Israel’s military actions in Gaza as “genocide,” has faced online abuse and political backlash. Yet a Victory Insights poll from October 22-23 shows him leading former Governor Andrew Cuomo by 18 points, with 47 per cent support. Republican Curtis Sliwa stands at 16 pc.
After a long hesitation, Dem­ocratic leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have also endorsed Mamdani, signalling party unity ahead of the November 4 election.
 
 

Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers,” Mr Jeffries said.
Mr Schumer added, “He ran an impressive campaign that connected with New Yorkers about affordability, fairness, and opportunity,” defending him against conservative calls to denaturalise him.
Born in Kampala, Uganda, Mr Mamdani moved to New York as a child. His father is a Ugandan Mus­lim scholar, and his mother, Mira Nair, is a Hindu Indian filmmaker.
This diverse heritage has resonated across New York’s South Asian community, uniting voters from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.
Muslim leaders, however, remain divided. Councilwoman Shahana Hanif called Mamdani “a bridge-builder”, noting their shared work to heal post-9/11 divides. Meanwhile, New Jersey-based Nasir Qayyum Khan cautioned that Mamdani’s progressive stances may conflict with more conservative Muslim values.
Early voting in New York has grown steadily since 2019. In June’s mayoral primary, about 35 percent of ballots were cast early. This year, early voting runs through November 2, with Election Day on November 4. The winner will take office in January.

• Citizens urged to wear masks, avoid unnecessary outdoor activity
• PDMA says smog intensity expected to rise from Nov to mid-Dec
• Govt imposes blanket ban on stubble, solid waste, plastic burning
LAHORE: Lahore has ranked as the world’s most polluted city for the past three days, with air quality plummeting to hazardous levels as smog blanketed the city and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) hitting 412, prompting health warnings and a province-wide crackdown on pollution sources.
Data revealed that Lower Mall was the worst-affected neighbourhood, with an AQI of 680, followed by Iqbal Town (577), Syed Maratib Ali Road (543), Shadman (507), the Punjab University area (506), and Shalimar (495).
Environmental experts have urged residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activity, particularly in the morning and evening, and to wear masks when outside. PM2.5 concentrations in Lahore’s air are multiple times above global safety thresholds, raising risks of respiratory and cardiovascular illness among other serious health issues, especially for children and the elderly.
The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a high alert across eastern districts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur.
“The intensity of smog is expected to increase from November to mid-December,” warned DG PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, citing forecasts from the Meteorological Department. The PDMA has directed all commissioners and deputy commissioners to ensure the implementation of government measures to combat smog.
The authorities have announced a strict, multi-pronged strategy to tackle the pollution at its source. A comprehensive ban has been imposed on the burning of crop residues, solid waste, tires, plastic and rubber.
Mr Kathia stated that a case would be registered for any violation, including the burning of crop stubble and garbage.
Simultaneously, the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) has intensified its anti-smog operations, using advanced drone cameras to monitor industrial zones, agricultural land, and urban areas.
In the last 24 hours, this tech-driven initiative identified over 460 smog-related violations. More than 200 e-challans were issued to smoke-emitting vehicles, with real-time data shared with departments for immediate action.
While enforcement is critical, the government is also pushing for long-term, sustainable solutions. At a seminar in the Kabirwala town of Khanewal district, the Department of Environmental Protection and Climate Change educated farmers on using modern machinery to manage crop residue, particularly rice stubble, without burning.
Officials and experts highlighted that this waste can be repurposed in biomass plants to generate steam and energy, turning an environmental problem into an economic opportunity.
“Smog is a serious environmental and public health issue, requiring collective and coordinated efforts to address it,” said Project Coordinator Dr Younus Zahid.
As the government leverages technology for enforcement and promotes alternative farming practices, the public has been urged to play its part.
Citizens have been asked to report smog-inducing activities on the emergency helpline 15, with authorities emphasising that only a collective effort can clear the hazardous air and protect public health.
Earlier, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that nine departments were conducting large-scale operations against smog.
The minister said that the environmental protection force and the department were fully mobilised, that all sectoral squads were present in the field, and that brick kilns were being monitored through drones, in addition to issuing a live report.
She added that anti-smog cannons and air-quality monitors are deployed and that AQI forecasting, which she said has been introduced for the first time in Punjab, has enabled earlier interventions to curb pollution spikes.

• Insiders say decision ‘almost finalised’, incumbent premier may be given choice of ‘honourable exit’
ISLAMABAD: As the PPP plans to install its own prime minister in Azad Jammu Kashmir, the party lawmakers from the region separately met party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and President Asif Ali Zardari to mull options for the removal of the incumbent PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq.
Only a picture of Mr Zardari’s meeting with the lawmakers was issued by Saturday night, while a handout issued by the PPP regarding the meeting with Mr Bhutto-Zardari also did not mention the possibility of a no-confidence motion against the AJK premier. The party leaders discussed the AJK’s “political situation” in the meeting, said the official statement.
 
 

Sources, however, claimed the party meeting considered names for Mr Haq’s successor. They said the PPP had “almost finalised” the decision to oust the AJK prime minister through a no-trust motion. A formal decision, according to sources, is likely in a day or two.
The insiders said the party leaders deliberated upon all possible options, including giving some time to the AJK prime minister for “an honourable exit”, before making any move to remove the premier through a no-trust vote.
According to the sources, the meeting also explored potential successors, with Chaudhry Yaseen, Chaudhry Latif Akbar and Sardar Yaqoob emerging as strong contenders for the coveted post. In the AJK assembly, the PPP, with the support of the PML-N, has the support of more than 27 lawmakers — a magic number required to form the government. The PPP has 17 members in the house, 10 of whom are ministers and two are advisers, while AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar also hails from the PPP.
It may be noted that the PPP had already decided it would not remain a part of the government, but it remained undecided about whether to sit on the opposition benches or form its own government in the region.
Meanwhile, the official statement by the party said that Mr Bhutto-Zardari presided over the PPP AJK Parliamentary group meeting and “discussed the political situation” in AJK.
The statement added that the PPP leaders of the AJK chapter discussed improving the organisational structure of the party in the region and the current political situation in AJK.
The meeting was also attended by former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and former Kashmir affairs minister Qamar Zaman Kaira, who had recently led a federal government delegation to talk to the protesters in AJK and remained successful in ending the protest after an agreement was signed in the first week of October. At least 10 had been killed while scores were injured in clashes between the law enforcers and the protesters that lasted for days. PPP Women Wing’s Central President Faryal Talpur was also present in the meeting.
Others who attended the meeting included Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, Faisal Mumtaz, Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Sardar Javed Ayub, Sardar Muhammad Yaqub Khan, Mian Abdul Waheed, Javed Iqbal Bandhanvi, Syed Bazil Naqvi, Syed Zia Qamar, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Chaudhry Aamir Yasin, Aamir Ghaffar Lone, Javed Butt, Rafiq Nayyar, Nabila Ayub, Chaudhry Muhammad Riaz, and Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.
