However, the visuals do not show any Afghan missile test.
On Sunday, fierce border clashes between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban resulted in the martyrdom of 23 troops and left over 200 Taliban fighters dead, including a number of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan terrorists. Both nations claimed to have destroyed the border posts of the other side.
On Tuesday, fighting flared up again between the neighbours in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The next day, the third major skirmish also took place, with the Pakistani security forces saying an attack by the Afghan Taliban was repulsed in Spin Boldak, killing about 15-20 Taliban fighters.
Meanwhile, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said in a social media post that the Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”.
On October 16, a pro-Afghan account shared an image on X of a missile being fired. The caption of the post, which gained 83,000 views, said: “Breaking news: Afghanistan’s defence forces have successfully tested a missile capable of hitting a target up to 400 kilometres away. Our own missile … congratulations, from our hands to yours.”
The same image with a similar claim was shared by another Afghan user with the caption: “Reliable security sources say that Afghanistan’s defence forces have successfully tested a missile capable of striking targets at a range of 400 kilometres.” The post gained over 93,000 views.
Other Afghan users on X also shared the video and claim, as can be seen here, here, here and here; collectively gaining more than 76,000 views.
The image with the same claim was also shared by the Afghan government’s Urdu account on X, but was later deleted.
 


Some Indian accounts shared a video of the missile launch as well, gaining over 11,000 views.
Meanwhile, some users, Afghan and Indian, shared a different and longer video with the same claim, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, gaining over 35,500 views collectively.
Russian news outlet RT International also shared the video with a similar claim, but later deleted the post.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter.
A keyword search conducted to corroborate whether any such missile tests were conducted in Afghanistan yielded no news or video reports from any mainstream and credible Afghan or international media outlets.
The search also did not yield any news reports in general about the current Afghan regime having any such missile capabilities.
A reverse image search for the first image and video yielded a news report dated February 24, 2023, from South Korean media outlet YTN titled: ‘North Korea: Yesterday, we launched four strategic cruise missiles into the East Sea … a show of nuclear warfare readiness’.
Sharing the same visuals, YTN reported North Korea’s launch of four Arrow-2 strategic cruise missiles into the East Sea on February 23 to test its nuclear warfare readiness.
The missile test was also covered in a news report by international wire news agency Reuters on February 24, 2023, titled: ‘North Korea test-fires cruise missiles to demonstrate nuclear counterattack’.
Meanwhile, a reverse image search for the second and longer video yielded a May 10, 2025, YouTube video by Pakistani financial news outlet Business Recorder titled: “‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’: Pakistan’s Fatah-1 missile fired at Indian airbase”.
The video showed a missile launched by the Pakistan Army at an Indian airbase during the fighting between the two countries in May 2025.
The claim that viral visuals show the Afghanistan military conducting a missile test amid the recent hostilities with Pakistan is false. The videos are from older unrelated events and there is no evidence for Afghanistan conducting any such test.</p><small>2025-10-17 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1718303634da4b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949553/trump-says-he-expects-expansion-of-abraham-accords-soon' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he expects expansion of Abraham accords soon</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said he expected an expansion of the Abraham Accords soon and hopes Saudi Arabia will join the pact that normalised diplomatic relations between Israel and some Arab states.
“I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in,” Trump said in an interview broadcast on Friday on Fox Business Network.
Trump said he had “some very good conversations” as recently as Wednesday with states that have indicated their willingness to join the accords.
“I think that they’re going to all go in very soon,” Trump said in the interview, which was recorded on Thursday.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed the accords in 2020 during Trump’s first term in the White House, breaking a longstanding taboo to become the first Arab states to recognise Israel in a quarter century. Morocco and Sudan followed suit.
Trump, who convened Muslim and European leaders in Egypt to discuss the future of the Gaza Strip on Monday, has presented his plan to end the onslaught in Gaza as the catalyst for a wider regional peace settlement.
He said then that more countries would join the Abraham Accords initiative and even floated the idea of a peace deal between arch Middle East enemies Iran and Israel, telling the Israeli parliament he thought Iran wanted one: “Wouldn’t it be nice?”
Earlier in June, Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the Abraham Accords, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.
“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”</p><small>2025-10-17 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/171917258de4421.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949556/pakistan-and-afghanistan-extend-ceasefire-confirms-diplomatic-source' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and Afghanistan extend ceasefire, confirms diplomatic source</strong></a><br><p>The temporary ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been extended, a senior diplomatic source confirmed to Dawn.com on Friday.
The Pakistani delegation is still in Pakistan and is scheduled to depart for Doha tomorrow morning, said security sources.
On the night of October 11, Afghanistan launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, triggering a series of skirmishes that carried on until Wednesday, leaving 23 troops martyred and over 200 Taliban fighters dead.
The Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and the capital Kabul. A temporary ceasefire was agreed at Afghanistan’s request for 48 hours, which expired at 6pm today.
“The temporary ceasefire was extended at the request of the Afghan Taliban government,” the source said. “High-level talks are expected to begin on Saturday.”
Islamabad Kabul working to resolve ‘complex but solvable’ issue
Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) stated that Pakistan and Afghanistan are sincerely working towards resolving the “complex but solvable” issue of border clashes amid a temporary ceasefire.
During a weekly press briefing at the FO, spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan highlighted that during the 48-hour ceasefire, both sides were making “sincere efforts to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue”.
“Pakistan greatly values dialogue and diplomacy and a mutually beneficial relationship with Afghanistan,” he said. “At the same time, the Government of Pakistan continues to closely monitor the situation and would take all possible measures to safeguard its territory and the lives of its people.”
 


Khan added that Pakistan wants a “peaceful, stable, friendly, inclusive, regionally connected, and prosperous Afghanistan” but highlighted that Kabul needs to fulfil its obligations and promises under the Doha Process. He also reiterated Pakistan’s requests to the Afghan Taliban to prohibit the use of their soil for terrorism.
“Pakistan has repeatedly shared its concerns related to the presence of Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan operating from Afghan soil,” Khan said.
“Pakistan expects concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime.”
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Islamabad was ready to talk if Kabul agreed to fulfil Pakistan’s “justified” conditions following recent hostilities between the two countries.
“Yesterday we decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready. The ball is in their court,” he said during a cabinet meeting.
Last week, the FO censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during a visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace.
“Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves,” he said, seemingly in response to Pakistan’s repeated requests to prevent terrorists from operating in Afghan territory. He added that there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan.
The FO responded by saying terrorism was not an internal problem and highlighted the presence of Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan in Afghan territory.
The border clashes come against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty.
While Kabul maintains that it does not provide safe havens to terrorists, Afghan officials blamed Pakistan on Friday for bombing a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line and also violating the territory of the capital Kabul. This was after an explosion was reported in Afghanistan last Thursday night.
The FO in Islamabad avoided directly acknowledging the incident in Kabul during a weekly briefing last Friday, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil.
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the Inter-Services Public Relations director general also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out any strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-17 16:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17181302fcdf95a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949545/at-least-71-new-dengue-cases-confirmed-in-kp-experts-link-rise-to-climate-change' target='_blank'><strong>At least 71 new dengue cases confirmed in KP; experts link rise to climate change</strong></a><br><p>At least 71 new dengue cases were confirmed across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the last 24 hours, according to a situation report issued on Friday by the Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response System (IDSRS) at the Directorate-General Health Services (DGHS).
The report stated that 27 of the new patients were hospitalised, bringing the total number of currently hospitalised dengue cases in the province to 48. So far this year, KP has recorded a total of 3,582 laboratory-confirmed cases, 1,474 hospitalisations, 3,314 recoveries, and two deaths.
Provincial Medical Entomologist at the DGHS Dengue Control Programme, Salahuddin Khan Marwat, told Dawn.com, “Climate change is a key factor in the spread of the disease to new areas.”
Marwat said the current weather conditions, persistent humidity, monsoon rains, and temperatures between 18 to 25 degrees Celsius, have created an ideal environment for mosquito breeding.
“This is why we see a spike in cases in October. The mosquitoes breed rapidly in these conditions,” he said, adding that both very high and very low temperatures slow down their reproduction.
He explained that previously, dengue was confined to districts like Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad. “But now, cases have been reported in Chitral. Global warming and increased travel contribute to this spread,” he said.
According to the entomologist, the provincial government has prepared for potential outbreaks by designating 1,500 to 1,600 beds for dengue patients across all districts. “Around 400,000 test kits have also been procured and distributed to district health offices based on need,” he said.
He cautioned, however, against the indiscriminate use of insecticide sprays. “Sprays can kill beneficial insects like honeybees, butterflies, and fireflies and also lead to resistance. Globally, environmental cleaning and prevention of mosquito breeding are prioritised over spraying,” he noted.
Marwat stressed the need for public cooperation to curb dengue spread. “There are about 200,000 houses in Peshawar. If each household spends 20 minutes cleaning water containers and surroundings, we can clean the entire city in a day,” Marwat said.
He added that awareness campaigns, school programmes, and the government’s Dengue Action Plan are already in motion, but community engagement remains the biggest challenge.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Caused by the dengue virus, it leads to high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and in severe cases, internal bleeding or organ failure, according to the World Health Organisation.
With no specific treatment available, prevention focuses on mosquito control and protection from bites. The disease spreads rapidly in tropical and subtropical regions, often overwhelming health systems during seasonal outbreaks.</p><small>2025-10-17 15:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/171932293a8186b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949557/kremlin-envoy-proposes-putin-trump-tunnel-to-link-russia-and-us' target='_blank'><strong>Kremlin envoy proposes ‘Putin-Trump tunnel’ to link Russia and US</strong></a><br><p>Russia and the United States should build a “Putin-Trump” rail tunnel under the Bering Strait to link their countries, unlock joint exploration of natural resources and “symbolise unity”, a Kremlin envoy has suggested.
The proposal by Kirill Dmitriev, President Vladimir Putin’s investment envoy and head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, envisages a construction project costing $8 billion, funded by Moscow and “international partners”, to build a 70-mile (112-km) rail and cargo link in under eight years.
Dmitriev, who has helped spearhead a Russian charm offensive designed to revive US-Russia ties, floated the idea late on Thursday after Putin spoke to US President Donald Trump by phone and agreed to meet in Budapest to seek a way to stop the war in Ukraine.
Musk’s ‘boring company’ proposed as contractor
“The dream of a US-Russia link via the Bering Strait reflects an enduring vision from the 1904 Siberia-Alaska railway to Russia’s 2007 plan. RDIF has studied existing proposals, including the US-Canada-Russia-China railroad, and will support the most viable,” Dmitriev wrote on X.
The Bering Strait, 51 miles (82 km) wide at its narrowest point, separates Russia’s vast and sparsely populated Chukotka region from Alaska. Ideas to link them have been around for at least 150 years. The small Diomede islands, one Russian and one belonging to the US, sit in the middle of the strait, only 2.4 miles (4 km) apart.
Dmitriev, who has struck up a relationship with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, and suggested US energy majors could join Russian projects in the Arctic, proposed that the tunnel be built by The Boring Company, a US tunnel construction company owned by US billionaire and sometime Trump ally Elon Musk.
“Imagine connecting the US and Russia, the Americas and the Afro-Eurasia with the Putin-Trump Tunnel - a 70-mile link symbolising unity. Traditional costs are $65B+, but @boringcompany’s tech could reduce it to <$8B. Let’s build a future together,” Dmitriev wrote to Musk on X.
 






There was no immediate public response from Musk or Trump.
Beyond the tunnel itself, it would cost a huge sum to build and upgrade infrastructure on both sides of the strait. Chukotka’s existing roads and railways are sparse, at best.
Dmitriev said a plan for a “Kennedy-Khrushchev World Peace Bridge” over the strait had been floated during the Cold War. He posted a sketch from that era of the route it might have taken, with a graphic showing the route the new tunnel could take.
“RDIF has already invested in and built the first-ever Russia-China railroad bridge. The time has come to do more and connect the Continents for the first time in human history. The time has come to connect Russia and the US,” Dmitriev said.</p><small>2025-10-17 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629095-pakistan-afghanistan-48-hour-ceasefire-extended' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-Afghanistan 48-hour ceasefire extended amid reports of Doha talks</strong></a><br><p>

The slain civil rights leader’s estate and OpenAI announced the decision in a joint statement late Thursday, saying the company would pause generations depicting King while it “strengthens guardrails for historical figures.”
The move comes as families of deceased celebrities and leaders have expressed outrage over OpenAI’s Sora 2 video tool, which allows users to create realistic-looking clips of historical figures without family consent.
Some users had generated videos showing King making monkey noises during his “I Have a Dream” speech and other demeaning content, according to The Washington Post.
Videos reanimating other dead figures, including Malcolm X, Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Amy Winehouse, have flooded social media since Sora 2’s launch on September 30.
“While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,” the joint statement said.
The company said authorised representatives or estate owners can now request that their likenesses not be used in the AI-generated videos, known as “Sora cameos.”
OpenAI thanked Bernice King, King’s daughter, who serves on behalf of the estate, “for reaching out” as well as businessman John Hope Bryant and the AI Ethics Council “for creating space for conversations like this.”
The text-to-video tool has rocketed to the top of download charts since its launch, but sparked immediate controversy.
Actor Robin Williams’s daughter Zelda Williams pleaded with people on Instagram to “stop sending me AI videos of dad,” calling the content “maddening.”
Ilyasah Shabazz, daughter of Malcolm X, told The Washington Post it was “deeply disrespectful” to see her father’s image used in crude and insensitive AI videos.
Malcolm X was assassinated in front of Shabazz in 1965 when she was two years old.
OpenAI had initially exempted “historical figures” from consent requirements when it launched Sora 2 last month, allowing anyone to create fake videos resurrecting public figures.
Sora 2 has already raised opposition from Hollywood, with the creative industry furious at OpenAI’s opt-out policy when it came to the use of its copyrighted characters and content in generated videos.
Disney sent a sharply worded letter to OpenAI in late September stating it “is not required to ‘opt out’ of inclusion of its works” to preserve its copyright rights.
Amid the pushback, OpenAI promised that it would give more “granular control” to rights holders.
After the launch of the Sora 2 app, the tool usually refused requests for videos featuring Disney or Marvel characters, some users said.
However, clips showing characters from other US franchises, as well as Japanese characters from popular games and anime series, were widely shared.</p><small>2025-10-17 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1717260209ad2f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949549/pakistan-still-looking-forward-to-semi-final-chance-says-omaima-ahead-of-new-zealand-world-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan still looking forward to semi-final chance, says Omaima ahead of New Zealand World Cup clash</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan opener Omaima Sohail said on Friday that the team was still looking forward to a chance to make the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup , ahead of their clash with New Zealand on Saturday.
On Wednesday, Pakistan’s hopes of a first victory at the World Cup were hit by rain, with their crucial fixture against England being abandoned after a second downpour in Colombo.
Chasing a revised target of 113 to win after earlier rains had reduced the match to 31 overs per side, Pakistan were well on their way at 34-0 in 6.4 overs when rains returned to end any chance of the match being completed — saving England from their first ever loss against the Green Shirts.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference at the R. Pramedasa Stadium in Colombo, Omaima said: “We are not relaxed at all. We have a chance to go [to the] semis if we win the matches, like three matches.
“So maybe the scenario is open, so maybe we will win the three matches, so we have a chance in the semis.”
 
 

Omaima showed glimpses of form in the England encounter, hitting a couple of sublime drives through the covers on her way to an unbeaten run-a-ball 18.
She, along with fellow opener Muneeba Ali, will be pivotal to providing stability at the top for a batting line-up that has failed to cross the 200-run mark in the tournament so far.
“I think the main challenge is to open — play the new ball. If you saw the matches, they are seaming and the pitch is [helping] seam. I’m trying to play the new ball and working on it,” the right-handed batter said of the challenges of opening.
Pakistan’s bowling, however, has been the real positive for the Green Shirts so far — having strong sides like England and Australia 78-7 and 76-7 in back-to-back matches.
New Zealand head coach Ben Sawyer was also wary about the danger posed by the Pakistani bowling at the presser.
“From Pakistan, Yeah. Look, they’ve put some teams in some real tough spots, so I think they had Australia 6 for 60. And then obviously the other night England was 7 for 70. So, their bowling attack is one that we’ve got to be really wary of.
Sawyer also spoke about the improvements seen in the Pakistani top-order in the previous outing against England, saying: “Their top order is, they made a little bit — look like light work of maybe chasing down that total the other night. So, they’ve been impressive.”
The Kiwis also go into the encounter with a washout of their own against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. The match got called off after Sri Lanka scored a daunting 258-6 batting first.
Last week‘s defeat against Australia had left the Green Shirts’ knockout hopes hanging by a thread as Pakistan registered three losses on the trot.
Pakistan will be hoping to register their first win and get on the board on Saturday, and then hope the permutations and other teams’ results go in their favour to make it into the semis somehow — a quintessentially Pakistani World Cup experience.</p><small>2025-10-17 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949476/going-nowhere' target='_blank'><strong>Going nowhere</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN has done it again. The country has held on to its spot near the bottom of the Henley Passport Index, ranking 103rd out of 106, just above Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. For the fifth time in a row, our passport holds the dubious distinction of being among the world’s least powerful. Consistency demands commitment and successive governments have shown plenty of that, especially when it comes to standing still. While others jostle up and down the index, Pakistan’s passport remains a model of stability. Holders of the green booklet can travel visa-free to a grand total of 31 destinations — a list that mostly includes islands most have never heard of and countries one might only encounter in a geography quiz. Meanwhile, top spot holders, Singaporeans, can breeze into 193 destinations, and South Koreans into 190.
One could blame geopolitics, global suspicion, or our own bureaucratic enthusiasm for paperwork. But the truth is that passport strength reflects far more than airport convenience: it mirrors international trust, governance standards and economic credibility. The weaker the state, the weaker its passport. And ours, sadly, carries the weight of poor diplomacy, inconsistent policies, and a brand image that does not inspire confidence abroad. What can be done? For starters, the government might invest in the kind of soft power that cannot be stamped or embossed — improving governance, security, and regional relationships. Trade, tourism and academic exchange do more for mobility than slogans about ‘image building’. A modern passport design or biometric upgrade will not help if the world continues to view Pakistan as unpredictable rather than a reliable partner with a coherent vision for engagement. Until then, Pakistanis can take comfort in the one privilege our passport still offers: the ability to stay firmly grounded. After all, who really needs jet lag anyway?
Published in Dawn, October 17th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-17 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17174732e866a0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949548/more-than-14m-afghans-repatriated-no-further-extension-by-govt' target='_blank'><strong>More than 1.4m Afghans repatriated, no further extension by govt</strong></a><br><p>A high-level meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was informed on Friday that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals have been repatriated and the government will grant no further extension.
A drive to expel more than 1.3 million Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders, the last category of refugees legally living in the country without visas, has been underway since Sept 1 this year.
According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the meeting’s attendees were told that only those Afghans who possess a valid Pakistani visa would be allowed to stay in Pakistan and the number of exit points on the Afghan side are being increased to make the repatriation process smoother and faster.
“Officials informed the meeting that harboring Afghan nationals residing illegally in Pakistan or allowing them to stay in guesthouses is a criminal offense, and efforts are underway to identify such individuals. The public will be involved in the repatriation process, and no one will be allowed to violate government policy by providing shelter to Afghan nationals,” stated the statement from the PMO.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that during the repatriation of illegal Afghan refugees, elderly persons, women, children, and minorities must be treated with dignity.
The meeting was attended by Chief of the Staff Army Field Marshall Asim Munir, chief ministers of all provinces except KP, premier of Azad Kashmir, federal ministers and other officials.
Referring to Afghanistan, the prime minister said that senior Pakistani officials, including the deputy prime minister, had visited Kabul multiple times to hold discussions with the Afghan interim government, urging them to prevent Afghan soil from being used for terrorism against Pakistan.
“Pakistan has made serious diplomatic and political efforts to stop the infiltration of militants from Afghanistan,” said the prime minister during the meeting.
“The brave people of Pakistan, who have lost loved ones in the war against terrorism, now ask: how long will the government continue to bear the burden of Afghan refugees?”
The prime minister maintained that the recent attack on the border areas of Pakistan from Afghanistan and support for terrorist infiltration is a “matter of serious concern”.
“The brave armed forces of Pakistan gave a strong and decisive response to this attack. Under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled the Afghan attacks. The entire nation joins me in paying tribute to them,“ added Shehbaz.
Concluding the meeting, the premier urged all provinces to extend full cooperation regarding the repatriation of Afghan refugees. The forum also decided that all recommendations presented would be “strictly implemented”.
The UN’s refugee agency had reported that more than 3.5 million Afghans had been living in Pakistan, including around 700,000 people who came after the Taliban takeover in 2021. The UN estimated that half of them were undocumented.
Though Pakistan had taken care of Afghans during the past decades of war, the government is now compelled to say that the high number of refugees is eventually posing risks to national security and causing pressure on public services.</p><small>2025-10-17 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17173342102ddbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949546/56-magnitude-quake-jostles-kp-twin-cities-and-other-regions-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.6-magnitude quake jostles KP, twin cities and other regions: PMD</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and other northern areas were jolted by tremors on Friday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).

The PMD stated that the quake’s epicentre was in the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) registered a 4.7 magnitude quake less than 30km from the western Pak-Afghan border, at a depth of 10km at 4:53pm.
However, USGS also registered a 5.5 magnitude earthquake less than 10km Pakistan’s northern border with Afghanistan. This one was registered at 5:15pm at a depth of 10km.

Last week, a magnitude 5 earthquake struck close to Punjab’s Layyah on Saturday night, according to the PMD. The department said the quake occurred 50km east of Layyah at 7:54pm at a depth of 20km.

Birmingham-based Villa said the club had been informed by the Safety Advisory Group (SAG), responsible for issuing certificates for matches, that no away fans would be permitted at the Europa League match on November 6.
“Shameful decision! I call on the UK authorities to reverse this coward decision,” the foreign minister of Israel, Gideon Saar, posted on X.
 






A UK police commissioner asked local officials to review the decision as criticism of the ban mounted, including from Starmer and European governing body UEFA.
Starmer, a keen football fan, called the move “wrong”.
“We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets. The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation,” Starmer wrote on X.
 






A spokesman for the prime minister said on Friday that conversations were “happening at pace across government and with all the relevant groups to find a way to resolve this”.
Britain’s Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, whose brief includes sport, was set to meet interior ministry officials and other stakeholders.
UEFA, which runs the Europa League, called on the clubs and authorities to
“agree on the implementation of appropriate measures necessary to allow” Maccabi fans to be able to attend.
Simon Foster, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands area, which covers Villa Park, called on SAG and the police to “conduct an immediate review” to determine whether the ban is “appropriate” and
“necessary”.
But a number of left-wing independent and Green politicians in Britain backed the ban, with some calling for the wider exclusion of Israeli teams from international competitions over the war in Gaza, similar to the sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa.
Public safety concerns
Villa issued a statement on Thursday saying West Midlands Police had advised the SAG they had “public safety concerns outside the stadium bowl and the ability to deal with any potential protests on the night”.
Police said they had classified the fixture as “high risk” following a “thorough assessment”.
“This decision is based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the 2024 UEFA Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam,” a spokesperson for the West Midlands force said.
Last November’s match between Dutch side Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv resulted in two days of violent clashes between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli fans.
Supporters of the Israeli team were assaulted in Amsterdam in hit-and-run attacks.
The attacks were the culmination of skirmishes in which Maccabi fans chanted anti-Arab songs, vandalised a taxi and pulled down a Palestinian flag.
Emily Damari, a British-Israeli who was captured during Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and held captive for more than a year, said the ban would prevent her from going to watch Maccabi, the team she supports.
“Football is a way of bringing people together irrespective of their faith, colour or religion, and this disgusting decision does the exact opposite,” she said in a statement.
Maccabi fan Tamir Nahson, 37, a wine importer in Israel, told AFP it was a “missed opportunity”.
“It’s very painful that the (country) has become the UK for anti-Semitism.
It’s very painful, it’s very unpleasant for us and I guess it’s also disappointing for Aston Villa fans.”
Maccabi Tel Aviv chief executive Jack Angelides told BBC radio the team had travelled to other countries where he said the sentiment is “not so kind towards Israeli teams” but the police “were out in force” and there were no incidents.
Villa are third in the Europa League standings while Maccabi Tel Aviv are 30th after two rounds.
Global soccer body FIFA has faced repeated calls to act over the war in Gaza, with Palestinian officials pressing for Israel to be suspended from international football.
The issue has been under review by FIFA for months, but no decision has yet been taken, with FIFA president Gianni Infantino consistently saying such matters require consensus with the confederations and must be handled with caution.
Earlier this month, FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani said Israel’s continued participation in international football has to be dealt with first and foremost by UEFA.
UEFA appeared poised for an emergency vote on suspending Israel from European competition last month but reportedly held off on a proposed vote following the announcement of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war in the region.</p><small>2025-10-17 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1714344259d28b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949500/summary-for-banning-tlp-forwarded-to-centre-says-punjab-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Summary for banning TLP forwarded to Centre, says Punjab minister</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said on Friday that the provincial government had forwarded the summary for banning the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to the Centre.
“The Punjab cabinet has given its approval for banning the TLP, and this has been forwarded to the Centre. So the legal requirement with regard to the provinces has been fulfilled. The provincial government, after giving its approval, has forwarded the summary to the Centre,” she said at a press conference in Lahore.
Her statement comes a day after the Punjab government decided to ask the Centre to ban the TLP, which had conducted a protest march “in solidarity with Gaza”, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy.
However, on Monday, the authorities launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke, where the TLP had set up its protest camp on its way to its planned destination. The move by law enforcement agencies had triggered violent clashes, chaos dozens of arrests, resulting in the protest’s premature end.
There have been reports of authorities going down hard on the TLP since.
At the outset of her press conference today, Bokhari, without naming the TLP, also referred to “a protest called in the name of Gaza”, noting that the demonstration was “illogically” held even after a truce to end the Israeli onslaught in the strip went into effect.
She added that the protest had turned “bloody as always”.
“This is not the first time that this party — or I would rather call it a group — has resorted to such acts. Be it 2017, 2019, 2021 or 2022, there have been repeated attempts to paralyse the lives of people and shut the country down,” Bokhari added, apparently referring to the TLP’s previous protests that had turned violent.
“We saw a continuity of those instances this time as well,” the minister added. “The only difference this time was that the state and government together decided that this could not continue anymore. Pakistan cannot afford this anymore.”
The minister emphasised that everybody needed to think about how attempts were made to create chaos in the name of religion.
She further asserted that when the protesters had taken to the streets recently, multiple attempts were made to “engage them”, rejecting the accusations that the relevant authorities had not tried to resolve the issue through dialogue.
“They were engaged repeatedly, and requests were made to them. They were told that people are celebrating in Gaza,” she said, accusing the protesters of setting vehicles on fire and inflicting violence on policemen. “Were they (police personnel and vehicles) a hurdle in the way of resolving the issue of Gaza?” Bokhari raised the question.
Referring to a protest call for today after Friday prayers, she thanked the trader community, transporters and the public for “rejecting the call”.
Earlier this week, a statement by TLP Balochistan president Wazir Ahmad Rizvi had called on protesters to converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar today. Meanwhile, intelligence reports suggested that TLP activists may engage in violent clashes and widespread chaos after Friday prayer.
Separately, a group named Tanzeemat-i-Ahle Sunnat — which is not linked to the TLP — had also given a protest call for today, demanding a judicial inquiry into the Muridke operation.
Meanwhile, a Dawn report said police had planned a crackdown to round up the TLP leadership to scuttle its plans for protests today.
Speaking of the protest call for today, Bokhari had two videos played during the press conference, which she said were from Lahore and Rawalpindi today. In those videos, she said, life could be seen continuing as usual.
“So now, everybody should understand once and for all that they cannot be allowed to paralyse or shut the country down on the pretext of any excuse.”
Bokhari then shared that 1,648 policemen had been injured during last week’s protest, of whom she said 202 personnel were severely injured. “Was it a peaceful protest then?” she questioned.
Before outlining a set of decisions taken by the Punjab government following the protest, she clarified that these measures were not against any “religious party, group or faith”.
“They are against only that extremist group, which has a history of creating a law and order situation in this country. The group that has been involved in inciting people […] and killings.”
Detailing the decisions, she said the Punjab government had forwarded the summary to the federal government for banning the TLP.
It may be mentioned here that the federal government had banned the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA.
The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march towards Islamabad.
In a meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab government also decided to seek a ban on the party again and move to place the TLP leadership in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The Fourth Schedule is a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism under the 1997 Anti-Terrorism Act.
Mentioning other measures taken yesterday, Bokhari said there would be “zero-tolerance” concerning the use of loudspeakers to “spread hatred or incite others”.
Bokhari further said that cases would be registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) for “uploading hateful content on social media, glorifying the protest and presenting it as a national cause”.
“Some arrests have been made [in this connection],” she said, adding that the “information department will also send a request for action under Peca over a post on [incarcerated PTI founder] Imran Khan’s X account that said 400-600 people had died”.
Again making an apparent reference to the TLP, she said, “All social media and bank accounts of the extremist party will be sealed. A lot of work on this has already been done”.
Moreover, she said, there was a complete ban on the display of weapons and from now on, weapons’ licences would not be issued in Punjab.
“Anyone in possession of illegal weapons is requested to submit them [to the relevant authorities] within a month; otherwise, cases would be registered against them under the terrorism law.
“And those in possession of legal weapons will have to get them registered at Khidmat centres, otherwise legal action will also be taken against them,” she elaborated.
Citing figures of cases of attempts to create anarchy, she said 108 such first information reports had been registered in Punjab in 2025 so far. Of those, she added, 71 were registered under the terrorism law.
“This trend shows that in 2025, a plan was hatched to worsen the situation in Punjab,” she alleged. Apparently referring to the PTI, she said that another party had tried to join today’s protest, the call for which was rejected by the people. “This is a slap for the two extremist groups that called the protest,” she said.
Separately, Pakistan Ulema Council chairman Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi also addressed a press conference where he apparently made a reference to the TLP and its protest last week.
Without naming anyone, he said, “The dialogue was underway till the last moment. The talks were very positive […] but unfortunately, there was no implementation, resulting in the loss of policemen, Rangers personnel, security institutions and the common man.”
He stressed the need to put an end to the trend of violence and thanked all religious scholars who had contributed to attempts of “making peace”.
Punjab IG’s warning
Earlier today, Punjab Inspector General (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar had also warned that no individual or group would be allowed to take the law into their hands.
A post on Punjab police’s account on social media platform X quoted IGP Anwar as saying that his department was actively ensuring the safety of people’s lives and properties, supremacy of law and maintenance of peace across the province.
“Punjab police is standing with civil society and the trader community, who have rejected the call for the protest and strike and expressed their resolve for [maintaining] peace and stability,” the statement quoted the police chief as saying.
It said he “strongly condemned violent protests, arson and illegal activities”, warning that no individual or group would be allowed to take the law into their hands. He also warned that “indiscriminate” action would be taken against those violating the law.
The IGP also assured the full implementation of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure — a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period — to ensure the safety of private and public properties.
The Punjab government had imposed Section 144 across the province yesterday for two days.
 






A subsequent post by the police said security was on high alert across the province on the directive of the IGP.
“Punjab police has further tightened foolproof security arrangements in the province, including Lahore. On the directive of Punjab IGP, instructions have been issued to all field officers to remain on high alert and take immediate measures to ensure the protection of the lives and property of the public,” the statement said.
It added that district police officers, special branch personnel and the counter-terrorism department had been directed “to keep a close eye on suspicious activities”.
 






In another statement posted around noon, police said that the situation was normal in cities across Punjab.
 






In an earlier post specifically mentioning Multan and Bhakkar, a statement quoted IGP Anwar as saying that “under no circumstances will anybody be allowed to take the law into their hands under the guise of protests or strikes”.
 






The IGP had issued similar warnings yesterday as well, saying, “We have decided to treat the violators under anti-terrorism and other heinous charges to take them to the court of law for punishment up to 10 and 14 years.”
Later, a police handout said Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran had reviewed security arrangements in different areas of the city while all divisional superintendents, sub-divisional police officers and station house officers were in the field.
The handout quoted the DIG as saying that security had been increased at all commercial and public spots in the city and that police would not let miscreants “destroy the peace of the city at any cost”.
He said “special security duties” had been assigned to police personnel to ensure peace in the city, while anybody who took the law into their hands would be dealt with strictly.
The handout said he instructed that strict legal action should be taken against those creating a law and order situation under the guise of protests.
On Thursday, four cabinet members also said that the crackdown on TLP office-bearers would continue. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Fed­e­r­­al Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf and Min­is­ter of State for Interior Talal Chaud­h­ry described the TLP as a group of anarchists and arsonists that had no political agenda except to challenge the authority of the state.
“The TLP leadership has been deceiving the nation from the very beginning. We were holding talks with them even before the protest march commenced, but they never stood firm on any commitment,“ Naqvi said.
LHC seeks replies from Punjab govt, police
Earlier today, the Lahore High Court (LHC) sought replies from the Punjab government and police on October 23 on pleas filed by the TLP. The pleas seek return of bodies of the TLP’s workers allegedly killed during the law-enforcement operation in Muridke and medical treatment for those injured.
Justice Shehram Sarwar Chaudhry presided over the hearing during which Advocate Naseem Usman represented the TLP.
The petitions, which were accepted for hearing yesterday, contend that the government carried out an operation against the party’s workers who were staging a peaceful march in Muridke. The party claimed that over 600 of its workers had been killed in the operation, while its chief Saad Rizvi and his younger brother also sustained bullet injuries.
It alleged that both Saad and his brother Anas Rizvi, among others, have been abducted by the law-enforcement agencies.
The party further alleges that the authorities refused to hand over the bodies of the victims to their families. It has asked the court to direct the government and police authorities to return the deceased workers’ bodies and ensure that the injured are provided medical treatment at government hospitals.
The pleas also seek directions for the authorities to produce Saad Rizvi and other detained leaders before the relevant court. The TLP further seeks possession of its headquarters on Lahore’s Multan Road, allegedly taken over by the law-enforcement authorities.

In July, the country created its third marine protected area around Miani Hor, a swampy coastal lagoon approximately 100km west of Karachi. This joins Astola Island and Churna Island, created in 2017 and 2024, respectively. These are meant to become safe havens for corals, fish and other marine species.
But the reality of Pakistan’s marine protected areas (MPAs) is trawlers sweeping the seabed, discarded “ghost nets” entangling marine life, and fishers shocking their catch with electric currents.
Pakistan has promised to protect 30 per cent of its ocean by 2030. At present, these three MPAs cover less than 1 per cent.
“Pakistan is a very terrestrial country and most conservation efforts are based there, as people are starting to understand the issues and are loud about the problems,” explains Rab Nawaz, senior director for biodiversity programmes at WWF-Pakistan. He worries that Pakistan’s sea is consequently being overlooked: “We are already losing much of the country’s marine life due to poorly planned development activities, and climate change.”
Pakistan’s ocean promises
Ocean health is key to humanity’s survival. The ocean is responsible for half of all oxygen production on Earth and offsets about a quarter of all manmade CO2 emissions. It has also been estimated to store 91pc of the excess heat trapped in Earth’s climate system by increasing greenhouse gases.
Pakistan, along with the 195 other countries that have ratified the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, adopted the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) in 2022. This framework sets a target for countries to conserve at least 30pc of terrestrial and inland water areas, and at least 30pc of marine and coastal areas, by 2030.
With less than five years left until that deadline, progress towards this “30×30” goal has been uneven.

Experts told Dialogue Earth that Pakistan’s three MPAs cover just 1,262 sq km of the 240,000 sq km of ocean under its jurisdiction (or 0.5pc). This sort of shortfall is not unique to South Asia, where most signatories to the biodiversity convention are struggling. Bangladesh has designated 8.0pc of its marine areas as MPAs, India has managed 0.3pc, the Maldives less than 0.1pc and Sri Lanka 0.3pc. This is according to SkyTruth, which tracks the world’s progress towards 30×30.
How are Pakistan’s MPAs created?
Creating MPAs has proven to be a challenge in Pakistan, but the process itself is relatively straightforward.
First comes baseline studies of a potential area. Once this is selected, residents, local fishers, governments and authorities who have an interest in the area are approached for comment.
Next, proposals go to a national coordinating body for further recommendations and a decision. This body includes representatives from the Ministry of Defence, fishing departments, port authorities, civil society and the wildlife departments of Pakistan’s two coastal provinces, Sindh and Balochistan. It is chaired by the climate change ministry, with the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) acting as convener.
In practice, however, this process can take years. Miani Hor was first proposed in 2013 and only came into being this year.

Once the national coordinating body has made a decision, the relevant provincial government issues a formal MPA notification document. This establishes its boundaries and protection measures, such as restrictions on fishing.
The Churna and Miani MPA notifications state the intention to protect and restore habitats, biodiversity and ecological processes impacted by human activities. They establish restrictions on taking endangered species, including corals, marine mammals and whale sharks. They ban explosives, chemicals, scuba guns and spear guns. And they make prior permission a requisite for sports, including scuba diving and power boating.
However, some say these protections are often not implemented.
Astola Island: Tourism and trawling
The isolated island of Astola, approximately 25 km off Pakistan’s coast in the Arabian Sea, was designated an MPA in 2017 to protect biodiversity around its coast, including coral species, turtles and whales.
The waters around the island also provide a livelihood for fishers from the mainland who voyage there on small boats twice a month. These fishing communities celebrated Astola’s MPA designation at the time.
“We were overjoyed with the prospect that the government would finally intervene to halt the activities that over the years diminished our catch,” recalls Abdul Ghafoor, a Pasni-based fisher. Ghafoor hoped the MPA designation would lead to a clampdown on tourist camps, discarded fishing nets, and the trawlers in the area that damage the ecosystem.
For Ghafoor, disillusionment has since set in: “I have not seen any action to protect the island. The ghost nets and plastics are still there. Tourists and trawlers come and destroy the habitat, leaving little to no catch for us.”
The Astola MPA notification did not explicitly ban trawling, though it did ban tents and restrict many tourist activities. A management plan for the MPA was officially endorsed by the government of Balochistan in April 2025, but local people and NGO representatives say nothing has been implemented, nor have any enforcement officers been hired.
Churna: Endangered by oil
Proposed in 2019, the Churna Island MPA was established last year, primarily to safeguard local corals and fish. These were being threatened by over-tourism, the development of an enormous oil refinery nearby, and the placement of large buoys for crude oil tankers.
Protecting the island has been a difficult sell as it holds significant commercial value for the oil and tourism industries, and also for local politicians.
 

.  Fine mesh nets that catch small, often juvenile fish are still being used on Churna Island, despite being banned as part of the MPA. With competition from trawlers impacting fish stocks, small-scale fishers rely on these cheap, effective nets to feed their families. —Hawwa Fazal

“There were a lot of powerful forces that created roadblocks. They did not want this island to become an MPA,” claims Shrifuddin Baloch, chief conservator of wildlife at the Balochistan Forest and Wildlife Department.
Churna eventually became an MPA in large part due to Baloch’s relentless efforts, the assistance of other activists and NGOs and positive media coverage.
In the year since the designation, however, many local people have not noticed any changes.
“I heard about some protection being given to Churna when I went to the city for some work, but what it is and means, nobody in the village, including me, knows,” claims Sarfaraz Ali, the elected local government representative for Churna.
Trawling, electric fishing and tourists damaging corals are all still regular occurrences, he says, with no officials trying to stop them.
Miani Hor: Pakistan’s latest ‘protected’ area
Similar stories are heard around Miani Hor. The largest lagoon in the country, it was selected for its rich marine life, which includes hundreds of species of fish, birds, mammals and invertebrates.
“People have no information about the site being declared an MPA. [The] few of those who do, have no understanding of what it means,” says Khalil Ronjha, a social activist who lives in the lagoon.
Officials cite a lack of funding as the main reason for delays: “Environment departments are least prioritised and receive budgetary scraps,” says Abdul Fateh Bhanger, director general secretary of the Balochistan Wildlife and Forest Department.
His colleague Baloch voices similar thoughts: “Enforcing the regulations requires personnel who can stay on the ground to monitor the areas and boats big enough to accommodate them, both of which the department does not have, nor the funds to acquire.”

In comparison, the government has not currently allocated any funds to conserve or improve the MPA’s environment. —Hawwa Fazal

Baloch emphasises that the department is relatively young. Established in 2021, it already oversees a network that includes four national parks, two wildlife sanctuaries, three marine protected areas, seven reserves and eight community-based conservancies. It is also responsible for controlling migratory-bird poaching.
The former director general of the Wildlife and Forest Department, Dostain Jamaldini, who oversaw Astola’s management plan and the creation of the Churna Island MPA, disputes money being the problem: “Resources exist, but effective leadership doesn’t.”
Enforcement without delay
Pakistan has protected 19.21pc of its terrestrial areas and inland waters, according to the database Protected Planet, in marked contrast to its current level of marine protection.
Moriani tells Dialogue Earth the federal government is collaborating with provincial governments and international NGOs to establish more MPAs, with feasibility studies being carried out in Sindh.
She adds that the potential of other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) is also being explored. These areas are not dedicated to biodiversity safeguarding but still provide meaningful protection, such as sacred sites and private beaches.
As the government considers its options for reaching the 30×30 goal, the clock is ticking. With such a tiny fraction of its marine territory currently protected, Pakistan is sailing towards the Kunming-Montreal deadline almost empty-handed.

On Thursday, Afridi, who was elected as the provincial chief minister on Monday, was denied a meeting with Imran during a visit to the prison. The PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests.
Afridi said he waited outside the prison for around two hours yesterday bef­ore departing. Speaking to reporters, he said he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran and seeking his input. He claimed he had officially notified the Punjab government and the federal government of his plan to visit Adiala, but received no response, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reply to his subsequent request, made during a phone call, to facilitate a meeting with Imran.
Per Afridi’s writ petition seen by Dawn.com, as a chief minister, he was  constitutionally responsible for governance of the province, and was “under both legal and moral obligation” to consult Imran for “guidance and instructions of urgent and sensitive provincial matters” concerning the governance and formation of the provincial cabinet.
The petition was filed against the federal secretary of the Interior Ministry, the secretary of the Punjab Home Department, the inspector general of Punjab prisons, and the superintendent of Central Prison Adiala, Rawalpindi.
Filed through counsel Syed Ali Bukhari, the petition stated that Afridi had approached the Interior Ministry and Punjab Home Department on October 15, 2025, seeking a meeting with Imran through an official letter that was “duly received” by both offices.
Aside from approaching the IHC, CM Afridi also wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, requesting the arrangement of a meeting with Imran.
According to the letter, seen by Dawn.com, it was “necessary in the public interest that a periodical meeting” of the KP CM be permitted under the supervision of the competent authorities at Central Prison Adiala, Rawalpindi.
Per the letter, Afridi has been elected CM of KP on the ticket of PTI, a province with a population of 45 million, for the governance and securing/safeguarding the fundamental rights and matters relating to law and order situation, formation of provincial cabinet, critical economic challenges being faced by the province’s people and important policy matters.
“There is a pressing need to seek direction from [Imran] regarding [these] matters and others, including relations regarding certain important matters with the federation and other provinces,” said the letter.
“The seeking of direction is extremely essential, even presently the province of Punjab has stopped the inter-provincial trade, i.e., of wheat, etc,” the letter said.
Separately, in a post on X, Afridi apologised for not attending the meeting regarding agriculture and Afghan refugees with the federal government today, saying that he was unable to do so without consulting Imran first.
“Until I meet [Imran Khan] and receive policy guidelines, participating in such a meeting would be an insult to the mandate of the province’s people,” he said.
 






“I hope that the federal government will resolve this issue as soon as possible and issue directions to the relevant authorities so that arrangements can be made for my regular meetings with my leader and the representative of the mandate of the people of KP.”
Pre-election controversy
Afridi was elected the new KP chief executive on Monday during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and amid the prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur.
Declaring Afridi’s election constitutional, Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah had orderered KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Tuesday to administer the oath by 4pm the next day or else the provincial assembly speaker would perform the ceremony the same day under Article 255(2) of the Constitution.</p><small>2025-10-17 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629074-pakistan-afghanistan-engaged-in-constructive-dialogue-for-peaceful-resolution-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan engaged in constructive dialogue for peaceful resolution: FO</strong></a><br><p>

The case of Rano, a female Himalayan brown bear who stirred public outcry over her ailing health in the zoo, has brought into sharp focus the neglect of animals kept in captivity in Karachi. Rano’s relocation was finally ordered on Tuesday by the SHC after a petition was submitted to recognise her deteriorating condition.
During the continuation of the hearing of the case today, the SHC called for a further report on all animals kept in captivity at the zoo.
The report is to include details on animals’ “physical and psychological health, living conditions, qualifications and training of zoo staff”, as well as alternative plans for animals if they are shifted from the zoo, according to lawyer Jibran Nasir, who was representing Rano’s case on behalf of the petitioner Jude Allen Pereira.
According to Nasir, details of the staff and their qualifications have been summoned from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), while the report on the zoo has been summoned from a committee already notified by the Sindh government to ensure Rano’s transfer, with the addition of some more members by the court.
The Sindh government has also been directed to visit the zoo and review the facilities provided to animals.
 
 

Nasir termed the decision a “massive achievement”, saying it was made possible by the combined efforts of animal rights activists, experts, and the media that raised awareness of the issue.
“We are deeply indebted to the empathy, understanding and judicial will of the honourable bench to make a difference in not just the lives of these animals, but for the education and sensitisation of the society at large with regards to animals and their rights,” he told Dawn.com.
Relocation of brown bear
Regarding Rano’s relocation, KMC advocate Barrister Asad Ahmed said, “The progress report states that first Rano will be transferred to Islamabad, and then to Gilgit.”
He added that training would be given in preparation for the relocation.
Nasir also said that the proposal of Wildlife Conservative Javed Mehar could be implemented.
Mehar suggested that Rano could be transported to Islamabad via road as well as by airplane.
“We have all the arrangements made in this regard and have transported animals before,” he told the court, adding that training was administered prior to the transfer of animals.
Justice calls for abolition of zoos
Justice Iqbal Kalhoro, who heard the case, pointed out in today’s hearing that Rano’s case was not a solitary one.
“It is not a problem of any one animal, but many animals are being affected by it,” he said.
Kalhoro slammed the current treatment of the animals by zoos, saying, “Zoos should be abolished and animals should be in natural habitats.”
He noted that it seemed “very difficult” to maintain the zoos here.
Advocate Nasir pointed out to the court that the zoos built in the city fell under the KMC, while bringing to the court’s attention the state of facilities.
“We do not even have administration people here to tell us whether people can give food to the animals or not,” he said.
He also pointed out that the Karachi Zoo only employed one veterinarian, to which the KMC advocate responded that no new appointments had been made due to a ban on them.
Justice Kalhoro noted, “I also saw zoos in my childhood — they were kept in a very bad condition; many animals were injured.
“You people earn money from the zoo but do not spend it on animals.”
He lamented that Pakistan had “no concept of a national park” as an alternative to zoos.
“The zoos outside (the country) are not in such condition; there are no cages there,” he said. “We want to abolish these cages.”
Nasir noted that one of the oldest zoos in Islamabad had also previously been closed.
Kalhoro told the bench, “You file a petition about whether there should be a zoo or not — then we will look into the law on it.”
The SHC adjourned the hearing for two weeks, seeking a progress report for the next hearing.
The neglect of Rano
Rano was reportedly brought to the Karachi Zoo in 2017, along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020.
Forced to live in solitary confinement in a barren cell, her “unusual behaviour” was remarked on in February in a report by a committee investigating her condition, which suggested she was “under stress”. The committee recommended her relocation to a sanctuary in Punjab, as well as a DNA test to determine her species.
Animal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.
While the committee expressed satisfaction over the bear’s diet, physical health, and found no wounds/injuries on her body, it noticed “heavy noise” during the visit. The report stated that the noise seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.
Although the KMC had directed the committee to issue the report, it later emerged that it was not implementing its recommendations, as Rano continued to languish in Karachi Zoo.
Earlier this month, it emerged that the bear had suffered a head injury, and the wound was infested with maggots due to a lack of care.
When contacted, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation spokesperson Daniyal Sial admitted that the bear was under treatment, adding that the injury had been self-administered by Rano, hitting her head on the bars of her cage.
A case was finally heard on Rano’s condition this month after animal rights activist Pereira petitioned the SHC for recognition of animal cruelty towards the bear.
During the hearing of the case on Tuesday, Justice Kalhoro expressed his anger at the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), saying, “How could the bear be kept in such conditions?“
He ordered the handover of the bear to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, a move termed a “big win for Rano” by Pereira.</p><small>2025-10-17 10:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17140728d982f42.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949525/naval-chief-reaffirms-pakistans-commitment-to-maritime-cooperation-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>Naval chief reaffirms Pakistan’s commitment to maritime cooperation with US</strong></a><br><p>The Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment towards cooperation with the United States over matters of maritime security during a visit to the country, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
The Pakistani and US Navy share a long-standing relationship. In September, the US Navy ship USS Wayne E. Meyer departed from Karachi on a two-day port call, strengthening the enduring maritime cooperation between the Pakistan Navy and the US Navy.
According to the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement,  “Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, visited [the] United States of America as part of ongoing efforts to further strengthen bilateral maritime cooperation and defence engagements.”
Over the course of the visit — which concluded last Friday — Admiral Ashraf met with the US Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Admiral Yvette Davids, and Acting Vice Commandant of the US Coast Guard, Vice Admiral Thomas G. Allan Jr.
“Matters of professional interest, regional security dynamics, and avenues for professional training and maritime cooperation were discussed during these meetings,” the statement said.
In a visit to the National Defence University (NDU) at Fort Lesley J. McNair, the naval chief met with the university’s president, Vice Admiral Peter A. Garvin.
The meeting “encompassed deliberations on politico-military cooperation, maritime security, capacity-building initiatives, and shared maritime interests,” ISPR said.
Admiral Ashraf also met the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, Stanley L. Brown, the statement added.
The naval chief addressed a gathering of US scholars and think-tank experts, the statement said, highlighting “regional maritime security challenges and Pakistan Navy’s contributions towards collaborative maritime efforts.”
As per ISPR, the visit “reflects the enduring defence ties between Pakistan and the United States, reaffirming the mutual commitment to promoting maritime security in the region and beyond.”
The development comes amid improving ties between Pakistan and the US.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with US President Donald Trump, along with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. In June, the COAS became the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president after his lunch with Trump.</p><small>2025-10-17 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629051-section-144-imposed-punjab-police-on-high-alert-amid-fresh-protest-call-by-tlp' target='_blank'><strong>TLP ban summary sent to Centre as Punjab on high alert amid fresh protest call today</strong></a><br><p>

Russian oil is a main irritant for Trump in prolonged trade talks with India — half of his 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods are in retaliation for those purchases.
His administration says Moscow is using petroleum revenue to fund its war in Ukraine.
The White House official told Reuters on Thursday that talks with an Indian delegation in Washington this week have been productive and that Indian refiners were already cutting Russian oil imports by 50%.
But Indian industry sources said on Friday that New Delhi had not informed refiners of any request to cut Russian imports.
Trump says Modi pledged to halt Russian oil purchases
Refiners have already placed orders for November loading, including some cargoes for December arrival, so any cut could be visible in December or January import numbers, said the sources, who asked not to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Indeed, India’s imports of Russian oil are set to rise about 20pc this month to 1.9 million barrels per day, according to estimates from commodities data firm Kpler, as Russia ramps up exports after Ukrainian drones hit its refineries.
The Indian oil ministry and refiners that buy Russian oil did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him on Wednesday that India would stop buying Russian oil.
India’s foreign ministry did not respond to Trump’s assertion except to say it was not aware of any telephone conversation between the two leaders that day.
Still, India’s oil minister on Thursday sought data on Russian oil imports from all the refiners, including their loadings and arrivals tied up for November and December.
Oil prices fell on Friday, with Brent crude futures down 48 cents, or 0.79pc, to $60.58 a barrel at 0720 GMT (12:20 pm PKT), amid uncertainty over global supply as Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared to discuss ending the war.
US-India trade talks have floundered
India has become the biggest buyer of seaborne Russian oil sold at a discount after Western nations shunned purchases and imposed sanctions on Moscow for its 2022 invasion of its neighbour.
New Delhi initially hoped to secure a quick trade deal with the US due to Modi’s warm relationship with Trump, but the talks have floundered and the president has slapped some of the highest levies in his global tariff regime on India’s products.
When Modi visited Trump in February, India pledged to more than double its annual US energy purchases to $25 billion, with both nations targeting $500bn in bilateral trade by 2030.
US negotiators have said curbing India’s Russian crude purchases would be crucial to reducing its tariff rate and sealing a trade deal.
Indian refiners are looking to buy at least 10pc of their liquefied petroleum gas needs from the US to help narrow India’s bilateral trade surplus, sources told Reuters this week.
Russia accounted for 36pc of India’s oil imports, some 1.75m barrels per day, in the six months through September, trade data shows.
Moscow said on Thursday it was confident its energy partnership with India would continue.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia could supply oil more cheaply to countries that Trump is trying to persuade to stop buying Russian oil.</p><small>2025-10-17 09:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1713222045fac95.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949519/south-korea-kicks-off-arms-fair-to-showcase-unmanned-ai-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>South Korea kicks off arms fair to showcase unmanned, AI weapons</strong></a><br><p>South Korea kicked off its largest-ever arms fair on Friday, with firms expected to show off new unmanned and artificial intelligence-enhanced weapons from howitzers to suicide drones, as Seoul seeks to strengthen its military and pursues more global defence sales.
Organisers said 600 companies from 35 countries were scheduled to participate in the Seoul International Aerospace & Defence Exhibition (ADEX) 2025.
This year’s ADEX kicked off with three days of public air shows at an air base, including flights by its newly developed KF-21 fighter jet.

The festivities will be followed next week by business exhibitions at a sprawling conference centre.
Earlier this month, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said that the country’s defence budget for next year would rise 8.2 per cent to 66.3 trillion won ($47.1 billion) as it faces more tensions around the region and a nuclear-armed North Korea.
Foreign dignitaries were invited to Pyongyang earlier in October to tour North Korea’s arms exhibition, which included drones and nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, followed by a grand military parade.
Arms have become one of South Korea’s fastest-growing exports, as it has inked multibillion-dollar deals selling everything from howitzers and ammunition to missiles and warships around the world.
At this year’s ADEX, Hanwha Aerospace said it would unveil next-generation versions of its popular self-propelled K9 howitzer that use automation and AI to reduce or eliminate the need for a crew.
In addition, the company said it would showcase its L-PGW, a missile-launched loitering munition — also known as a suicide drone — which can circle an area before using AI to identify and destroy a target.
Unmanned weapons and AI will provide more capabilities and help South Korea maintain its defences, despite a shrinking population that will reduce the number of available soldiers, Hanwha said in a statement.

Seok Jong-gun, the minister for the Defence Acquisition Programme Administration, told parliament on Friday that its focus included developing and modernising manned and unmanned weapons systems, while expanding its defence export markets in cooperation with the US, Canada, Saudi Arabia and others.
“We will pursue entry into the global supply chain by expanding cooperation with the US in defence shipbuilding,“ he said.
South Korea’s shipbuilding cooperation with the US has become a flashpoint with China, which unveiled sanctions on Hanwha Ocean’s US-linked affiliates earlier this week.</p><small>2025-10-17 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629046-imran-insisted-on-agitation-gandapur-wanted-dialogue-to-avoid-bloodshed' target='_blank'><strong>'Imran insisted on agitation, Gandapur wanted dialogue to avoid bloodshed'</strong></a><br><p>

“According to sources, a khawarij attempted to carry out a suicide attack against security forces in Mir Ali. One kharji rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more khawarij tried to enter the camp,” the report said.
 






“As a result of security forces’ timely and courageous action, the three khawarij were killed outside the camp. Security forces did not suffer any losses in the incident. In the last two days alone, 88 terrorists supported by the Afghan Taliban have been killed,” the report said.
Khawarij is a term that the state uses to refer to terrorists.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to security forces for foiling the attack and praised their professionalism.
“Salute to the brave soldiers who thwarted the evil intentions of Khawarij,” Naqvi said, according to a statement issued by the ministry.
“Security forces took timely action and brought the khawarij to an exemplary end,” he said, adding that the nation was “proud of the brave soldiers”.
The development comes a day after the ISPR’s said that 34 “India-backed” terrorists had been killed in multiple operations in KP’s North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts over the previous three days.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Last week, a lieutenant colonel and a major were among 11 military personnel martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Orakzai, in which 19 terrorists were reported killed. The same week, the ISPR reported that 30 terrorists who were involved in the incident had been killed in a “retribution operation”.
A day after the Orakzai operation, another officer was martyred in an operation in Dera Ismail Khan, in which seven terrorists were also killed, according to the ISPR.
In July, the government designated the TTP as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks, even before the most recent deadly border clashes between the two countries this past week. However, Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy.
The development also comes tensions have flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the past few days after the two countries engaged in border clashes over the weekend. Tensions escalated to the point where both sides agreed to a temporary ceasefire 48-hour ceasefire after Islamabad carried out strikes in Kabul and Kandahar.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made it clear that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.</p><small>2025-10-17 07:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629032-abducted-son-of-ziarat-ac-muhammad-afzal-recovered-in-harnai-police' target='_blank'><strong>Abducted son of Ziarat AC Muhammad Afzal recovered: police</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, DC, where Aurangzeb had arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip from Oct 13 to 18.
NDB — established in 2015 by the BRICS  — is a multilateral development bank aimed at mobilising resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS, as per their website. In February, the Economic Coord­ination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had approved Pakistan’s membership in the NDB.
In a statement issued today, the ministry said, “Aurangzeb sought China’s support for Pakistan’s membership in the NDB and welcomed enhanced investment from Chinese enterprises in key sectors, including information and communication technology, agriculture, industry, and minerals.”
 






The minister briefed Min on the staff-level agreement reached with the IMF last week, terming it “external validation of the government’s ongoing economic reform agenda”.
The pair also discussed “latest developments regarding the issuance of the Panda Bond in the Chinese market”.
“The finance minister expressed gratitude to the office of the executive director [at the] IMF for extending full support to Pakistan during recent Board meetings,” the statement added.
Aurangzeb also extended an invitation to the Chinese official to visit Pakistan at a “mutually convenient time”.
Formerly the BRICS Development Bank, NDB was set up by founding members — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa —  to support public or private projects through loans, guarantees, equity participation and other financial instruments.
NDB is headquartered in Shanghai, China and has regional offices in other member states. India originally proposed that the bank simplify mutual settlement and lending operations among BRICS countries and reduce dependence on the US dollar and the euro.
Aurangzeb meets US congressman
The finance minister also met with US Congressman French Hill, who is the chairman of the US House Financial Services Committee.
As per the finance ministry, the pair discussed avenues for “strengthening Pakistan-US economic and financial cooperation, with particular emphasis on the digitisation of financial services, development of the new economy, mineral sector collaboration, and broader partnerships in information technology”.
“Both sides expressed interest in enhancing bilateral engagement to promote sustainable economic growth and innovation-driven collaboration between Pakistan and the United States,” the statement added.
 






Auragazeb also held meetings with representatives from Bangladesh, Japan and attended seminars arranged by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and JP Morgan.
Addressing the WEF’s dialogue on “Leveraging Innovation for Inclusive and Sustainable Growth“, the minister remarked that “technology must be guided by inclusion and resilience strategies and highlighted the role of AI-led monitoring in boosting efficiency and productivity.”
“He cited the example of AI-based interventions, such as satellite imagery, which have improved farmers’ incomes and service delivery in developing countries,” the statement said.
 






Separately, while addressing the JP Morgan investment seminar on Pakistan’s economic and monetary policy outlook, he briefed investors on “positive momentum of the economy,” adding that it is “fueled by sound macro management and enhanced fiscal and external sector stability”.
 






In his meeting with Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) Governor Nobumitsu Hayashi, he welcomed JBIC’s commitment to join the Reko Diq lender group.
He reassured Hayashi that “the government attaches high importance to ensuring the security and confidence of foreign investors”.
 






Meanwhile, in a meeting with Special Envoy to the Hon’ble Chief Adviser of Bangladesh Lutfey Y Siddiqi, the minister underscored Pakistan’s commitment to “fostering closer regional economic cooperation.”
 






The minister also “engaged in a media interaction with the renowned media outlet Bloomberg,” the statement said.
The finance minister has held a series of meetings during his six-day visit, which is set to conclude tomorrow.
On Thursday, he met Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed bin Abdullah Al-Jadaan, where Aurangzeb apprised him of the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and key airports.
The two finance ministers also reviewed the growing trade and investment relations between the two countries.
Later in the day, during a select gathering of scholars and economists at the Atlantic Council in Washington, the minister discussed Pakistan’s approach to economic reform, disaster response and private-sector-led growth.
He also met an S&P Global team, welcoming its recent ratings action and noting that the three major international agencies are now aligned.
He briefed the team on recent fiscal, monetary and external-sector developments and progress under the government’s reform programme.</p><small>2025-10-17 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17113149ec41a80.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949501/japan-ex-pm-tomiichi-murayama-famous-for-ww2-apology-dies-aged-101' target='_blank'><strong>Japan ex-PM Tomiichi Murayama, famous for WW2 apology, dies aged 101</strong></a><br><p>Japan’s former prime minister Tomiichi Murayama, best known for making a statement apologising over World War II, died Friday aged 101, officials said.
Murayama issued the 1995 proclamation on the 50th anniversary of Japan’s surrender, expressing “deep remorse” over the country’s atrocities in Asia.
The statement became a benchmark for Tokyo’s subsequent apologies over World War II.
 
 

“Tomiichi Murayama, the father of Japanese politics, passed away today at 11:28am at a hospital in Oita City at the age of 101,” Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party, seen as the successor to Murayama’s now-defunct Socialist Party, said on X.
 






Hiroyuki Takano, the secretary general of the Social Democratic Party in Oita, Murayama’s hometown, told AFP he had been informed that the former premier died of old age.
In the landmark statement in August 1995, Murayama said that “Japan …
through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations”.
“In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology,” he added.
The phrases “deep remorse” and “heartfelt apology” were used by successive Japanese prime ministers when marking the 60th and 70th World War II anniversaries.
 
 

Murayama, who was also well-known for his distinctive bushy eyebrows, was elected as the prime minister in a coalition government that also included the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan’s dominant postwar political force.
He was in office from 1994 to 1996, a turbulent period that saw a huge 1995 earthquake in western Japan, and a sarin gas attack on Tokyo’s subway that killed more than a dozen people and injured more than 5,800.
Murayama was conscripted into the Japanese Imperial Army in 1944 while studying at university.
In a 2015 interview with public broadcaster NHK, he called the military a “dreadful thing”, describing how “rebellion or argument was absolutely forbidden”.
He also recalled his difficult memories of the run-up to the end of the war, when “food was already scarce, and very few weapons remained”.
“We had weapons made of bamboo.

A senior Trump administration official told the Financial Times there were discussions about signing something when the crown prince comes, but the details are in flux.
The FT said the deal in discussion was similar to the recent US-Qatar pact that pledged to treat any armed attack on Qatar as a threat to the United States. The US deal with Qatar came after Israel last month attempted to kill leaders of Hamas with an air strike on Doha.
The US State Department told the FT that defence co-operation with the kingdom was a “strong bedrock of our regional strategy,” but declined to comment on details of the potential deal.
The US State Department, the White House and the Saudi government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the FT report.
Last month, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.</p><small>2025-10-17 05:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629001-pml-n-ppp-agree-to-resolve-differences-via-dialogue-end-political-bickering' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N, PPP agree to resolve differences via dialogue, end political bickering</strong></a><br><p>

• CJP calls for ensuring that principles of harmony and equality are reflected in judicial practice
ISLAMABAD: Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said on Thursday that procedural safeguards were being introduced by the government in blasphemy-related cases to prevent misuse of the law, and ensure timely justice.
Speaking at a symposium on “Interfaith Harmony and Fundamental Rights – A Constitutional Imperative”, the minister urged members of the judiciary to continue providing leadership in protecting constitutional rights and guiding jurisprudence to safeguard vulnerable communities.
 
 

Jointly organised by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) and the Federal Judicial Academy (FJA), the symposium was held at the Supreme Court auditorium.
The minister appealed to religious leaders to use their influence to promote compassion, humanity, and tolerance, noting that their voices shape hearts and minds.
 


He further urged educators and media professionals to use their platforms to amplify messages of pluralism and social cohesion, while encouraging business leaders and civil society to invest in community projects that promote equal economic opportunities across social divides.
Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, in his welcome address earlier, said the message of Islam, from the very beginning, has been peace, compassion and respect for all humanity.
Referring to the theme of the symposium, the CJP said the purpose of dialogue on interfaith harmony was not merely understanding and transformation but ensuring that the principles discussed should also be reflected in judicial practice.
He expressed hope that the dialogue on interfaith harmony would bring Pakistan closer to a society where rights are not only declared but also realised, where justice is not delayed but delivered, and where the law serves as a common language of peace and equality.
Speaking next, Dr Al-Issa who has also served as head of the Saudi Judiciary and delivered the sermon at Arafat during the 2022 Haj, said Pakistan was considered as one of the leading international models in preserving the rights of minorities. He lauded the Supreme Court for its role as the guardian of Pakistan’s Constitution.
 
 

Former CJP Tassaduq Hussain Jillani emphasised that the judiciary has a sacred constitutional duty to protect equality, pluralism, and the rule of law.
Declaration adopted
Meanwhile, a declaration on interfaith harmony adopted at the conclusion of the symposium called for integrating interfaith sensitivity and human rights education within the justice sector; strengthening institutional mechanisms for the protection of minorities and the realisation of fundamental rights; promoting interfaith harmony, social inclusion, and mutual respect as the foundation of fundamental rights; and upholding the constitutional promise of equality and justice for all citizens.

• PM reiterates ‘respect for PPP as ruling ally’; Chan says PM amenable to using social safety net to help flood-hit people
• MQM leaders also call on PM to discuss political situation
ISLAMABAD: After weeks of acrimony between the ruling allies, the two main parties in the ruling coalition seemed to make a breakthrough on Thursday, with a PPP leader claiming the prime minister had acceded to one of their main demands.
“The prime minister has agreed to utilise BISP for helping flood victims and that the PPP will be taken on board while decision-making about flood victims and farmers,” PPP Information Secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan told Dawn.
The understanding, he said, was reached during a meeting at the Prime Minister’s House with a PPP delegation  led by Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
It is believed that the development will finally defuse nearly a month of public confrontation between the two parties.
 
 

However, all eyes will now be on how the premier convinces the PML-N-led Punjab government, which had resisted routing assistance to flood-hit families through BISP — an issue that led to the dispute in the first place.
Mr Chan said the PM had agr­eed to all the PPP’s demands “as they were justified and logical”.
The disagreement between the ruling allies first surfaced last month, soon after heavy monsoon rains and flooding devastated parts of Punjab and other provinces. The PPP pushed for using the BISP to deliver immediate relief to flood-affected families, a demand resisted by the Punjab government.
Tensions deepened when PPP leaders publicly criticised the Punjab government, accusing it of politicising relief and sidelining the federal mechanism for assistance. On the other hand, PML-N ministers also voiced frustration, with Rana Sanaullah calling for a complete overhaul of BISP and arguing that its current structure was unfit.
The technical disagreement soon turned into a political confrontation, with both the ruling allies issuing counter-accusations almost on a daily basis.
 
 

In late September, PPP publicly walked out of Senate and National Assembly sessions to protest what it called insults from Punjab’s PML-N leadership over the controversial Cholistan canal project and criticism of the PPP’s Sindh administration.
‘Respect and appreciation’
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, Thursday’s meeting between PM Shehbaz and the PPP chairman also reviewed a range of domestic and foreign issues as well as the overall political situation.
“PPP is our ally with whom we view relations with respect and appreciation,” the premier was quoted as telling Mr Bhutto-Zardari.
The PPP delegation paid tribute to the premier for Pakistan’s role in efforts towards a Gaza peace agreement.
The PPP team included Raja Pervez Ashraf, Senator Sherry Rehman, Nayyar Bukhari, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Syed Ali Qasim Gilani.
From the government side, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal, and Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmed Khan attended.
Sources said Mr Bhutto-Zardari conveyed his party’s reservations regarding Punjab and urged an end to the war of words between the PPP and PML-N. He also pressed for targeted support, urging PM Shehbaz to help farmers who had been hit hard by the floods.
When asked whether the PM had agreed to use BISP for flood relief, Information Minister Ata Tarar, who was also present on the occasion, said he would check. However, he did not respond to Dawn’s query until going to print.
In a separate development, a delegation led by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement convener, Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, called on PM Shehbaz on Thursday and discussed the country’s political situation. The delegation also included Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, as well as MNAs Dr Muhammad Farooq Sattar, Aminul Haq, and Javed Hanif.
The prime minister stressed that the timely completion of the ongoing federal development projects was among the government’s top priorities.

In its Annual Report on the State of Pakistan’s Economy 2024-25, released on Thursday, the SBP noted that while there has been a partial recovery in industrial activity, macroeconomic risks remain, including pressure on inflation, fiscal accounts, and external balances.
GDP growth for FY25 was revised up to 3.02pc from 2.68pc, following a sharp rebound in the fourth quarter. Industrial output rose by 19.9pc in Q4, after growing marginally in the first three quarters — 0.3pc in Q1, 0.2pc in Q2, and 1.2pc in Q3. This late surge was driven by value addition in electricity, gas, water supply, and construction. Manufacturing, particularly small-scale manufacturing, also contributed, though mining and quarrying continued to contract for the fourth consecutive year.
The central bank emphasised the need for structural reforms to enhance economic resilience and position the economy on a sustainable path of high growth. Key areas identified include promoting savings and investment, improving resource allocation, and advancing institutional and regulatory reforms to enhance competitiveness.
Twin deficit/inflation
The report flagged that increased economic activity and expected agricultural shortages may lead to higher imports in FY26. However, lower US tariffs on Pakistani exports and sustained workers’ remittances could help mitigate the current account deficit. The SBP projects the current account deficit (CAD) to range between 0-1pc of GDP in FY26.
On the fiscal side, continued tax reforms and efforts to document the economy are expected to strengthen revenue mobilisation. Additional support is expected from the transfer of SBP profits in August 2025. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected to fall within a range of 3.8-4.8pc of GDP in FY26.
Despite a relatively stable global commodity outlook and subdued domestic demand, inflationary pressures may resurface. “Headline NCPI inflation may cross the upper bound of the medium-term target range in the second half of FY26, before returning to the range in FY27,” the SBP stated. It noted upside risks from flood-related damage to agriculture and infrastructure, and warned of downside risks to growth from geopolitical and trade uncertainty.
The report also pointed to structural weaknesses in financial intermediation. Elevated government borrowing has crowded out private sector credit, with banks preferring to invest in government securities due to their high returns and low risk. This trend, the SBP noted, contributes to Pakistan’s low credit-to-GDP ratio compared to peer economies and undermines financial development, discouraging both savings and private investment.
Private construction activity remained sluggish due to rising input costs and higher property taxes, despite increased development spending supporting public sector construction.
SBP reserves rise $21m
The foreign exchange reserves held by the SBP increased by $21 million to $14.441 billion during the week ended on October 10, the central bank reported on Thursday.
The country’s total liquid foreign exchange reserves stood at $19.811bn, including $5.369bn held by commercial banks.

• Uncertainty surrounds reports of peace talks in Doha in absence of official confirmation
• Beijing, Tehran and UN mission urge restraint, ready to play constructive role for de-escalation
ISLAMABAD: Back-channel diplomatic efforts were afoot on Thursday, as the Pakistan-Afghanistan border remained calm and no ceasefire violations being reported.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.
 
 

“The ball is in [their] court,” he said while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, informing his colleagues that the Afghan Taliban had formally requested a ceasefire after intense clashes between the two sides earlier in the week.
“We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks.
He, however, hoped that thorny issues between the two be resolved on a long-term basis, including the elimination of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which uses Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan, so that the neighbouring country’s territory was no longer used by terrorists.
PM Shehbaz reiterated his hope that the ceasefire be maintained for the future on the basis of “solid demands”. “If this was only done to buy time, then we won’t accept it,” the premier warned, as per Dawn.com.
 
 

He elaborated that officials from Pakistan had visited Kabul many times and engaged in cordial dialogue on resolving their issues together with mutual agreement for the sake of peace and prosperity.
“Unfortunately, despite all efforts, this was not possible, and when this attack was ongoing on Pakistan, on India’s complete incitement, their (Afghan) Foreign Minister [Amir] Muttaqi was in New Delhi, so we were forced to give a comprehensive response,” the PM said.
 
 

According to PM Shehbaz, the Qatari emir had condemned the entire episode in talks with him in Egypt and expressed his desire to play a role in cooling down tensions.
There was no immediate response to his remarks from Kabul, with Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khowarazmi saying only that the ceasefire was holding so far.
A statement from the Afghan Taliban interior ministry said Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani met senior Iranian officials and told them that Afghanistan seeks good relations with all countries, especially its neighbours, Reuters reported.
It may be noted that both sides reached a ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, which took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours.
Doha talks?
Though diplomatic efforts were continuing to arrange a meeting between the two sides before the truce expires, uncertainty surrounded the planned talks in the absence of any official confirmation.
In its statement announcing the ceasefire, the Foreign Office had said that both sides would hold dialogue “to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue.”
According to diplomatic sources, the talks were expected to focus on extending the ceasefire and finding ways to defuse the latest border tensions.
On Thursday, reports emerged that Qatar had invited high-level delegations from both countries for talks in Doha on Friday.
Though Doha’s invitation was not made public, but a day earlier, Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had received a message from Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr. M. Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi about “the regional situation.” The timing of the message, which coincided with the announcement of the ceasefire, appeared linked to Qatar’s efforts to mediate.
 






Saudi Arabia also joined the diplomatic push on Thursday, with Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan speaking by phone with FM Dar to discuss “the regional situation and recent developments,” according to the Foreign Office. While Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia on regional and international issues, the statement did not directly mention Afghanistan.
 






Diplomatic sources said the main hurdle to the planned dialogue appeared to be internal deliberations within the Taliban’s top leadership. A source in Kabul said that Taliban supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada had yet to give formal approval for his side’s participation.
Late-night reports from Kabul suggested that Mullah Haibatullah had eventually agreed to send Defense Minister Mullah Yaqub to represent the Taliban at the proposed Doha meeting.
The Pakistani side remained cautious. Officials in Islamabad declined to confirm or deny the meeting. They seemed to be waiting for Kabul’s decision.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if the talks take place,” a Pakistani diplomat said on condition of anonymity, describing the negotiations as “fluid but not off the table.”
Calls for restraint
On Thursday, Iran and China urged restraint on both sides, calling on them to settle the current conflict through talks.
China said it supports countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire. A foreign ministry spokesperson, when asked about Pakistan and Afghanistan agreeing to a 48-hour ceasefire, said that Beijing stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations.
“Pakistan and Afgh­anistan are each other’s neighbours and both are China’s friends. China supports the two countries in staying cool-headed and exercising restraint, realizing a full and lasting ceasefire, properly handling differences through dialogue and consultation, returning to the track of political settlement, and together maintaining peace and stability in both countries and the wider region.”
Iran also welcomed the ceasefire, urging dialogue and diplomacy. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”.
Meanwhile, the Tasnim News Agency quoted Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian as calling for Muslim unity and dialogue following the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
He said the renewed tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have raised serious concern among regional nations, including Iran, which shares borders with both.
Pezeshkian reiterated that Iran would use all available resources to reduce tensions, promote dialogue, and strengthen ties between the two neighbours.
Enemies continually seek to create discord among Muslim nations to weaken them, he said, adding that the region needs peace, cohesion, and cooperation more than ever.
Meanwhile, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) also called on all parties “to bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians and prevent further loss of life”.
It also urged both Afghanistan and Pakistan to comply with their obligations under international law “to prevent” more civilian casualties.
