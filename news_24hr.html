The ATC allowed the police to conduct the polygraph (lie detection) and photogrammetric (facial and voice analysis) test on May 14, however, the ex-premier refused to undergo them.
Last week, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari had assailed the PTI founder for refusing the tests, saying that he either made excuses such as being asleep or eating or claimed that his lawyers were unavailable. She remarked that it appeared he had still not come to terms with being a convict serving court sentences in jail, and stressed that “he needed to understand he was in Adiala Jail, not at his Bani Gala residence.”
During today’s hearing, the police submitted a report to the judge about Imran’s refusal to take the test, arguing that the investigation could not be completed without the results.
Legal Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Javed Ahmed said, “The PTI founder has refused to conduct the polygraphic and photogrammatic test. He has refused to take the written test twice … [and] the oral test three times.
“We have to perform the polygraph and photogrammetry tests for the purpose of our investigation,” he stated.
The DSP told the court that police would cooperate with Imran, but stressed that he needed to cooperate with investigating officers, too.
“Justice will be seen,” he added.
The court ordered that the PTI founder take the tests and demanded that the results be submitted by June 9.
Imran, 71, has been imprisoned at the Adiala Jail for two years upon his conviction in four cases — two Toshakhana references, the cipher case, and the Iddat case, in which his wife, Bushra Bibi, is also jailed.
Imran’s sentences in the Toshakhana references were suspended while he was acquitted by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in the cipher case in June. An Islamabad district and sessions court had also recently accepted the appeals filed by Imran and his spouse against their conviction in the Iddat case.
Various courts have also acquitted him in several other cases filed against him since the events of May 9, 2023 — the day when his first arrest had caused riots across the country, following which the state launched a crackdown against him and his party.</p><small>2025-05-26 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26193239816b37d.jpg?r=202000' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913442/ready-to-talk-with-india-pm-shehbaz-says-during-meeting-with-iranian-president-in-tehran' target='_blank'><strong>‘Ready to talk with India’, PM Shehbaz says during meeting with Iranian President in Tehran</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday expressed his willingness to talk with India to resolve ongoing disputes between the two countries, including the Kashmir issue and water security, during his visit to Iran.
The PM is currently on a four-nation tour to friendly countries, where he will express his gratitude for supporting Pakistan during the recent military escalation with India.
Earlier on Monday, PM Shehbaz was received Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at Saadabad Palace in the Iranian capital, where he received a guard of honour.

Addressing a joint press conference with Iranian President Masood Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz said that the two countries’ delegations had a “very productive and useful meeting … which covered all areas of our mutual interests and cooperation”.
“There was total agreement that our two brotherly and neighbourly countries must enhance our cooperation in the field of trade, investments, commerce, in fact, every walk of life,” he said.
The prime minister said that he thanked Pezeshkian for his support during the military conflict with India and emphasised that both nations have deep-rooted cultural ties and historical relations, adding that they decided to turn these relations into a “very productive cooperation in various fields of life”.
“My dear brother, I dearly appreciate your sense of concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt before it, God forbid, escalates,” Shehbaz said, addressing the Iranian president.
 


The PM also lauded Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi for visiting Pakistan during the military escalation, calling him an “outstanding diplomat” and stating that they had a “heart to heart discussion”.
“Pakistan came out of this conflict victorious … through our brave actions by our outstanding armed forces,” Shehbaz said.
“We wanted peace, we want peace and we will work for peace in the region through talks on the table and resolve our outstanding issues, including the Kashmir problem, according to the resolutions passed by the [United Nations] Security Council … and even by Indian Lok Sabha (parliament) back in 1954,” he added, speaking about when then-prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru committed to a plebiscite in the disputed territory.
“We are ready to talk, for the sake of peace on water issues with our neighbour,” he continued. “We are ready to talk to promote trade and also, counter-terrorism if they’re serious.
“But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory … like we have done a few days ago,” he added. “But if they accept my offer of peace, then we will show that we really want peace, seriously and sincerely.”
According to PTV News, the PM touched down at Tehran’s Mehrabad Airport on Monday afternoon, where he was received by Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moqadam, Pakistani Ambassador to Iran Mudassar Tipu, and senior diplomatic officials.
 






“Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi, Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi are part of the delegation accompanying the Prime Minister on his visit to Iran,” the broadcaster wrote in a post on X.
The PM and his delegation will also meet Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei “to discuss bilateral matters as well as important regional issues”.
During a two-day visit to Turkiye on Sunday, he had a delegation-level meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, where he thanked Turkiye for their support during the recent conflict and discussed bilateral trade and investment between the two nations.
PTV News reported that PM Shehbaz was seen off by senior Turkish officials at Istanbul Airport today.
“Turkish Defense Minister Yashar Guler, Deputy Governor of Istanbul Ilker Haktankacmaz Burhan Kayaturk, President of the Pakistan-Turkiye Cultural Association, Yousuf Junaid, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Turkiye, Numan Aslam, Consul General in Istanbul, senior Turkish government officials, and Pakistani diplomats stationed in Turkiye saw off the Prime Minister at Istanbul Airport,” PTV News said in a post on X.
 






“The purpose of the Prime Minister’s visit was to thank the people of Turkiye, and especially President Erdogan, for their strong cooperation and support in the recent tensions between Pakistan and India,” the post added.</p><small>2025-05-26 15:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606307-imran-khan-asks-pti-to-prepare-for-major-nationwide-movement' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan asks PTI to prepare for ‘major nationwide movement'</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, the CCD elaborated that the police conducted an operation and recovered the woman in the Mani Yazman area, while also arresting four men allegedly involved in the kidnapping.
The statement added that a case was registered against them and the suspects were wanted by the Saddar Dunyapur police.
“The accused were absconding for nine years and the recovery of the kidnapped woman was a challenge,” the police spokesperson said in the statement.
The spokesperson added that the suspects were arrested after stringent efforts of the IT team and the Dunyapur Circle police team. The suspects were included in the list of top 100 declared fugitives.
“The police are not negligent in their duties and are determined to ensure the safety of the public, the statement quoted the CCD director of operations as saying.
The statement concluded that action will continue against criminal elements and proclaimed offenders.
Meanwhile, Lodhran CCD Public Relations Officer Adnan Tahir, describing the motive behind the kidnapping, told Dawn.com:  “The suspect wanted to marry the victim but her family had married her off to someone else.”
He added that the suspect, along with his accomplices, kidnapped the woman from her husband’s house.
“Following the incident, a kidnapping case was registered against them,” Tahir said.
In March, police arrested two youths for kidnapping and gang-raping a 14-year-old girl in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district.
According to a recent report by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation (SSDO), each day in Pakistan in 2024 brought with it an average of 67 kidnappings, 19 rapes, six domestic violence cases and two honour killings, with conviction rates hovering at an appalling 0.5 per cent for honour killings and rape, 0.1pc for kidnapping, and a mere 1.3pc for domestic violence.
Per the report, the highest number of rape cases against women, totalling 532, were reported in Lahore but only two perpetrators were convicted. The situation was also alarming in Faisalabad, Kasur, and other districts. The highest number of cases of kidnapping of women were also reported in Lahore, with 4,510 cases, but only
five perpetrators were convicted.
It further noted that Gujranwala topped the list of domestic violence cases, but no punishment was given in any of the cases.</p><small>2025-05-26 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26171019911c9a3.jpg?r=185251' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913420/justice-mandokhail-questions-pti-joining-sunni-ittehad-council-as-sc-live-streams-reserved-seats-case' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Mandokhail questions PTI joining Sunni Ittehad Council as SC live-streams reserved seats case</strong></a><br><p>Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail questioned the PTI’s decision to merge with the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) during last year’s elections as the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench (CB) heard review pleas against a ruling that had declared the main opposition party eligible for reserved seats.
In its July 12, 2024 short order, eight out of 13 judges ruled that 39 out of a list of 80 MNAs were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the single largest party in the National Assembly.
However, the ruling had not been implemented by the National Assembly, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
An 11-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed the hearing today after Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had dismissed the review petitions on the first day of hearings.
The CB live-streamed its proceedings for the first time today, after accepting the SIC’s application for it last week. The hearing was live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel.
The other 10 members of the bench were Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.
 


During today’s hearing, Justice Mandokhail observed that it was not a political party that contested the elections but rather its candidates.
He further noted that the problem of reserved seats would not have arisen had the PTI-backed independent candidates not joined the SIC — a decision former premier Imran Khan’s party took after having its election symbol revoked by the SC just a month before the polls.
 
 

Senior counsel Makh­do­­om Ali Khan appeared on behalf of PML-N and PPP women candidates affected by the July 2024 ruling and concluded his arguments.
ECP counsel Sikandar Bashir Mohmand and PML-N lawyer Barrister Haris Azmat also informed the court that they had submitted their written responses. PPP’s Senator Farooq H. Naek said he would file his party’s response tomorrow. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow (Tuesday).
Initially, a full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin took up the review pleas on May 6. However, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi declared the applications as inadmissible and were not part of the subsequent proceedings, with the CB head judge noting they had stepped back voluntarily.
Justice Ayesha had formally complained to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi about her dissenting order not being uploaded to the SC’s website.
 
 

In her judgement, she had criticised the ECP for not implementing the earlier order, observing that it would “not only undermine the authority of the Supreme Court but also erode the foundational values of democracy itself”.
The SIC, which allied with the PTI during the 2024 elections and was a party in the reserved seats case, had requested the bench to put off the hearing until challenges to the 26th Amendment were decided and to include judges who had heard the original case.
However, the CB dismissed those pleas, with Justice Aminuddin observing that review petitions could be heard even by a bench smaller than the original bench after the 26th Amendment.
The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Makhdoom began presenting his arguments, Justice Hilali wondered how the SIC could be eligible for reserved seats.
“How can independent lawmakers join a political party that is not in the parliament? Did SIC take part in the elections?” she asked, at which the PPP lawyer replied that the party had not participated in the polls and that even its chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza had contested as an independent candidate.

Justice Mandokhail then observed that the SIC was not eligible for reserved seats. “The Sunni Ittehad Council could have become a parliamentary party but it does not have the right to reserved seats.”
Makhdoom contended that lawmakers elected on the reserved seats had been denotified without any prior notice, at which Justice Mazhar pointed out that the SC had struck down the ECP notifications.
The lawyer reiterated that the affected lawmakers should have been alerted about it beforehand. He argued that the ruling did not address Article 255 of the Constitution, according to which “no election to a House or a provincial assembly shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such tribunal and in such manner as may be determined” by a parliament Act.
Justice Mandokhail inquired how Article 255 was applicable in this case, highlighting that the matter pertained to reserved seats, which are to be allotted based on proportional representation in the parliament.
 
 

At Makhdoom saying that a complaint pertaining to a mistake in nomination papers should have been taken up before a tribunal, Justice Mandokhail observed that the case did not come under the Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) jurisdiction if the lawyer’s arguments were to be accepted.
Makhdoom asserted that it was the SC’s responsibility to “correct a mistake” as any decision “contrary to the Constitution and laws would be defective”. Justice Mandokhail remarked, “If the majority of the judges deem that the ruling was correct and the review pleas are not, what would happen in that situation?”
At this point, Justice Bilal asked whether the PTI was a party to the case, wondering, “How can a party that is not a respondent [in the case] be given reserved seats?”
Makhdoom answered that such a political party could not get reserved seats. CJP Afridi also observed that the PTI was not a respondent in the case.
Here, Justice Mandokhail observed, “We also have to review the ECP’s role at the time. In my opinion, the ECP did not fulfil its responsibility. [While] allotting the reserved seats or not is an issue, the election commission’s role is also to be looked at.”
 
 

The judge stated that in his minority judgement, there was “no formula for a middle path”. He noted that he perused the available records all night, according to which 41 candidates had written PTI in their party certificate and affiliations.
Here, Justice Afghan observed, “The Constitution cannot be rewritten. Justice Mandokhail and Justice Afridi have also written that fulfilling the legal requirement of a timeline is mandatory.”
Makhdoom then contended that Article 178 of the Constitution had “no jurisdiction”. “Complete justice is a provision of the Constitution, under which the SC does complete justice on a dispute. The right cannot be used to provide relief to a third party that is not a respondent in the case,” he argued. Justice Mandokhail then quipped, “This is the Supreme Court, not a civil court.”
At Makhdoom giving a hypothetical situation of a dispute between a landlord and a tenant, the judge replied that matter would be of a personal nature and stressed that the current case was about the “people’s right to vote”.
As Makhdoom quoted a judgement by CJP Afridi, Justice Mandokhail pointed that the top judge had called for the SC’s right to provide complete justice to be used with caution.
At one point, Justice Mandokhail remarked, “A political party does not end by not having an election symbol. A political party does not contest elections but its candidates do.
“An election symbol is for the public’s awareness. Someone cannot be stopped from running for elections due to not having an election symbol.”
The judge further noted, “If the independent candidates had remained in the PTI instead of joining the SIC, this issue would not be there today. If the SIC had contested the elections on its party symbol, then also the issue would not have arisen.”
 
 

The judge further said the presiding officers had not formulated Forms-33 correctly, while Makhdoom contended that the apex court had not taken up the reserved seats case within its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) but as an appeal.
Here, Justice Hilali reiterated her earlier question: “I am having trouble in understanding this. The SIC could not win even a single seat. Its chairman Hamid Raza himself did not contest elections from his party. [Moreover], the PTI was not even a party to the case. How can then reserved seats be given to it?”
The affected legislators’ lawyer responded saying that the use of the “allegiance to the Constitution” in the original SC verdict seemed “emotional”.
Justice Rizvi then inquired whether the PTI had challenged the ECP notifications in the PHC or ECP, to which Makhdoom replied in the negative.
Makhdoom urged the court to accept the review pleas, arguing that the “court could change its opinion in a review case”. Justice Mandokhail asked if it was possible for him to change his “decision in the reserved seats case”, to which the lawyer said, “Definitely, you can change your opinion.”
Makhdoom then concluded his arguments.
Noting that the opposing parties had submitted their written responses, SIC’s lawyer Faisal Siddiqui contended they had “lost their right to rebuttal”, at which Justice Aminuddin observed that it was upto the court to decide who had that right.
Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till Tuesday, with Siddiqui expected to present his arguments.
Tug-of-war over reserved seats
In its detailed verdict on the reserved seats case, which was authored by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC had observed that the ECP’s numerous “unlawful acts and omissions” had “caused confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates and the electorate who voted for PTI”.
 
 

It had also castigated the ECP for failing to fulfil its “role as a guarantor institution and impartial steward” of electoral processes.
On September 14, 2024 — the day the government was supposed to lay the 26th Amendment in both Houses of the parliament but could not — the Supreme Court, through a clarification, had reprimanded the ECP for not implementing its July 12 ruling in the reserved seats case.
Later on October 18, in yet another clarification, Justice Shah reiterated that the effect of an amendment made in the Elections Act 2017 in August last year could not undo the reserved seats case verdict.
 
 

The bill, titled “Elections (Second Amendment) Act, 2024”, was seen as aimed at circumventing the apex court’s verdict on the reserved seats case by barring independent lawmakers from joining a political party after a stipulated period.
A six-judge CB of the apex court was set to take up the PTI’s petition challenging those tweaks to the election laws in December 2024. A separate plea of the PTI against the Jan 13, 2024 ruling denying it its election symbol is also pending before the SC.</p><small>2025-05-26 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26165244a7805fb.jpg?r=165310' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913441/india-arrests-police-officer-suspected-of-spying-for-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India arrests police officer suspected of ‘spying for Pakistan’</strong></a><br><p>In another incident amid a growing crackdown on alleged espionage, Indian authorities on Monday said they arrested a paramilitary police officer on charges of “spying for Pakistan” following a recent military confrontation between the two neighbouring countries.
The developments follow a military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.  On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
 
 

Last week, Indian police arrested 10 people in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi —including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan or comments related to the recent escalation.
On Monday, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) alleged a Central Reserve Police Force officer was arrested in Delhi “for sharing sensitive information with Pakistani agents”.
“The accused, Moti Ram Jat, was actively involved in espionage activity and had been sharing classified information related to national security with Pakistan Intelligence Officers (PIOs) since 2023,” the NIA alleged.
Jat has been remanded to custody until June 6 by a special court, the agency said, as investigators question him.
The spate of arrests comes after the worst flare-up in violence between the nuclear-armed rivals since their last open conflict in 1999.
Ali Khan Mahmudabad, an associate professor at Haryana’s Ashoka University, was picked up from his home in Delhi last week for his comments about the Indian army’s press briefings on its actions targeting Pakistan, termed “Operation Sindoor”.
The complaint against Mahmudabad was filed by Yogesh Jatheri, general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing, in Haryana’s Sonepat district, the academic’s lawyer confirmed to Scroll.
Mahmudabad was arrested under offences pertaining to acts prejudicial to maintaining communal harmony, making assertions likely to cause disharmony, inciting secession, armed rebellion or subversive activities and insulting religious beliefs.
In a social media post on May 8, Mahmudabad, the head of the university’s political science department, had highlighted the apparent irony of right-wing Hindutva commentators praising Colonel Sofia Qureshi, who had addressed the media briefings.
Meanwhile, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights reported that between April 27 and May 8, there were 184 anti-Muslim attacks of various sorts all over India.
They comprise 19 acts of vandalism, 39 assaults, 42 incidents of harassment and 84 incidents of hate speech. It’s believed that 106 were “triggered” by Pahalgam. The majority happened in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra.</p><small>2025-05-26 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26172348eb022b6.jpg?r=182958' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913443/punjab-pdma-requests-govt-to-issue-rules-for-proper-solar-panel-installation' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab PDMA requests govt to issue rules for proper solar panel installation</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday requested the government to issue rules and guidelines for the proper installation of solar panels.
This development comes after heavy rains lashed several parts of Punjab on Saturday, resulting in multiple casualties. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others were injured across Punjab and KP following the severe weather. About two dozen incidents of the fall of solar panels and billboards were also reported.
PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia wrote separate letters to the Energy Department, Local Government Department and the Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners across the province, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
The letters said that 70 per cent of the “human losses were caused by the structural collapse of poorly installed solar panels/solar energy system or solar-related structures due to windstorm”.
It further said that there was an urgent need to “ensure that all solar installations — especially those on rooftops and open structures must be executed in a technically sound and weather resilient manner”.
The PDMA said that the installations must be “properly designed, structurally secure and approved by the concerned authorities”, urging the use of certified materials and mounting equipment as well as following recognised engineering standards.
“A thorough review of existing installations should also be carried out, with immediate corrective actions taken where necessary,” it said, adding that “appropriate maintenance and inspection protocols” must be developed and implemented regularly.
The authority requested a survey of any dangerous solar structures and address such cases, and stated, “Timely action will help protect lives, public infrastructure and support the long-term success of solar energy initiatives in Punjab.”
Pakistan became the largest importer of solar panels in the world by the end of 2024, British news outlet The Independent reported, citing the Global Electricity Review 2025 report by UK-based energy think tank, Ember.
“Amid high electricity prices linked to expensive contracts with privately-owned thermal power stations, rooftop solar installations in Pakistan’s homes and businesses soared as a means of accessing lower-cost power,” the report stated. “The country imported 17 GW of solar panels in 2024 to meet this growing consumer demand.”</p><small>2025-05-26 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/261757417787bee.jpg?r=182005' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913452/ruet-i-hilal-committee-to-convene-to-sight-zilhaj-moon-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Ruet-i-Hilal Committee to convene to sight Zilhaj moon tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>The Ruet-i-Hilal Committee will meet tomorrow in Islamabad to sight the Zilhaj moon, state-run broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported.
Earlier this week, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) issued a prediction regarding the sighting of the crescent moon for the month of Zilhaj 1446 AH, “based on scientific analysis, astronomical data, and modern observational techniques.”
The statement said that the birth of the new moon for Zilhaj will occur on May 27, meaning that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha is likely to be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
According to Radio Pakistan, Committee Chairman Maulana Syed Muhammad Abdul Khabeer Azad will preside over the meeting, while zonal Ruet-e-Hilal Committees will also meet separately at their respective headquarters for sighting of the Eidul Azha Moon.

Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, took over as interim head of the country last August after deadly student-led protests forced then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India.
Yunus’ administration has faced pressure from civil servants, teachers, political parties and the military as the caretaker government attempts to guide the country through a fragile transition before holding a general election.
The government issued an ordinance on Sunday allowing the Ministry of Public Administration to dismiss public servants for misconduct without lengthy procedures, sparking outrage across the bureaucracy.
Government employees continued their demonstrations for a third consecutive day on Monday, calling the ordinance “repressive” and demanding its immediate withdrawal.
Thousands of teachers in government primary schools also began indefinite leave from work on Monday, demanding a hike in wages.
In the face of protests by the employees of the National Board of Revenue, the interim government was forced on Sunday to withdraw an order to dissolve the tax body and replace it with two divisions under the finance ministry.
Political uncertainty also deepened last week after a top student leader said Yunus said he could step down if political parties cannot agree on reforms and an election timeline.
Wahiduddin Mahmud, the planning adviser in Yunus’ cabinet, however, said the de facto prime minister was not quitting.
“We are not going anywhere till our job is done,” Mahmud said during the weekend, adding that Yunus acknowledged the obstacles but remained committed to holding a fair election.
The interim government has been caught between competing demands for swift general elections and reforms. Yunus has said the elections could be held by June 2026, while the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has been pushing for polls by December.
Bangladesh’s army chief, General Wakeruz Zaman, added to the pressure by calling for elections to be held in December during a speech last week, expressing his dissatisfaction over the political situation.
Yunus convened a last-minute meeting of his Advisory Council on Saturday and also held talks during the weekend with the country’s main political forces, including the BNP, Jamaat-i-Islami and the student-led National Citizen Party.
Leaders of other political parties also met Yunus.
“We are in a war-like situation,” Yunus’ press secretary Shafiqul Alam told reporters on Sunday. “After the Awami League’s activities were banned, attempts are on to destabilise us in various ways. We have to get out of this situation.”
The registration of Hasina’s Awami League party was suspended this month, effectively barring the party from contesting the next election.</p><small>2025-05-26 13:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/261550226e72b2d.png?r=155451' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913432/former-sindh-governor-kamaluddin-azfar-passes-away-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Former Sindh governor Kamaluddin Azfar passes away in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Former Sindh governor and veteran PPP leader Kamaluddin Azfar passed away in Karachi on Monday, according to his family and party officials.
PPP Sindh Secretary General Senator Waqar Mehdi told Dawn.com that Azfar had been admitted to Ziauddin Hospital, where he breathed his last.
Mehdi said Azfar’s funeral prayers would likely be decided after the arrival of his children from abroad.
Azfar was close aide of former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
He also served as PPP Karachi president and was once known as the “son of Karachi”.
The veteran leader was instrumental in constructing apartments for lower-income communities in Karachi’s Lines Area.
Azfar was a former senator and relinquished his senatorship when he was appointed Sindh governor in 1995 by ex-premier Benazir Bhutto.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed sorrow at Azfar’s demise, calling him a “wise politician.”
“Your political services will be remembered,” Murad said of Azfar,  who also held the post of finance minister, according to a statement from the minister’s office.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said she was “grieved” by Azfar’s passing.
“He served in many positions including Governor Sindh, and was a well known activist as well as politician from Karachi, who worked closely with Shaheed Benazir Bhutto on local government policies among other initiatives.
“Prayers for his family and loved ones in this moment of loss,” she said in a post on X.
 






The Karachi Literature Festival, which hosted Azfar as a speaker multiple times, called him a well-known lawyer, writer and political figure.
“Educated at Government College, Lahore, and Balliol College, Oxford, he was called to the Bar at the Inner temple, London.”
Upon returning to Pakistan, he established his law practice in Karachi.
“As a writer, Barrister Azfar has mostly written on issues concerning economics, history and politics. He was Research Assistant to Nobel Prize Winning Economist Gunnar Myrdal on his magnum opus The Asian Drama: 1960-63.
“His later publications have included The Chinese Synthesis (1975), Pakistan: Political and Constitutional Dilemmas (1987), an anthology titled Pakistan under the Military (1991), Asian Drama Revisited (1992), Good Governance (1994), Discovery of Pakistan (2005), and, most recently, Waters of Lahore (2014),” KLF said in a description on him.
Azfar has held key offices, such as Sindh minister for finance, planning and development, federal minister for local government and rural development, and special assistant to the prime minister.

“Something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!” Trump said of the Russian president on Truth Social.
“I’ve always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that’s proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!”
Trump also criticised Zelensky, posting that the Ukrainian leader “is doing his Country no favours by talking the way he does. Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop.”
Speaking to reporters at the airport in Morristown, New Jersey, Trump said of Putin: “I don’t know what’s wrong with him. What the hell happened to him? Right? He’s killing a lot of people. I’m not happy about that.” He raised the possibility of imposing more sanctions on Russia in response to the ongoing attacks.
The Kremlin on Monday said that US President Donald Trump’s claim that Vladimir Putin had “gone absolutely CRAZY” might be due to emotional overload, but thanked the US leader for his assistance in launching Ukraine peace negotiations.
“We are really grateful to the Americans and to President Trump personally for their assistance in organising and launching this negotiation process,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about the Trump remarks about Putin.
“Of course, at the same time, this is a very crucial moment, which is associated, of course, with the emotional overload of everyone absolutely and with emotional reactions.”
There was no immediate response Zelensky’s office on Trump’s remarks.
In the biggest aerial assault of the war, Russia pummeled Ukrainian cities and other targets with at least 367 drones and missiles overnight on Sunday, killing at least 12 people, including three children in the northern region of Zhytomyr, Ukrainian officials said.
 
 

The Russian attack was the largest of the war in terms of weapons fired, although other strikes have killed more people.
Trump has been pressuring Russia and Ukraine to end the more than three-year war, but the two sides remain far apart — and while major powers talk, the war is intensifying and Russian forces are advancing in eastern Ukraine.
Swarms of drones are being launched by both sides while fierce fighting is underway along key parts of the front.
The Kremlin says it is conducting what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine to protect Russia from Nato encroachment on its borders. Ukraine says Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression.</p><small>2025-05-26 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606272-former-sindh-governor-kamal-azfar-passes-away-at-87' target='_blank'><strong>Former Sindh governor Kamal Azfar passes away at 87</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had opened high-level policy talks in Islamabad on May 19 to discuss the FY2025-26 budget. As deliberations with the IMF remained inconclusive, the government has postponed the budget announcement till June 10.
While speaking at an event in Islamabad, the finance minister said they were working on a “strategic budget” instead of “just making the math work”.
He said that the “DNA” of the economy had to change.
“And therefore we are going to bring some bold measures during the budget because the budget is not just about revenue and expenditure but has to provide the strategic direction where the economy is and where it is heading,” he said.
“So it’s our full effort to make this document more strategic, rather than just making the math work,” he said. “Of course, we have to make the math work.”
On debt servicing cost, he noted that it had gone down “by a trillion rupees”.
“And next year, what we are going to do, god willing, is to restructure and reorganise our debt management office along modern lines in terms of international best practices,” he said.
He observed that the country was heavily dependent on imports, leading to a foreign exchange issue and a balance of payment crisis.
“We go running back to the lenders as the last resort, the reason why we are in the 24th IMF programme … let’s be very clear about this because all of us have had enough boom and bust cycles,” he added.
In terms of structural reforms, he reiterated the government’s resolve to “stay the course” on the taxation side; people, process, and technology framework; and digitalisation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
On the public financing side, the finance minister said, “Its important that whatever we are doing — including the rightsizing of the federal government — we are taking it in waves rather than a big bang approach and we will continue on that journey.”
 
 

Last year, Aurangzeb presented his first federal budget with a total outlay of Rs18.9 trillion, which analysts said was broadly “in line with IMF guidelines”.
Aurangzeb, during the budget presentation, had said that the goal was to widen the tax base to avoid burdening existing taxpayers.
Pakistan’s total revenue for the current fiscal year was budgeted at Rs17,815bn. After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs7,438bn, the net revenue stood at Rs10,377bn, representing a significant 48.7pc increase from the fiscal year 2023-24.</p><small>2025-05-26 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/26154546ceec100.jpg?r=155136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913437/india-races-to-contain-oil-spill-after-container-ship-sinks-off-kerala-coast' target='_blank'><strong>India races to contain oil spill after container ship sinks off Kerala coast</strong></a><br><p>India’s coastguard raced on Monday to contain an oil spill from a container ship with hazardous cargo that sank off the southern coast a day earlier, Kerala’s state government said.
The Liberian-flagged MSC ELSA 3, listed as a 184 meter freight ship, went down off the coast of Kerala on Sunday, with all 24 crew members rescued.
It was carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo and 12 containing calcium carbide, a chemical used for fertiliser production and steelmaking. The vessel also contained some 370 tonnes of fuel and oil.
“The Coast Guard is taking action to prevent the spread of oil using two ships,” Kerala’s government said in a statement.
“The work of spraying dust to destroy the oil is in progress using a Dornier aircraft”.

India’s defence ministry said the ship sank “due to flooding” some 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi, raising concerns for the “sensitive marine ecosystem along Kerala’s coast”.
The government has put coastal areas on high alert and warned people not to touch or approach any containers — some of which have already washed up along the coast.
The ship was sailing between the Indian ports of Vizhinjam and Kochi when it ran into trouble on Saturday and issued a distress call.</p><small>2025-05-26 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606261-pakistan-railways-to-run-five-eid-special-trains-from-major-cities' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Railways to run five Eid special trains from major cities</strong></a><br><p>

The benchmark KSE-100 index declined by 886.10, or 0.74 per cent, to stand at 118,216.57 from the last close of 119,102.67 at 1:13pm.
At 3:04pm, the index decreased by 642.92 points, or 0.54pc, from the last close.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, attributed the decline to “delay in budget announcement”, in addition to “lack of clarity” on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “conditions related to budget pushing investors to trim their exposure”.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, said, “The market is consolidating ahead of the budget, with pressure on the oil sector following media reports of disagreements with the IMF over the circular debt resolution plan and the onset of rollover week.”
“We expect a rerating to the upside once there is clarity on key budgetary measures,” he added.
The government has delayed unveiling the federal budget from June 2 to June 10 due to inconclusive discussions with the IMF on taxation and fiscal measures.
Informed sources said the visiting IMF staff mission had multiple rounds of discussion, including a wrap-up session with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “The market is concerned about delays in the release of circular debt payments to companies, as well as the potential rationalisation of tariffs in the upcoming budget.”
On a positive note, he highlighted the reduction in the primary surplus target to 1.6pc of GDP — down from last year’s 2.1pc.
He said that this was “expected to give the government some fiscal space to avoid imposing harsh new taxes, unlike the pattern seen over the past three years”.
“Although the room for significant relief is limited, we expect a relatively more people-centric budget, with emphasis on executing the comprehensive tax reforms initiated under the IMF programme over the last two years,” he said.
On Friday, the stock market had come under renewed selling pressure, forcing the index to close the outgoing in the red as jittery investors trimmed their positions amid fears of an unfriendly IMF-driven federal budget.
Contrary to the preceding week, when the benchmark KSE 100 index recovered a staggering 12,474 points thanks to a US-brokered ceasefire between two nuclear-armed neighbors, the PSX faltered due to lacklustre conditions as investors preferred to remain on the sidelines before the announcement of the budget 2025-26.

Trump on Friday said he was recommending a 50pc tariff go into place on June 1 because of frustration that talks with the EU were not moving quickly enough. The threat roiled global financial markets and intensified a trade war that has been punctuated by frequent changes in tariff policies toward US trading partners and allies.
Trump, who has repeatedly expressed disdain for the EU and its treatment of the US on trade, relented after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told him on Sunday that the EU needed more time to come to an agreement.
She asked him during a call to delay the tariffs until July, the deadline he had originally set when he announced new tariffs in April. Trump told reporters he had granted the request.
“We had a very nice call, and I agreed to move it,” Trump said before returning to Washington after a weekend in New Jersey.
“She said we will rapidly get together and see if we can work something out.” Von der Leyen said in a post on X that she had a “good call” with Trump and that the EU was ready to move quickly.
 






“Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,” she said.
“To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.”
The euro and US dollar rose against the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc after the deadline extension.
In early April, Trump set a 90-day window for trade talks between the EU and the US, which was to end on July 9. But on Friday he upended that timeframe and said he wasn’t interested in a deal at all.
“I’m not looking for a deal,” Trump said then. “We’ve set the deal it’s at 50pc.”
Major US stock indexes and European shares dropped and the dollar weakened as a result.
Trump has sought to upend the world economy with his trade policies, but after his announcement in April of tariffs on multiple countries sparked financial market upheaval, he dialed down his threats in favor of talks. Since then Washington has inked a pact with Britain and has held discussions with China.
But progress with the EU has been more limited, sparking Trump’s ire and adding to broader tensions between the two allies over Trump’s “America first” agenda and Europe’s longtime reliance on Washington for security and defense needs.</p><small>2025-05-26 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606259-rain-hailstorms-likely-in-upper-and-central-pakistan-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Rain, hailstorms likely in upper and central Pakistan: PMD</strong></a><br><p>

The negotiations between Washington and Tehran aim to resolve a decades-long dispute over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, and both sides have taken a tough stance in public over the issue of Iran’s uranium enrichment.
Asked about reports that Iran could freeze enrichment for three years to reach an agreement, spokesperson Esmail Baghaei told a press conference: “Iran will never accept that.”
Baghaei also ruled out the possibility of an interim nuclear deal with the US, dismissing media reports that a provisional agreement was being considered as a temporary step towards a final deal.
President Donald Trump said on Sunday that US negotiators had “very good” talks with an Iranian delegation over the weekend.
Iran is waiting for further details from mediator Oman regarding the timing of the next round of talks, Baghaei said.
“If there is goodwill from the American side, we are also optimistic, but if talks are aimed at curbing Iran’s rights then talks will get nowhere,” he added.
The stakes are high for both sides.
Trump wants to curtail Tehran’s potential to produce a nuclear weapon that could trigger a regional nuclear arms race and perhaps threaten Israel.
Iran, for its part, maintains its nuclear programme is exclusively for civilian purposes and wants to be rid of devastating sanctions on its oil-based economy.</p><small>2025-05-26 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606258-eid-ul-adha-ruet-e-hilal-committee-meets-tomorrow-to-sight-zil-hajj-moon' target='_blank'><strong>Eid ul Adha: Ruet-e-Hilal committee meets tomorrow to sight Zil Hajj moon</strong></a><br><p>

Karim was elected unopposed after the position fell vacant following the demise of former emir Professor Sajid Mir on May 3, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Hafiz Abdul Karim on his election and expressed his good wishes for the newly elected chief of the religio-political party.
The PML-N has nominated Hafiz Abdul Karim, who was earlier the secretary-general of JAH, as its candidate for the Senate seat which fell vacant after the demise of Prof Mir.
According to a PML-N press release, party president Nawaz Sharif offered the Senate seat to Prof Mir’s son, Ahmad Mir, but he declined the offer. The PML-N then nominated Karim for the vacant Senate seat.
Karim earlier served as a senator from March 2018 to March 2024 on a technocrat seat from Punjab. He was also a member of the National Assembly from June 2013 to 2018. Besides, he served as the minister for communication in the cabinet of then premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in 2017.
Notable religious and political leader Prof Mir passed away at the age of 86 earlier this month after a heart attack. He was laid to rest in his native Sialkot.
Mir was elected as a PML-N senator in 2021, which was his fifth time contesting the Senate election on the party’s ticket. He had also served as a senator from March 2009 to March 2015.

On February 25, the finance ministry had announced it was considering “establishing a National Crypto Council” to adopt emerging digital currencies in line with global trends. It later appointed Saqib as chief executive officer of the PPC.
According to a press release issued today, Saqib will now be responsible for developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets, launching Bitcoin mining initiatives, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records.
Additionally, he will also facilitate “licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)” and champion “investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth” in the country.
According to Forbes, Saqib — who is part of their ‘30 under 30’ list — is the cofounder of Tayaba, which the publication describes as “a social enterprise that aims to provide solutions to the water crisis in Pakistan”.
He also received his MBE in 2023 for contributions to the UK’s National Health Service, the statement added.
An MBE, which stands for “Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire”, is awarded for an outstanding achievement or service to the community which has had a long-term, significant impact.
According to the statement today, this appointment reflected the country’s  “commitment to aligning with global trends”.
“Just as the United States has brought leaders like David Sacks — appointed by Donald Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar — into its digital policy framework, Pakistan is taking a forward-thinking approach by empowering a youth leader to help steer national strategy in emerging technologies,” the statement read.
The press release also stated that the country stood at a “critical digital crossroads” — with it consistently ranking in the top 10 globally for crypto adoption, according to the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index.
It noted Pakistan currently had 40 million crypto users and an annual crypto trading volume exceeding $300 billion.
Additionally, it added that the “nation produces around 40,000 IT graduates annually and boasts the 4th largest freelancer market worldwide”.

This development has brought considerable comfort to motorists. The previous closures had forced them to take long detours, resulting in increased fuel consumption and wastage of time.
A large number of citizens have welcomed the decision and expressed the hope that the reopened U-turns and squares would not be closed again under the pretext of managing traffic congestion.
“It [the reopening of U-turns] happened due to a collective effort of all stakeholders,” said Deputy Commissioner Irfan Memon when contacted on Sunday.

Decision taken on permanent basis and happened due to collective effort of all stakeholders, says DC

When asked whether the move was permanent or if the U-turns might be closed again, he confirmed that it would be permanent.
 
 

However, while most people commend the decision of the local administration and the capital police, some fear it may lead to traffic jams in the city.
A senior police officer noted that the traffic police would need additional personnel to manage traffic at reopened intersections, especially those lacking traffic signals.
Citing “security concerns and the smooth flow of traffic,” city managers and police had originally closed numerous crossings and U-turns in 2011. The closures were prompted by the traffic police’s lack of resources and personnel.
Another senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, criticised the move, stating that the closure of over 70 intersections had compromised pedestrian safety, particularly for school-going children. He acknowledged that the closures had more to do with manpower shortages than security or traffic flow.
The idea of closing intersections was initiated and implemented by the Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) even though it was a law enforcement agency and not responsible for traffic engineering. While the ITP cited security concerns for some closures, the number of such crossings was relatively small.
Many people were worried about other closed intersections which were made signal-free, allowing motorists to drive fast.
 
 

“It was difficult for pedestrians to cross from G-7 to G-8 and similarly from G-6 to G-7 due to the high-speed traffic and lack of signals,” said Ahmed Ali, a resident of G-6.
A senior CDA official noted that no other city was as “signal-free” as Islamabad had become. “By closing intersections, the concept of ‘zebra crossing’ has nearly disappeared from the city,” he said. In developed countries, pedestrians have more rights than motorists, he added. “There, pedestrians can stop fast-moving vehicles by pressing a button at traffic lights, turning them red to safely cross.”
“Now that crossings and U-turns have reopened, it is the responsibility of motorists to follow traffic rules and avoid creating jams,” said Abdul Qadir, a resident of F-8.
Mohammad Riaz, a senior citizen from F-10, added that many previously closed U-turns and chowks in the busy F-10 Markaz had been reopened, allowing motorists to cross main roads without inconvenience.
Meanwhile, a senior journalist who recently visited China noted that no one takes the first available U-turn after entering a highway from a side road there, not due to a law but out of consideration for traffic flow. He expressed the hope that such civic responsibility could be adopted in Pakistan as well.

According to the first information report (FIR) lodged with the police based on the victim’s complaint, the suspect, a resident of her native village in Khanewal, claimed he was an adviser to the chief minister and promised he could facilitate her transfer to a hospital of her choice.
He continued to make such assurances and eventually called her to Lahore. Upon her arrival in Lahore, the suspect reportedly showed her videos of her family, issued threats and attempted to sexually assault her.
The FIR stated that on May 20, the suspect forcibly entered her hostel in Murree after pushing aside the security guard and falsely claimed that the doctor was his wife. Despite her efforts to persuade him to leave, he forcibly took her out and placed her in a cab, in which two other individuals were already seated.
 
 

She said the men threatened to kill her and took her to a hotel, where two other individuals were guarding the premises. The victim alleged that the suspect sexually assaulted her repeatedly throughout the night. She said she managed to escape and later shared her ordeal with her father, who was in Multan at the time.
After her father’s arrival in Murree, she lodged a formal complaint with the police, accusing the suspect of rape, impersonating a public official and naming two others for aiding and abetting the crime. The FIR has been registered on charges of rape, abduction and impersonation. However, the suspect has yet to be arrested.

This unsurprisingly results in Malaysia leading the Asia-focused categories of Trip.com’s global rankings.
Named the best in a total of 19 categories, ranging from accommodation to nightlife, the country boasts several establishments that received multiple recognitions.
The popular island of Langkawi earns repeat mentions for its hotels and villas, as well as its Underwater World attraction. Langkawi was also named one of “Asia’s best coastal destinations”.
The only other place in Malaysia crowned best coastal destination is Semporna, a scenic seaside town in Sabah’s east coast.
Meanwhile, the state’s capital city Kota Kinabalu joins Semporna, Langkawi, Melaka and Kuala Lumpur in the “best destinations” category.
Understandably, Kuala Lumpur draws many visits from local and foreign tourists alike. Many of its attractions and restaurants are highlighted in the rankings.
Some of the categories that the city appears in are “best family-friendly destinations” (the only Malaysian spot in this category), “best nightlife (bars)”, “best gourmet hotels”, and “best things to do”. The latter includes Petronas Twin Towers, which was also recognised under “Asia’s best night attractions”.
“It’s truly exciting to see Malaysian establishments being recognised across so many categories in this year’s Trip.Best Global Rankings,” Stephane Thong, general manager of Trip.com Malaysia, said in a press statement.
“From family-friendly hotels and scenic resorts to local culinary gems and iconic attractions, this recognition reflects the richness and diversity of our travel offerings.
“We hope this not only inspires Malaysians to rediscover local favourites but also encourages more international travellers to explore what Malaysia has to offer – especially as we gear up for Visit Malaysia 2026,” Thong added.
Updated annually, Trip.Best is a signature collection of curated travel rankings by the international one-stop travel service provider Trip.com.

• Demands release of Yasin Malik, others detained in Indian jails
MUZAFFARABAD: A civil society alliance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) campaigning for public rights has given the regional government a deadline of June 8, though Eidul Azha is likely to fall on June 7, to implement its ‘Charter of Demands’, warning of further mass mobilisation in the event of dilly-dallying or inaction.
The announcement was made by Shaukat Nawaz Mir, a prominent leader of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), in his speech in the small hours of Sunday at a massive rally held at Muzaffarabad’s Lal Chowk.
Titled as “Conference of the Martyrs of Jammu and Kashmir and Public Rights”, the rally began on Saturday afternoon, with thousands of participants arriving in caravans from across the region till late evening.
The event continued until dawn on Sunday, during which more than two dozen speakers, including the JKJAAC’s core committee members, addressed the emotionally charged gathering.
 
 

Local hotel and trader associations facilitated the participants by offering free accommodation and meals. The event ended peacefully, much to the relief of the local administration.
The 13-point declaration read out by Mr Mir at the rally addressed internal governance issues, the Kashmir conflict, and the dangers of nuclear war in South Asia.
It stressed that lasting peace between Pakistan and India, as well as in the South Asian region, was impossible without a resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“The international community must ensure the peaceful and permanent settlement of the Kashmir issue as per the collective will of the people and their inalienable right to self-determination under the UN Charter,” the declaration said.
It also warned that if any decision was imposed against the will of Kashmiris, or if war was thrust upon the region, the people across all divided units of the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir would reserve the right to peacefully dismantle the so-called “bloody” Line of Control (LoC).
The declaration raised grave concerns about the possibility of a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, and appealed to citizens of both countries as well as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives, Afghanistan and Iran to support Kashmiris’ call for self-determination to prevent becoming collateral in such a conflict.
Demanding the release of prominent Kashmiri resistance leader Yasin Malik and other political prisoners detained in Indian jails, the declaration also condemned “enforced disappearances” in the AJK and “arrests of political activists in Gilgit-Baltistan”.
New 16-point charter
The committee warned the AJK government to fulfil commitments made under a previous agreement regarding a 10-point charter of demands. If implementation was not ensured by June 8, the alliance said it would announce its next course of action during a representative meeting in the Mirpur division.
“We caution the rulers: if we are compelled to issue another protest call, they will not be able to escape its repercussions,” Mr Mir said.
The alliance also rejected the recent increase in perks and privileges for AJK’s elite, calling it a mockery of public sentiment. It reiterated its demand for complete reversal of these benefits.
In a strong rebuttal, Mr Mir dismissed Prime Minister Anwarul Haq’s allegations of “RAW funding” for the protest movement, terming them baseless and malicious.
“Our movement is being funded by donations from local residents and overseas Kashmiris, with complete transparency ensured through social media disclosures,” he said.
According to the JKJAAC, the newly introduced 16-point charter — formally adopted at a core committee meeting in Dhirkot (Bagh) on May 21 — would now be pursued alongside the earlier demands.
 
 

The new demands included free and equitable access to education and healthcare, employment opportunities, establishment of international airports in AJK, provision of clean drinking and irrigation water, construction of the Taobat-Bhimber Expressway, elimination of corruption, bribery and favouritism in government departments, interest-free loans for youth, regulation of exploitative cellular companies, quotas and financial support for persons with disabilities, and tax exemptions.
It also called for reform of judicial privileges and procedures, including transparent appointments, timely hearings and judicial accountability, to ensure the protection of public rights.
The declaration strongly criticised the continued violation of Article 52-C of the Interim Constitution and a 2019 AJK High Court ruling on hydropower resources, terming them detrimental to the rule of law.
Another key demand was the abolition of 12 legislative seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees living in Pakistan. The committee asserted that these seats had become instruments of exploitation and obstacles to local ownership and self-governance, and their immediate abolition was essential.
Instead, the refugees residing within AJK should be granted legislative representation and ownership rights, particularly those displaced after 1989, the JKJAAC stressed.
It further demanded an immediate halt to what it called the unconstitutional and unethical diversion of development funds from AJK to the so-called 12 constituencies in Pakistan, describing it as a form of open corruption.
It also opposed job quotas for refugees settled in Pakistan, calling them unjust to the residents of AJK. “The right to employment in the liberated territory must be restricted to those living within it,” it added.

Shockingly, the official vehicles in the use of top-ranked officers were spotted violating the traffic laws. They included inspector general of police, Lahore Commissioner and DC, DGs of Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Pakistan Post, Agriculture, Excise and Taxation, Punjab Food Authority and Health Services, Lesco CEO and additional chief secretaries.
It was revealed in a report formed by the City Traffic Police (CTP) Lahore, carrying the record of total 3,896 official vehicles that were spotted ignoring traffic rules.
As per the report, the Punjab Police was at the top among other federal and provincial departments whose 496 official vehicles committed traffic violations in Lahore, followed by 358 vehicles of the Services & General Administration Dept and 328 of the Lahore Electricity Supply Company (Lesco).

Vehicles of IGP, commissioner, DC, FIA DG, other top officers found committing violations, not paying fines

About the departments, the traffic police said many vehicles belonged to the CM Monitoring Cell, Law, Parliamentary Affairs & Human Rights Department Punjab, the Pakistan Railways, Punjab Revenue Authority, Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd, National Highways Authority, Ministry of Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines, Punjab Home Department, the Environment Protection Department Punjab, the Lahore Development Authority.
A vehicle (LRZ 6076), in the use of an SP, violated the traffic laws 107 times (highest violations) in Lahore and fines imposed on this vehicle, amounting to Rs50,300, were still unpaid. Another vehicle (LZR 9872), which was under the use of the Punjab Agriculture DG, violated the traffic regulations 83 times and its Rs74,000 fine was not paid. An official vehicle (LWQ 1235) belonging to the additional chief secretary (S&GAD) Punjab committed 47 violations and its fine Rs21,300 was still unpaid. Seven other vehicles belonging to the same officer were spotted violating traffic laws 65 times.
The report further revealed that 300 vehicles which violated traffic laws belonged to Wapda, 184 to Livestock & Dairy Department, 181 PTCL, 130 SNGPL, 122 irrigation department, 117 of PFA Punjab, 107 DC office, 102 belonged to the Lahore Cantonment Board, 104 National Highways Authority, 99 of agriculture department, 89 LDA, 76 Pakistan Railways, 69 Punjab Revenue Authority, 68 of Punjab health department, 61 Punjab Horticulture Authority, 42 of Punjab Home Department, 41 of Ring Road Authority, 40 of Punjab Board of Revenue, 37 of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, 31 of FIA etc.
An official said the statistics came to the limelight when the Punjab Safe City cameras spotted the vehicles and issued them e-challan tickets. The city traffic police conducted detailed investigations and found out that these vehicles belonged to 73 departments.
Another irritating part of the development is that all officials in charge of these vehicles never bothered to pay fines, prompting the traffic police high-ups to write them letters to ‘identify the violators and pay fees’ besides initiating action against them.
Lahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Athar Waheed has brought the matter to the notice of Chief Secretary Zahid Akthar Zaman and IGP Dr Usman Anwar. He has requested the both higher officers of the province to intervene to stop violations being committed by those running the province.
On the other hand, the traffic police lodged 4,541 FIRs against the citizens for violating traffic rules in Lahore during the last 10 days. Many of them were arrested on the spot, the official said.

The latest victim, Sheema Ibrahim, was undergoing treatment at Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta, where she died of her injuries. She was the daughter of a Levies official and had been in critical condition since the explosion.
 
 

The fatalities now include eight APS students, seven girls and one boy, along with two adults. On the day of the attack, three students — Saniya Soomro (Grade 6), Hafza Kausar (Grade 7) and Ayesha Saleem (Grade 10) — died on the spot. In the days that followed, Haider, Mala­ika and Sehr Saleem succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment. The identity of one more student could not be ascertained.
Security officials have condemned the assault, alleging foreign involvement in the targeted attack on schoolchildren. “Eight innocent lives have fallen victim to India’s campaign of terrorism within Pakistan,” a senior security official said.

With feel-like temperature soaring past 40°C and humidity adding to the misery, frustration among the public reached boiling point.
The Sakhi Hassan hydrant is the only operational hydrant supplying water to the densely populated Central district.
The protesters, including women and children, blocked both sides of the road outside the hydrant, disrupting traffic for hours.
Many carried empty water containers, which is a symbol of the growing desperation in the city, already reeling under infrastructural challenges.

Many areas continue to face severe shortage

For over a month, large parts of Karachi, particularly in the Central district, have been experiencing a severe water shortage.
Areas like Buffer Zone, North Karachi, North Nazimabad, Federal B Area and Shadman Town have reported little to no water supply for weeks, forcing residents to rely on expensive private water tankers or travel long distances to fetch water.
“This is not the first protest,” said Shahid Ali, a resident of Shadman Town. “We protested here two weeks ago. The authorities made promises, but nothing changed. We’re still without water. How long can people survive like this?”
The city’s total daily water demand is estimated at over 1,200 million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the supply falls drastically short, hovering around 550 to 600 MGD even under optimal conditions.
Both experts and officials agree that chronic infrastructure issues, rampant water theft, deep-rooted corruption within Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation and poor governance have further exacerbated the situation.
Electricity outage at Gharo pump
The fresh crisis got further deeper when the KWSC issued a statement attributing the latest disruption to a technical fault caused by a power outage at the Gharo Pumping Station — a critical component of the city’s water supply network.
According to the KWSC spokesman, a cable fault at 10:35am led to a complete shutdown of the pumping station.
“Due to a cable fault on KE’s network, the Gharo Pumping Station is non-operational at the moment,” the statement read. “We are in continuous coordination with KE to restore operations. However, the fault has not yet been resolved.”
The Gharo Pumping Station is responsible for supplying nearly 30 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to key areas of Karachi, including Port Qasim, Bin Qasim Town, Shah Faisal Town, PNS Mehran, PAF Base Faisal, and Karsaz. With its operations stalled, several districts face further strain on already stretched water resources.

Lahore Qalandars were Pakistan Super League champions again, sealing their third title in four seasons after pulling off a remarkable chase.
Quetta Gladiators had been in the ascendancy in Sunday’s final, headed towards what they believed was their destiny — a second PSL crown — having clinched their first six long years ago. They had tightened the noose around the Qalandars, who, in their chase of 202, needed 57 runs to win off the last 20 deliveries when Raza joined Perera at the crease.
But the Qalandars found inspiration, as Gladiators lost theirs; Perera played a masterful knock of an unbeaten 31-ball 62 featuring four sixes and five fours, with Raza providing the ideal foil with 22 off seven balls to take their side home with a ball to spare. As their teammates ran onto the pitch in jubilation, the Gladiators sank to the ground, left wondering what could have been.
 


Raza, who had flown in from England after featuring for Zimbabwe in a four-day Test that only ended on Saturday and only arrived 10 minutes before the toss for the final, began the recovery when he deposited the first two balls he faced for a four and a six. The hits, both in the mid-wicket region, came immediately after Mohammad Amir had dismissed Bhanuka Rajapaksa to put the Gladiators on top.

Perera, Raza star in nerve-jangling last-over victory against Quetta Gladiators to seal third title in four seasons

Perera launched the offensive from the other end; the left-hander — who only came into the Qalandars’ side after the PSL was halted with eight games to go due to Pakistan-India skirmishes — hit Khurram Shahzad for two sixes and then punished Amir in the penultimate over for two fours and a slog-sweep for six.
That left Qalandars needing 13 off the final over and Raza came to the fore after Hasan Nawaz, who had earlier scored 76 for Gladiators, acrobatically saved a boundary. The Zimbabwean slashed an audacious six over point and then used his wrists to spark Qalandars’ celebrations in front of a partisan home crowd.
Qalandars skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi ran to lift Raza on his shoulders. The pacer — who was the pick of Lahore’s bowlers with 3-24 — had given his side the ideal start in the final when he dismissed his Gladiators counterpart Saud Shakeel early on. Saud’s opening partner Finn Allen departed in the third over, but Hasan checked Qalandar’s building momentum.
 
 

On the first six balls he faced, Hasan got two fours and a massive six over long-on. Rilee Roussow, at the other end, was also dealing in boundaries; his first three scoring shots being two fours and a pull off Haris Rauf for six. The left-hander then found joy on the off side, getting two fours in the sixth over by Salman, and the Gladiators ending the powerplay at 57-2. Rossouw, however, fell soon after, with Raza striking as the South African found Shaheen at short cover.
Losing his partner didn’t stop Hasan, though. Rishad Hossain was belted for two fours off the first three balls of the eighth over. Raza was then deposited for six in the next over before Hasan took Rishad to the cleaners in the 10th with 6, 4, 4 off the first three balls to raise his 50 off just 21 balls as Gladiators got to 100-3 at the midway point of their innings.
Avishka Fernando (29) hit five fours before becoming Rishad’s first victim, but Hasan — seemingly struggling with an injury — kept going on, using brute force to dispatch Raza over his head for six more and he got lucky when he was spilled by Fakhar Zaman two overs later.
Dinesh Chandimal chipped in with 22, hitting two sixes, before holing Shaheen to substitute Mohammad Azab on the second ball of the 18th over with Hasan’s 43-ball knock ending four deliveries later when he found Raza at wide long-on.
Haris returned to dismiss Amir and Abrar Ahmed as Gladiators seemed to crumble late on, but Faheem Ashraf (28 not out) pulled and flicked Salman for three sixes in the final over to take his side to 201-9.
 
 

Mohammad Naeem (46) got Qalandars off to a flier in their chase, bludgeoning Faheem for two sixes, but just when he was threatening to take it away from the Gladiators single-handedly, he saw his partner Fakhar trapped lbw by Abrar.
Naeem survived after Usman Tariq dropped a sitter and with Abdullah Shafique crunching a glorious late cut for four off Abrar, Qalandars reached 56-1 by the end of the powerplay. Naeem hit six sixes in his 27-ball innings, which ended when Faheem had him caught at deep square, bringing Perera to the crease.
Abdullah made 41 off 28 with four fours and a six, but after he top-edged Usman to be caught in the 13th over, the Gladiators seemed to have reined in the Qalandars, who needed 71 off the last five overs. Rajapaksa never got going, but his dismissal only paved the way for Qalandars’ stunning late charge.

ISLAMABAD: In the first leg of his four-country tour, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday arrived in Turkiye, where he met President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to not only thank Ankara for its support during recent tensions with India but also cement bilateral economic cooperation.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” said an official press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on Sunday.
In his meeting with President Erdogan, the PM advocated joint ventures and enhanced bilateral investment, highlighting key sectors, including renewable energy, information technology, defence production, infrastructure development, and agriculture as potential areas of mutual interest.
The two leaders also conducted a comprehensive review of the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reiterated their resolve to elevate the strategic partnership. They also followed up on the implementation of key decisions taken during the 7th session of the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC), held in Islamabad on Feb 13 this year. Both sides agreed to take steps to achieve the $5 billion annual bilateral trade target agreed earlier by the two leaders.
 
 

In addition to bilateral issues, Prime Minister Shehbaz and President Erdogan discussed pressing regional and international developments. They also expressed concern over the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, urgently calling for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to the affected Palestinian population.
PM Shehbaz, who was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, expressed heartfelt gratitude to the government and people of Turkiye for their unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent developments in South Asia. He lauded Turkiye’s principled stance and the outpouring support of goodwill of the Turkish people for Pakistan and termed it as a source of great comfort and strength for Pakistan.
 






The premier highlighted the commitment, courage and the spirit of sacrifice of the armed forces of Pakistan and the resolute patriotism that was demonstrated in an unprecedented manner, which contributed to Pakistan’s victory in Marak-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.
According to state-run PTV News, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minis­ter Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi also participated in the meeting.
Moreover, both leaders also presided over a delegation-level meeting between the two sides.
Earlier, on his arrival at the airport, the PM was received by Defence Minister Yashar Guler, Istanbul Deputy Governor Erdogan Turan Ermis, Pakistan’s ambassador in Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, and other diplomats.
After the two-day Turkiye visit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan during this week.
During the visits, he is expected to hold “wide-ranging discussions” with the nations while acknowledging their support during Pakistan’s recent escalation with India.
According to Dawn.com, in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Confe­rence on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dus­hanbe, on May 29 and 30.
 
 

The visit comes a fortnight after Pakistan and India reached a US-brokered ceasefire following a brief military confrontation. During the conflict, the Iranian foreign minister visited both nations to act as a mediator. According to the FO’s statement, the PM will have “wide-ranging discussions” with the leaders of the four countries on issues including bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance.
Pakistan, Uzbekistan ties
Earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Mini­ster Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Saidov Bakhtiyor Odilovich discussed bilateral relations and the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project in a phone call on Sunday, the Foreign Office said in a press release.
During the conversation, the two leaders expressed optimism about the early finalisation of the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project.
The ministers also exchanged views on the regional situation, according to the statement.

The Resettlement Programme in Pakistan has been active since the 1980s and more than 20,000 vulnerable refugees have now departed for resettlement to third countries to find safety and rebuild their lives, UNHCR says in its latest resettlement factsheet on Pakistan Operation.
In 2021, following the changed situation in Afghanistan, there was a renewed interest by the international community in the resettlement of Afghan refugees, leading to an increase in resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.
 
 

The US topped the list of nine countries that accepted Afghan refugees for resettlement. The US accepted 10,823 Afghan refugees, followed by Australia (4,362), Canada (2,253), the United Kingdom (954), New Zealand (817), Norway (248), Sweden (182), Finland (116), and Italy (72).

Over 300,000 Afghans returned, deported by Pakistan, Iran in a month, says IFRC

Since 2021, several diplomatic missions in Pakistan established their own “Safe Passage” programmes to facilitate the evacuation and relocation of Afghan nationals affiliated with their foreign missions in Afgha­nistan, they are outside the framework of UNHCR’s Resettle­ment Programme, the agency clarified.
“Resettlement is unique in that it is the only durable solution that involves the relocation of refugees from an asylum country to a third country,” the UNHCR said. Those prioritised include survivors of violence, vulnerable women and girls, at-risk children, and individuals with serious medical conditions.
Worsening crisis
Meanwhile, the International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC) warned that Afghanistan’s humanitarian crisis — marked by extreme poverty, food insecurity, and a strained health system — is worsening due to a mass influx of returnees, largely triggered by Pakistan’s Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“This influx of Afghan nationals has put further strain on an already fragile infrastructure, complicating efforts to provide essential services to those in need,” the IFRC said.
 
 

Last month, the IFRC launched a Federation-wide Emergency Appeal in response to escalating humanitarian needs, seeking 25 million Swiss francs to scale up multi-sectoral immediate and longer-term assistance.
In April, over 144,500 people returned from Pakistan, with more than 29,900 deported. “During the month of April, between 4,000 and 6,000 people were arriving in Afgha­nistan each day,” the IFRC reported.
The influx of returnees, amidst persistent drought, pre-existing internal displacements, and deteriorating economic conditions, is placing immense pressure on already overstretched services.
Adding to the pressure, returns from Iran are also increasing due to policy shifts hindering access to legal protection. Between March 20 and April 30, 170,200 Afghans arrived from Iran. The combined returns from Pakistan and Iran, exceeding 300,000 in April alone, are placing “extreme pressure” on Afghanistan’s border regions and urban areas ill-equipped for such large movements, the IFRC concluded.
