Rameen first bagged two wickets for 17 runs and then made an unbeaten 12-ball 21 featuring two fours and one six in the last over, after walking in to bat at 88-5, to help Challengers register first win in the tournament as they chased the 118-run target in 19.2 overs.

The Indian Premier League match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals was abandoned midway due to floodlights at Dharamsala’s HPCA stadium malfunctioning, India’s cricket board said.
Punjab were batting at 122-1 against Delhi when the match was called off with only one floodlight functioning. Only 10.1 overs of the first innings were bowled after Punjab chose to bat first.
“The Punjab Kings v Delhi Capitals match (Match#58) in Tata IPL was forced to be abandoned due to a significant technical failure at the HPCA stadium in Dharamsala,” the Board of Cricket Control in India said in a statement. “Due to a power outage in the area, one of the light towers at the HPCA stadium malfunctioned. BCCI regrets the inconvenience caused to the in-stadium attendees.”
Sunday’s match between Punjab and Mumbai Indians at the same venue had already been moved from Dharamshala to Ahmedabad earlier on Thursday, amid fears of an escalation in the conflict with Pakistan.

BCCI claims abandonment due to floodlight failure

Dharamsala, home to the Dalai Lama and headquarters of the Tibetan exile government, is less than 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the town of Jammu, where explosions were reported hours earlier.
It was not immediately clear if the power outage was linked to the wider blackouts enforced in several areas in northern India on Thursday evening, as New Delhi accused Pakistan of targeting military stations with drones and missiles.
Dharamshala is one of the major airports in the region which was impacted with airlines cancelling flights and the BCCI said the venue for Sunday’s match was changed due to logistical reasons.
Sunday’s match will now be played in the city of Ahmedabad in the western state of Gujarat, the state’s cricket association secretary Anil Patel told the Press Trust of India news agency on Thursday.
India struck multiple locations in Pakistan this week after the April 22 attack targeting Hindu tourists in Indian-held Kashmir that New Delhi has blamed on its neighbour.
Pakistan, which denies any link to the violence, said on Thursday it shot down 25 drones from India overnight.
The arch-rivals have since exchanged fire across their contested border in Kashmir. The violence has raised fears of a wider conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
With the airport shut down, there was no way for Mumbai to reach Dharamsala. There was another logistical challenge awaiting the Punjab and Delhi squads, as well as broadcast crews, to travel from Dharamsala to their next respective venues.
Both teams will take a 10-hour road journey to New Delhi after the game. Delhi play Gujarat Titans at home next, and Punjab fly from Delhi to Ahmedabad for their next game against the Mumbai,
“With the airport in Dharamsala closed, it would have been a huge logistical challenge for everyone involved,” BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told Reuters by phone. “Purely due to logistical reasons, we’ve decided to move the match to Ahmedabad.”
The IPL is the world’s richest Twenty20 tournament with celebrity owners and teams offering mouth-watering contracts to attract cricket’s best talents.
Despite the prevailing volatility, Saikia said the foreign players in the 10-team league had no apprehensions about continuing their participation. “They are quite comfortable. Everyone in the league is comfortable,” Saikia said. “The safety and security of every player — be it a local player or a foreigner — every match official and every fan is important for us. We have the clearance of every single authority.”
Bilateral cricket remains suspended between India and Pakistan, who play each other only in multi-team events and mostly at neutral venues. Pakistan players are not allowed in the IPL.
Earlier on Thursday, a PSL match in Rawalpindi was postponed hours before its scheduled start following a drone strike by India close to the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.
More PSL matches were likely to be rescheduled, the Pakistan Cricket Board said in a statement. British media reports said some of the seven English cricketers playing in the PSL were considering whether to return home as hostilities escalate.

In a press briefing on Thursday, Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said the US was aware of Pakistan’s offer for a neutral investigation into the attack.
“Pakistan wants an independent investigation … and [the US] want the perpetrators to be held accountable, and we are supportive of any efforts to that end,” she added.
When asked if the two neighbours have offered any commitments,
Ms Bruce said Secretary Rubio had been clear on two things: “that this should not escalate” and “communication was fundamentally key”.
When the spokesperson was asked if the US shared India’s view that Pakistan was supporting terrorist groups, she refrained from affirming the accusation.
She said the Pahalgam attack was “awful”, but the “back and forth and continuation” of attacks should stop.
Ms Bruce added that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan over the past few weeks were “not surprising but very, very disappointing”.
She said both sides should remain engaged in conversation and the US would remain involved in this process.
Mr Rubio also spoke with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. They discussed regional security matters, economic engagement, and efforts to de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan, Ms Bruce added.
She acknowledged the situation was “very delicate and dangerous” and said any discussion about ongoing negotiations shouldn’t be made public.
“That’s certainly our policy. We think it’s important to not put details in the midst of the worldwide media when the work is being done in private between leaders.”
When asked whether India provided the US with any intelligence to back up its claims against Pakistan, Ms Bruce refused to give details.
“We, though, will not engage in the nature of discussing what the conversations have been or what we have conveyed,” she added.
She urged both India and Pakistan to “work towards a responsible solution”.
US consulate advisory
The US Consulate General in Lahore has directed its staff to shelter in place after Indian drones were shot down in the city. The consulate said it has also received initial reports that authorities may be eva­cuating some areas adjacent to Lah­ore’s main airport, a statement said.

On the other hand, the PR has also spared purpose-built rolling stock that is likely to be used by the armed forces in the current situation.
“We are in coordination with them (the armed forces) for providing them with transportation-related services whenever they need and a purpose-built rolling stock (wagons, coaches, locomotives etc) has been allocated for them,” PR Chief Executive Officer Amir Ali Baloch said while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
“When they ask us to move the stock, we will do it within no time. We are ready and stand by our forces,” he added.
According to Mr Baloch, the PR’s passenger and freight trains’ operations are underway as usual as the PR is facing no issue yet. However, the trains’ operations, railway stations etc have been put on high alert. Moreover, there is no plan to curtail the operations as the department cannot do this in a situation of air-space closure for certain periods and suspension of planes’ operations from time to time. “We want to facilitate and accommodate in our trains all those passengers who used to travel by air,” he added. To a question, Mr Baloch said the security at major stations and trains had also been enhanced.

PR operations put on high alert across the country

Meanwhile, the Lahore city district administration has put all offices of administrations, hospitals, Rescue 1122 and others on high-alert, keeping in view the attacks from India.
According to Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza, a central control room had also been established at the DC office for surveillance and safety of the citizens.
The administration officers, staff led by the ADC (Finance and Planning) Mudassir Nawaz also took out a rally to pay tributes to armed forces for prompt and befitting response to India.
TRANSFER: Muhammad Nasir Khalily, a BPS-20 officer of the PR’s mechanical engineering department, has been transferred with placement of his services at the disposal of Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) on a deputation basis for a period of three years for his posting as director general of the programme, according to a notification issued by the Establishment Division.
Five BPS-18 officers of the PR’s civil engineering department, namely Muhammad Imran Saeed, Muhammad Sohail Javed, Mehtab Ahmad, Mujib Ur Rehman Khuhro and Riaz Mahmood Lashari, have been transferred to Karachi, Peshawar, Sukkur, Quetta and Lahore as divisional engineers, according to a notification.

The court highlighted serious gaps in the oversight of these products, which are widely consumed by infants and young children across Pakistan.  
The case was initiated on a petition expressing concerns over substandard and unregistered baby food products allegedly causing serious health issues among infants.
Drug Court Chairman Muhammad Naveed Rana noted that despite the presence of laws such as the Drugs Act 1940, Drugs Act 1976, and the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) Act 2012, there is no clear mechanism for testing or regulating these products.  
The chairman expressed regret that no Drug Testing Laboratory (DTL) in Pakistan is currently equipped to analyse the quality of baby milk and related products, leaving manufacturers largely unchecked.  

Judge regrets no lab in the country is equipped to analyse quality of baby milk

He observed that many baby food items contain over 40 ingredients — including vitamins and minerals — yet there is no system to verify whether manufacturers’ claims about their contents are accurate.
“There is no clearly designated authority to monitor the sale of these products,” the judge noted. 
“It is alarming that, despite the presence of the aforementioned laws, not a single case has been filed against any company or individual for manufacturing or selling substandard or unregistered baby milk, baby food, infant formula, or related products.”
Substandard products, the judgment warned, have been linked to malnutrition, weakened immunity, developmental delays, digestive disorders, and contamination — all posing serious risks to infant health.
The judge pointed out that Drap has enlisted 291 baby food products under the Alternative Medicines and Health Products (Enlistment) Rules, 2014. However, no legal action has been taken against substandard products since Drap’s inception in 2012. Citing a medical report, the judge noted that poor-quality formula milk has been seriously harming infants’ health. He raised concern that thousands of newborns in Pakistan — often fed such products on doctors’ recommendations — are suffering due to unchecked quality standards.
Judge Naveed Rana emphasised that under the 18th Amendment, provinces have the authority to legislate independently for the welfare of their populations, and must act accordingly.
He directed the Drap, the director general of Drugs Control Punjab, and the secretary of the Provincial Quality Control Board to draft legislation and establish testing and regulatory mechanisms for baby food products. The court gave the authorities three months to submit progress reports, with the next hearing scheduled for June 16.
The judgment underscored the urgency of safeguarding the health of infants — described as the future of the nation — and called on both federal and provincial health and law ministries to take immediate action.
Copies of the order have also been sent to the federal health minister, federal law minister, Punjab chief minister, and other relevant officials.
The judgment was co-signed by technical members of the Drug Court, Dr. Tanvir Ahmad Usmani and Muhammad Irfan Munir.
The petition was filed by Mujahid Abbas, who argued that formula milk products must be enlisted and regulated under existing drug laws. He contended that substandard formula milk is causing various illnesses among infants and pointed out the absence of any laboratory in Pakistan capable of checking these products’ quality.
The petitioner also questioned the exorbitant prices being charged by companies for these essential products.

Heading the five-judge CB, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned whether the authority to determine the seniority of superior court judges should lie with the President or the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP).
He also recalled how, under civil service procedures, when officers were transferred from the surplus pool to a different department, their seniority started from the bottom in the new department. He wondered whether there was any rule or convention for finalising the seniority of judges or whether it should be compared with civil service rules.
The bench was hearing a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.

Justice Mazhar questions who should determine seniority — president or CJP?

Senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, representing the petitioners, argued that the consultation process for transfer of the three judges to the IHC was neither purposive, meaningful, nor consensus-oriented on all relevant aspects. Consequently, he said, the transfers should be struck down.
During the hearing, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan recalled earlier transfers to the IHC, noting that one such transferred judge was even appointed as chief justice of the IHC. He also asked the counsel whether the judges in those instances had taken a fresh oath upon transfer.
The counsel replied that these transfers occurred after the IHC was re-established under the 18th Amendment, following its abolition by the 2009 SC judgement and subsequent re-establishment through the Islamabad High Court Act, 2010.
The counsel contended that, during the consultation process, the consultees — namely the CJP and the chief justices of the high courts concerned — were not presented with any information or data explaining why Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar was selected or shortlisted for transfer to the IHC out of a pool of 33 Lahore High Court judges, particularly when he was ranked 16th in seniority.
“You are suggesting as if there was no evidence that any option was afforded to other judges of the LHC to opt for transfer to the IHC,” remarked Justice Salahuddin Panhwar.
The counsel said Justice Dogar’s appo­intment was not random but premeditated, intended to place him ahead of the senior puisne judge of the IHC in seniority.
“You seem more aggrieved by the transfer of Justice Sarfraz Dogar,” Justice Panhwar observed.
When Justice Mazhar noted that one of the summaries had mentioned that the transferred judges would retain their seniority in the high court to which they were transferred, the counsel clarified that this communication was directed to the prime minister, not the CJP.
The counsel argued that following recent developments in the rules governing the appointment of judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the top five judges of a high court now have a legitimate expectancy to become the chief justice. If a seventh-ranked judge is elevated over them, a writ of quo warranto may be filed in the Supreme Court to challenge the appointment.
He contended that the consultees never discussed critical issues such as emoluments or the selection procedure. He cited the example of Justice Muhammad Asif of the Balochistan High Court, who was serving as an additional judge at the time of his transfer. In his case, consent for the transfer was taken from the acting chief justice (ACJ).
When the counsel cited the Al-Jihad Trust case — in which it was held that an ACJ can only perform routine tasks for a limited period and cannot recommend a judge for elevation — Justice Mazhar noted that it made sense, as, at the time, consultations were carried out between the CJP and the President in the absence of the JCP. Now, however, the JCP exists, and every member has an equal vote.
The issue of seniority is critical, the counsel emphasised, because it is not merely about personal satisfaction. He pointed out that there is no law currently in place to fix the seniority of judges.
The hearing was adjourned to Wednesday (May 14).

BBC terms video showing wreckage of French-made jet in Bathinda ‘authentic’

Earlier, on Wednesday, a high-ranking French intelligence official had told CNN that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Reuters cited two US officials as saying that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to shoot down at least two Indian jets on Wednesday.
One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was high confidence that Pakistan launched air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets using the Chinese-made aircraft.
Another official said at least one Indian jet shot down by Pakistan was Rafale.
BBC has also confirmed that a Rafale aircraft fell in Indian territory.
BBC Verify said it had authenticated three videos purportedly showing the wreckage of a Rafale fighter jet in a field in Bathinda.
One of the clips geo-located by BBC Verify to a field near Bathinda in Indian Punjab showed troops collecting debris from the crashed jet.
“We have also located two further clips from the same location filmed at night. One shows debris in the field, while another shows a projectile catching fire in the sky, and then fire in an open field,” the British broadcaster added.
Justin Crump, a former British Army officer, confirmed to BBC Verify the wreckage visible in the video appeared to be of a French air-to-air missile used on both Mirage 2000 and Rafale fighter jets.

• Red Cross says aid blockade to Gaza ‘unacceptable’
• Military strikes across the enclave kill 105 people
CAIRO: Dozens of community kitchens in Gaza shut their doors on Thursday due to a lack of supplies, closing off a lifeline used by hundreds of thousands of people in a further blow to efforts to combat growing hunger in the enclave.
The move followed hours after the US-based World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity announced that it had run out of the ingredients necessary to provide much-needed free meals and had been prevented by Israel from bringing in aid.
Amjad al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organisations Network (PNGO) in Gaza, told Reuters that most of the enclave’s 170 community kitchens had shut down after running out of stock due to Israel’s continued blockade on Gaza.
Shawa said the decision by the WCK, announced late on Wednesday, and the closure of community kitchens on Thursday would cause a drop of between 400,000 to 500,000 free meals per day for the 2.3 million population.
“The remaining kitchens will be closing soon. The hunger catastrophe is beyond words. People are losing their lone source of food,” Shawa added.
Those Gazans trying to cook independently meanwhile complain that flour still available on the market is contaminated.
Israel has faced growing international pressure to lift an aid blockade that it imposed in March after the collapse of a US-backed ceasefire that had halted fighting for two months.
Two weeks ago most of the population relied on one and a half meals per day, but in the past few days that has dropped to one meal a day, and even that will lack meat, vegetables or the necessary healthy components, said Shawa.
‘Unacceptable’
The Red Cross denounced the human cost of the war raging in Gaza, slamming Israel’s “unacceptable” full blockade on aid into the besieged and conflict-ravaged Palestinian territory.
Aid agencies have repeatedly warned of a growing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which they say has been exacerbated by an Israeli blockade on all aid since early March.
“It is unacceptable that humanitarian aid is not allowed into the Gaza Strip,” Pierre Krahenbuhl, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told reporters in Geneva.
“That’s just fundamentally against anything that international humanitarian law provides.” The situation in Gaza is on a “razor’s edge” and “the next few days are absolutely decisive”, he added.
“There’s a moment where we will also run out of anything that’s left in terms of medical supplies and other” aid, he said.
“Right now, the most effective way to get aid to people is to lift…actions or decisions that were taken to prevent aid from reaching” inside Gaza, Krahenbuhl said. “There are huge quantities of aid that are on the borders of Gaza that can go in tomorrow,” he insisted.
On Thursday, the Gaza health ministry said Israeli military strikes across the enclave killed at least 105 people in the past 24 hours, in one of the biggest death tolls in a single day in two months. More than 52,700 people have been killed by Israel since Oct 2023.

Amongst the most notable examples of what this means in practice are the public statements issued by India’s two major left-wing parties, the Communist Party of India (CPI), and the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), following India’s strikes inside Pakistan on May 7.
Both parties have aped the Modi regime’s narrative about Pakistan harbouring ‘terrorists’ and the righteousness of targeting the ‘infrastructure’ (read: civilians) responsible for the Pahalgam attacks of April 22. The statements are uncritical of Indian state policy and only cursorily mention the need for diplomatic solutions to avert war.
Other Indian opposition parties, including the Congress, have expressed similar positions. But the parliamentary communist parties, with a long history of challenging state nationalism whilst also being principally anti-war, appear to be entering unchartered territory.
Bear in mind that the CPI and CPI-M have both remained largely critical of the Indian government’s support for Zionist war crimes against Palestinians since October 2023. They have repeatedly demanded that India re-adopt its historical policy of support for Palestinian self-determination, refusing to be drawn into the dominant discourse of dehistoricising Palestinian militancy and engaging in blanket condemnation of Hamas as a ‘terrorist’ organisation.
The CPI and CPI-M are threatening their very own political creed.
Even if India’s otherwise robust left has been less willing to challenge the Indian state with regards to the question of Kashmiri self-determination, it has at various points acknowledged the organic roots of militancy in held Kashmir rather than just pawn off all responsibility to the proverbial ‘foreign hand’. But by taking the positions they have vis-à-vis burgeoning conflict with Pakistan, the CPI and CPI-M are threatening their very own political creed.
 
 

This is no small matter, especially when looked at from the perspective of the much smaller and embattled Pakistani left. To oppose state militarism in this country can be a perilous endeavour, as evidenced by the repression faced by progressive forces. But despite the propaganda in official and online media, left-progressives have not retreated from their principled positions.
It is not just in India that it is becoming more difficult for what can broadly be called the anti-war left to survive, let alone thrive. Hindutva is not the only extreme ideology to have taken hold through ‘democratic’ institutions. We all live in political environments dominated by an increasingly xenophobic right wing, undergirded by entrenched military-industrial-media establishments. But this is exactly why surrendering to majoritarian sentiment is anathema for anyone committed to a long-term horizon of justice, egalitarianism and lasting peace.
The CPI-M ought to have learned from its own historic defeat in what was once its bastion of West Bengal in 2011. Having ruled one of India’s largest states for over three decades, its downfall was triggered by a symbolic decision in 2007 to dispossess thousands of peasants in Nandigram so as to set up a special export zone. The peasantry was the bedrock of CPI-M’s politics, but by acquiescing to the then dominant logics of neoliberal globalisation, the party turned its back on its social base, and signed its own death warrant.
In the intervening two decades, the CPI-M has been unable to recover lost ground in West Bengal, though re­­-taining governmental po­­wer in Kerala. The soc­i­a­list left in Pak­is­tan is not curr­e­ntly equip-ped to take state power, so parliamentary communism in India still represents an inspiration of sorts. But by unequivocally supporting the Modi regime in its warmongering, both the CPI-M and CPI have greatly reduced their lustre.
At the time of writing, India has further escalated tensions by flying drones into major Pakistani cities, triggering panic and creating further space for hawkish elements in the Pakistani political and intellectual mainstream. The drones are reportedly imported from Israel, a symbol of the growing synergy between Zionism and Hindutva. Surely it is this nexus that Indian progressives should be seeking to challenge.
At the very least, those on the left in the subcontinent and beyond must stop uncritically deploying the language of ‘terrorism’ at the behest of the state, thereby trampling upon the real histories of structural oppression which explain so many conflicts in our region and world. In the fog of war hysteria and disinformation, this much clarity is a must.

The strikes, carried out with Israeli-made Harop drones as part of ‘Operation Sindoor’, seemed to be an effort by New Delhi to assert its dominance —responding swiftly and forcefully after the devastating loss of five fighter jets, including its prized Rafales.
Pakistan said it had neutralised 29 of the drones using electronic jamming and ground fire.
While the Pakistani military scored a tactical win by downing fighter jets, India’s attacks on Pakistan’s mainland, both the May 7 missile strikes and the drone swarm soon afterwards shows it wants to dictate the terms of conflict.
“India wants to demonstrate escalation dominance, signalling to Pakistan that it believes it can dominate and control any further rounds of escalation,” Shashank Joshi, defence editor of The Economist, told Dawn.

The Harop is classified as ‘loitering munition’,  a hybrid between a drone and a missile

The most telling aspect of this drone operation was India’s focus on ‘Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD)’ — in military terms, a mission traditionally reserved for full-scale war.
 
 

One of the drones, according to ISPR spokesman Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, “partially succeeded” in striking a military target near Lahore, injuring four soldiers.
By targeting cantonments and defence assets, India seeks to diminish Pakistan’s deterrence. It can also be trying to bait Islamabad into revealing its defensive playbook by exposing its air defence grid.
“Both sides are trying to map each others’ air defence systems, India more so than Pakistan. After air combat between two sides the other day, the contest is now in domain of air defences with both sides attempting to gain an operational advantage,” Muhammad Faisal, South Asia security researcher at the University of Technology Sydney said.
What are Harop drones?
The Harop drones, developed by Israel Aerospace Industries, are not traditional unmanned armed vehicles (UAVs), but loitering munitions—a hybrid between a drone and a missile.
Designed for SEAD operations, Harops autonomously seek out and destroy targets that emit a radar signature, delivering high-explosive payloads with precision. Their ability to approach from unpredictable angles makes them particularly lethal in contested airspace.
The drone can operate both fully autonomously or be manually operated in its human-in-the-loop mode. If a target is not engaged, the drone can return and land itself back at base. Harop, with its folding wings, can be launched from a truck- or ship-mounted canister, or configured for air-launch.
Mr Joshi noted that the choice of targets by India revealed an intent to escalate. “The decision to send drones over Lahore and Karachi, and the decision to target … explicitly military targets, represents a significant step up in the Indian campaign,” he maintained.
India justified the drone attacks by asserting that Pakistani missiles had targeted military facilities in 15 Indian cities the previous night—a claim New Delhi has yet to substantiate with evidence.
This rationale appears more as a cover than a factual claim, much like the absence of justification for the May 7 airstrikes.
Under the International Humanitarian Law, targeting civilian sites, as India did in Pakistan, is a grave violation.
Changing calculus
The use of Harops also marks a departure from India’s traditional reliance on conventional aerial strikes and a movement toward asymmetrical, tech-driven warfare.
In recent history, India has steered clear of targeting mainland Pakistan, relying instead on border skirmishes or air raids. That calculus seems to have changed now.
India’s choice to strike deep into Pakistan means that the prospect of a retaliation is no longer hypothetical; it’s a virtual certainty. The tit-for-tat exchanges are widening the conflict’s scope, with a trajectory that risks spiraling out of control.
Despite the aggravation of tensions, there is still hope. Direct communication lines like the DGMO hotline and communication between national security advisers is continuing, presenting a narrow diplomatic window. That said, the path toward de-escalation appears increasingly fraught.
While the United States has historically played a de-escalatory role in India-Pakistan crises, its response so far has been markedly subdued.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s call with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday, following his earlier outreach to both countries’ National Security Advisers, signalled continued diplomatic engagement — but not urgency.
“[The] US approach towards this conflict leaves space open for escalation as both sides interpret it as space for operational action,” Faisal argued.

The market capital had lost Rs1.3 trillion in value in three sessions as jittery investors preferred to exit the market amid growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as geopolitical tensions turned into a military standoff after India hit three cities with missiles in the wee hours of Wednesday, martyring over 31 innocent civilians. Pakistan’s armed forces responded with the downing of five Indian fighter planes.
Meanwhile, Indian shares fell on Thursday in their most volatile session this month. The Nifty 50 settled 0.58pc lower at 24,273.8 and the BSE Sensex fell 0.51pc to 80,334.81 after struggling for direction in early trade.
Topline Securities Ltd said the PSX faced an unprecedented meltdown on Thursday as the benchmark KSE-100 index plunged by 6,482.21 points, closing at 103,527.82 — marking the largest single-day decline in the index’s history in absolute terms.

Indian shares fall in most volatile session this month

Investor sentiment remained deeply shaken throughout the session, which saw extreme volatility. The KSE-100 recorded its highest-ever intraday movement of 10,282 points, swinging from an intraday high of 1,872 points to an intraday low of 8,410 points.
The market crash followed alarming geopolitical developments after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry announced that Pakistani forces had neutralised 25 drones sent by India since last night. He also confirmed that four army personnel were injured after one drone managed to partially strike a military target, despite the majority being intercepted.
The statement sent shockwaves through financial markets, triggering widespread panic selling amid fears of escalating cross-border hostilities. Investors rushed to offload positions, leading to a broad-based decline across sectors.
Amid the sharp sell-off, trading was temporarily halted for one hour after the KSE-30 index dropped more than 5pc for five consecutive minutes, activating the market’s circuit breaker mechanism.
The largest drag on the benchmark index came from Fauji Fertiliser,  Mari Energies, United Bank, OGDC, and Pakistan Petroleum, which eroded 2,051 points from the benchmark index.
Ali Najib, Head of Sales at Insight Securities, said PSX commenced the session on a positive note as the index gained 1,872 points or 1.70pc. However, media reports about drone attacks dampened investors’ confidence regarding the current escalation is fizzling out.
Selling pressure diminished the previously strong momentum after ISPR’s con­­firmation. Conse­quen­tly, PSX went through with its historic bloodbath, and at 12:34 pm, trading was halted for an hour.
However, there was no sigh of relief after trading resumed at 13:34 pm as the benchmark index continued to receive selling pressure.
The market participation was strong as the trading volume rose 18.81pc to 653.55 million shares, and the traded value rose 17.65pc to Rs35.43 billion day-on-day. Ahsan Meha­n­­ti of Arif Habib Corpora­tion said stocks witnessed the largest decline amid security unrest, adding that the weak rupee, economic uncertainty, and falling Pakistan’s dollar bonds played a catalyst role in the record bearish close at PSX.

Pope Leo appeared on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica after white smoke had billowed from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signifying the 133 cardinal electors had chosen a new leader for the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church.
“Peace be with you all,” he told the cheering crowd, speaking in fluent Italian. He also spoke in Spanish during his brief address, but did not say anything in English.
Prevost, 69 and originally from Chicago, has spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and has dual Peruvian nationality. He became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given few media interviews and rarely speaks in public.
President Donald Trump swiftly congratulated Prevost on becoming the first US pope. “What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”  Prevost beco­mes the 267th Catholic pope after the death last month of Pope Francis, who was the first Latin American pontiff and had led the Church for 12 years.
Francis had widely sought to open the staid institution up to the modern world, enacting a range of reforms and allowing debate on divisive issues such as women’s inclusion of LGBT Catholics.
Leo thanked Francis in his speech and repeated his predecessor’s call for a church that is engaged with the modern world and “is always looking for peace, charity and being close to people, especially those who are suffering”.
He had not been seen as a frontrunner and there was a brief moment of silence when his name was announced to the packed St Peter’s Square, before people started to clap and cheer.
“I’m just thrilled. I hope this can bring to America a more loving community. I think there’s a lot of hate in America. I think there’s a lot of racism. I have experienced it,” said Lailah Brown, 28, from Seattle, Washington, an African American.
“I hope America does not embarrass the pope,” he said.
Ahead of the conclave, some cardinals called for continuity with Francis’s vision of greater openness and reform, while others said they wanted to turn back the clock and embrace old traditions.
Unlike Francis, who spurned much of the trappings of the papacy from the day he was elected in 2013, Prevost wore a traditional red papal garment over his white cassock.
A crowd of clergy and staff members at Chicago’s Catholic Theological Union erupted in a joyful cheer as Pope Leo walked out onto the Vatican balcony, some four decades after he graduated from the South Side school.
It was an “explosion of excitement and cheers that went up in the room … many of us were just simply incredulous and just couldn’t even find words to express our delight, our pride,” said Sister Barbara Reid, president of the theology school.
Pope Leo graduated from the school in 1982 with a master’s degree. Reid called Leo intellectually brilliant, saying he has an extraordinarily compassionate heart.
“It’s an unusual blend that makes him a leader who can think critically, but listens to the cries of the poorest, and always has in mind those who are most needy,” she said.
The last pope to take the name Leo led the Church from 1878 to 1903. Leo XIII was known for his devoted focus on social justice issues, and is often credited with laying the foundation for modern Catholic social teaching.
Felicitations
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was among world leaders congratulating the new pope.
“May his pontificate contribute to strengthening dialogue and the defense of human rights in a world in need of hope and unity,” Sanchez said.
Prevost has attracted interest from his peers because of his quiet style and support for Francis, especially his commitment to social justice issues.
Prevost served as a bishop in Chiclayo, in northwestern Peru, from 2015 to 2023.
Francis brought him to Rome that year to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world’s bishops.
“Most of us thought a US cardinal would never become pope, but Prevost got strong support from cardinals from Latin America where he worked for 20 years,” said Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit commentator who has covered the Vatican for decades.
“He is multilingual and has a reputation as a listener,” said Reese.  “The Holy Spirit continues to surprise us.”

The show, however, will go on with the closing stages of this season’s PSL to be held in the United Arab Emirates.
“The PCB confirms that the remaining fixtures of the HBL PSL X have been shifted to the UAE,” the PCB said in a statement in the early hours of Friday morning. “The exact sche­dule of matches, outlining the dates and venues, will be shared in due course.”
Four matches of the league stage of the country’s glitzy T20 extravaganza are still to be held, which will decide which four teams advance to the playoffs.
That, after Thursday’s match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings, which was to be held at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, was called off hours before the scheduled start time.
Pakistan’s military on Thursday said it took down nearly two dozen Indian drones sent on this side of the border since the previous night. One of those drones crashed within the stadium’s complex, inflicting some damage.
The worsening situation saw the PCB, PSL and government officials gather for a meeting, which continued till late in the night with other venues, including Karachi and Dubai, coming into consideration for the remaining eight matches of the league.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that the board had decided to shift the remaining matches to the UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers could be saved from “the possible reckless targeting by India”.
He also stressed it was important for the board “to ensure the mental well-being of all players” participating in the tournament.
PCB spokesperson Amir Mir had told Dawn earlier on Thursday the security of the players, especially the foreigners is the most important for us. “There have been drones brought down in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi We will decide in due course what needs to be done.”
Carrying out the matches in Rawalpindi only also came under discussion, sources said.
Asked if postponing all the remaining matches for an indefinite period was an option, sources in PCB said that it was highly unlikely as foreign players due the national and international commitments of foreign players.
BBC Sport had reported that a postponement was being considered.
Earlier on Thursday, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Pakistan’s interior minister held a meeting with the PSL teams — except Multan Sultans, who are currently in their home city — in Islamabad and met foreign players.
Out of remaining eight matches — four were slated to be held in Rawalpindi, one in Multan and three in Lahore, including the final.
The cross border tensions also affected Thursday’s Indian Premier League match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in the Himalayan region of Dharamsala, which was called off midway due to a “floodlight malfunction” according to the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
The incident occurred hours after the BCCI had said that it had shifted the match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians — scheduled to be held on Sunday in Dharamsala – to Ahmedabad.
Cricket boards around the world were monitoring the situation across the two countries with several foreign-based players featuring in both the PSL and the IPL.
Bangladeshi media reported that The Bangladesh Cricket Board was working to bring home Nahid Rana and Rishad Hossain — participating in the PSL for Peshawar Zalmi and Lahore Qalandars respectively — “in a timely and secure manner”.
“The BCB is in active coordination with the PCB and the Bangladesh High Commission in Islamabad to ensure that all necessary measures are in place to guarantee the security of our players,” the board said in a statement.
BBC Sport reported that some English players participating in the PSL were considering leaving while others wanted to stay.
The Professional Cricketers’ Association (PCA) has been in regular contact with the 15-person contingent, it said.
Cricket West Indies (CWI) also said that it was in touch with their players in the PSL and IPL and has engaged West Indies Players’ Association (WIPA) “to coordinate and ensure the safety, security, and well-being of all West Indies players and support personnel in the region”.

On Thursday night, Indian news channels were flooded with reports claiming that India’s air defence systems had shot down Pakistani jets during alleged attacks on  multiple locations across Jammu in India-held Kashmir and Punjab in  India.
Although the claims were widely repeated, no evidence or footage was offered to substantiate them.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed the claims that India shot down Pakistani jets, including an F-16 and two JF-17 fighter jets. He termed the claim “absurd and false”.
“Fake and concocted stories will get you nowhere. Such false claims only reflect your desperation. Denied and rejected,” the minister said in a post on X.
 






Separately, speaking to Geo News, the information minister challenged the Indian government to provide proof of downing any PAF fighters or capturing a pilot.
“I am 100 per cent denying it. With fullest confidence at my command, I am denying it,” the information minister said.
 






Jammu attacks
Also on Thursday evening, Indian media claimed Pakistan had launched attacks using missiles and drones across Jammu in India-occupied Kashmir.
The Foreign Office immediately rubbished this claim as well.
 
 

“[Pakistan] categorically rejects the baseless and irresponsible allegations propagated by the Indian media, accusing Pakistan of launching attacks on Pathankot, Jaisalmer, and Srinagar. These claims are entirely unfounded, politically motivated, and part of a reckless propaganda campaign aimed at maligning Pakistan,” it said in a statement on Thursday night.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also contradicted the Indian misinformation.
“We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far,” Mr Asif told BBC in an interview. The minister added that when Pakistan does strike, everyone will know it. “We will not strike and then deny.”
He said Pakistan will not deny any actions it takes.
Earlier, Indian media reports claimed that explosions were heard in held Kashmir and there was a blackout in the region.
In a statement on X, the Indian military said there have been no losses reported and that the threat has been “neutralised”, without giving any proof.

ISLAMABAD: At least three people lost their lives and seven, including four soldiers, sustained injuries as Pakistan intercepted and destroyed as many as 25 Indian drones that had intruded into its airspace across the country, possibly to target military installations.
According to the military, the locations where these drones were neutralised included Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur, Umerkot and Karachi in Sindh.
Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s chief spokesperson, confirmed that one civilian lost their life while another sustained injuries in Miano.
Moreover, as per police, one person each was slain in Attock and Rawalpindi.
“One drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” said the army spokesperson. “Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.
The rest of the drones apparently missed their potential targets and caused damages in densely populated areas.
 
 

Three drones were shot down in Walton and Burki, near Lahore. Officials said two drones crashed in Walton, while another crashed in Burki soon after security forces intercepted them. According to a witness, they heard multiple explosions in the old Walton airport area, leading to widespread confusion among locals.
In Rawalpindi, one person — a resident of Lahore — lost his life and two were inj­ured after a drone crashed near the Pindi Cricket Stadium on the Murree Road.
A police officer said that the stadium’s food street was not fully open and there were not many people around ; otherwise, there could have been more casualties.
Another drone damaged a house after it crashed on its rooftop in the Westridge locality of the garrison city. However, no casualties were reported.
In Attock, a farmer was killed near Jabbi Kasran — a town in Fateh Jang tehsil — after an Indian drone was downed. The injured person was taken to hospital, but could not survive.
In Gujranwala, three drones were destroyed in different locations of the district. The locals found wreckage of the drones in the Tokrian village of Wahndo and Solakhanabad village on the outskirts of the city. Another drone was found in a field near Aimanabad’s Agu Bhandar village of Gujranwala.
In Gujrat, parts of an Indian drone were found in Peer Jhand village in the jurisdiction of the Dinga police station. According to eyewitnesses, some parts of the drone fell in the field while some crashed on a house, falling through its roof into a room on the ground floor. However, everyone remained safe.
In Bahawalpur, an Ind­ian drone was destroyed in the Cholistan desert. According to the announcement, the Indian drone hit the area of Chapoowala in the desert in the limits of tehsil Yazman.
In Karachi, two drones fell on the outskirts of the Malir district, partially damaging the roof of a house. The first drone fell on a house in the Sharafi Goth slum, said area police SHO Sadaruddin Mirani. It damaged the roof partially, but no one was hurt. He said the incident occu­rred at around 10:30am.
The officer said that the drone was two and a half feet long.
Soon after, another dr­­o­ne fell near the residential neighbourhood of Gulshan-i-Hadeed.
Malir SP Mansoor Gulzar Bozdar told Dawn the drone fell in a hilly area near Link Road. He said it did not cause any damage to life or property.
In Umerkot, an Indian drone also crashed near the village of Sufi Akbar, close to the Chhor cantonment. Fortunately, no casualties or injuries were reported.
‘Serious, serious provocation’
India also admitted that it targetted military installations.
A statement by India’s Press Information Bureau said army installations were targeted “at a number of locations across Pakistan”. However, the attacks mostly took place in areas heavily populated by civilians.
As he shared details about the operation that downed drones, Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the Pakistan Army used “their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully” to shoot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones.
Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said, “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”
“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” it added.
“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.
During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.
“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” Lt-Gen Chaudhry continued.
“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the ISPR chief added.
According to BBC News, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said the Indian government needs to transition from “cinema” into the “real world we live in” and called the strikes a “phantom defence”.

Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports were the most affected, as air traffic was halted for several hours amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India. How­ever, flight operations at the four airports later resumed on Thursday after temporary suspensions.
The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) initially said that flight operations at Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­nat­ional Airport would remain suspen­ded until midnight, but they resu­med earlier than scheduled. Flight operations at Islamabad, Lah­ore and Sialkot airports resumed by evening.
Earlier in the day, the PAA had temporarily suspended operations at Karachi, Lahore and Sialkot airports until Thursday noon, citing operational reasons. Islamabad International Airport also briefly suspended flights during the day.
Later, the PAA extended the closure at Lahore, Islamabad and Sialkot until 6pm before confirming their reopening.
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) confirmed that the country’s ongoing security situation severely disrupted air operations nationwide.
“In the interest of air safety, some routes have been restricted as a precaution, affecting several flights,” a PIA spokesperson said. “The temporary closure of air routes has been undertaken to protect the assets of domestic carriers and ensure passenger safety.”
The airline urged passengers to remain patient and cooperate with airline staff, adding that its call centre was actively contacting affected travellers.
For passengers of diverted flights, PIA said it had made arrangements for meals and accommodation. Passengers were advised to check flight status via the PIA website or helpline before heading to the airport.
Passengers stranded
Passengers said that they faced immense difficulties due to last-minute cancellations. “I was scheduled to fly to Washington via Doha in the early hours of Thursday from Lahore airport, but the airline rescheduled the flight for later that morning.
Ghazala Bibi, another traveller, said her flight to Dubai from Sialkot was cancelled at the last minute due to the airport’s suddenclosure.
Passengers arriving from abroad also faced immense difficulties due to diversions. Domestic air travellers encountered similar issues, with flight operations disrupted for a third consecutive day due to intermittent airport closures.
“Domestic flights have been badly affected over the past three days,” an official said.
The Haj flight operation, which began recently, has also been almost suspended amid the escalating situation between the two countries.
While a tour operator told Dawn that most international airlines had suspended flights to and from Pakistan until May 10, the PAA said it was continuously issuing revised notices to airmen or Notams to update the status of airport operations and the opening of airspace.

Maryam Nawaz condemned drone strikes in various places including Lahore. She paid tribute to the Pakistan Army for timely shooting down Indian drones. She appreciated timely response of the administration, police, rescue services and Pakistan Air Force. 
She directed the police, administration and other institutions to remain alert round the clock in Lahore, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, Attock, Bahawalpur and other cities. 
She directed the relevant stakeholders to provide best medical treatment facilities to the civilians and officers getting injured during drone attacks in different cities of Punjab.

“Thalassemia is not just a challenge for the individual patient but for the entire family,” he said in his message on the occasion of World Thalassemia Day and urged the public to donate blood to help save the lives of thalassemia patients, stressing the importance of raising awareness to prevent the disease.
“Protecting the younger generation from thalassemia is a top priority for the Sindh government,” he added.
The CM highlighted that modern medical facilities were being provided for the treatment of thalassemia throughout the province. According to the data from the Sindh Blood Transfusion Authority, 9,525 patients, the majority of whom are children, were registered across 26 centres in Sindh.
Mr Shah also mentioned that the Sindh government had established free diagnostic desks for thalassemia and hepatitis at two National Database and Registration Authority centres located in Korangi and Safoora. Additionally, efforts were underway to promote pre-marital screening to curb the spread of the disease, he added
The chief minister stressed that awareness campaigns are being conducted in educational institutions, media platforms, and community programmes. “More effective measures are needed to prevent thalassemia,” he said, suggesting that the introduction of a comprehensive screening programme could significantly reduce the prevalence of the disease.
He also underscored the essential roles of parents, teachers and religious leaders in addressing thalassemia and announced that public awareness campaigns would be further intensified across the province.

• Call for restoring NCC training in colleges to defend country                      
KARACHI: In a continued display of national solidarity for the second consecutive day on Thursday, Karachi became the focal point of flurry of activity as political parties, human rights organisations, labour unions and civil society groups came together to express unwavering support for Pakistan’s armed forces amid rising tensions with India. 
Marking a moment of unity across the political and social spectrum, rallies, seminars and public gatherings were held in Karachi and other major cities of Sindh, underscoring a collective resolve to stand behind the country’s defenders. 
The mobilisation, which cut across ideological and organisational lines, signalled a broader national consensus on safeguarding sovereignty and promoting peace through strength. 
In Karachi, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) staged a power show outside the Karachi Press Club. 
The rally drew hundreds of party supporters waving national flags and chanting slogans in support of the armed forces, transforming the city’s central press hub into a sea of patriotism and resolve. Addressing the crowd, senior MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar issued a stern message to New Delhi.
“Let it be clear to Narendra Modi and the Indian establishment that the people of Pakistan are united, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with our soldiers. Any aggression will be met with the full strength of our unity,” he said. 
Senator Faisal Subzwari echoed the same sentiment, stating that the MQM-P joined the entire nation in honouring the sacrifices of armed forces. It is not just the duty of the military to defend the country; it is a collective responsibility that the nation proudly shares, he added.
Nasreen Jalil also took the stage, emphasising the role of civilians in reinforcing national resolve. “This gathering is a proof that Karachi stands with the armed forces and we will not be intimidated by external threats,” she said. 
The Sindh Madressatul Islam University, the alma-mater of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, organised a walk to show solidarity with Pakistan’s armed forces and against Indian aggression. 
A statement issued by the university said that the walk started from the main building of the university and ended at its IT Tower. The walk was led by Acting Vice Chancellor of SMIU Prof Dr Zahid Ali Channar, Dean Dr Aftab Ahmed Shaikh, Advisor to the Vice Chancellor on Academics Dr Abdul Hafeez Khan, Director Students Affairs Muhammad Naeem Ahmed and Registrar Ghulam Mustafa Shaikh among other participants. 
They raised slogans in support of Pakistan and its armed forces and against Indian aggression and its attacks. They pledged that every citizen of Pakistan will safeguard its country and will fight against the enemy. 
Dow University of Health Sciences held protest rallies and demonstrations across its campuses to condemn Indian aggression and express unwavering solidarity with Pakistan’s armed forces. The rallies took place at both the Ojha and Dow Medical College campuses. 
The rally at Ojha campus, led by Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Jehan Ara Hassan, witnessed the participation of hundreds of students, faculty, and staff. Simultaneously, a rally at Dow Medical College was led by Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Nazli Hossain. Students from Dow International Medical College and other departments carried placards inscribed with slogans condemning the cowardly attacks by India. 
Addressing the students, Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Jehan Ara Hassan said India’s cowardly actions would never succeed in achieving its malicious war objectives.
Addressing a press conference, the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Karachi Chief Monem Zafar announced to activate Emergency Response Centres across the city and said that Alkhidmat would be working in collaboration with the Pakistan Disaster Management Authority and the Rescue 1122. 
He demanded the government to immediately restore the National Cadet Corps (NCC) training in colleges in order to equip the youth with civil defence training. 
He also demanded to reactivate the Girls Guide and Scouts. The JI leader also urged the government to convene a national security conference to bring all political parties together for the defence of the country. 
He said India, Israel and the United States are part of a “satanic nexus” and criticised them for their crimes against humanity. 
At a convention organised by the Palestine Foundation Pakistan, prominent scholars condemned India’s aggressive posturing toward Pakistan, calling on the international community to restrain the Modi government.
The other speakers, including Allama Hassan Zafar Naqvi, Allama Akhlaq Ahmed Akhlaq, Allama Nisar Qalandari, Allama Furqan Abidi, Allama Sajjad Shabbir, Allama Ali Irfan, and Ali Kamran Abidi, said that the entire Pakistani nation stood united like an iron wall in defence of our homeland.

The two-judge bench, headed by Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput, also noted that short-term kidnappings were not only unlawful but it also undermined the very essence of the rule of law. 
The bench further said that the law enforcing agencies were duty-bound to maintain law and order, and safeguard the life, liberty and property of citizens. 
“If those responsible for enforcing the law are themselves involved in such serious offences, it naturally reduces public trust in these institutions. If this trend continues, it could seriously harm civil rights and the credibility of law enforcement agencies,” it added. 
The bench made these observations while turning down the bail applications of three officials of the excise police. 

Turns down bail pleas of three excise police officials in kidnap case

Applicants Javed Khan, Nawab Khan and Amjad Hussain have been facing trial before an anti-terrorism court for allegedly kidnapping Majid Ali in the Defence Housing Authority in April last year, confining him to the excise police station and demanding ransom for his release. 
The detained officials approached the SHC after the trial court had dismissed their post-arrest bail pleas. 
After hearing the arguments, the bench dismissed the bail applications and observed that apparently, prosecution had sufficient evidence against the applicants to connect them with the offences. 
It also noted that as per record, the names of applicants were not mentioned in the FIR, but they had been named in the charge sheet and had been assigned their specific roles in committing short-term kidnapping of the complainant, detaining him at their police stations, demanding ransom and forcibly transferring money from the bank account of the captive. 
The bench in its order also said: “It may be observed that short-term kidnapping of innocent citizens by police officials for the purpose of extorting money is now-a-days increasing in the society in an uncontrolled way.” 
Chinese nationals’ security 
The same bench on Thursday directed the provincial and police authorities to act as per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) about providing security to Chinese nationals. 
A petition was filed by two people and submitted that Chinese nationals were their tenants and police personnel, providing security to them, were breaching the privacy of the petitioners. 
Additional advocate general Sagheer Ahmed Abbasi and ASP Manisha Ropeta filed some documents including SOPs for foreigners working on non-CPEC projects. 
The police officer also informed the SHC that the petitioners were approached for providing security to their Chinese tenants as per SOPs, but they were reluctant to cooperate with the police. 
The counsel for petitioner argued that the petitioners cannot give inside house access to police as it will breach their privacy. 
Thereafter, the bench directed the respondents to act as per SOPs in the case of petitioners and their Chinese tenants and if they do not need protection as per SOPs, they may submit such undertaking to police that they would arrange requisite security to themselves and such undertaking be sent to embassy and consulates of such foreign citizens.

World number two Swiatek came to Italy on the back of a demoralising straight-sets defeat to Coco Gauff in the semi-finals of the Madrid Open.
But the 23-year-old Pole dropped just a single game in winning 6-1, 6-0 against Italian Cocciaretto to move onto a third-round meeting with Danielle Collins as the American defeated Elena-Gabriela Ruse of Romania 6-3, 6-3.
“I felt like the ball was kind of listening to me today and I had full control over the match, so it’s always pretty comfortable to play a match like that,” Swiatek said.
“You just need to continue the work you’ve been doing and not expect that it’s going to happen more often.”
Swiatek is a three-time winner of the Italian Open and is using the claycourt tournament as a key step towards her defence of her French Open title, but she is yet to win a tournament this season.
In another second-round match, former world number one Naomi Osaka came from behind to overcome lucky loser Viktorija Golubic 2-6, 7-5, 6-1.
Sixth seed Jasmine Paolini, cheered on by her home crowd, was a comfortable 6-4, 6-3 winner against Lulu Sun of New Zealand and will face Ons Jabeur in round three after the Tunisian benefited from a walkover against Petra Kvitova.
Kvitova — who secured her first victory since returning from maternity leave by defeating Irina-Camelia Begu in the first round — was forced to withdraw due to a leg problem. 
Spanish ninth seed Paula Badosa also withdrew from the tournament earlier. Badosa’s injury cast more doubts over her fitness ahead of the French Open as the  Spanish former world number two pulled out of another tournament due to  a recurring back injury.
Third seed Jessica Pegula increased her perfect record against her fellow American Ashlyn Krueger with a 6-4, 6-2 second-round victory.
Pegula and her 37th-ranked compatriot Krueger have met five times, all in the last two years, and Pegula has prevailed on each occasion without the loss of a set. 
Meanwhile, men’s world number one Jannik Sinner will make his return to competition after a three-month doping ban by facing Mariano Navone on Saturday after the Argentinian beat Federico Cina 6-3, 6-3 on Thursday.
Alexander Bublik advanced into the next round after beating Roman Safiullin 6-3, 7-6(4). Bublik will next face Norwegian sixth seed Casper Ruud in the second round.
Fabian Marozsan fended off a mid-match fight back from Joao Fonseca as he earned an impressive 6-3, 7-6(4) first-round victory against the Brazilian star.
Earlier, Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut earned his first win in Rome for four years when he defeated Italian Matteo Arnaldi, 6-4, 6-3 and will next meet 11th seed Tommy Paul while last year’s finalist Nicolas Jarry also made a winning start, moving past Hugo Gaston 7-6(4), 6-4.
Italian wild card Luca Nardi beat countryman Flavio Cobolli 6-3, 6-4 and Marcos Giron overcame Madrid quarter-finalist Gabriel Diallo 3-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz makes his comeback on Friday, facing Laslo Djere of Serbia in the second round.
Alcaraz withdrew from the Madrid Open last month after struggling with  hamstring and groin injuries he had sustained during the Barcelona Open  final, opting to take a break so he could recover well before his French  Open title defence.   
In Wednesday’s late action, Great Britain’s Emma Raducanu eliminated  19-year-old qualifier Maya Joint of Australia 7-5, 6-7 (1), 6-3 in 2  hours, 44 minutes. 
Russia’s Anastasia Potapova outlasted Dayana Yastremska of Ukraine  2-6, 7-6 (6), 6-3. American Caroline Dolehide won a battle with  Australia’s Olivia Gadecki 7-6 (5), 5-7, 6-2 in 2 hours, 48 minutes.
Romania’s Ruse rallied to beat Russia’s Polina Kudermetova 6-7 (10), 6-4, 6-2 in 2 hours, 52 minutes.
Cocciaretto got past Russia’s Elina Avanesyan  6-2, 4-6, 6-1. Krueger bounced back to down Hungary’s  Anna Bondar 4-6, 6-2, 6-1.
In other matches on Wednesday, Colombia’s Emiliana Arango ousted Bulgaria’s Viktoriya Tomova 7-6(6), 5-7, 6-4 in 3 hours, 12 minutes.
Croatia’s Antonia Ruzic, 22, rallied past Roman wild card Tyra  Caterina Grant 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. Grant, 17, had two match points at 5-4 in  the third set. Ruzic won the final four games.
Serbia’s Olga Danilovic also recovered from a slow start to beat Czech Katerina Siniakova 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

• 200 ongoing uplift projects likely to be closed
• Ahsan says proper allocations cannot be made for key schemes                        
ISLAMABAD: The federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.
This was announced at a press conference by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who disclosed that an indicative budget ceiling (IBC) of Rs921bn for the next year provided by the Ministry of Finance was over three times lower than Rs2.9 trillion demanded by the Planning Commission based on requirements of various ministries for development projects.
The figure is also around 16pc lower than the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr, slashed on the instructions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from Rs1.4tr approved by the parliament as part of the federal budget 2024-25.
The minister said he would contest the IBC provided by the finance ministry and request the prime minister for higher allocations of at least Rs1.6tr to provide the rupee cover for foreign-funded projects.
The minister also launched the Planning Ministry’s Monthly Development Update for May 2025 during the press conference, a new initiative on the pattern of finance ministry’s monthly economic outlook.
Responding to a question, Mr Iqbal said authorisation for the disbursement had been issued for about Rs900bn out of Rs1.1tr PSDP for the current year.
He hoped the authorisation would increase during May and June. However, he hastened to add that the finance division had its own constraints, as resources were needed to increase the development budget, which required an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio.
He said the Annual Plan Coordination Com­mittee would meet on May 23 to finalise the next year’s development programme in consultations with provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Meanwhile, the National Economic Council (NEC) is expected to meet on May 26 or 27 to approve the development programme and macroeconomic targets for the next fiscal year. The federal budget would be presented on June 2, he said.
For the next fiscal year’s development budget, the minister bemoaned that Rs2.9tr was requested from the Ministry of Finance, which provided an IBC of only Rs 921bn, about Rs178bn lower than the current year.
“This is a cause of concern for us,” he said. “This will affect even the inflow of foreign exchange. We will need Rs700bn to provide rupee cover to foreign-funded projects during the next development budget. If we do not have enough rupee cover, we cannot utilise all the allocated foreign exchange component.”
Mr Iqbal said that with such a meagre IBC, proper allocations could not be made to the important projects, which would result in delays and cost escalations of such schemes. He said that the number of provincial projects in the PSDP would be reduced, while about 200 slow-moving projects would be closed.
Irregularities in key projects
He said the cost of Diamer-Bhasha Dam has escalated from Rs480bn to Rs1.5tr due to delays. Likewise, the cost of the Dasu Hydropower Project has increased from Rs500bn to Rs1.7tr.
The minister said there were several lapses in the implementation of the Dasu Hydropower Project. No project director or CFO was hired for such a huge project, and it was operated by Wapda’s own people.
He said that even the contracts for the construction of roads in the project area were allotted in dollars. “There are irregularities in the Dasu project and we want that responsibility to be fixed,” he emphasised, regretting that the financial viability of these projects had diminished due to rising costs.
Similarly, the minister said that there were shocking irregularities in the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project. The plan was started in such a hurry that the contractor was mobilised prior to the consultant, which the minister said was a serious irregularity.
“Interestingly, once in a meeting I asked the CFO of Neelum-Jhelum regarding his qualification, and I was stunned to know that he had a Master’s in Geography,” he said.
Mr Iqbal said the report of the International Marine Corps regarding the failure in the Ne­­e­lum-Jhelum Hydropower Project was awaited.
In reply to a question as to why a civilian could not be appointed as Wapda chairman, the minister said: “In my opinion, a civilian should be appointed as Wapda chairman and he should be a hydrology expert of international repute. I will recommend this to the prime minister.”
He reiterated that funding priorities under the next PSDP would align with the government’s Uraan Pakistan programme, aimed at job creation and economic uplift. “Projects approved under Uraan are expected to generate 120,000 direct and indirect jobs,” he said.

In a press conference, Ishaq Dar said India “deliberately fired” projectiles, three of which were dropped in Amritsar, the capital of Indian Punjab, located around 54km from Lahore.
He added that a fourth projectile entered Pakistani airspace, which was shot down by the air defense system in Dinga, Gujrat, around 87km from the nearest point on the India-Pakistan border.
Mr Dar’s remarks were in response to claims by New Delhi that it neutralised attempts by Pakistan to hit multiple “military targets” using “drones and missiles” on the night of Wednesday and Thursday.
Mr Dar added that India’s “deliberate” attack was a “malicious strategy” to “falsely implicate Pakistan” for targeting civilians and incite Indian Sikhs.
Sitting beside Mr Dar, the armed forces spokesperson also accused India of launching a false flag operation. 
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the projectiles, which he claimed were launched by India the previous night. 
He claimed India fired four projectiles from Adampur, a town in Jalan­dhar district of Indian Punjab. Three projectiles were “intently targeted” at Amritsar while one was taken down over Dinga, Lt-Gen Chaudhry added.
He said India’s claim that Pakistan attacked 15 locations was a “fantastic and cooked-up story”.
Every projectile leaves a digital signature, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said, asking India to share details about the origin of the projectiles it claimed were launched by Pakistan. 
The military spokesperson also lambasted the Indian media for falsely accusing Pakistan of launching attacks.
“When Pakistan strikes, we won’t need the Indian media to report it. The whole world will come to know. Its reverberations will be felt everywhere.”

Moratinos will continue in his current role as High Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC), which he has held since 2019, according to a statement by the UN spokesperson’s office.
“Moratinos brings decades of diplomatic experience and leadership on multilateral issues, including dialogue among civilisations and combating discrimination,” it said. “Moratinos has reinforced UNAOC’s role as a global platform for dialogue and bridge-building.”
A seasoned diplomat, Moratinos served as Spain’s foreign minister from 2004 to 2010, during which his country held the presidency of the Security Council and led several international organisations, including the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe.
On X, Moratinos uploaded a statement expressing his gratitude and stating he was truly honoured for the appointment.
“I thank the secretary general for the new responsibility that I have been entrusted with. I am also grateful for the support of member states and especially the OIC Core Group,” he wrote.
“The appointment of a UN special envoy to combat Islamophobia will contribute to strengthening our response to Islamophobia,” he added. “I wish to reaffirm my commitment to stand in solidarity with Muslim communities and to stand up against all forms of discrimination and bigotry.”

The agreement announced by Trump from the Oval Office marked the first since Trump triggered a global trade war with a barrage of levies on trading partners following his return to the White House in January.
“It opens up a tremendous market for us,” Trump said.
“This is a really fantastic, historic day,” Starmer said by teleconference.
The United States has been under pressure from investors to strike deals to de-escalate its tariff war after Trump’s often chaotic policymaking upended global trade with friend and foe alike, threatening to stoke inflation and start a recession.
 






Top US officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the president on April 2 imposed a 10pc tariff on most countries, along with higher rates for many trading partners that were then suspended for 90 days.
The US has also imposed 25pc tariffs on autos, steel and aluminium, 25pc tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 145pc tariffs on China. US and Chinese officials are due to hold talks in Switzerland on Saturday.
Warm relationship
With the British economy struggling to grow, the tariffs had added to the pressure on his government. Jaguar Land Rover paused its shipments to the US for a month and the government was forced to seize control of British Steel to keep it operating.
The deal will reduce US tariffs on British auto imports to 10pc from the current 27.5pc, according to a UK statement. The lower rate will apply to a quota of 100,000 British vehicles, almost the total exported to the US last year.
US tariffs on imports from the struggling UK steel industry will fall to zero from 25pc, while British tariffs on US ethanol will fall to zero from 19pc.
Both sides have agreed on new reciprocal market access on beef, with UK farmers given a tariff-free quota for 13,000 metric tonnes. There will be no weakening of UK food standards on imports.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that Britain is expected to announce a purchase of $10 billion worth of US-assembled Boeing aircraft, although a White House graphic referred to “aircraft parts”. In turn, Lutnick said that the US will allow duty-free imports for Rolls-Royce jet engines.
Lutnick said that the deal would create $5bn in new annual export opportunities for American producers, while the new tariffs that stay in place would produce $6bn in annual new US revenue.
 






While seeking a deal with the US, Britain had refused to lower its food standards, which are closely aligned with the European Union. However, Britain’s farming trade union has said that some US producers who do not use growth hormones or antimicrobial washes could be given greater market access.
Trump said the 10pc “baseline” tariff would stay in place and that other countries may face higher reciprocal tariffs even as they negotiate similar trade deals with the US.
Details were scant on tariffs on UK pharmaceuticals imports, which could damage AstraZeneca and GSK, although a White House fact sheet said the deal would create a secure pharma supply chain.
Initial news of an announcement sent shares in luxury carmaker Aston Martin up 10pc, while British retailers with operations in the US, including JD Sports and Primark owner AB Foods, also rose.
Trade tightrope
Starmer’s government has been seeking to build new trading relationships post-Brexit with the US, China and the EU without moving so far towards one bloc that it angers the others.
Economists and one FTSE 100 chief executive said the immediate economic impact of a tariff deal was likely to be limited but that trade agreements in general would help long-term growth. Britain struck a free trade agreement with India this week.
There are also domestic political risks. Polling shows the government remains deeply unpopular, making any move to cut taxes on multi-national tech companies a big risk.
Britain’s digital service tax, levied at 2pc of UK revenue for online marketplaces, would continue unchanged.
It was expected to raise about £800 million ($1.1bn) this year, but companies such as Google and Amazon have passed the cost on to customers through ad surcharges and higher selling fees, respectively.
“The American, Indian and other deals we can do will be really important to the long-term economic health of the UK, but don’t expect them to result in overnight euphoria,” the CEO said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><small>2025-05-08 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603675-pakistans-chinese-made-jet-brought-down-two-indian-fighter-aircraft-us-officials-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's J-10s brought down two Indian fighter aircraft, US officials say</strong></a><br><p>

A day earlier, Pakistan mourned the loss of 31 lives in overnight attacks by Indian forces on civilians, describing New Delhi’s actions as “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).
The Pakistan military termed the downing of five Indian fighter jets as a major victory —  and it was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials admitted that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory.
On Wednesday, as both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the damage caused by Indian strikes at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.
“The Pakistan Army, using their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully, have shot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones,” the ISPR said in a press release today.
Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said: “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”
“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” the statement added.
“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.
Meanwhile, the Indian defence ministry admitted that its armed forces targeted a number of locations in Pakistan in the morning today. Indian outlet ANI News reported that Harpy drones were used by the Indian military to target Pakistan’s “air defence system”. According to the Database of Israeli Military and Security Export, the Harop is a “later development of the Harpy”.
The ministry’s statement also alleged that Pakistan had “increased the intensity” of firing at the LoC, where the two countries’ troops have been exchanging fire for the past several days.
 
 

“The Harpy is designed to attack radar systems and is optimised for the suppression of enemy air defences (Sead) role. It carries a high explosive warhead,” the ANI report read.
In a press briefing early today, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistan’s forces had neutralised 12 drones sent by India since last night. He also stated that four army personnel were injured as one drone, besides those downed, managed to engage a military target partially.
The ISPR DG detailed the locations where 12 of those drones sent by India were neutralised — Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur’s Miano, Umerkot’s Chhor and near Karachi in Sindh.
“Other than these 12, one drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.
“Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.
The DG ISPR further said that as a result of India’s drone activity, one civilian embraced martyrdom and another was injured in Miano.

During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.
“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” he continued.
“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the DG ISPR said.
“The Indians have resorted to these measures after] having miserably failed on the night of May 6 and 7, when they attacked places of worship and civilian infrastructure and killed innocent civilians, including children, women and [the] elderly,” he continued.
 


He further said: “Not only that, having faced the destruction of five of their aircraft, multiple drones, and suffering heavy casualties along LoC and damage, it appears that India has apparently lost the plot.
“And rather than going on a path of rationality, it is further escalating in a highly charged environment to satisfy the hubristic mindset of the Indian government,” Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted.
“The international community can visibly see the path that India is treading through this extremely provocative military aggression in a region, which is highly fragile and putting the security of the region and beyond at risk,” he said.
The DG ISPR added that the Pakistan armed forces remain “fully vigilant to any type of threat”. He then repeated the details of the Indian drones downed in Urdu.</p><small>2025-05-08 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603636-at-least-40-50-indian-soldiers-killed-in-retaliation-along-loc-following-missile-attack' target='_blank'><strong>At least 40-50 Indian soldiers killed in retaliation along LoC following missile attack</strong></a><br><p>
