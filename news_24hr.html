The Special Investigation Unit of the Sindh police and an intelligence agency conducted the raid on a tip-off, SIU SSP Mohammed Shoaib Memon said, adding that they had links with the Indian intelligence agency — the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).
He identified the suspects as Mohammed Khan alias Gullu, Yameen Malah, Akhter Thaheem and Ghulam Qadir alias Akash, and claimed that they were found involved in espionage activities.
With their arrest, a plot to carry out terror attacks in the country was foiled, he said.
SSP Memon said that two hand grenades, a Kalashnikov, a rifle, two pistols and mobile phones were seized from them. The mobile phones, believed to be containing sensitive digital material, have been sent for a forensic analysis, he said.
“The suspects had made videos and captured pictures of the country’s sensitive installations, which they used to send to RAW using specialised software,” the SIU officer claimed.
According to him, the suspects admitted that they used to meet officers of RAW and Indian Border Security Force in border areas.
They received large sums of cash, liquor and valuable gifts from Indian agencies’ personnel, the SSP said.

Talking to reporters alongside Rutte at a Nato alliance summit, Trump again berated Israel and Iran.
“They’ve had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. You know, they fight like hell, you can’t stop them. Let them fight for about 2-3 minutes, then it’s easy to stop them,” he said. In response, Rutte laughed and said: “And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get (them to) stop.”
On Tuesday, after a ceasefire deal, Trump had raised eyebrows by saying Israel and Iran had been fighting “so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing”.
With the 32-member Nato alliance endeavouring to placate Trump after complaints that it was over-reliant on US financial and military muscle, Rutte was asked if he might be over-flattering the US president.
“No, I don’t think so. I think it’s a bit of a question of taste,” he said, calling Trump a “good friend” for more than a decade and praising his role in “finally” persuading Europe to boost military spending.
“So doesn’t he deserve some praise?” Rutte asked, also noting Trump’s decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites.
“And when it comes to Iran, the fact that he took this decisive action, very targeted, to make sure that Iran would not be able to get his hands on a nuclear capability — I think he deserves all the praise.”
Iran branded Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte’s gushing note to President Donald Trump on US strikes targeting key nuclear sites as “disgraceful, despicable and irresponsible”.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei hit back, saying it was “disgraceful, despicable and irresponsible for Nato’s SG to congratulate a `truly extraordinary’ criminal act of aggression against a sovereign state”. Whoever supports a crime is regarded as complicit“, Baqaei said in a post on
X.

Speaking at a webinar titled “Opportunities in Pakistan’s Mining Sector – Unlocking Mineral Potential”, the minister highlighted the country’s rich endowment of mineral resources, including gold, copper, coal, rare earth elements and other critical minerals vital for the global energy transition.
The event was jointly organised by the Ministry of Energy and the US Embassy in Pakistan to promote investment opportunities in the country’s minerals and mining sector.
Mr Malik assured that both the Government of Pakistan and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) are fully committed to facilitating international companies seeking to partner in unlocking Pakistan’s mineral reserves.
He emphasised Pakistan’s growing role in the global shift towards clean energy, citing the nation’s abundant reserves of critical minerals as a key enabler of a green transition. “Renewable energy development is central to our climate goals and economic future. We are facilitating this shift by supporting the mining of essential minerals and improving ease of doing business,” he stated.
 
 

The minister underscored the international significance of the Reko Diq copper-gold project, while also referencing recent discoveries in Balochistan’s Chaghi district and KP’s Waziristan region.
Mr Malik lauded the success of the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 (PMIF25), held earlier this year, which attracted over 5,000 participants and global attention. “PMIF25 marked a turning point, showcasing Pakistan as a serious player in the global minerals economy,” he remarked.
US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker reaffirmed the strong economic ties between the US and Pakistan. “Pakistan offers immense opportunities in the minerals sector. With one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits at Reko Diq, and a strong commitment to economic reforms, this is the right time for US investors to explore and engage,” she said.
Ms Baker welcomed Pakistan’s recent policy initiatives aimed at unlocking the sector’s potential and pledged continued support from the US Embassy in facilitating American businesses. “We are here to foster connections and build win-win partnerships. US investors have long contributed to Pakistan’s development, and we see great promise in this sector,” she added.
She concluded by reaffirming the US government’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s economic development and strengthening bilateral economic ties. “We believe in Pakistan’s potential and see shared opportunity in its journey toward inclusive, sustainable growth,” she said. The webinar was broadcast from the head office of Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) and brought together senior officials from the Ministry of Energy, leading mineral and energy firms, SIFC representatives, US diplomats, and energy sector stakeholders.

According to Kurram District Police Officer Habibullah, the blasts also resulted in injuries to four others.
Parachinar Hospital’s Medi­cal Superintendent Mir Hassan Jan told Dawn that the dece­a­sed were identified as Nawab Ali, Aamir Hussain, Hidayat Hussain, and Manzar Ali. All four died on the spot.
The injured — identified as Muhammad, Qunein, Shafaat Hussain and Hassan Ghulam — were initially taken to Para­chi­nar Hospital for first-aid, and later referred to Peshawar for further treatment. DPO Habib­ul­­lah said police teams had been dispatched to the area and that an investigation is underway.
Two of the injured, Qunein and Hassan Ghulam, told Dawn that the landmines exploded as they neared a mountain area. They said they were seriously wounded in the blasts, which also killed four of their companions and two horses on the spot.
Tribal elders strongly condemned the incident, demanding the immediate arrest of those responsible and calling for a high-level investigation. They termed the explosions an attempt to sabotage peace efforts in the region.

• Omar Ayub labels budget ‘dead on arrival’, slams inflation claims
• Rs4.8tr in grants approved for four ministries
• Finance minister claims macroeconomic stability restored
ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) came under fire in the National Assembly on Wednesday over allegations of collusion with smugglers and tax evaders, as the House paved the way for the federal budget’s passage today (Thursday).
The budget, presented on June 10, is now set to pass with previously agreed-upon amendments.
On Wednesday, the National Asse­m­bly completed the process of approving demands for grants to cover the ex­­­pe­n­ses of various ministries and divisions.
It approved 31 demands for grants totalling Rs4.814 trillion for four ministries and divisions —Finance and Revenue, Human Rights, Interior, and National Food Security — while rejecting all 430 cut motions submitted by the opposition.
Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, speaking during the debate on budgetary allocations for the Finance Division, alleged that oil worth Rs550 billion is smuggled from Iran every year.
He wondered how around 200 heavy vehicles manage to cross more than two dozen bridges daily without being intercepted, implying official complicity. Describing the FBR as “one of the most corrupt institutions”, he opposed proposals to grant it arrest powers.
He rejected the budget as “dead on arrival” and dismissed government claims of reducing inflation. He said the purchasing power of the masses continues to shrink and lamented that 44 per cent of citizens had slipped below the poverty line.
He accused the government of sig­ning flawed power purchase agreements with independent power producers (IPPs) between 2013 and 2018, saying capacity payments had soared from Rs450bn in 2018 to Rs 2.2tr.
“This regime is responsible,” he said, adding that 97pc of the fiscal deficit would be financed through bank borrowing, benefiting the owners of four private banks.
JUI-F’s Aliya Kamran voiced alarm over the ballooning national debt, noting it had swelled to Rs76tr by March — more than four times the entire budget. On tax evasion, she said the FBR’s system was weak and lacked ac­­countability. “Tax frauds are made with the help of FBR officials,” she alleged.
PTI’s Usama Ahmad Mela criticised the government’s reliance on indirect taxes, including the imposition of a carbon tax amid rising oil prices, instead of reducing the petroleum levy. He questioned the rationale behind taxing hybrid vehicles if the state was serious about promoting eco-friendly alternatives and demanded the reversal of the decision.
He also condemned the government’s policy of exporting and then re-importing 750,000 tonnes of sugar, saying it had led to a Rs50 per kilogram price hike. “If we continue surrendering to pressure groups and lobbies, we should forget about public relief,” he said.
He warned that allowing the FBR to make unlimited contract-based recruitments and leaving small business owners at its mercy would open floodgates of corruption.
JUI-P’s Shahida Begum criticised the FBR’s inaction in the face of disclosures about public officials owning large, undeclared properties, and opposed proposed powers allowing it to arrest businessmen.
PTI’s Shandana Gulzar challenged government claims of growth in the livestock sector, pointing out that the last livestock census was held in 2006. She accused the government of peddling falsehoods and pursuing anti-people policies, adding: “We are sowing the seeds of revolution in Pakistan.”
‘Macroeconomic stability’
Winding up the discussion on cut motions on demands for grants relating to the Finance and Revenue Division, Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb claimed that macroeconomic stability had been restored.
He cited improvements in economic indicators, including a stable curren­cy, increased foreign reserves sufficient to cover two and a half months of imp­orts, and reduced inflation and policy rates. “These are hard facts, independently validated by rating agencies,” he said. He said investor, business and consumer confidence had improved over the past four to five months, citing a Dun & Bradstreet survey indicating the highest consumer confidence since 2022.
On FBR corruption, he said digitisation was meant to ensure transparency and minimise human involvement, which he called the most effective way to reduce graft.
Concluding debate on cut motions related to the Human Rights Division, Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar highlighted that the National Commission for Human Rights Pakistan had, for the first time, received “A” status from a cluster of global human rights organisations. He said effective legislation had been enacted to protect the rights of women, children, and minorities.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry stated that Pakistan’s passports have been upgraded with international security features to prevent forgery. He added that airports and seaports are now integrated with AI systems to ensure that no person can leave the country without a valid visa and the necessary legal documents.

GILGIT: NDMA’s Nat­ional Emergencies Ope­ration Centre (NEOC) on Wednesday issued a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (Glof) alert for northern areas, including Gilgit-Baltistan, citing a dangerous combination of persistent high temperatures, intensified monsoon currents and a prevailing westerly wave.
The alert comes as current heatwaves intensify glacier melting across the region, leading to increased water levels and flash floods creating disasters in downstream areas.
A flash flood triggered on Wednesday by a melting glacier occurred in the Burundubar stream, which flows into the famous tourist point Attabad Lake, according to Rescue 1122.
The floodwater blocked access to the Luxus hotel, entering its premises where “a large number of national and foreign tourists were present”.

160 evacuated by boat after flash flooding near Attabad Lake

More than 160 tourists and hotel staff were evacuated by boat.
The flood also damaged trees and land, creating “panic among stranded tourists cut off from land link”.
Elsewhere, rising temperatures triggered flooding in Barga nallah in Skardu, where water “once again entered homes and crops, causing widespread destruction,” police said.
GB Environmental Pro­tection Agency’s (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that the frequency of melting glacier disasters “intensified in recent years”.
Mr Hussain attributed this to global climate cha­nge and localised factors.
“In old times, snowfall received the mountains in November to December, that was converting into ice, now snowfall in February and March, that couldn’t convert into ice, with heatwaves, the snow melting in speed that causes flooding,” he said.
He added that “localised factors including def­orestation, unplanned con­­struction, and tourism influx,” along with incr­e­ased population and certain energy practices, contribute to accelerated glacier melt.
Another environmental expert told Dawn that many in GB live “in downstream areas of nallahs and rivers and near glaciers,” and when floods hit, “they have no time to save themselves.”
The expert highlighted the broader consequences, saying, “The GB glaciers produce 80pc of Pakistan’s agricultural water. This isn’t just a GB issue — it affects the whole country.”
Concerns were also raised that the GB government “has shown little priority in creating awareness or reducing the risks of climate change and disasters.”

The spectacular success of China, despite having a large market of 1.4 billion people, is primarily attributed to its integration into the world economy. In merely three decades, China has become the top exporting nation.
Notably, our neighbours India and Bangladesh have also progressed since 1990 by actively participating in the global economy. Vietnam, once a war-shattered country with a lower export level than Pakistan until 1996, exported $371bn of goods, equal to 106 per cent of GDP, in 2022, while Pakistan hardly reached $30bn, or 8pc.
Had Pakistan retained its share in the 1990s’ global exports of 0.15pc, it could have generated $50bn by 2024-25. Unfortunately, our global share has slid to an average of 0.08pc in the 2020s. Export earnings of $50bn would have prevented recurring crises and reliance on external borrowing, preserving economic sovereignty.
All major political parties seem to agree that Pakistan must recapture its lost market share and reduce its dependence on external borrowing. This implies surpassing other countries in pricing, quality, reliability, and the timely delivery of goods and services. Regaining its market share would enable accelerated economic growth and jobs for the youth as well as act as a buffer against external shocks. The recent debate in parliament focused on how tariff rationalisation can achieve the export expansion target. One cannot expect a single instrument such as tariff rationalisation alone to deliver the desired results; the matter must be seen in the larger context of enhanced competitiveness. It should be conceded that there will be losers and winners and that some industries won’t survive while new ones would emerge.
The challenge of improving competitiveness is intricate, as states do not directly compete. Rather, it is the myriad firms, enterprises, and companies within them that compete under a national policy and institutional framework. Hence, a comprehensive analysis of competitiveness means a two-layered approach — at the national and firm level.
A conducive national environment entails well-functioning governance institutions, streamlined investment climate, emphasis on human capital, especially female labour participation, rationalised tariffs and taxes, flexible exchange rate policy and policies for the promotion of exports. At the firm level, investments in upskilling the workforce, professionalised management structures, collaboration with international experts, engagement in joint ventures with foreign companies, participation in global value chains, service exp­o­rts, innovation, and digitalisation are imperative.

We can’t expect a single instrument such as tariff rationalisation alone to deliver the results.

With tariff reform planned over the next five years, some complementary changes are needed. First, overregulation and high entry barriers disadvantage firms in the formal sector, with only 5pc of businesses accounting for 76pc of exports. Regulatory reforms have been underway for the last five years and should be brought to a culmination point. By eliminating outdated rules, streamlining processes in land acquisition and SEZs, and providing access to finance, a conducive environment is created for new entrants. Persisting difficulties in navigating bureaucracy and securing approvals hinder business growth and innovation. Facilitating ease of entry and exit is crucial to break rent-seeking practices, promote efficiency and encourage new ventures.
Second, dedicated commercial courts and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms should be set up to enforce contracts speedily and avoid protracted litigation which acts as a barrier, keeping resources trapped in low-productivity firms.
Third, energy prices should be determined in a competitive market consisting of multiple buyers and sellers without intervention by the regulator or government.
Fourth, the Export Facilitation Scheme and Export Development Fund should be aligned with international best practices and the excessive tax burden on the export sector eliminated.
Fifth, proliferating new technologies have spurred advanced production and processing methods, elevating the need for knowledge-based skilled workers. Platform economies, encompassing online sales, technology frameworks, and transaction platforms are gaining traction. Public-private partnership in resolving skill shortages must be incentivised.
Finally, tariff rationalisation. Our highly protected economy relies heavily on high output tariffs, a significant source of rents for shielded firms. Profitability for sectors with strong trade protection is more than double that of other industries, leading to pressure from political and business lobbies to maintain high tariffs. While economists agree on time-bound, performance-related protection for infant industries, Pakistan continuously extends concessions and high tariff rates, resulting in low entry and exit rates for exporting firms, reduced product diversification, unchanged sectoral composition since the 1990s, and heightened geographical concentration.
Though the latest estimates of effective rates of protection are unavailable, a previous PIDE study suggested a decline in the early 2000s. However, introduction of additional customs and regulatory duties in the last five years has increased ERPs, with the average rate rising from 12pc in FY15 to almost 20pc in FY20 — double that of our competitors’ and China’s 5pc. In a world dominated by global value chains, tariffs on imports of components, ancillary supplies and intermediate inputs act as a tax on exports. Reducing import duties helps minimise input costs, enabling downstream industries — automobiles, construction, consumer electronics, engineering goods — to become competitive in third-country markets. Despite protection, auto-grade steel isn’t domestically produced, hindering the fabrication of certain auto parts. Similarly, pharma faces challenges as active ingredients are imported. High tariff rates impede industries in sunrise sectors from scaling up, reducing unit costs and becoming competitive globally. In fast-moving market dynamics, static input-output coefficients lose relevance.
Meanwhile, the private sector needs a radical mindset shift. While blaming the government is often justifiable, owners must reconsider their own attitude towards workers and recognise them as key partners, invest in R&D, and explore new markets. Professionalising the management cadre, utilising management consultancy and adopting international benchmarks and best practices are additional enablers.
As these targets and action plans evolve, maintaining consistency, continuity, coherence, coordination and predictability is paramount. To that extent, open debate and discussion in parliament signals that these reforms, once agreed upon, will not be abdicated if a new political party comes to power in 2029.

The drugs in question form the backbone of treatment plans for numerous common cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer and leukaemia.
Some drugs contained so little of their key ingredient that pharmacists said giving them to patients would be as good as doing nothing. Other drugs, containing too much active ingredient, put patients at risk of severe organ damage or even death.
“Both scenarios are horrendous,” said one pharmacist. “It’s heartbreaking.”
Doctors from multiple countries told The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) that the drugs in question were not working as expected, leaving patients suddenly unresponsive to treatment. Other patients suffered side effects so toxic that they could no longer tolerate the medicine.
The variance found in the levels of active ingredient was alarming. In some cases, pills from the same blister pack contained different amounts.
These findings expose huge holes in the global safety nets intended to prevent profit-seeking manufacturers from cutting corners and to protect patients from bad drugs. All the while, patients and governments with stretched resources are paying the price for drugs that don’t work.
A global killer
Cancer is one of the biggest killers worldwide, linked to around 10 million deaths every year — roughly one in six. The burden of cancer is growing, particularly in low and middle-income regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, instances of cancer have doubled in the last 30 years.
Much of the global demand for treatment is met by so-called generic drugs. These are versions of a drug that can be made once the original maker’s exclusivity rights have expired, and are typically made far more cheaply. The bad drugs described in this investigation were all generics.
Generics are widely used in all countries but are most crucial in those with fewer resources, where costlier treatments might be beyond reach.
If generics were not available in sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, “any cancer treatment would be likely inaccessible to most of the population”, said Claudia Martinez of the Access to Medicine Foundation, an NGO part-funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
In chemotherapy drugs, the active ingredient, which fights cancer cells, is also highly toxic. Patients need to receive enough of it to treat the cancer, but not so much that they overdose and suffer damaging side effects.
As such, hospital pharmacists calculate doses carefully and, in doing so, rely on the amount of active ingredient being exactly what’s stated on the label.
Research from a landmark study published today examined the amount of active ingredient in seven common types of cancer drugs: cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, leucovorin, methotrexate and oxaliplatin. All of them are classed as essential medicines by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Working with collaborators in Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya and Malawi, researchers at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, in the United States, analysed drug samples from the four countries.
Of the 189 samples that had not expired at the time of testing, about one-fifth failed. This consisted of 20 different brands of generic drug made by 17 manufacturers.
 
“We were all taken aback when we saw the results,” said Marya Lieberman, the professor who led the research.
More than 30 manufacturers made products to a good standard. But for patients receiving the poor-quality drugs, the effects could be devastating.
“Once a person has been diagnosed with cancer, there’s a limited window of opportunity for treatment to work,” said Lieberman. “And if someone is treated with an ineffective product, they can lose that precious window.”
The majority of failed drugs had too little active ingredient — for most, this meant less than 88 per cent of the amount stated on the label — while some contained too much, more than 112pc in some cases. Both thresholds were decided by researchers based on international standards.

“Both scenarios are horrendous in my eyes,” said Shereen Nabhani-Gebara, vice chair of the British Oncology Pharmacists Association. “It takes a lot of courage for someone with cancer to accept a diagnosis, but then to be short-changed like this when they are trying their best is heartbreaking, because this is someone’s life.”
Tracking the threat
Over the past six years, these brands of drugs have been shipped to more than 100 countries in every populated continent on the planet. They range from low and middle-income nations like Nepal, Ethiopia, North Korea and Pakistan, to wealthy countries such as the US, UK and Saudi Arabia.
The worst-performing drug in the study is made by Indian manufacturer Venus Remedies. It is a drug called cyclophosphamide, which is often used to treat cancers, including lymphoma and breast cancer.

All eight samples of this Venus Remedies drug failed, with six containing less than half the amount of active ingredient claimed by the manufacturer. One contained just over a quarter of the stated dose, which, according to several cancer pharmacists, would be as effective as no treatment at all.
The drug has been shipped to six countries, with its largest importer being Ethiopia. Although Pakistan does obtain cyclophosphamide from Indian vendors, Venus Remedies is not the main supplier.
Wondemagegnhu Tigeneh, a clinical oncologist in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, told TBIJ that he has treated patients with chemotherapy drugs he believes did not work.
“I have a suspicion that the active ingredient was lower than expected,” he said, remembering a drug he gave to a recent patient who had responded well to the first three rounds of treatment. But on the next round, their progress suddenly stopped.
Because he has no means to test them, Tigeneh can never be sure of the quality of a given drug. But in his 20 years treating cancer, he has learned to notice tell-tale signs. Sometimes, for instance, there is a complete absence of side effects such as nausea or hair loss.
“That makes it difficult to trust that particular drug,” he said.
Then there are the patients whose disease he struggles to get under control, such as a patient whose response to treatment halted without warning.
Rather than reducing the size of the tumour enough to enable surgery, his team has been forced to move on to a second-line treatment. If that fails, the next stage is palliative care. “
It’s very sad,“ said Tigeneh. “We didn’t used to see things like this.”
Cancer patients in Ethiopia have far better access to treatment facilities now than they did 20 years ago. It doesn’t seem, however, that the standard of medicines has kept pace.
A 2020 study of cancer drugs in Ethiopia included 20 samples of cisplatin, which were all found to be substandard, averaging just over half of the stated content. One researcher who tests the quality of drugs in the country told TBIJ that they find bad medicines wherever they go.
Venus Remedies told TBIJ that the study results were “not scientifically plausible” given the company’s “validated manufacturing systems and quality controls”.
It said it has received no complaints or concerns about the batches in question and shared the results of its own testing that indicated they were of a good standard.

It said storage conditions in the supply chain, which can affect drug quality, might have affected the researchers’ test results. However, the absence of similar quality issues across the entire data set suggests this is not the case.
Venus Remedies is one of three companies or regulators that queried the methodology used by the lab, saying it deviated from international standards or could give erroneous results.
However, Lieberman said that, although her results are not intended for regulatory purposes, her researchers’ methods are based on those used by regulatory labs and were verified for suitability, accuracy, and precision. Both the findings and methods have been scrutinised by independent academics.
Toxic effects
Some 2,000 miles south of Addis Ababa, in Malawi, specialist cancer care has only been available for around 15 years. In one of the poorest countries in the world, patients depend on healthcare being free at the point of need. That means clinics have to rely on generic drugs.
A pharmacist specialising in cancer care in central Malawi told TBIJ of seeing patients at his hospital overdose on methotrexate, a drug used to treat leukaemia and lymphoma.
Malawi has also imported two of the brands of methotrexate the researchers in this investigation found to contain too much active ingredient: Zuvitrex, made by Zuvius Lifesciences; and Unitrexate, made by United Biotech.
Neither company responded to multiple requests for comment.
This sort of excess can be just as harmful as a deficit. A bad overdose can leave a patient with lifelong side effects or even kill them. As Nabhani-Gebara said, “More is not better.”
The Malawian pharmacist said patients at his hospital have suffered severe vomiting and nausea after overdosing on methotrexate, while others had to be moved onto a second-line treatment, which may not be as effective.
For some patients, the side effects were so severe that they had to pause treatment entirely, giving the cancer a chance to grow.
When a sample of the methotrexate in question was tested as part of a research project taking place at the time, it was found to be too high in active ingredient. “It’s very worrying,” the pharmacist said.
He told TBIJ that he and his colleagues have, on occasion, had to stop using an entire batch of chemotherapy medicine and send samples to the national drug regulator after the medicine changed colour — a sign that something is wrong with it.
“We had patients scheduled for clinic,” he said, “and then we had to break the news to them that we don’t have medicines.”
Failing safety nets
Countries all over the world have systems in place to stop bad drugs from reaching patients. However, there are huge disparities in their effectiveness.
According to Chaitanya Kumar Koduri of the US Pharmacopoeia, an organisation that sets standards for medicines in the US and internationally, “70pc of countries cannot take care of their own medicine quality”.
Most governments have a national regulator, but their remit and resources vary hugely. Even the better-funded regulators are far from foolproof.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for instance, is struggling to keep up with inspections of manufacturing plants domestically and in India and China and has admitted that its inspections have not been a reliable indicator of drug quality.
The FDA recently announced it would expand unannounced inspections at foreign manufacturing facilities, saying this will help expose those who falsify records or hide violations.
It told TBIJ “that inspections and reviews will continue to ensure [drug] safety and efficacy”.

One of the countries where medicine regulation ranks the lowest, according to the WHO, is Nepal. It is also one of the biggest importers of the failed chemotherapy brands in this investigation.
Despite there being more than 20,000 brands of medicine on the market, the country’s drugs regulator has set a target of testing just 22 drugs in the next 12 months — none of them chemotherapy drugs.
Narayan Prasad Dhakal, the regulator’s director general, told TBIJ that its lab cannot currently test cancer drugs and admitted that the situation around quality testing is “a concern”. He also said that while his department has the power to recall cancer drugs based on external evidence, it has never done so.
The issue is especially fraught for patients who may have travelled from remote, rural areas to get treatment that may not even work.
Laxmi Kumari, whose two-year-old son is being treated for cancer in Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, has had to procure chemotherapy drugs from private pharmacies.
The treatment has cost the family nearly 200,000 Nepalese rupees (£1,160), equivalent to several months’ average salary in Nepal, and yet they have no reassurance that it will be effective.
“We have no way of knowing the quality of the medications being used in his treatment,” said Kumari. “We rely entirely on what the doctors recommend.”
“Neither patients nor their families have any way of knowing the quality of these drugs,” said Smriti Pokharel of the Wish Nepal Foundation, which helps children from low-income families access cancer treatment.
“Even doctors face challenges in verifying their quality. No one seems willing to take responsibility for ensuring proper treatment for cancer patients.”
Race to the bottom
Generic drug manufacturers are operating in a global market that healthcare professionals and experts agree is driven by one thing: price. It’s a market in which those operating under a less watchful eye can find ways to undercut their competitors.
This could mean scrimping on the amount or quality of the active ingredient — the most expensive component — or using cheap or outdated machinery. Research shows that the majority of substandard drugs occur due to problems with manufacturing, quality control, packaging or storage.
The results can be fatal. Four children died in Colombia after being given contaminated cancer drugs in 2019. Three years later, another batch of bad medicine caused the deaths of at least 10 children in Yemen who were being treated for leukaemia.
The price-driven market creates a dangerous dynamic in which the number of companies making a particular drug shrinks and shrinks until global supply is precariously dependent on just a handful of manufacturers. Should one company slip up, thousands of patients can be left without the drugs they depend on.
It’s a situation that played out in the US recently. Between 2018 and 2022, Intas Pharmaceuticals, the parent company of Accord Healthcare — which made the worst-performing cisplatin tested in this investigation — grew its market share of cisplatin from 24pc to 62pc.
It also increased its share of methotrexate fivefold in the same time period. All the while, prices of both these chemotherapy drugs dropped.
Then, at the end of 2022, a surprise inspection by the US drug regulator revealed a “cascade of failure” at an Intas factory in India, where staff were seen shredding and pouring acid on quality records.
The shutdown that ensued sent shockwaves across the US, with nearly every major cancer centre reporting shortfalls in chemotherapy drugs during the spring or summer of 2023, according to The New York Times.
Accord Healthcare said the batch of cisplatin that failed our testing had met all established quality standards and shared data from internal and external studies indicating its quality. It said it has not received any market concerns related to this batch.
The world’s pharmacy
India, where about 20pc of the world’s generic drugs come from, plays a pivotal role in ensuring people everywhere can access affordable medicine. Sixteen of the 17 manufacturers of failed drugs in this investigation are based in India.
While the majority of India-made drugs are safe, the country’s generics industry has long been dogged by scandal. In 2013, Indian manufacturer Ranbaxy agreed to pay a fine of $500 million after its US subsidiary pleaded guilty to the improper manufacturing, storing and testing of drugs.
In 2022 and 2023, Indian-made cough syrups were linked to the deaths of children in Gambia, Cameroon and Uzbekistan. As recently as August 2024, it was reported that the regulator had found more than 50 drugs on the market to be substandard or fake, including some paracetamol and antacids.
In India, the world’s largest producer of generic drugs, questions have been raised over whether manufacturers are properly punished for producing drugs that aren’t fit for purpose and whether foreign regulators have proper oversight.
“The Indian government’s interest is in trying to protect the industry,” said public health activist and former Big Pharma whistleblower Dinesh Thakur.
Sixteen of the 17 manufacturers identified in this investigation are based in India, and five have been previously flagged by a regulator for producing substandard batches of drugs. One of them, Zee Laboratories, has been flagged 46 times since 2018.
India’s drug regulator told TBIJ that Zee Laboratories has been audited and given a “stop production order”, which was lifted after the company resolved the problems in question. It did not give details about when this was, which issues it pertained to or whether the company faced any consequences.
It’s also unclear whether the manufacturers exposed in TBIJ’s previous investigation into substandard asparaginase have faced any repercussions, despite 70,000 children with leukaemia being at risk.
Three of those companies — Getwell Pharmaceuticals, United Biotech and VHB Medi Sciences — also made some of the substandard drugs revealed by this investigation.
Thakur said there’s only one way to explain the production of weak drugs by big companies: “Somebody’s cutting corners.”
Meanwhile, these medicines continue to fill pharmacy shelves. Zuvius Lifesciences and GLS Pharma have supplied their failed brands to over 40 countries.
In the past two years, Venus Remedies, which made the drug that pharmacists said wasn’t worth prescribing, has been awarded a series of contracts and licences, including from the Pan American Health Organisation to supply several essential cancer drugs to Latin American countries.
India’s drug regulator defended the oversight system, saying that failing drugs are recalled and manufacturers face “either administrative penalties or legal prosecution in court”.
Getwell Pharmaceuticals, GLS Pharma, VHB Medi Sciences, and Zee Laboratories did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Shortage of resources
In order to ensure that people across the world have access to safe, effective drugs, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has put in place a series of steps.
It has compiled a list of “essential medicines”, to help countries with limited resources know what to prioritise. It checks certain drugs, active ingredients and their manufacturers to create a pre-approved list that countries can trust.
The WHO also oversees a set of standards for manufacturers and drugs that many countries refer to when importing medicines.
However, these measures have their own limitations.
The list of recommended medicines, for example, only expanded to include cancer drugs in 2019 and experts say that the  WHO should include more of them on the list.
Shalini Jayasekar-Zürn of the Union for International Cancer Control, a global membership organisation dedicated to taking action on cancer, says it currently only encompasses two cancer drugs, rituximab and trastuzumab.
“It would be great if the list were expanded to include more essential medicines, especially for cancer,” she said.
While the WHO oversees standards for manufacturers and drugs, it’s up to the countries buying medicines to make sure those standards are met, which is no easy task given the resources of national regulators.
Meanwhile, Thakur said that one WHO scheme — a certificate system that says a given drug meets various standards — has been undermined by companies that have found “workarounds” to get hold of the paperwork without improving quality.
“It’s not worth the paper it’s written on,” he said.
As a result, experts say, is that without the comprehensive oversight seen in countries like the UK, the WHO’s processes don’t stop substandard medicines from making their way onto shelves.
Reflecting on TBIJ’s findings alongside his own experience, Thakur said that the WHO was “clearly not” delivering on its stated purpose: to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable.
The WHO did not respond to several requests for comment made by TBIJ.
A high price
The cruel irony is that in this race to the bottom, it is the cancer patients who are often left to foot the bill. And those who have the least pay the most: in low-income countries, the cost of 58pc of essential cancer medicines is paid by patients, compared with 1.8pc in upper-middle-income countries.
One cancer pharmacist in Ethiopia estimated that it could take over a year for a patient to save for cancer treatment. If that medicine then turns out to be faulty, they simply might not be able to afford to pay for another.
“Most people believe cancer is incurable,” they said. “When they end up with a medicine that won’t cure them, that’s another tragedy.”
“For me, it’s a question of fairness,” said Lieberman, the lead researcher. “[Patients] have the right to be treated with a medicine that actually is what it says it is. One that has the correct ingredients in it, that hasn’t degraded, and that doesn’t have things in it that will hurt them. It’s too important.”</p><small>2025-06-26 04:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/685cbf187d6bc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920156/a-fiery-fortnight' target='_blank'><strong>A fiery fortnight</strong></a><br><p>COULD one lunch in Washington cause so much dyspepsia in Delhi, or indigestion in Islamabad?
On June 18, 2025, President Donald Trump invited Field Marshal Asim Munir for a private meal in the White House’s Cabinet Room. He set five places: for himself, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his aide Steve Witkoff. The field marshal sat with Lt-Gen Asim Malik, ISI head and national security adviser. There was no place for a representative of Pakistan’s elected government. (Later, Rubio deadened Islamabad’s pique by phoning Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.)
Trump’s working lunch, scheduled for an hour, extended to two. In July 2019, Trump received PM Imran Khan and spent almost four hours taking him on a tour of the White House, with a photo-op with Melania. Trump had hoped that after the recent G-7 meeting in Canada, PM Modi would accompany him to Washington. Modi ‘politely’ declined, rejecting yet again Trump’s contention that he brokered the Indo-Pak ceasefire in May.
Returning to Washington, Trump tweeted that he had brokered peace deals between the DPR of Congo and Rwanda; Serbia and Kosovo, Egypt and Ethiopia; and the Abraham Accords. But, he griped: “I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between India and Pakistan. I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran.” Being Caesar is obviously not laurel enough.
Within days of Trump’s lunch, Pakistan indulged his whim. Pakistan, in “obsequious bondage”, formally recommended Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his “strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship”. The Iranians would prefer to see Trump receive a different award — for Duplicity.

Israel’s actions have obviously emboldened India.

During the past fiery fortnight, while Iran and Israel lobbed missiles and drones at each other, Trump held out that he would decide Iran’s fate “within a fortnight”. He encouraged the UK, France and Germany plus the EU to negotiate with Iran in Geneva. No sooner had they retired for the weekend than, overnight on Sunday, Trump gave the order for a sneak attack on Iran. Seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers flew over supine Syria and impotent Iraq. They dropped 420,000 pounds of explosives on Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.
This mission — planned over months — was executed within hours, with multi-pronged precision. It involved 14 GBU-57 ‘bunker-buster’ bombs and two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from a US submarine. The attack on Fordow was not entirely successful. It had to be repeated by a second sortie of B-2s.
Trump exulted at his “spectacular military success”, warning of “far greater” attacks if Iran did not “make peace”. Benjamin Netanyahu heaped shovels of praise, congratulating America’s “awesome and righteous might … which will change history”. He continued: ‘‘President Trump and I often say, ‘Peace through strength’. First comes strength, then comes peace.“ Netanyahu’s strategy is to make Israel, with US backing, the preeminent power in the region and, at a personal level, to fortify his position within Israel. Trump’s intervention has made his dream a reality. The tail has finally wagged the dog. It bit.
Today, Iran — a Shia state headed by an 87-year-old cleric — stands alone, surrounded by a herd of Arabian sheep. Will Iran capitulate? Unlikely. For centuries since October 680 CE, Shias every Muharram recall the martyrdom of Imam Hussain and his stoic companions at Karbala. Iran’s leadership may well believe: ‘If you are prepared to die, nobody can kill you.’
On Tuesday, after an attack by Iran on the US’s Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar (artfully cho­­reographed with US connivance to minimise damage), Trump claimed he had arranged a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. They obeyed his intervention by violating the ceasefire. An irate Trump has been driven to spouting expletives.
Israel’s actions have obviously emboldened India. Its Home Minister Amit Shah declared again that India will never restore the Indus Waters Treaty: “We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.” Pakistan seeks negotiations, but has warned India continued suspension or abrogation of the IWT constitutes a casus belli. Would a war result in a dependable supply of water? Or is PM Modi’s plan to convert Pakistan into a modern Karbala?
When threats replace diplomacy, nations like Pakistan and Iran are vulnerable victims of the vaunting ambition of others. Trump’s maverick decisions, Netanyahu’s gory genocide, Modi’s aversion to negotiations, and the Dr Strangelove advice of US hawks to Trump that he should “reluctantly blow Iran to smithereens” remind one of Friedrich Schiller’s maxim: “Against stupidity, even the gods fight in vain.”

While neither side achieved a knockout blow, Iran has emerged with its leadership intact and its regional prestige enhanced.
Unsurprisingly, Tehran’s strategists are reportedly plotting the resumption of nuclear enrichment. How exactly they will evade fresh sanctions, or even avoid another episode of aggression, remains unclear. But the resolve is unmistakable.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi hinted at a shift in Tehran’s approach, telling Qatar’s Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Iran’s posture on its nuclear programme and the global non-proliferation framework “will witness changes.”

Despite loss of senior generals and top nuclear scientists on day one, Iran’s command structure has largely survived, and the regime that Israel and the West wanted out remains in place

In tandem, Iran’s parliament moved aggressively by passing a bill on Wednesday to suspend cooperation with the IAEA and sending it to the Guardian Council for final approval.
From Iran’s perspective, the outcome is a “lasting symbol of pride, strength and self-belief,” says Iranian envoy to Pakistan Amb Reza Amiri Moghadam.
Lt Gen (retd) Masood Aslam, a former corps commander in the Pakistan Army, agrees that this “was [the] best possible end Iran could have achieved”.
Israel, backed by US intelligence and followed by American bunker-buster raids on Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan, aimed to destroy the nuclear infrastructure and decapitate Iran’s scientific-military elite and topple the regime.
 
 

How successful was Tel Aviv? Satellite imagery indicates that the strikes would cause at the most only months-long delays to enrichment, not the permanent halt that Israeli PM Netanyahu and President Trump had promised, or were hoping for.
And despite the loss of senior generals and top nuclear scientists on day one, Iran’s command structure has largely survived, and the regime that Israel and the West wanted out remains in place.
Iran didn’t just absorb the shock; its ballistic and hypersonic missile brigades retaliated in over forty waves.
Trump, speaking at margins of the Nato summit in The Hague, admitted, “Israel was hit really hard… those ballistic missiles took out a lot of buildings.”
In a separate estimation by former Haaretz editor Avi Scharf, “the US launched a year’s worth of interceptors in twelve days,” and Israel’s own aerial defence inventories were “approaching their limit”.
While the aggravating situation in Israel and the strike on the Al-Udeid military base in Qatar formed the backdrop of Trump’s announcement of a unilateral cease-fire, he was also facing mounting domestic pressure over starting a fresh war without Congressional approval.
Israel, with no choice, followed suit. Meanwhile, Iran, having earlier said that it was retaliating solely in self-defence, simply stood down.
The road ahead
Though the ceasefire is holding, this peace is fragile. The Iranian parliament has already taken a step towards revival of Iran’s “peaceful” enrichment program, suspended IAEA inspections, and whispered about speeding up secrecy-shrouded enrichment. Talk of exiting the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is also getting louder.
Contradictions are also emerging in the global nuclear watchdog’s reading of the situation.
On one hand, IAEA found no off-site radiation spike, but its chief’s testimony said that “very significant damage” likely occurred and is insisting on inspections. This also casts doubt on any purely benign outlook. Tehran’s next step could spark a regional arms race as Saudi Arabia and Turkey too could scramble for their own deterrents, especially because they would no more be fully trusting US.
Israel, wary of prospects of a reintegrated but nuclear-shy Iran, may resume covert operations, or even resort to strikes to block enrichment.
Iranian strategists, buoyed by their perceived success, could also intensify missile tests and rehabilitate groups like Hezbollah and the Houthis, whose capabilities had been downgraded because of Israeli and US kinetic actions.
All the while, Washington’s roller-coaster of rhetoric, strikes and sudden withdrawals has undercut its credibility as mediator, making uncoordinated, unilateral moves by regional players all too likely.
Lessons for South Asia
Though the battlefield here was the Middle East, the war’s lessons have rippled to South Asia. In New Delhi and Islamabad, planners must be studying the campaign’s multi-domain playbook — air strikes, cyber operations, precision missiles and strategic ambiguity — building on their clash from earlier this year, which followed a similar template, albeit at a lower scale.
India, which sided with Israel politically, would be dissecting deep-strike tactics; whereas Pakistan, which was instinctively supportive of Iran, is admiring its resilience.
“What worked for Iran was the capacity to absorb shock and persevere,” Gen Aslam noted.
But mirroring Israel’s methods against a peer like Pakistan would be fraught with risks for India.
For its part, Pakistan must bolster its air defences, modernise its air force and navy for the next round of confrontation, which may not be too far away.
Christopher Clary, non-resident Fellow at the Stimson Center, believes “Pakistan’s air force and air defences are better than Iran (especially the air force) and India’s air forces and missile defences are weaker than Israel’s, but India may strive for the ability to reach deep into Pakistan and strike at air bases, missile storage sites, and missile staging areas.”
Gen Aslam also argues that India does not enjoy the same US backing as Israel gets.

Now, similar diplomatic efforts are needed to end Israel’s brutal slaughter in Gaza. For 12 days, ever since Israel attacked Iran, the world was glued to the battle, as any expansion in hostilities would have had seismic effects on the global geopolitical and economic order.
Yet, despite its aggression against Iran, the regime in Tel Aviv continued the bloodshed in Gaza without pause. Between late May and now, over 500 people have been killed in the occupied Palestinian territory, with many of the victims cruelly mowed down as they jostled for food in a Strip that is on the verge of starvation. As the spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights put it: “The Israeli military must stop shooting at people trying to get food.”
While speaking at the Nato summit in The Hague on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said there was “great progress” on a Gaza ceasefire. We must greet this pronouncement cautiously. After all, there have been several false hopes since Israel began its assault on Gaza after Oct 7, 2023, with all chances of peace dashed by the Zionist regime’s belligerence and barbarity. Under the cover of going after Hamas, which launched a blitzkrieg on Israel on Oct 7, Tel Aviv has unleashed a campaign of ethnic cleansing in Gaza to collectively punish the Palestinian people.
Israel’s Western supporters, who have shed crocodile tears for Iran’s people and the repression — real and imagined — they have suffered under their rulers, apparently feel that the Palestinians, who have undergone far worse under the Israeli genocide, are unworthy of sympathy. The hypocrisy is astounding.
On Tuesday, Mr Trump expressed his annoyance with Israel — using four-letter words — for violating the ceasefire with Iran. He must express similar outrage over what is transpiring in Gaza to his friends in Tel Aviv. As the Iran-Israel ceasefire has shown, when America puts its foot down, it is difficult for Israel to say no. The Iran truce, though welcome, was apparently fast-tracked because the global community was alarmed after the Iranians threatened the closure of the Strait of Hormuz following the US attack on their nuclear facilities.
World leaders’ primary fear was the devastating impact the blockade would have on the global economy. Yet while economic stability is sacrosanct to the global elite, starving and butchered Palestinian children do not raise much concern. This inhumanity must end now. Mr Trump and other Western states must prevail upon Israel to end the genocide in Gaza. And after a long-term ceasefire takes effect, those responsible in Tel Aviv for the crimes committed in the occupied territories must face justice.

A lieutenant, three staff sergeants and three sergeants, members of a combat engineering battalion, were killed when an explosive device planted on the armoured vehicle they were travelling in ignited a fire, the military said on Wednesday.
The latest deaths are likely to increase public pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and end the nearly two-year-long war, a move strongly opposed by hardline members of his right-wing ruling coalition.
Public support for Netanyahu collapsed after the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas rain on southern Israel from Gaza, which exposed Israel to its deadliest security failure. But his standing has been boosted by his surprise decision to strike Iran a campaign widely viewed as dealing a significant blow to Israel’s longtime adversary.

Six Palestinian aid seekers among 20 who lost their lives to Israeli fire

Attention has shifted back to Gaza following US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a truce between Israel and Iran that came into effect on Tuesday and continues to hold.
Moshe Gafne, a lawmaker from an ultra-Orthodox party within Netanyahu’s coalition government, on Wednesday publicly questioned why Israel was still locked in the war in Gaza. “This is a very sad day, with seven soldiers killed in Gaza … I still don’t understand why we are fighting there. To what end?” he told a parliamentary committee.
Hamas’ military wing confirmed that it had carried out the deadly attack in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, on Tuesday. It said its fighters had also fired an anti-tank missile at another vehicle that came to help.
The war in Gaza has isolated Israel from many of its international partners critical of the military campaign. During the 12 days Israel was fighting Iran, more than 800 Palestinians were killed in Gaza by the Israeli military, including at least 30, among them a journalist, on Wednesday, according to local health officials.
Israel kills 20 Palestinians
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 20 people on Wednesday, including six who were waiting to collect food aid in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
The latest in a string of deadly incidents near aid distribution sites came after the United Nations had condemned the “weaponisation of food” in the Gaza Strip, where a US- and Israeli-backed foundation has largely replaced established humanitarian organisations.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that six people were killed and 30 others wounded “following Israeli fire targeting thousands of civilians waiting for aid” in an area of central Gaza where Palestinians have gathered each night in the hope of collecting food rations. Bassal said the crowd was hit by Israeli “bullets and tank shells”.
Pressure grew Tuesday on the privately run aid group Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was brought into the Palestinian territory at the end of May to replace United Nations agencies.
The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, called the US- and Israeli-backed system an “abomination” that has put Palestinians’ lives at risk, while a spokesman for the UN human rights office condemned the “weaponisation of food” in the territory.

“I think great progress is being made on Gaza,” Trump told reporters ahead of a Nato summit in the Netherlands, adding that his special envoy Steve Witkoff had told him: “Gaza is very close.”
Key mediator Qatar announced on Tuesday that it would launch a new push for a ceasefire, with Hamas on Wednesday saying talks had stepped up.
“Our communications with the brother mediators in Egypt and Qatar have not stopped and have inten­sified in recent hours,” Hamas official Taher al-Nunu told AFP.
He cautioned, however, that the group had “not yet received any new proposals” to end the war.
The Israeli government declined to comment on any new ceasefire talks beyond saying that efforts to return Israeli prisoners in Gaza were ongoing “on the battlefield and via negotiations”.
Trump’s comments came a day after a US intelligence assessment revealed that US strikes had only set back Iran’s nuclear programme by just a few months. But on Wednesday, Trump compared the attacks to the end of World War II, arguing that the damage was severe even though available intelligence was inconclusive.
“The intelligence was … very inconclusive,” Trump told reporters while meeting with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte ahead of a summit in The Hague.
Trump said the US strikes were responsible for ending the war between Israel and Iran and compared them to the United States’ use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, which brought an end to World War Two in 1945.
“I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war,” Trump said.
Trump argued that Iran’s nuclear deal had been set back “basically decades, because I don’t think they’ll ever do it again” and he turned to top advisers to reinforce that message.
Teases nuclear talks
Trump also said the US would hold nuclear talks with Iran next week, teasing the possibility of a deal even after boasting that recent US strikes had crippled Tehran’s atomic programme.
Insisting on the “total obliteration” of Iran’s nuclear capabilities, contrary to leaked US intelligence, Trump said, “They’re not going to be building bombs for a long time,”
He added that the strikes had set back the programme by “decades” and that the ceasefire that he declared was going “very well”.
Trump later told reporters that Israel and Iran were “both tired, exhausted”, going on to say that talks were planned with Iran “next week”.
“We may sign an agreement. I don’t know,” he added.
Iran’s death toll
The spokesperson for Iran’s Health Ministry has released an updated death toll from Israel’s attacks on Iranian territory, Al Jazeera reported.
In a post on X, Hossein Kermanpour said at least 627 people were killed and 4,870 wounded in Israeli strikes.
Tehran recorded the highest number of casualties, followed by Kermanshah, with Khuzestan, Lorestan, and Isfahan reporting significant losses, he said.

• Files petition under Article 184(3) for visitation rights
• Justice Shah directs KP CM to approach CJP or apex court’s registrar
ISLAMABAD: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Wednesday entered a Supreme Court courtroom to draw the attention of senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah to his repeated denial of access to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, where he intended to consult the party leader on budget proposals.
Mr Gandapur was accompanied by senior counsel Sardar Latif Khosa and KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel as he appeared before a two-judge bench headed by Justice Shah.
However, Justice Shah told the chief minister that he had knocked on the wrong door and that he should approach the Supreme Court’s Registrar Office or Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, who is presently in Lahore.
During the proceedings, Advocate Khosa interrupted to raise what he termed an urgent matter regarding the KP budget session currently underway, stressing the need for an immediate meeting between the chief minister and the incarcerated PTI founder.
At this, Justice Shah explained that the CJP was the chairman of the Practice and Procedure Committee, which fixes cases before different benches.
Taking the rostrum himself, CM Gandapur highlighted the gravity of the situation by stating that the budget approval process was underway in the provincial assembly and therefore it was necessary to meet the party head since every party leader had a certain vision to be implemented.
He regretted that despite repeated requests, the meeting with PTI founder was not being arranged, adding that PTI’s budget committee intends to meet Imran Khan at the jail.
He recalled that Mr Khan had previously written a letter to the Supreme Court, attaching certain evidence, and that the then-CJP had responded positively. However, he lamented that no action was taken on the letter.
Advocate Khosa stated that “we only want the judge’s blessings that he should refer the matter to the CJP”. But Justice Shah reiterated that the senior counsel should approach the Registrar’s Office or the CJP directly.
Later, speaking to the media outside the court premises, Mr Gandapur regretted that democracy had ended in this court and that, with the passage of the 26th Amendment to the Constitution, the writ of the judiciary had also been eroded in the country.
He alleged that an attempt was being made to harm the PTI founder, stressing that lies were being disseminated through social media to earn money.
Petition filed
Mr Gandapur also filed a petition in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, seeking a declaration against the federal government, Punjab’s chief secretary and the Adiala Jail superintendent for denying regular meetings with Imran Khan. The petition argues that such denial violates Articles 9 and 10A of the Constitution, which guarantee the right to life and a fair trial.
The petition argues that the court should direct the respondents to ensure compliance with any court order regarding visitation rights, adding that Mr Gandapur’s role as the chief minister necessitates consultation with the founding chairman, especially for the Budget 2025-26, for effective governance and policymaking.
It said that the restriction on access undermined the democratic rights of PTI members and supporters, which it claimed represented over one-fourth of Pakistan’s population, adding that the failure of prior petitions in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the same subject underscored the urgency and necessity of the apex court’s intervention.
The petition explained that Imran Khan had expressed a desire to consult relevant senior officials of the KP government, including chief minister’s adviser Muzammil Aslam, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub and former KP finance minister Taimur Jhagra, to discuss critical matters before the provincial budget’s passage.
It noted that previous court orders, including those from the IHC, had permitted limited weekly meetings; however, the practical implementation by the jail superintendent remained inconsistent, necessitating notice from the Supreme Court.
The petition argued that several cases had been filed in the IHC seeking permission for the petitioner to meet Imran Khan, but these efforts have borne no fruit.
It added that the matter involved a question of public importance regarding the enforcement of fundamental rights, as the continued detention and restricted access to the PTI founder affected the democratic process and stability.
The petition contended that the KP chief minister, as a key political ally, seeks regular and unimpeded access to Imran Khan for consultation on matters of provincial governance, party policy and ongoing legal proceedings affecting PTI leadership.

• Federal cabinet likely to approve revised Finance Bill today
• Most contentious clause involves FBR’s expanded powers
• Nearly half of NA panel’s suggestions incorporated
• PM holds one-on-one meetings with MNAs to secure support for budget
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend contentious clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).
Former finance minister and PPP MNA Naveed Qamar, who currently chairs the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, met Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in a bid to build consensus on key provisions of the Finance Bill 2025.
With the clock ticking down to the National Assembly’s decisive vote on the Finance Bill on Thursday, tensions within the ruling coalition have intensified. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has meanwhile ramped up individual meetings with MNAs in the lead-up to the bill’s presentation in parliament.
According to a source in the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, the premier has been meeting five to six MNAs daily since the budget was presented — excluding days he is abroad.
Each meeting typically lasts around 10 minutes and is aimed at ensuring parliamentary attendance and addressing individual concerns. “This is an incentive for an MNA to meet the premier,” the source said, adding that, as a result, MNAs have also been attending the budget sessions in greater numbers.
Mr Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiani did not respond to messages or calls for comment.
Mr Qamar told Dawn that the final draft of the Finance Bill reflects the recommendations put forth by the standing committee. He stated that the finance committee must first approve these amendments before they are presented for final voting.
He acknowledged the PPP’s opposition to the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) proposed arrest powers for tax officials, saying the issue remained under discussion with the PML-N and would be addressed before the final vote.
Another source said the federal government is set to convene a cabinet meeting today to approve the revised Finance Bill. This marks the first time the government has incorporated nearly half of the standing committee’s recommendations into the final draft. The cabinet will endorse the revised version of the Finance Bill before presenting it to parliament for a vote.
The most contentious clause involves expanded powers for the FBR, particularly the authority to arrest and prosecute individuals in sales tax fraud cases. A compromise was reached following a proposal by PPP Senator Farooq H. Naek, with revised provisions now expected to be included in the final version.
Another controversial measure links the purchase of property and vehicles to a person’s declared income in their wealth statement. While the government has raised the threshold, the PPP argues the provision remains politically unpopular and may negatively impact the real estate sector.
A third sticking point concerns business registration under the sales tax regime. Initially, it was proposed that non-compliant businesses would face disconnection of utility services or closure. However, the government has since introduced a revised version of the proposal.
NA Finance Committee
In a departure from past practice, the chairmanship of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance now lies with a member of a coalition partner rather than the ruling party. More significantly, this is the first time the committee has conducted a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill.
Mr Qamar, the committee chairman, told Dawn this change was made possible through an amendment to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007 — introduced in September 2024 and moved by him.
The change, unanimously endorsed by the Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges, mandates that the Finance Bill be referred to the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue before passage, with a report due within 15 days.
As per past practice, the Finance Bill is laid before the Senate, where the chairman refers it to the Senate Committee on Finance and Revenue.
Meanwhile, the National Assembly typically passes the budget around 28 days later, following extensive debate and discussion. However, the Senate committee’s recommendations are non-binding and have largely gone unheeded during the passage of the final Finance Bill.
In contrast, recommendations from the National Assembly are mandatory, reflecting a growing empowerment of the lower house in the budget-making process. Currently, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance and Revenue is also a PPP senator, Saleem Mandviwalla.
As a result of this amendment, during the National Assembly’s budget session 2025, Mr Qamar presented the committee’s first detailed report on the Finance Bill, which aims to give effect to the federal government’s fiscal proposals for the year beginning July 1.
Mr Qamar described the development as a landmark achievement, marking the first time parliament has been empowered to engage in budget deliberations at a micro level.
He noted that committee members were consistently present and actively participated in detailed discussions on the Finance Bill. He added that the government had accepted most of the committee’s recommendations, despite being constrained by the IMF programme.
“This is no longer a rubber-stamp process,” Mr Qamar said, adding that the process had been shifted from the hands of the bureaucracy to the representatives of the people in parliament.

Explaining how he helped defuse tensions across the globe — from Ukr­­aine to Serbia — Trump said “the most impo­r­­tant” of these conflicts was last month’s war scare between India and Pakistan.
“And that was not whether or not they may someday have nukes, like we are talking about the Middle East, like we are talking about with Israel and Iran. This is — they have nuclear weapons,” President Trump said at his news conference in The Hague, at the conclusion of a Nato summit.
Referring to recent tensions between the two South Asian neighbours, Trump said, “I ended that with a series of phone calls on trade. I said, ‘Look, if you are going to be fighting each other…’ It was getting very bad — you know how bad that last attack was. It was very bad. If you are really going to go fighting with each other, we are not going to do any trade.’ They said, ‘No, no. No, you have to do a trade deal’.”
 
 

He described a conversation with Pakistan’s army chief and praised him in personal terms: “In fact, I had the general — he was really very impressive — the general from Pakistan was in my office last week. You know Prime Minister Modi is a great friend of mine. He is a great gentleman. He is a great man. And I got them to reason. I said, ‘We are not doing any trade deal if you are going to be fighting. And if you are going to be fighting each other, we are not doing any trade deal’.”
Trump concluded, “And you know what? They said, ‘No, I want to do a trade deal.’ And we stopped the nuclear war.”
The remarks highlighted the key role played by Field Marshal Munir in easing regional tensions.
Although Trump did not name the general directly in his public remarks, he had earlier described Munir as “an exceptional human being and an inspiring personality.”
These statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.
In broader comments during the Nato summit, Trump also said, “The Pakistanis know Iran very well, better than most. But they are not happy.” While brief, the comment underscored Washington’s view of Pakistan as a key regional player, especially as the US explores reopening talks with Tehran.
Trump indicated negotiations with Iran could resume “as early as next week.”

• Welcomes provincial funding for agricultural projects, terming them key to sectoral growth
• Instructs fast-tracking of second and third phases of Genco privatisation
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to revitalising the agriculture sector, urging relevant authorities to reduce tax burden on the sector. He also called for introducing sustainable reforms to boost the sector.
Describing the agriculture sector as the backbone of the national economy, the prime minister emphasised that the introduction of sustainable reforms in agriculture will not only boost the country’s economic development but also significantly enhance per-acre yield and reduce production costs.
Presiding over a high-level meeting on agricultural sector reforms, the prime minister directed the relevant authorities to gradually reduce taxes on agricultural machinery and tools in order to encourage farm mechanisation across the country. He also instructed to expedite efforts aimed at increasing the storage capacity for agricultural produce.
PM Shehbaz welcomed the provision of funds by the provincial governments for new agricultural projects, stating these initiatives would play a key role in accelerating sectoral growth. He expressed optimism that the agriculture students and scientists currently pursuing scholarships in China would contribute to the sector’s development as entrepreneurs upon their return.
He said no new taxes were being imposed on fertilisers or agricultural pesticides in the upcoming fiscal year, reaffirming the government’s commitment to support farmers and keep input costs manageable.
He noted that the development of the agriculture sector would directly benefit farmers and uplift rural communities across the country. He stressed that increasing agricultural productivity, modernising infrastructure, and facilitating access to affordable credit were all crucial pillars of the reform agenda.
During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on key recommendations focused on increasing agricultural output, improving infrastructure, and expanding farmers’ access to easy agri-loans.
The briefing highlighted the National Agriculture Innovation and Growth Action Plan, which aimed to raise farmers’ incomes, boost production, and steer reforms in the right direction. It was also shared that increasing exports of value-added agricultural products would further enhance farmers’ earnings. Under the National Technology Fund’s project Ignite, a total of 129 agricultural start-ups have been launched to date, aimed at fostering innovation and entrepreneurship in the sector.
The meeting was attended by Federal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, Minister for Climate Change Dr. Musadik Malik, PM’s Chief Coordinator Musharraf Zaidi, Chief Coordinator for Agriculture Sector Ahmad Umair, as well as private sector entrepreneurs and senior government officials.
Power sector reforms
Prime Minister Shehbaz also chaired a high-level meeting on power sector reforms in Islamabad today, where he emphasised that ensuring public relief and uninterrupted electricity supply to industries remain among the government’s top priorities.
He reviewed progress on reforms, including privatisation of loss-making generation companies (Gencos), installation of smart meters, and promotion of renewable energy and electric vehicles.
The PM directed authorities to expedite the second and third phases of the privatisation of loss-making Gencos and to broadcast the process live to ensure transparency. He also called for rapid completion of smart meter installations and urged swift execution of proposed projects to improve the electricity transmission and distribution system.
 
 

He announced that the federal government has successfully completed the solarisation of tube wells in Balochistan, which is expected to enhance agricultural productivity in the province. He also ordered acceleration of the privatisation process of electricity distribution companies and the nationwide establishment of electric vehicle charging stations.
The prime minister noted that, by the grace of God, electricity tariffs were kept stable for consumers during the recent winter. He further stated that completing low-cost and eco-friendly renewable energy projects remains a top priority to provide sustainable relief to the public.
The meeting was briefed that the first phase of Gencos privatisation has been completed, generating Rs9.05 billion in revenue. Negotiations with 36 Independent Power Producers (IPPs) on tariff reductions are expected to save the national treasury Rs3.69 trillion.

Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shuja lauded the budget as “people-friendly” and dismissed all objections from the opposition.
The session, presided over by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, began with a three-hour and 33-minute delay.
The opposition continued their vocal protests, prompting the Speaker to humorously inquire if they were chanting against “Modi” or “Yahoodi” (Jews), which drew laughter from the treasury benches.
Summing up the five-day budget debate, the minister emphasised that it was a “progressive and balanced budget” aligning with public aspirations. He highlighted a significant increase in the development budget to Rs1,240bn for the current fiscal year, compared to Rs840bn previously. He also noted substantial reductions in non-development expenditures and the circular debt.
 
 

Opposition members led by Malik Ahmed Bhachar, however, raised concerns about rising crime rates, particularly against women, and criticised the government’s agricultural policies, despite the finance minister’s assurances of farmer-friendly initiatives and substantial allocations for the sector.
Demands for grants to the police, health services, education, and Public Health Engineering departments were approved by a majority vote, while the opposition’s cut motions were rejected.
The session was adjourned until Thursday (today) at 11am.

“It is divine justice that the man who wanted to sideline PML-N head Nawaz Sharif has himself been abandoned by his party,” the minister said in a statement here on Wednesday.
A day earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan told media persons that it seemed that “minus-Imran” formula was now in effect. She was referring to the passing of provincial budget by the Khyber Pakht­unkhwa government without the approval of the PTI founder who has been in jail for nearly two years in multiple cases.
“Aleema Khan has been continuously conspiring against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, and today, Ali Amin himself openly acknowledged these conspiracies against him,” Ms Bokhari said and added that had Gandapur failed to get the provincial budget passed as the province’s chief executive, he would have been constitutionally-bound to resign.
The minister said the group backed by Aleema Khan, along with PTI’s social media wing, was actively running a campaign against Gandapur.
“The PTI at the federal level is divided into three factions, while in KP, three different groups [of the party] are operating. One group is led by Junaid Akbar, second by Atif Khan, and the third one consists of members who have already rebelled against the party,” she claimed.
PTI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf says the ‘imposed’, ‘incompetent’ regime and those who brought them to power have tried everything, but failed and will continue to fail in their attempts to minus Imran.
Responding to information minister Azma Bukhari’s statement, PTI Punjab media cell head Shayan Bashir said Ms Bukhari and her masters have already been permanently eliminated from Pakistan’s political landscape.
He said the defeated puppets, on the orders of their masters, were trying to create divisions within the PTI through propaganda to ensure their own survival.
“Instead of spreading rumours and using foul language, these foul-mouthed handmaidens of the mandate thieves should answer for the billions in irregularities and corruption in Punjab,” Mr Bashir asked.

The bust, executed under the code name ‘Operation Yalghar’, has led to the arrest of six suspected RAW facilitators in Toba Tek Singh district.
Sources say the law enforcement agencies acted quickly when they detected audio calls of two individuals identified as Major Rawindra Rathor and Inspector Singh — both officers of RAW — to their local handlers.
The recordings reveal that the RAW officers were issuing instructions to the local handlers how to do recce of some sensitive installations and carry out an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blast at a mosque to cause large-scale casualties and other damage.

Suspects were to carry out blasts at a mosque, Bahawalpur Railway Station

They were also being assigned some other tasks from RAW officers, including targeted killings, picking up IEDs from a Indian Border Security Force (BSF) gate, planting the explosives at the Bahwalpur Railway Station, besides passing instructions to them regarding border crossing.
In the audio recordings (also available with Dawn), they also discussed a deal to make payments with the local facilitators against each Indian-sponsored task they were to complete, and the mode of payment through their Dubai-based agents.
Meanwhile, senior police officers held a press conference here at the Central Police Office, saying they seized a cache of sensitive material, including maps of strategic locations in Pakistan, detonators and high-grade explosives.
Punjab Additional IG (Operations) Shahzada Sultan says that was not an isolated operation as in a parallel development the Bahawalpur CTD apprehended more suspects allegedly linked to the same RAW-sponsored network.
He said a Raw-sponsored Dubai-based payment facilitator, Zulfiqar, a resident of Dera Ghazi Khan, was apprehended from Bahawalpur, besides Azam alias Jajji and Manzoor alias Qari, both residents of Bahawalpur and one Amjad of Pakpattan.
These individuals, according to the CTD officials, received financial support routed through Dubai and consignments of IEDs directly from India’s BSF.
“The suspects were actively plotting attacks on a mosque and a local [Bahawalpur] railway station,” Mr Sultan said. “Had they succeeded, the consequences would have been catastrophic.”
The police officer said that perhaps most alarming was the intelligence haul accompanying these arrests.
“Forensic examination of the digital communications intercepted by the CTD has unearthed audio recordings of two individuals identified as Major Rawindra Rathor and Inspector Singh, alleged officers within RAW, who were giving direct operational instructions to the apprehended men,” he said.
 
 

In the recordings, the two RAW officers can be heard directing the execution of attacks on “sensitive installations” across Pakistan.
The police officers termed the development very significant as Pakistani authorities have not only named, but also provided “direct evidence” of Indian intelligence operatives orchestrating subversive activities on Pakistani soil.
In a statement issued late on Wednesday, the CTD vowed to safeguard the national security.
“We will not compromise on the sovereignty of Pakistan,” the agency said. “Anyone involved in aiding any foreign attempt to destabilise our country will be brought to justice.”
This crackdown reinforces Islamabad’s long-standing claims of external interference, particularly by New Delhi, in its internal security affairs.
The CTD says the proxy networks, their clandestine facilitators and hybrid warfare are fast becoming the new norm in South Asia’s security theatre.
 
 

This episode is likely to further deteriorate the already tense relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and will certainly feature in the diplomatic back channels between the two countries, if not escalating into open recriminations on global forums, says the agency.

The telescope, which can see farther into the universe than anything before it, has turbocharged the search for planets beyond the Solar System since coming online in 2022.
Until now, however, its deep gaze has mostly been used to probe already known exoplanets, to find out key information such as the atmospheric composition, rather than tracking down new worlds.
The discovery of exoplanet TWA 7b, revealed in a study in the journal Nature, “represents a first for the telescope”, France’s CNRS research centre said in a statement.
The large majority of the nearly 6,000 exoplanets found so far have been identified from the light they blot out when they pass in front of their star, rather than from direct images of the planet.
Webb “has spent an enormous amount of time observing planets that have never been directly imaged”, lead study author Anne-Marie Lagrange of the Paris Observatory told AFP.
‘Blinded by the light’
Capturing direct images of faraway planets is difficult because they are “very faint” due to a lack of heat, Lagrange said. Even worse, she added, “We’re blinded by the light of the star they orbit.”
But Webb has a way to get around the problem.
An attachment to Webb’s MIRI instrument called a coronagraph masks the star, creating an effect similar to a solar eclipse. The telescope’s infrared vision can then peer through and spot the planet.
Astronomers pointed Webb at the star TWA 7, which is around a hundred light years from Earth, relatively nearby in the universe.
The star, which was first spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, was thought to be a promising target for two reasons.
It is just 6.4 million years old — a baby compared to the Sun’s 4.5 billion years — and still surrounded by a massive disc of gas and dust where planets are thought to form.
And from the direction of Earth, the disc is seen from above, giving a good view of its rings.
The three rings around the star, which stretch more than 100 times the distance separating the Sun and Earth, had previously been spotted by the Very Large Telescope in Chile.
But inside an otherwise empty section of the second ring, the Webb telescope detected something particularly bright. Astronomers ruled out that the light was coming from an object at the edge of the Solar System, or from a distant galaxy behind the star.
That could mean only that the light source was a relatively small and cold planet, with a mass at least 10 times lighter than any other exoplanet directly imaged so far, according to the study.
The hunt for smaller worlds
The researchers estimated that the planet’s mass was similar to that of Saturn, a gas giant that weighs only a third of Jupiter, the biggest planet in the Solar System.
Webb has increased the ability to detect exoplanets via direct images by a factor of 10, Lagrange said.
That is important because smaller, rocky planets similar to Earth or Mars are the ultimate target in the search for habitable worlds outside of the Solar System.
Lagrange said she would be delighted to discover “Earth-like planets” one day.
But she said astronomers needed to study all kinds of planets — and to understand how planetary systems form — to know whether the life-hosting Solar System is unique.
In the future, astronomers expect the Webb telescope will be able to spot planets even smaller than TWA 7b.
But directly capturing images of faraway worlds similar to Earth will require even more telescopic power, such as from the Extremely Large Telescope that is scheduled to come online in Chile in 2028.</p><small>2025-06-25 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610914-pakistan-uae-ink-agreement-on-visa-exemption-for-diplomatic-passports-joint-investment-body' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE ink agreement on visa exemption for diplomatic passports</strong></a><br><p>

Nepra Spokesperson Safeer Hussain confirmed the development to Dawn.com and said the proposal had been sent to the federal government.
 
 

Last month, against high hopes, the government sought revision in the base electricity tariff for the next fiscal year, proposing only 30 paise to a maximum of Rs2.25 per unit reduction in consumer rates under seven different scenarios.
Only in one unlikely case of normal circumstances and a stable exchange rate at Rs280, the average base tariff would reduce by Rs2.25 per unit in fiscal year 2025-26 to Rs24.75 from the prevailing rate of about Rs27 per unit.
In case of local currency depreciation to Rs300, the base tariff reduction would be around 30 paise per unit. The reduction mainly stems from lower capacity payments.
The average Power Purchase Price (PPP) would be on top of about Rs8.16 to Rs9.52 per unit fuel cost, taking the total electricity price to range between Rs34 and Rs35 per unit, excluding taxes, fees, duties and surcharges.
Electricity demand is projected to grow between three and five per cent in all cases, but only if the exchange rate remains stable at Rs280. The exchange rate has been assumed to be Rs300 in all six other cases. In addition, US inflation has been taken at 2pc, Pakistan inflation at 8.65pc, besides 11.9pc Karachi Interbank Offe­red Rate, 4.07pc international interest rate, and transmission losses at 2.80pc.
The Nepra determination would be taken to the federal cabinet for approval and subsidy allocation, and the power division would file a follow-up tariff table to Nepra for subsidy punching for various consumer categories and slabs be­­fore formal notification with effect from July 1 as already committed to the International Monetary Fund.</p><small>2025-06-25 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610916-impressive-great-man-trump-heaps-praise-on-field-marshal-munir-again' target='_blank'><strong>'Impressive, great man': Trump heaps praise on Field Marshal Munir, again</strong></a><br><p>

According to the newspaper, 31-year-old construction worker Vladimir Vitkov was arrested and confessed to “trying to murder” the child, who had arrived in Russia with his family after fleeing Iran due to its 12-day war with Israel.
“Yazdan, aged 18 months, is now fighting for his life with serious skull fractures and spinal injuries,” The Mirror read, adding that Vitkov was on board the same flight as the child and his mother.
Both The Mirror and British newspaper The Daily Mail reported that the boy suffered skull fractures and spinal injuries, with the latter reporting that the boy was “in a coma”.
Graphic CCTV showed Vitkov picking up the boy before “hurling him to the ground of Moscow airport’s arrivals hall”.
“The attacker — described as a ‘monster’ by a Russian official — apparently checks to see if anyone is watching and then suddenly grabs the child, throwing him hard on the floor in the arrivals section of Sheremetyevo airport,” The Mail reported.
According to The Mail, Vitkov reportedly flew to Moscow from Cyprus or Egypt and was rapidly taken into custody after the incident, amid suspicions he was under the influence of drugs.
The Mirror reported that Vitkov had been fired from a nuclear power plant construction job in Egypt after failing a spot check for drugs and alcohol and was returning home via Moscow, citing a friend of the suspect’s.
“He (Vitkov) ‘confessed’ when a police interrogator asked: ‘Explain what you did’,” The Mirror reported. Vitkov responded with, “I attempted to murder a child.”
The Mail reported that police are examining whether there was a racist or other motivation for the act against the child. However, The Mirror said that when his motive was questioned, he replied that he did not know because he was “under the influence of drugs”.
“Reports said cannabis had been found in his possession, and there were traces of the drug in his blood. Mash news outlet reported today that he had drunk three bottles of whisky and obtained cannabis in Cairo before the incident,” The Mirror reported.
Moscow region children’s ombudswoman Ksenia Mishonova was quoted as saying, “A drug-addled monster grabbed a toddler in the arrivals hall and threw him on the floor with all his might. All this is incredibly difficult to bear.
“I hope the detained monster will receive the full severity of the law. I wish the child a speedy recovery. May the parents have the strength to survive this.”
The Mirror quoted the ombudswoman as saying she hopes Vitkov receives “hard labour until he is feeble with old age”.
“I am always very, very careful, but here I no longer have the strength not to say simply [this was] a stoned drug addict, a monster,” she said after seeing the boy in hospital.“
The Iranian Ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, condemned the incident as “completely inhuman”, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency.
“A video has been circulated showing a child being brutally slammed to the ground. Some have claimed the attacker is Jewish, but I cannot confirm that,” Jalali told Tasnim.
The ambassador added that Tehran immediately contacted Russian authorities to confirm the victim’s nationality.
“It was initially reported that the child was Iranian,” Jalali said. “Russian Foreign Ministry colleagues told us that the file is officially listed under Afghanistan. The innocent child, currently in a coma, is apparently from an Afghan family.”</p><small>2025-06-25 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/251846353d49eff.jpg?r=184907' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920059/pakistan-uae-sign-mou-on-visa-exemption-at-12th-jmc-session-held-after-13-year-gap' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE sign MOU on visa exemption at 12th JMC session held after 13-year gap</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on mutual visa exemption during the 12th session of the Pakistan-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), the Foreign Office (FO) said on Wednesday.
The session was held following a hiatus of 13 years after it was scheduled in October 2024. The last session was held in Islamabad from November 6-7, 2013.
The FO said in a statement that the session, held in Abu Dhabi a day ago, was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.
“Prior to the formal proceedings, a working group meeting of the JMC was held under the leadership of Special Assistant to the PM Tariq Bajwa and Minister of State of the UAE Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, the statement said.
“The JMC reviewed the full scope of bilateral relations and agreed on concrete measures to strengthen cooperation in trade, banking, culture, investment, aviation, railways, energy, food security, climate change, defence, healthcare, manpower, higher education and information technology.”
 






It also said that both sides emphasised promoting institutional mechanisms and inter-ministerial coordination, and discussed regional and global developments.
“A protocol, outlining procedural frameworks for follow-up actions, coordination through sectoral working groups and facilitation for reciprocal visits, was also signed,” the statement added.
According to FO, “In addition to the protocol of the session, MoU on ‘Mutual Exemption of Entry Visa Requirements’ and ‘Establishment of a Joint Task Force to Promote Investments’ as well as an Agreement on ‘Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy’ were signed.”
In a post on X, Dar said that he signed an agreement with Al-Nahyan on “mutual visa exemption for the holders of diplomatic and official passports of our two countries”.
“This important step reflects our shared resolve to further strengthen our fraternal ties and deepen institutional collaboration across all levels,” he added.
 






The FO said that both sides expressed satisfaction with the outcomes and agreed to hold the 13th Session of the JMC in Pakistan on mutually agreed-upon dates.
“The successful convening of the JMC session underscores the deep-rooted and multifaceted relationship between Pakistan and the UAE and their shared vision for a dynamic and progressive partnership,” it added.
The UAE is Pakistan’s third-largest trading partner after China and the United States, is home to more than a million Pakistani expatriates and is the second-largest source of remittances after Saudi Arabia.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Tirmizi, had said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the UAE exceeded US$10.9 billion in the fiscal year 2023–24, including goods and services.
Earlier this month, PM Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his official one-day visit to the Gulf state, where he discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest.
The high-level engagement aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its recent standoff with New Delhi.</p><small>2025-06-25 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610901-undemocratic-behaviour-leads-to-exclusion-from-politics-sanaullah-on-minus-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>'Undemocratic behaviour leads to exclusion from politics', Sanaullah on minus-Imran</strong></a><br><p>

The negotiations are part of a broader push to reset economic ties at a time of shifting geopolitical alignments and Pakistan’s efforts to avoid steep US duties on exports.
“Both sides showed satisfaction on the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude the trade negotiations next week,” the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that a longer-term strategic and investment partnership is also under discussion.
“The discussion focused on meaningful engagement in trade, investment and deepening economic ties mutually beneficial to both sides, with technical-level trade-related discussions to be concluded next week,” it added.
Pakistan faces a 29 per cent tariff on exports to the US under President Donald Trump’s measures to target countries with large trade surpluses with the US. Pakistan’s surplus was around $3 bn in 2024.
To offset the imbalance and ease tariff pressures, Islamabad has offered to import more US goods, including crude oil, and to open up investment opportunities through concessions for US firms in Pakistan’s mining sector.
Earlier this week, the two countries co-hosted a webinar promoting investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector, including the $7bn Reko Diq copper-gold project.
Senior officials from both governments and US investors discussed public-private partnerships and regulatory reforms. The US Export-Import Bank is reviewing financing proposals worth $500 mn to $1 bn in Reko Diq.</p><small>2025-06-25 12:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610869-pakistan-rules-out-possibility-of-khawaja-asifs-meeting-with-indian-counterpart-at-sco-event' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rules out possibility of Khawaja Asif's meeting with Indian counterpart at SCO event</strong></a><br><p>
