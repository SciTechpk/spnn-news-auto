Weather authorities have issued their second-highest rainstorm warning for the capital Beijing, neighbouring Hebei and Tianjin, as well as 10 other provinces, state news agency Xinhua said.
The rains are expected to last into Wednesday, it added.
As of midnight Monday, the heavy rainstorms had left 30 people dead in Beijing, Xinhua said, citing the city’s municipal flood control headquarters.
More than 80,000 people have been evacuated in the Chinese capital alone, local state-run outlet Beijing Daily said on social media.
The death toll was highest in Miyun, a suburban district northeast of the city centre, it said.
“This time the rain was unusually heavy, it’s not normally like this,” a resident of Miyun, surnamed Jiang, told AFP as water streamed down the road outside her house.
“The road is full of water so people aren’t going to work,” she said.
At a village called Xinanzhuang visited by AFP journalists, murky water submerged homes, cars and a road leading onto a highway.
A local man in his sixties said that he had never seen water levels so high.

Record floods
Nearby, spillways gushed with torrents of water leading out of the Miyun Reservoir, which authorities said has reached its highest levels since its construction in 1959.
Huairou district in the north of the city and Fangshan in the southwest were also badly affected, state media said.
Dozens of roads have been closed and over 130 villages have lost electricity, Beijing Daily said.
“Please pay attention to weather forecasts and warnings and do not go to risk areas unless necessary,” the outlet said.
More than 10,000 people also evacuated their homes in the neighbouring port city of Tianjin, which saw major flash floods, according to state-owned nationalist tabloid Global Times.
And in Hebei, which encircles the capital, a landslide in a village near the city of Chengde killed eight people, with four still missing, state broadcaster CCTV reported Tuesday.
On social media, users shared anxious accounts of being unable to reach family members who lived in Chengde’s mountainous Xinglong county.
Mudslides and floods forced more than 8,000 people to evacuate, while rescuers were still attempting to reach some villages that had “lost contact”, China National Radio said Tuesday.
Local authorities have issued flash flood warnings through Tuesday evening, with Chengde and surrounding areas under the highest alert, Hebei’s radio and television station said.
‘All-out efforts’
Chinese President Xi Jinping urged authorities late Monday to plan for worst-case scenarios and rush the relocation of residents of flood-threatened areas.
Beijing Daily said local officials had “made all-out efforts to search and rescue missing persons… and made every effort to reduce casualties”.
The government has allocated 350 million yuan ($49 million) for disaster relief in nine regions hit by heavy rains, state broadcaster CCTV said Tuesday.
A separate 200 million yuan has been set aside for the capital, the broadcaster said.
In 2023, heavy rain killed more than 80 people across northern and northeastern China, including at least 29 people in Hebei where severe flooding destroyed homes and crops.
 
 

Some reports at the time suggested the province shouldered the burden of a government decision to divert the deluge away from Beijing.
Natural disasters are common across China, particularly in the summer when some regions experience heavy rain while others bake in searing heat.
China is the world’s biggest emitter of the greenhouse gases that scientists say drive climate change and contribute to making extreme weather more frequent and intense.
But it is also a global renewable energy powerhouse that aims to make its massive economy carbon-neutral by 2060.</p><small>2025-07-29 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/29135842c62c959.jpg?r=142450' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927385/palestinian-question-a-test-case-for-world-dar-tells-un-moot-on-two-state-solution' target='_blank'><strong>Palestinian question a ‘test case’ for world, Dar tells UN moot on two-state solution</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said the Israel-Palestine question was a “test case” for the United Nations and the world as he addressed a high-level conference on the two-state solution in New York.
Dar was addressing a rescheduled global conference on “The Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution” at the United Nations headquarters.
The three-day moot, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, comes amid renewed international efforts calling for an end to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza ongoing for over 660 days, with France announcing it will formally recognise the State of Palestine.
“The Palestinian question is a test case for the United Nations and the world. Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering and principled support for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to a viable, independent and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” Dar told the conference.
 






“It is high time for credible and enforceable international action,” he stressed, according to a transcript posted on X by Pakistan’s Permanent Mission to the UN.
Since October 7, 2023, Israel’s offensive against Gaza has killed more than 60,000 and injured 145,870 others, according to the health ministry in the besieged and bombarded territory.
“First, an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire across Gaza and all Occupied Palestinian Territories.
“Resolution 2735 must be implemented. We commend the efforts of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United States,” Dar said, referring to a UN Security Council resolution passed last year for a ceasefire in Gaza.
“Second, full and unimpeded humanitarian access, especially life-saving food and medicine. Humanitarian teams must be protected,” the deputy premier said, highlighting the need for reinforced political and financial support for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
“International accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Impunity must end,” Dar further said. The International Criminal Court (ICC) had issued arrest warrants last year for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas’s slain military chief Mohammed Deif.
 
 

Dar further noted: “Fifth, the reinvigoration of a genuine and irreversible political process to end the occupation and realise the two-state solution.”
The conference, with 123 countries and global organisations participating, aims to chart a concrete path towards the two-state solution through proposals developed by eight working groups, which have held extensive consultations with UN member states and civil society groups.
During his speech, Dar urged the conference to “ensure universal recognition of the State of Palestine and its full UN membership”, welcoming France’s decision in that regard.
The deputy premier highlighted: “Today, Gaza is a graveyard of international law and humanitarian principles.
“The death and destruction inflicted by Israel, including the killing of over 58,000 Palestinians — mostly women and children — is an unconscionable breach of international humanitarian law, UN resolutions and the binding measures of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).”
The ICJ, in a non-binding ruling, had ordered Israel in January 2024 to prevent acts of genocide against Palestinians, but had stopped short of ordering a ceasefire as requested by South Africa. In July that year, it also ruled that Israel’s decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory was “illegal” and needed to end as soon as possible.
At the moot, the deputy PM also called attention to Israel’s blocking of humanitarian aid to Gaza, which Tel Aviv eased on Sunday.
“The blockade of aid, deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, including refugee camps, hospitals and aid convoys, has crossed every red line of legality and humanity. This collective punishment must stop now!” Dar emphasised.
“For over 75 years, the Palestinian people have endured occupation, displacement and denial of their fundamental rights, including their inalienable right to self-determination. This prolonged injustice is not just a political failure, but a moral stain — and a persistent threat to international peace and security.”
 






Detailing Pakistan’s will to support Palestinians, Dar said: “Pakistan stands ready to extend dedicated technical assistance and capacity building support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters in key sectors such as public administration, health, education and service delivery, in coordination with the Palestinian leadership.
“Pakistan is prepared to contribute to the building of institutions, including through participation in the Arab-OIC Plan, and any international protection mechanism,” he added.
“Justice delayed is justice denied. But when justice is denied for generations, the consequences are even graver.
“The question of Palestine has impacted the entire region and beyond. We must give hope to the Palestinian people. The occupation must end, and end now.  It is time for freedom, self-determination and statehood, and Palestine’s full membership of the UN. That will be the best guarantee for lasting peace in the region,” the foreign minister asserted.
 
 

Speaking on the outcomes of the conference, Dar underscored the “centrality of the two-state solution as the only path to sustainable peace”. He called on the moot to demand Israel’s immediate withdrawal from Gaza and support its reconstruction as envisaged in Resolution 2735 and a plan by Arab countries.
“Four: reject and halt any attempts at the forced displacement or demographic manipulation. Five: Oppose illegal Israeli settlements and annexation, especially in the West Bank and East Jerusalem,” the foreign minister said, addressing the UN member states present.
The deputy premier also supported a proposal by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to “provide international protection for the Palestinian people through the deployment of an international protection mechanism”.
Dar meets with Palestinian PM
On the sidelines of the UN conference, Dar met with Palestinian PM Mohammad Mustafa and held a “detailed exchange on the grave situation in Gaza and Occupied Palestinian Territory”.
“I conveyed deep sorrow over the immense suffering endured by innocent Palestinians, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s full solidarity with them,” the deputy PM said on X.
 






He reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to lasting peace and the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders.
“We expressed hope that the conference would lead to concrete outcomes in support of the Palestinian cause and the realisation of the two-state solution,” Dar wrote.
Mustafa also addressed the conference, saying: “What is happening in Gaza is its latest and most brutal manifestation, and we are more than ever compelled to act.”
 






Dar, Kuwait FM discuss close collaboration at multilateral forums
Separately, Dar also held a meeting with Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya in New York and discussed close collaboration at multilateral forums.
Pakistan established diplomatic relations with Kuwait in October 1963. The two countries maintain strong brotherly relations rooted in shared religion and culture, with the oil-rich Gulf state hosting nearly 100,000 Pakistanis.
Dar met with the Kuwaiti minister on the sidelines of the international conference on the two-state solution.
The two leaders “discussed close collaboration at multilateral fora, including at the UN and OIC”, a statement by the Foreign Office said.
“The two leaders discussed ways to further strengthen Pakistan–Kuwait relations, with a focus on enhancing cooperation in trade, investment, energy, food security and defence.”
Both sides agreed to undertake high-level exchanges soon to deepen bilateral engagement, the FO added.
The two foreign ministers also expressed their “deep concern at continuing Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians and worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza”, stressing the urgent need for a just and lasting resolution.
 






Pakistan, Bangladesh reaffirm aim to boost ties
Dar also met with Bangladesh’s Foreign Adviser Md. Touhid Hossain on the sidelines of the conference, which the FO noted was their fourth meeting since October 2024.
“The two leaders reviewed bilateral ties, reaffirmed commitment to deepen political, economic and cultural cooperation, as well as boost connectivity and people-to-people exchanges,” the FO said on X.
“Both agreed to undertake high-level visits in the near future,” it said, adding that the two diplomats also expressed their concern over the “grave humanitarian crisis and ongoing Israeli aggression” in Gaza.

According to a notification issued in this regard, this year’s celebration theme will be “Marka-i-Haq”, referring to Pakistan’s military response to Indian aggression during May, including Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.
The two countries entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
The list of museums includes several government-owned sites, including Quaid-i-Azam House Museum in Karachi, Sindh Provincial Museum in Hyderabad, Folk and Craft Museum in Sehwan Sharif, Banbhore Museum near Thatta, Kotdiji Museum in Khairpur, and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Museum in Larkana.
Other places include Mohenjo Daro, Mukhi House in Hyderabad, Umarkot Fort Museum, Naukot Fort in Tharparkar, Laar Museum in Badin, Marvi Cultural Centre Bhalwa, Miskeen Jahan Khan Khoso and Bhit Shah Cultural Centre.
“Access to archaeological and heritage sites will also be free,” the notification said, mentioning Shah Jahan Mosque in Thatta and Sateen jo Aastan.
 

Naukot fort is situated about 2.5 kilometres from the Naukot town in Sindh’s Tharparkar. — antiquities.sindhculture.gov.pk

The announcement further stated that a 50 per cent discount will be applied on all departmental publications, including books available at official book stores, along with free access to all tourist sites managed by the department.
Furthermore, access to the Archives Gallery at Karachi — featuring rare documents, manuscripts, and photographs — will be free, as well as art galleries including the city’s Sambara Art Gallery, and Hyderabad’s Zafar Kazmi Art Gallery and Mehran Arts Council Gallery.
“The department has also decided to organise grand musical events in Hyderabad, Sukkur, and Karachi’s National Stadium,” the notification added.
The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by Sindh Culture Minister Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah on the instructions of Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. The acting secretary, Archaeology and Antiquities Director General Abdul Fatah Shaikh, Sindh Tourism Development Corporation Managing Director Fayyaz Shah and other officers also attended the meeting.
“Famous singers in the country will showcase their talent in the musical event,” the statement said. “National flags and lights will be installed at all tourist, cultural and ancient places. This time, the entire nation will celebrate the festival of independence with enthusiasm.”
In January, Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah stressed the importance of promoting the province’s tourism potential through national and international platforms.
He directed the relevant departments to work collaboratively for the implementation of tourism projects, including comprehensive plans for Keenjhar Lake, Haleji Lake and Gorakh Hill Resort.</p><small>2025-07-29 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/29141108bc227b4.png?r=154117' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927377/gb-govt-promises-to-compensate-flood-affected-people-says-rehabilitation-work-underway' target='_blank'><strong>GB govt promises to compensate flood-affected people, says rehabilitation work underway</strong></a><br><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan government on Tuesday announced that it would compensate people affected by the recent rain-induced floods that damaged houses and other infrastructure, adding that the search for missing tourists has been intensified.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns, and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
On July 21, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. At least 10 people died and four were injured as a result. The Babusar Highway was partially reopened yesterday as the search for missing people continued.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said those affected by the floods will be compensated for their losses.
“The rehabilitation of the affected people is underway in Thak, Niyat village, Batogah, Thor, Kunar, Tangir district and Khanbari,” he said.
The spokesperson also added that the GB government has intensified the search operations for missing tourists on Babusar Highway.
“A joint search team comprising Diamer police, Rescue 1122, GB Scouts, and army personnel is carrying out the search operation,” Faraq said. “Local volunteers and communities are also participating in the efforts.”
He also recalled that the Babusar Highway had been restored for one-way traffic.
The spokesperson further said that the vehicle of a private TV channel anchorperson was found in the flood debris after she, her husband, and their four children reportedly went missing in Babusar Valley on Sunday during the floods.
“Steps are being taken to restore the water and electricity supply to the affected areas, and work is also underway to restore irrigation channels across the region,” Faraq said.
“Relief operations are also underway in Ghanche, Balan village in Astore Valley, Gilgit, Ghizer and other areas.”
People displaced by flash floods across multiple areas of Gilgit-Baltistan have complained of severe shortages of clean drinking water, electricity, road access and communication services.
Survivors in the flood-stricken Babusar and Thore valleys of Diamer said they had been hit by one of the deadliest floods in recent memory, which left many homeless and swept away their belongings.
In Gilgit, thousands of residents in Danyor and Sultanabad areas remained without drinking water for three consecutive days after a flash flood from Danyor Nallah damaged the main supply pipeline and several irrigation channels.</p><small>2025-07-29 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616307-dozens-of-quad-i-azam-university-students-arrested-for-refusing-to-vacate-hostel' target='_blank'><strong>Dozens of Quad-i-Azam University students arrested for 'refusing to vacate' hostel</strong></a><br><p>

Following peace talks in Malaysia on Monday, both sides agreed that an unconditional ceasefire would start at midnight to end fighting over a smattering of ancient temples in disputed zones along their 800-kilometre (500-mile) border.
On Tuesday, the Thai military said Cambodian troops “had launched armed attacks into several areas” in “a clear attempt to undermine mutual trust”, but said clashes later stopped.
Cambodia’s defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata insisted there had been “no armed clashes against each other in any regions”.
However, both sides said some morning meetings between rival military commanders along the border — scheduled as part of the pact — had gone ahead.
Cambodian leader Hun Manet and Thai acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai shook hands over the ceasefire deal on Monday at peace talks hosted by Malaysia and attended by delegates from the United States and China.
“I saw photos of the two leaders shaking hands,” said 32-year-old pharmacy worker Kittisak Sukwilai in the Thai city of Surin — 50 kilometres from the border.
“I just hope it’s not just a photo op with fake smiles — and that those hands aren’t actually preparing to stab each other in the back.”
In Cambodia’s Samraong city — 20 kilometres from the frontier — an AFP journalist said the sound of blasts stopped in the 30 minutes leading up to midnight, with the lull continuing until midday.
“The frontline has eased since the ceasefire at 12 midnight,” Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said in a Tuesday morning message on Facebook.
‘Good faith’
Jets, rockets and artillery killed at least 42 people since last Thursday and displaced more than 300,000 — prompting intervention from US President Donald Trump over the weekend.
The flare-up was the deadliest since violence raged sporadically from 2008-2011 over the territory, claimed by both because of a vague demarcation made by Cambodia’s French colonial administrators in 1907.
“When I heard the news I was so happy because I miss my home and my belongings that I left behind,” Phean Neth told AFP at a sprawling camp for Cambodian evacuees on a temple site away from the fighting.
“I am so happy that I can’t describe it,” said the 45-year-old.
A joint statement from both countries — as well as Malaysia — said the ceasefire was “a vital first step towards de-escalation and the restoration of peace and security”.
Both sides are courting Trump for trade deals to avert his threat of eye-watering tariffs, and the US State Department said its officials had been “on the ground” to shepherd peace talks.
“I have instructed my Trade Team to restart negotiations on Trade,” Trump said in a message on his Truth Social platform, taking credit for the ceasefire deal after it was announced.
 






“The US and I are still in negotiations,” Thailand’s Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira told reporters on Tuesday. “We’re still waiting for the US to decide whether to accept our proposal.”
‘Good faith’ needed
The statement said China also had “active participation” in the talks, hosted by Malaysian Prime Minister and ASEAN bloc chair Anwar Ibrahim in his country’s administrative capital, Putrajaya.
Hun Manet thanked Trump for his “decisive” support, while his Thai counterpart Phumtham said it should be “carried out in good faith by both sides”.
Each side had already agreed to a truce in principle while accusing the other of undermining peace efforts, trading allegations about the use of cluster bombs and targeting of hospitals.
Thailand says 14 of its soldiers and 15 civilians were killed, while Cambodia has confirmed only eight civilian and five military deaths.
More than 188,000 people have fled Thailand’s border regions, while around 140,000 have been driven from their homes in Cambodia.
Pakistan welcomes talks; hopes for a ‘peaceful resolution’
Pakistan welcomed the Malaysian-mediated peace talks between Thailand and Cambodia, stressing the need for “diplomacy and regional cooperation”, the Foreign Office said on Tuesday.
In a statement, the FO said, “Pakistan welcomes the successful conclusion of the special meeting hosted by Malaysia on the Cambodia-Thailand situation.”
“We appreciate the spirit of dialogue and express hope for a peaceful resolution through diplomacy and regional cooperation,” the FO added.

In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had denied Imran bail in the cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots, including an attack on the house of the Lahore corps commander. The incarcerated PTI leader’s plea challenging that was also rejected by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on June 24.
Subsequently, Imran moved the apex court last week against the LHC’s rejection of his bail pleas.
A two-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and including Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui took up those applications today.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared before the court on behalf of Imran, as his main counsel, Salman Safdar, could not attend the hearing due to being out of the country.
Raja informed the bench that Safdar has applied for an adjournment of the hearing till next week. He requested that notices be issued to the relevant parties in the matter and that the hearing be fixed for next week.
However, the bench rejected the requests and adjourned the hearing till August 12.
Imran’s appeal, filed through senior counsel Salman Safdar, claimed that the PTI founder has been accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9.
 
 

However, at the time of the alleged offence, Imran was in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau. Therefore, his involvement in violence was “impossible”, the petition argued.
It contended the PTI founder had been subjected to an “unprecedented campaign of political victimisation” since his ouster as prime minister two years ago.
On LHC’s rejection of the bail pleas, the fresh appeal claimed that the court relied on “engineered and fabricated evidence” which included “stale, discredited and delayed statements of police officials”.
In its detailed verdict, the two-member LHC bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Tariq Mahmood Bajwa observed that the prosecution had evidence that reflected Imran’s role in the violence that broke out on May 9 following his arrest.
 
 

The bench reproduced the statements of two police officials and prosecution witnesses, who claimed to have secretly attended PTI’s meetings wherein Imran allegedly gave instructions to other leaders to attack military installations in case of his imminent arrest from the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The meetings were allegedly held at a rest area of Chakri, Rawalpindi, on May 4 and at Imran’s Zaman Park residence in Lahore on May 7-9, 2023.
Following the ex-premier’s arrest on May 9, 2023 from the IHC premises, riots erupted across the country and went on for at least 24 hours, with military installations also coming under attack.
The state subsequently launched a crackdown against him and his party, filing many cases against Imran since the events of May 9. He has been acquitted in some of those cases, including the cipher and Iddat cases.</p><small>2025-07-29 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/29113207ea6d79b.jpg?r=113957' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927362/road-crash-kills-18-hindu-pilgrims-in-indias-jharkhand' target='_blank'><strong>Road crash kills 18 Hindu pilgrims in India’s Jharkhand</strong></a><br><p>At least 18 people were killed in eastern India on Tuesday after a bus ferrying Hindu pilgrims collided with a truck loaded with cooking gas cylinders, officials said.
Visuals from the site in Jharkhand state showed the mangled wreckage of the bus, with its rear portion almost entirely burnt.
Local lawmaker Nishikant Dubey said the pilgrims were travelling to a Hindu shrine to celebrate the sacred month of Shravan, coinciding with the onset of the monsoons in the subcontinent.
“18 devotees lost their lives due to a bus and truck accident,” Dubey said on social media.
 






The pilgrims were carrying holy water from the Ganges to offer to the Hindu god of destruction, Lord Shiva.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his “deepest condolences to the families of the devotees who lost their lives”.
“The road accident in Jharkhand’s Deoghar is extremely tragic,” his office said on social media.
 






Tens of thousands of people die in road accidents in India every year, according to official data.
More than 172,000 died in road crashes in 2023, Indian transport minister Nitin Gadkari told parliament.
Last November, a bus plunged into a deep Himalayan ravine in the northern state of Uttarakhand, killing at least 36 passengers and injuring several others.</p><small>2025-07-29 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927339/man-who-molested-girl-held-with-bullet-injury' target='_blank'><strong>Man who ‘molested’ girl held with bullet injury</strong></a><br><p>KASUR: City police claimed to have arrested an alleged robbery suspect who suffered a bullet injury to his private parts when his pistol went off during a “mob attack” at Dhanpat Road on Monday.
The police claimed that the suspect had concealed a pistol in his trousers that went off when he tried to take it out, when a mob attacked him after he was caught following a robbery.
However, sources say that the suspect, a labourer from Okara, was wanted by police for allegedly molesting a minor girl in a street of Shah Inayat Colony, some three days back.
The video of the molestation incident also surfaced on social media, following which A-Division police registered a case against the suspect under section 377 B of the PPC.
Police, on Monday, lodged a second criminal case against the suspect under sections 393 of the PPC and 13-2(a)- of The Punjab Amendment Ordinance 2015 on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Ashfaq Ahmed.

The main accused, Qari Umar and his son, Ihsanullah, were apprehended following a determined search operation launched by Swat police. The two had been on the run since the incident, which occurred on July 21 and sparked widespread outrage across the region.
According to the police, the child was brutally tortured to death at the madressah, allegedly by multiple individuals, including teachers.
The disturbing incident led to the immediate arrest of 10 suspects from the site. However, the principal accused managed to flee, prompting an intensive manhunt.
 
 

DPO Umar said the arrest of Qari Umar and his son was the result of “tireless efforts” by the Swat police. “Justice will be ensured, and all individuals involved in this heinous act will be brought to justice,” he stated.
The murder triggered strong public reaction, with citizens and rights activists demanding accountability and stricter oversight of unregistered seminaries in the region. Authorities have since reiterated their commitment to safeguarding children’s rights and preventing future abuse in religious institutions.

The 22-year-old is one of many Afghan volunteers rallying to help their compatriots, despite having little themselves.
Since the beginning of the year, more than 1.6 million Afghans, including many children, have returned after being deported or driven out of Iran, which accuses them of pushing up unemployment and crime.
“It doesn’t matter whether you have a lot of money or not. I don’t have much, but with the help of Afghans here and abroad, we manage,” said Rezaei.
The number of crossings at the Islam Qala border has reached 30,000 on several days, peaking at 50,000 on July 4, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
In response, residents of the western region have mobilised, partly thanks to donations sent by Afghans living in Europe or North America.
A journalist for a local television channel, Rezaei travels over 100 kilometres (62 miles) to reach the border from her hometown of Herat.
From a stack of cardboard boxes, she distributes baby wipes and sanitary towels to women gathered under a tent and surrounded by around a dozen children.
“It is our responsibility to stand by their side,” she said.
“The government tries to help, but it’s not enough.”
International organisations are helping to register migrants but face massive budget cuts.
Meanwhile, Taliban authorities struggle to support the influx of Afghans who have often left everything behind and returned to a country mired in poverty.
‘We have a duty’
Unemployed Hosna Salehi volunteers with her parents’ charitable organisation, Khan-e-Meher, to distribute aid, such as infant formula.
“Some women with young children tried to breastfeed but didn’t have enough milk due to stress,” she told AFP.
“Our fellow Afghans need our support right now. We have a duty to give what we can, no matter if it is a little or a lot.”
The show of solidarity “makes us proud”, said Ahmadullah Wassiq, director of Afghanistan’s High Commission for Refugees.
“The government cannot solve these problems alone,” he acknowledged, “and the efforts of citizens must be applauded”.
The Taliban government says it provides money upon arrival and is establishing towns dedicated to returning Afghans, though it does not specify when they will be ready.
In Herat, the nearest major city to the border, some in the most precarious circumstances have been living in parks in tents donated by residents.
‘Extended a hand’
Some said they were having to rebuild their lives after returning home.
“The only thing we’re worried about is finding work,” said Hussein, 33, who spent more than 10 years in Iran.
“There, they told us our papers were no longer valid. We had good jobs, now we need to find work and start from scratch,” said the father-of-two, who was moved by the support he encountered on the Afghan side of the border.
“They really helped us and extended a hand,” he said as he waited for a free bus to take him the nearly 1,000 kilometres to the capital Kabul.
In Afghanistan, where half the population of around 48 million lives below the poverty line according to the World Bank, “there isn’t much of a culture of volunteering”, said 27-year-old Omid Haqjoo, as he prepared food in vast cooking pots.
“But we are trying to promote it… to provide the support that is missing,” he added.
After a day of heat in the humanitarian tents at Islam Qala, Salehi felt strengthened by a “life lesson”.
“If I was able to help volunteer, I think everyone can,” she said.
“And when I go home and think of all the fellow Afghans who smiled at me and prayed for me, that’s enough for me.”</p><small>2025-07-29 05:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/6887fde46f812.gif?r=100926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927296/four-killed-eight-missing-as-heavy-rain-soaks-northern-china' target='_blank'><strong>Four killed, eight missing as heavy rain soaks northern China</strong></a><br><p>HONG KONG: Heavy rain intensified around Beijing and nearby provinces on Monday, with four people killed in a landslide in northern Hebei and eight people missing, as authorities warned of intensifying conditions and heightened disaster risks in the coming days.
Authorities relocated more than 4,400 people as colossal rain continued to pound the suburban area of Miyun in Beijing causing flash floods and landslides, impacting many villages, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Images circulated on China’s Wechat app showed areas of Miyun where cars and trucks were floating on a flooded road where water levels had risen so high that it had submerged part of a residential building. Electricity cuts are also affecting more than 10,000 people, in the area, CCTV said.
Northern China has seen record precipitation in recent years, exposing densely populated cities, including Beijing, to flood risks. Some scientists link the increased rainfall in China’s usually arid north to global warming.
China’s Central Meteorological Observatory said that heavy rainfall would continue to drench northern China over the next three days. Beijing issued its highest level flood alert on Monday, the official Xinhua news agency said.
The storms are part of the broader pattern of extreme weather across China due to the East Asian monsoon, which has caused disruptions in the world’s second-largest economy.
Xiwanzi Village in Shicheng Town, near Miyun Reservoir, was severely affected, CCTV said on Monday with an additional 100 villagers transferred to a primary school for shelter. It comes after the maximum flood peak flow into the Miyun reservoir reached a record high of 6550 cubic meters per second, Beijing authorities said.
In neighbouring Shanxi province, videos from state media showed roads inundated by strong gushing currents and submerged vegetation including crops and trees.
Shaanxi province, home to China’s historic city of Xian, also issued flash flood disaster risk warnings on Monday. In Beijing’s Pinggu District, two high-risk road sections have been sealed, authorities said.
Authorities are carrying out search and rescue work across cities including Datong, where a driver in a Ford car has lost contact while driving in the floods, the People’s Daily reported.
China’s Water Resources Ministry has issued targeted flood warnings to 11 provinces and regions, including Beijing and neighbouring Hebei, for floods from small and midsize rivers and mountain torrents.

The incident took place during Sunday-Monday night in the house of Bilawal Bhatti, who lives next to the residence of Sindh Minister for Energy and Planning Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, in Rizwan Colony of Rohri taluka in Sukkur district.
The robbers comfortably collected cash and valuables and fled the house leaving the businessman’s wife in trauma.
It was stated that the robbers had overpowered the couple and were busy collecting cash and valuables but when Mr Bhatti tried to put up resistance. The robbers turned aggressive and started beating up the couple. They then dragged Mr Bhatti to an open area on the rooftop and threw him down. 
The businessman suffered serious injuries and died a little later. 
Residents of the neighbourhood had come out of their houses upon hearing Mr Bhatti’s screams and rushed to his rescue but the robbers managed to flee the house. 
Mr Bhatti was taken to a nearby hospital but he succumbed to his injuries.
‘One of the robbers shot dead’
A strong contingent of police proceeded to the house to collect details of the incident. A police team was sent after the robbers.
The team claimed that the robbers were spotted in the Jaara Mah area and challenged. 
The suspects responded with firing which led to an encounter, the police said, adding that one of the suspects was shot dead but his associates managed to flee.
They identified the killed suspect as Hubdar Shaikh.
A TT pistol was seized from the dead suspect, they said.
Sukkur SSP Azhar Khan Mughal, meanwhile, formed a team comprising the DSPs of Rohri and Mundo Dero and in-charge of the local CIA office to launch a hunt for the fugitive suspects. 
The team conducted raids at suspected hideouts of the outlaws and picked up several persons for interrogation.
However, the robbers could not be arrested till late Monday evening.

The demand was made by HRCP leaders and other speakers at a programme held here on Monday. It also featured screening of a documentary on ‘The right to a living wage’.
The programme was part of a mobilisation campaign launched by the HRCP. It was attended by labour rights activists.
In their speeches, HRCP representatives termed the existing minimum wage ‘inadequate’ for a worker to make both ends meet. They stressed that it should be revised upwards to Rs75,000, arguing that a five-member family could hardly meet its monthly expenses of food, education and healthcare with a fewer amount.
HRCP’s Hyderabad coordinator Ghufrana Arain said that a notification fixing the minimum wage at Rs75,000 should be applicable to all sectors.
She said that inflation was increasing on a daily basis while salaried class was bearing the brunt of the conditions “being imposed under dictates of financial institutions”.

Leaders, activists demand effective enforcement of all labour laws

She lamented that the rulers had already increased their salaries and perks by 600pc but labourers were denied even the right to a living wage. Capitalists and elites were being granted huge incentives as well, she noted.
She said that lower cadre employees were told that their salaries could not be increased because of the conditions attached by international financial institutions.
Advocate Mir Ahmed Mangrio observed that federal government’s policies were aimed at undermining rights of provinces. He said that labourers from other provinces were hired by the private sector in Sindh while local people were denied employment opportunities. He added that price hike remained unchecked as government was least bothered about its impact on low-income group.
He said government was not interested in implementing the minimum wage notification. He said that Rs40,000 minimum wages were inadequate in the prevailing situation.
Kashif Bajeer, a development sector activist, said that children were still subjected to forced labour despite existence of laws that curb it. He said that forced labour issues were increasing but these laws were not being invoked. He said that over 60pc of labourers in the country were working under contract system. He stressed that labour rights could only be protected when their unions were strengthened.
Jamila Latif, a home-based workers’ union leader, said that women of this segment also needed a strong union, and called for the formation of such union without further delay.
She flayed that when she and her colleagues were forming a union for bangle workers, they were threatened by the contractors concerned. Still, this union was formed and was now struggling for women workers’ rights.
HRCP council member Saleem Jarwar said that all the laws that ensured labour rights must be given effect. He said that formation of a union was essential to protect these rights. Otherwise, he added, workers’ problems would remain unresolved.
Imdad Chandio, Pushpa Kumari, Boota Imtiaz and others were among the prominent activists who attended the programme.
Later, the participants held a demonstration calling for the acceptance of their demands.

A fifth victim was also in critical condition after being shot, while the gunman apparently took his own life, Mayor Eric Adams told a late-night briefing at a hospital near the scene of the shooting.
The gunman was caught on camera exiting a black BMW carrying an M-4 rifle, then entering the building, immediately opening fire on a police officer before “spraying the lobby” with bullets, police commissioner Jessica Tisch told the press conference.
 
 

He then took an elevator to the 33rd floor of Rudin Management, which owns the building, where the man continued his spree before apparently shooting himself. He was later discovered by officers next to his weapon.
The office tower block at 345 Park Avenue is also home to hedge fund giant Blackstone, auditor KPMG and the National Football League.
Tisch told the briefing that the suspect was believed to have acted alone, but inquiries were ongoing, with the FBI assisting in the investigation.
She identified the shooter as Shane Tamura of Las Vegas and said a revolver, ammunition and magazines were found in his vehicle along with medication bearing his name.
The man had a history of mental health issues, according to Las Vegas law enforcement — but did appear to possess a valid firearms permit for Nevada, Tisch said.
He drove cross-country from the southwestern state in recent days and arrived in New York on Monday, she said.
The incident began around 6pm (3am PKT) when reports of gunfire prompted hundreds of police to swarm a busy office district on the storied Park Avenue, an area popular with tourists and visiting businesspeople.
A worker from a nearby office building wept as she left the area after a local lockdown was lifted, while another described a gunman going floor to floor as staff prepared to leave for the day.
Adams said the fallen police officer, an immigrant from Bangladesh who was 36 years old, was among the dead.
Two other males and a female died, and another man remained in a critical condition, officials said without giving any preliminary motive for the shootings.
Rush hour
Office worker Shad Sakib told AFP that he was packing his things to leave work when a public address announcement warned him and his colleagues to shelter in place.
“Everyone was confused with like, ‘wait, what’s going on?’ And then someone finally realised that it’s online, that someone walked in with a machine gun,” said the witness who wore a grey suit jacket.
 
 

“He walked right into a building right next door. We saw the photo of him walking through the same area that I walked through to get lunch here.
“You would think it won’t happen to you, and then it does.” Mass shootings are common in the United States, where a constitutional right to bear arms outweighs demands for stricter rules.
There have been 254 mass shootings in the United States this year, including Monday’s incident in New York, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot.
Police officers deployed a drone near Park Avenue at the height of the evening rush hour as dozens of officers swarmed the area, some carrying long guns and others wearing ballistic vests.
The area is home to several five-star business hotels, as well as a number of corporate headquarters. The United Nations headquarters is nearby.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she has been briefed on the shooting.
The frontrunner in the race for mayor, Zohran Mamdani, wrote on X that he was “heartbroken to learn of the horrific shooting in midtown and I am holding the victims, their families, and the NYPD officer… in my thoughts.”

• French, Saudi FMs seek concrete road map
• Pakistan, Egypt, Turkiye call for immediate ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian aid
• Death toll nears 60,000-mark
WASHINGTON: As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday warned “nothing can justify the obliteration of Gaza that has unfolded before the eyes of the world”, calling for bold international action to end the war and rescue the long-stalled two-state solution.
Speaking at the United Nations International Conference on the Israeli-Pale­stinian conflict, held at UN Head­quarters in New York, Mr Guterres said the decades-old conflict had “reached a breaking point” and urged world leaders to halt what he described as the “systemic dismantling of peace efforts.”
“The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has endured for generations — defying hopes, defying diplomacy, defying countless resolutions, defying international law,” he said. “But we also know its persistence is not inevitable. It can be resolved. That demands political will and courageous leadership. And it demands truth. The truth is: we are at a breaking point. The two-state solution is farther than ever before.”
 
 

Mr Guterres deplored the “wholesale destruction” of Gaza and described Israel’s “creeping annexation” of the occupied West Bank as illegal. He condemned the killing of civilians, the starvation of children, settler violence, and the mass displacement of Palestinians.
“Unilateral actions that would forever undermine the two-state solution are unacceptable and they must stop,” the UN chief said, reaffirming the long-standing UN position that peace can only be achieved through the creation of two states — Israel and Palestine — living side by side within secure and recognized borders based on pre-1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the capital of both.
Co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, the high-level conference was convened following the adoption of a UN General Assembly resolution earlier this year.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who formally opened the event, echoed President Emmanuel Macron’s recent statement that France intends to officially recognize the State of Palestine in September. “We must move from the end of the war in Gaza to the end of the entire conflict, which threatens regional stability,” Mr Barrot said.
“Only the two-state solution will meet the legitimate aspirations of both peoples. There is no alternative.”
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, representing the Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, called on countries around the world to “recognize the state of Palestine without delay”.
“The path to peace starts with recognizing the state of Palestine and preserving it from destruction,” he said.
Concrete road map
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud urged participants to support a concrete road map towards Palestinian statehood that also ensures Israeli security.
“We must ensure that it does not become another exercise in well-meaning rhetoric,” Mr Guterres remarked. “It can and must serve as a decisive turning point — one that catalyzes irreversible progress towards ending the occupation and realizing our shared aspiration for a viable two-state solution.”
A concept note circulated ahead of the meeting by the French and Saudi governments stated that the two-state solution still enjoys “near-universal support” and remains “the only way to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians… and create the conditions for regional peace and stability”.
Immediate ceasefire
On the sidelines of the international conference on the two-state solution, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar met Egypt’s Foreign Minister Dr Badr Abdelatty as well as Adviser for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Touhid Hossain besides holding a telephonic discussion with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
In a joint statement issued in New York, Pakistan and Egypt reiterated their unwavering support for the Palestinian people and their just cause, underscored the urgent need for unimpaired humanitarian access, an immediate cessation of Israeli hostilities.
Death toll near 60,000
Meanwhile, the humanitarian toll continues to rise. Reports from Gaza said Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians waiting for food aid, killing at least 26 and injuring many more. More than 60 have reportedly died in attacks since dawn. At least 14 more, including a baby, died of malnutrition.
According to the Gaza health ministry, Israel’s ongoing military campaign has killed at least 59,921 Palestinians and wounded more than 144,000, besides since October 2023.

Large numbers of pilgrims, who arrived in Quetta on Sunday night in five passenger coaches, staged a protest demanding the government immediately lift the ban.
Demonstrators gathered at Shuhada Chowk on Alamdar road, home to most of the city’s Imambar­gahs, and blocked the main road.
The protesters, joined by leaders of the Balochistan Shia Conference, chanted slogans against the government. “We have reached Quetta to travel to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage which will start in the evening of Aug 14 and will continue till Aug 15, in Karbala,” said a pilgrim without giving his name.
We will go to Karbala and the ban on travelling through land routes is not accepted, protestors chanted.
They said the government’s alternative to travel by air is unaffordable for most people. “Air tickets are very expensive and such large numbers of people cannot afford travelling by-air,” a protester said.
A spokesman for the Balochistan government, Shahid Rind, confirmed the federal ban on road travel to Iran and Iraq, admitting that the provincial government was taken into confidence regarding the decision.

One passenger, Aurangzeb Pathan hailing from Quetta, was injured as he fell from the berth due to the the derailment of the three coaches of the Jaffar Express near Shikarpur.
Media reports, including the state-run APP news agency, cited officials as saying that the accident was caused by an explosion.
However, in a statement late on Monday evening, the railways ministry said locals living around the station perceived the sound of the derailing train as that of an explosion and panicked, assuming it an act of terror.
The ministry ruled out explosion as the cause of accident. It said an unfamiliar terrorist outfit “took advantage of the incident” and falsely labelled it as an “armed attack” and claimed responsibility. “This claim is not only baseless, but also tantamount to an example of opportunism and irrelevance.”
The train was heading from Peshawar to Quetta when it met with the accident on Monday, Divisional Superintendent Railways Sukkur Jamshaid Alam said.
As initial reports claimed an explosion, a number of senior officials, including the Shikarpur DC Shakeel Abro, SSP Shahzaib Chachar, railway authorities and bomb disposal unit arrived at the site and after a thorough sweep cleared the site.

The committee, headed by Senator Pervaiz Rashid, was briefed by NHA regarding the flood-affected portion of the Indus Highway, damaged during the Manchar Lake Floods of 2022. It was informed that the segment has been restored as two-lane road.
The committee’s members also referred to the recent Babusar Top incident, questioning why the NHA did not take preventive measures to stop tourists from entering the area despite being aware of the risks.
Members pointed out that on the Motorways, if a vehicle is found over-speeding, the driver is detained immediately, his family is left behind, and in some cases, rude behaviour is adopted by Motorway Police officials.

Torrential rains, flash floods recently claimed life of several tourists

“Why similar strict actions were not taken to stop tourists from heading towards hazardous areas like Babusar Top,” a committee member asked.
The committee directed that Motor­way Police officials should be instructed to avoid misconduct with the public. In response, the chairman of the committee recommended summoning the Inspector General of Motorway Police for a detailed briefing on the matter.
The meeting was attended by Senators Zamir Hussain Ghumro, Jam Saifullah Khan, Saifullah Abro, Dost Ali Jessar, Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan, Kamil Ali Agha, Abdul Wasay and other officials from Ministry of Communications and relevant departments.
Deputations in NHA
The committee sought a comprehensive list of 43 officials of (BS-16 & above) serving with the NHA on deputation with details such as names, designations, qualifications, parent departments, duration of deputation, and number of extensions granted.
The NHA chairman informed the committee that out of 20,900 employees, 43 were initially on deputation in the authority, but now the number has been reduced to 39.
A member of the committee termed the situation alarming and said that as per court directives, deputation should not exceed three years, but several officers in NHA have exceeded this limit.
Hyderabad-Sukkar Motorway
A comprehensive briefing was given to committee meeting on the current status of Hyderabad-Sukkar Motorway (M-6) by the NHA chairman.
The NHA chairman told the committee that Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) has indicated to give $475 million for two sections of M-6 (4 & 5) while sections 1 & 2 will be built under PPP mode.
CAREC project
The committee was apprised of the possibility of funds availability for the construction of the Sehwan Bypass under the CAREC Tranche-1 project.
The committee was informed that Sehwan Bypass could not be included in the ADB-funded CAREC Tranche-1 project, which was at the closing stage.
Meanwhile, the chairman of Senate standing committee on economic affairs, Saifullah Abro, called its meeting on Aug 1 for deliberations on the communications sector, with a particular focus on the CAREC-Tranche III project.
The committee questioned how all four lots of tranche-III were being given to the same joint venture of — NXCC, Rustam Associates and Dynamic Constructors.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Abro, who is also a member of the Senate committee on communications, said that serious concern was expressed over repeated absence of the secretary of communications from the meeting. He said the committee felt that secretary should have attended the meetings and briefed members on actions taken by the ministry so far on alleged irregularities in the biding process of CAREC-Tranche III project.
Mr Abro said that despite repeated directives, the NHA has failed to provide relevant documents to the committee that could prove innocence of the authority.

Trump has threatened both sanctions on Russia and buyers of its exports unless progress is made. “I’m going to make a new deadline of about … 10 or 12 days from today,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland.
“There’s no reason in waiting… We just don’t see any progress being made.”
Trump said he was disappointed in Putin and shortening the 50-day deadline he had set on the issue earlier this month. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin.

Threatens Russia, buyers of its exports with sanctions if progress not made within 12 days

Trump, who has expressed anno­yance also with Ukrainian Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky, has not always followed up on his tough talk about Putin with action, citing what he deems a good relationship that the two men have had previously.
On Monday, Trump indicated he was not interested in more talks with Putin. He said sanctions and tariffs would be used as penalties for Moscow if it did not meet Trump’s demands.
“There’s no reason to wait. If you know what the answer is going to be, why wait? And it would be sanctions and maybe tariffs, secondary tariffs,” Trump said.
“I don’t want to do that to Russia. I love the Russian people.”
Expressing disappointment in President Putin, Trump said, “I’m going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number because I think I already know the answer what’s going to happen.”
The US president has repeatedly voiced exasperation with Putin for continuing attacks on Ukraine despite US efforts to end the war. Trump has played up successes in other parts of the world where the United States has helped to broker peace agreements and has been flattered by some leaders who suggest he should be given the Nobel Peace Prize.
 
 

Before returning to the White House in January, Trump had promised to end the conflict “within 24 hours”.
“We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,” Trump said. “And I say that’s not the way to do it.”

• BJP govt claims success, opposition accuses it of hiding fact as Indian parliament debates Operation Sindoor
• New Delhi claims killing Kashmiri fighters under new ‘Operation Mahadev’
KARACHI: As the Indian parliament kicked off an animated discussion on Monday on the recent military standoff with Pakistan, a former home minister has challenged New Delhi’s narrative on the Pahalgam incident, questioning the claim that the attackers came from Pakistan.
The remarks from veteran Indian National Congress leader P Chidambaram came during an interview with The Quint, where he questioned the authorities handling of the April 22 attack and pointed out a lack of evidence to support New Delhi’s claim regarding Pakistan’s role.
“Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?” Times of India quoted him as saying.
He also questioned the role of the investigating agencies. “They are unwilling to disclose what the [National Investig­ation Agency] has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists or where they came from? For all we know, they could be homegrown terrorists. Why do you assume they came from Pakistan? There is no evidence of that,” The Statesman quoted Mr Chidambaram as saying during the interview.
According to Times of India, he also pointed out what he called the lack of a clear official information.
“We get snatches and bits of information from different officers. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) goes to Singapore and makes a statement that gives you bits of information. The deputy army chief makes a statement in Mumbai. In Indonesia, a junior officer of the Navy makes a statement. But why is the PM or the defence minister, or the foreign minister not making a comprehensive statement?” he said.
Asked what he believed the government was trying to hide, Mr Chidambaram responded, “I think, and this is speculation, I think they are hiding the fact that we made tactical mistakes (during Operation Sindoor), and we re-strategised… The CDS hinted at that. What tactical mistakes were made? What was the re-strategising? Either the BJP government is incompetent to answer these questions, or it is unwilling to do so.”
Mr Chidambaram further added, “They are also hiding the losses. I said it in a column that in a war, losses will occur on both sides. I understand that India would have suffered losses. Be upfront.”
The remarks prompted criticism from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which accused the Congress leader of defending Pakistan.
Union minister Pralhad Joshi accused Mr Chidambaram of giving a “clean chit to Pakistan”, while BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya alleged that Congress “always bend over backwards to protect the enemy”.
‘No pressure to end fighting’
In parliament, members from the treasury benches accused the Congress party of speaking the language of Pakistan and took exception to Mr Chidambaram’s remarks.
Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh began the discussion by skipping mention of any follow up on the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, and avoided answering a question about India losing warplanes to Pakistan by saying that the opposition was asking the wrong question.
“If a child gets good marks in the exam, the question whether he had broken a pencil or lost one was not correct.”
“We should not focus on whether (an examinee’s) pencil was broken or the pen was lost during the exam. Ultimately, the result matters, and the result is that our forces achieved fully the goals of Operation Sindoor.”
Mr Singh continued to make his claims though: “The opposition sometimes asks about planes shot down. Their question does not represent India’s sentiments. They have not yet asked how many Pakistani planes were shot down.
He also reiterated the Indian claim that Operation Sindoor was halted because India had fulfilled its political and military objectives. “To say it was done under any pressure is totally baseless and wrong,” he claimed, adding: “The aim was not to go to war but to compel the adversary to bend.”
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also claimed that President Donald Trump had played no role in bringing about the ceasefire. He said US Vice President J.D. Vance had spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and told him that Pakistan was preparing to launch a major attack, adding that PM Modi told him that the attack would be responded to appropriately.
‘Operation Mahadev’
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s state broadcaster warned that India has once again begun “fake encounters” under the guise of countering terrorism, with an alleged plan to “use” detained Pakistanis in them.
The statement came after the Indian Army’s Chinar Corps said they killed three alleged terrorists as part of the so-called ‘Operation Mahadev’ in occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar, Radio Pakistan reported.
While Indian media, citing sources, has been linking one of the dead to the Pahalgam attack, there has been no official word in this regard.
The Radio Pakistan report recalled statements made by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in press briefings held in April, where he had revealed details of 723 Pakistani nationals illegally detained in various Indian jails… [and] 56 Pakistanis are said to be held in secret custody by Indian intelligence agencies.

THIS screengrab shows Khalid Nisar Dogar (centre) striking Ehsaan Riaz during Monday’s proceedings.

• PTI’s Khalid Dogar suspended for slapping treasury MPA; Sheikh Imtiaz punished for ‘pointing out quorum’
• Opposition lawmakers ‘accosted’ by two unidentified men on assembly premises after addressing presser
• ECP disqualifies three PTI lawmakers following their conviction in May 9 cases
LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly on Monday desc­e­nded into chaos, mar­ked by physical altercations, walkouts by the opposition, and heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition lawmakers over alleged political victimisation as well as the arrest of PTI opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar following his conviction in a May 9 case.
The session was abruptly disrupted when oppo­sition member Kha­l­id Nisar Dogar slapped treasury MPA Ehsaan Riaz during a discussion bet­ween Deputy Opp­osition Leader Moin Qur­eshi and Acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar.
At this, Law Minister Sohaib Bherth, Ashiq Kirmani, and Moin Qureshi attempted to intervene. The scuffle reportedly began due to an exchange of harsh words between Mr Riaz and Mr Dogar, with provincial minister Zeeshan Rafiq also getting involved. The MPAs from both sides were seen slapping each other, leading to a “flurry of slaps”. The acting spea­ker adjou­rned the session for five minutes to de-escalate the situation, but it took more than an hour to finally resu­me proceedings.
Following the altercation, opposition members staged their first walkout and protested in the asse­mbly compound, chanting anti-government slogans and demanding the rele­ase of the PTI founder and the opposition leader.
‘Heated exchange of words’
Earlier, a heated exch­ange of words took place when opposition member Rana Shahbaz held a copy of the Holy Quran in his hand while speaking about alleged false cases filed against him. The speaker rebuked Mr Shahbaz for the act, as the PTI leader claimed he had been falsely implicated in terrorism cases registered at five police stations in three cities.
Law Minister Sohaib Bherth later expre­ssed reg­ret over the use of the Holy Quran in such a manner, urging the need for dialogue to resolve such issues.
The session also witnessed a fiery debate regarding the arrest of Oppos­ition Leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar.
Opposition members, including Tayyab Rashid, strongly condemned the arrest, calling it a violation of law and an attack on democracy, while claiming that the punishment was meted out for ‘exposing corruption’.
In response, Minister for Parlia­m­entary Affairs Mujtaba Shujaur Reh­man asserted that the opposition leader’s conviction was a court decision and not a political vendetta, as he alluded to the role of Mr Bhachar in the May 9 violence.
He also highlighted the government’s efforts to control inflation and accused the opposition of destabilising the country.
Ali Imtiaz Warraich from the opposition decried the labelling of political opponents, including those with health issues, as terrorists.
The atmosphere in the provincial assembly remained tense due to escalating political tension, with the op­­p­osition continuing its protest.
The ac­­ting speaker held two meetings with the senior members of the treasury and the opposition before resuming the proceedings after over an hour.
The chair suspended Mr Dogar for 15 sittings and later also Sheikh Imtiaz, who pointed out the quorum during the proceedings, as the opposition walked out of the house again.
The second walkout was prompted by the suspension of Mr Imtiaz.
Later, some MPAs came face to face again after two unknown persons clashed with opposition members as they were leaving the press hall after a press conference.
Following the clash, the two men also hurled abuses at opposition members. Assembly security staff arrived on time and separated the two sides.
It was alleged that the two unknown persons, who escaped after abusing the opposition MPAs, were the staff of some treasury members.
PTI MPA Ijaz Shafi said that as the deputy speaker has left, the issue would be raised before him tomorrow to ban the entry of the accused.
ECP disqualifies lawmakers
Separately, the Election Commis­sion of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday disqualified three PTI lawmakers, days after their convictions by anti-terrorism courts in Lahore and Sargodha.
Those disqualified and de-notified by the election watchdog included Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha, and MPA Ahmad Khan Bhachar, leader of the opposition in the Punjab Assembly.
Last week, the Lahore court had sentenced Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, while the Sargodha court had convicted MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha from Wazirabad and Punjab opposition leader Ahmad Khan from Mianwali.
All three were jailed for 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 violence and subsequently disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution.

Seven people were fired at after a demonstration outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz on Sunday against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — the state’s terminology for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Paki­stan (TTP).
However, sources and eyewitnesses said security personnel guarding the installation had reportedly opened fire to control the crowd after the demonstration took a violent turn.

Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen march against militant presence in restive valley

A number of those who lost their lives on Sunday were laid to rest in the Bagh Markaz and Peer Mela localities of Tirah.
Besides the seven deaths, at least 16 people sustained gunshot wounds. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.
“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant admi­n­istration,” Dawn.com quo­ted CM Gandapur’s adviser, Barri­ster Mohammad Ali Saif, as saying on Monday. He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself.
Local sources claimed that security officials had accepted the tribesmen’s demand for compensation to the families of the deceased and injured tribesmen. However, no FIR has been lodged.
Separately, the PTI has called for an immediate and impartial inquiry into the Tirah incident, and asked for those responsible to be held accountable.
In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that the use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians was not only unjustifiable but also a blatant violation of basic human rights and democratic principles.
TTP ‘withdrawal’ demanded
Meanwhile, the Bar Qambarkhel tribe in the restive Tirah valley temporarily suspended its week-long protest against the presence of militants in Tirah after representatives of the banned TTP reportedly asked for some time to hold talks with their leadership in Afgh­a­nistan on the demand for their withdrawal from the valley.
Sources told Dawn that the decision to suspend the sit-in was announced during a jirga in Lar Bagh, after ‘successful negotiations’ between the Bar Qambar­khel elders and TTP representatives in the region.
Sources said the jirga was told that militant commanders had sought time till Aug 5.
Earlier, Malak Zahir Shah had led a protest of hundreds of tribesmen, carrying the Holy Quran in their hands, and demanded the TTP men leave their area.
They staged a sit-in in Bhutan Shareef, saying they would only end their protest when given assurances that the militants would exit the area.

Khawaja on Monday moved a request to initiate contempt of court proceedings against Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif for not obeying May 7 Sup­reme Court directions to set up an independent appellate forum within 45 days over decisions rendered by court martial in the May 9, 2023 riots.
The direction has not been complied with and the federal government has disobeyed the order of the Supreme Court, plea­ded a petition moved before the apex court thro­ugh senior counsel Khw­aja Ahmad Hosain. The former CJP was also a petit­ioner in the Intra-Court Appeal (ICA), which the five-judge const­itutional bench had taken up and decided on May 7.
The petition has been filed under Article 204 of the Constitution read with sections 3 to 6 of the Conte­mpt of Court Ordinance, 2003 and Order XXVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980.
Earlier on May 7, a  five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had asked the federal government and the Parliament to consider bringing necessary amendments/legislation in the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) and allied rules within a period of 45 days to provide an independent right of appeal in the High Court against convictions awarded to civilians by the military courts.
The petition argued that the prime minister was liable for failure on part of the federal government to comply with orders of the Supreme Court.
The failure on part of the federal government to legislate and provide a civilian appellate forum renders all court martial proceedings against civilians as unlawful and unconstitutional, the petition argued, adding the appeal in the Intra-Court Appeal (ICA) and related appeals were conditionally allowed by the Supreme Court through the short order.
As no appellate forum had been provided within the given timeframe, the petition contended that the appeals now stand dismissed, and any subsequent proceedings under the legal provisions struck down by the Court in its original judgment dated October 23, 2023, are unlawful and unconstitutional.
The lapse of the 45-day period for enacting the legislation amounts to willful disobedience of the Supreme Court’s order, the petition stated, adding that no system of governance can function if the federation fails to comply with time-bound judicial directions.
Under Article 90 of the Constitution, read with the Rules of Business and past Supreme Court precedents, the prime minister—as the chief executive of the federation—is responsible for implementing court directives issued to the federal government.
Therefore, the petition argued, the prime minister is personally liable for contempt of court due to the government’s failure to act upon the court’s decision.
The petition further maintained that the case pertained to the protection and enforcement of fundamental rights—at its core, it was about the right to a fair trial and due process.
The petition reminded that the May 7, short order had held, the Constitutional Bench in unison, sensitise the need of legislative changes, which will also be compliant to the requirements laid down under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) for maintaining and preserving the constitutional and societal norms in the existing legal framework.
The Constitutional Bench had expressly stated that it recognises the need for legislative changes which would be compliant with Pakistan’s international human rights obligations, and preserve the constitutional norms in the existing legal framework.
To uphold the Constitution and protect fundamental rights, the Supreme Court had directed the government to “consider and make” a law allowing civilians convicted by military courts to appeal in High Courts.
The petition concluded by stressing that the language of the short order was mandatory, leaving no discretion for the government. The government must legislate, and the legislation must provide a right of appeal to civilian courts for civilians tried by military courts.

• Authorities asked to prepare for another monsoon spell starting today
• Babusar Road ‘partially reopened’ as search continues for tourists swept away by torrents
LAHORE: Floods in the Indus and Chenab rivers have inundated over a dozen villages in several districts of Punjab, prompting the authorities to evacuate thousands of people to safer locations, while the government has asked rescue departments to brace for urban and riverine floods as well as landslides in light of the new monsoon spell starting today.
In the southern districts of Punjab, district administrations issued emergency alerts across different villages as floods in the Indus and Chenab destroyed houses and crops. In Rajanpur, standing crops were destroyed by the Indus, which also impacted Taunsa and D.G. Khan districts.
 
 

In Layyah and Taunsa, panic spread after a crack emerged in a ‘guide embankment’ built by the National Highway Authority (NHA) to protect the Layyah-Taunsa bridge. Though the bridge remained intact, the breach submerged Taunsa’s several villages, including Basti Kumharan, Basti Mangotha, and Basti Sohbewala, forcing the residents to flee. The floods in Taunsa also left entire settl­e­ments and agricultural zones submerged, with the rescue and relief operations underway to save lives and property.
Hundreds of people from Bait Ashraf and Jarh Leghari villages in Taunsa displaced by floods, meanwhile, awaited the government’s help, as their houses and the roads came under water, which forced them to relocate to higher grounds.
In Jhang, the raging Chenab River inundated more than 10 villages and destroyed crops and residential areas, besides destroying key road networks.
In central Punjab’s Hafizabad district, rapid erosion along the Chenab’s banks washed away hundreds of acres of farmland. Hafizabad and Sukheke were also affected by stagnant rainwater, which has not been drained for more than 10 days.
According to the PMD, low to medium-level flows are expected in the rivers Jhelum and Chenab due to the expected rainfall from July 29 to 31. It also said flash flooding was expected in the tributaries of the River Kabul and hill torrents of DG Khan from July 29 to 31. The PMD also forecasted a medium-level flood at Taunsa and Guddu in the Indus, while Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Sukkur are experiencing low floods.
A report by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority on Monday said that 152 citizens have been killed and 539 have been injured in accidents during the monsoon rains this year. 210 houses were affected, and 121 livestock were killed. The deaths were due to lightning, collapse of damaged buildings, drowning while bathing in rivers and electrocution, the report added.
Another rain spell
Meanwhile, the Nati­onal Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) stated that widespread rainfall was anticipated in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), with heightened risks of flooding, landslides, and urban flooding in vulnerable districts. The spell, which will start today, will end on July 31.
The NDMA instructed all relevant departments to remain on high alert, pre-deploy flood response teams and equipment, and ensure the immediate clearance of drainage systems.
In Punjab, significant rainfall is anticipated in Sargodha, Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Lahore, Narowal, and adjoining areas. Southern districts, including Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan may receive moderate rainfall.
Torrents in D.G. Khan and Rajanpur could be reactivated with medium flows, while nullahs originating from the Pir Panjal range may also see a rise in water levels.
In KP, moderate rainfall and localised thunderstorms are expected to affect central and lower districts, such as Kohistan, Swat, Malakand, Dir and Buner.
Tributaries like River Swat, Panjkora, Bara, and Kalpani Nullah may swell and contribute to rising flows in River Kabul at Nowshera.
River Chitral and its tributaries may also surge due to a combination of glacial melting and rainfall in Booni, Reshun, and adjacent parts of Chitral Valley. Urban flooding is also anticipated in Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera, and Abbottabad.
The authority has also issued flood alerts for various areas of GB and AJK, as rainfall is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar, as well as in AJK’s Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh.
Babusar Road partially reopened
In GB, the Babusar Road was partially reop­ened on Monday as a search operation to locate the people swept away by torrents after heavy rains continued.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the Babusar-Naran Highway had “been reopened for one-way traffic”.
He further said, “Several families…have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in their search.” The TV anchor, who was reported to be among those swept away by floods, could not be traced on Monday, but her wrecked vehicle was found by the rescuers.
The Ghanche district administration also made arrangements for the displaced villagers from Kundus valley and Haldi, and provided them tents, food packs, and installed kitchens for them. The government also mobilised machinery to clear roads to the Kundus and Saltoro valleys.
Officials said a tent village with running water and electricity had been set up for the displaced people and damage assessments were underway which would be submitted for compensation. A mobile veterinary dispensary has been set up at the flood site, and a temporary power supply has been restored and all roads in the affected areas are currently open.
The Baltistan Division commissioner arranged 4,500 feet of pipe for the permanent restoration of the drinking water supply to the Kundus affectees and work on the same was in progress, which would be completed in two to three days.
GB Disaster Mana­gement Authority DG Zakir Hussain told Dawn that teams of GBDMA provide relief to affected areas round the clock and machinery had been mobilised to restore roads, irrigation and water channels.
