According to the PCB, the bidders hail from five countries — the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan — underscoring the league’s growing global footprint and commercial appeal.
Pakistan-based solar power company Inverex Power Solution also confirmed on Wednesday that it will be bidding for one of the two new franchises.
The PCB said the outcome of the initial phase of the bidding process will be announced on December 27.
In the next stage, bidders who meet the technical requirements will be invited to take part in an open competition bidding process for the acquisition of the two new teams.
This phase is scheduled to be held on January 8 at the Islamabad Convention Centre.
The PCB reiterated its commitment to conducting the entire process in a transparent and competitive manner, in line with international standards, with the aim of ensuring the sustained expansion and long-term growth of the PSL.</p><small>2025-12-24 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/241826482851f41.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962990/military-top-brass-says-no-malicious-interest-political-or-otherwise-will-be-tolerated' target='_blank'><strong>Military top brass says no malicious interest, political or otherwise, will be tolerated</strong></a><br><p>The military’s top brass on Wednesday vowed that no malicious interest, political or otherwise, aimed at undermining national unity would be tolerated, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
These remarks were made at the 273rd Corps Commanders’ Conference, which was convened at General Headquarters (GHQ) Rawalpindi and chaired by Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“The forum categorically rejected the nexus between terrorism, crime, and vested political interests,” the ISPR’s statement read.
“It resolved that no malicious interest, political or otherwise, aimed at undermining national unity, security and stability would be tolerated, nor would anyone be allowed to create divisions between the Armed Forces and the people of Pakistan.”
Paying tribute to security personnel martyred in counter-terrorism operations and civilians who “laid down their lives in recent terrorist incidents”, the forum noted that Pakistan’s gradual progress towards stability, greater opportunities and respect was the product of a joint effort by the government, the military and law enforcement agencies (LEAs).
The army high command also conducted a comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment, with particular emphasis on evolving threats and operational preparedness.
“The participants reaffirmed that all terrorists under the tutelage of Indian sponsors, along with their facilitators and abettors, would be dealt with decisively and without exception,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, the participants also appreciated the Balochistan Special Development Initiatives, which the ISPR said in the statement are “directed towards local empowerment and social engagements to address challenges of terrorism related to governance”.
“The participants noted the need for similar public-centric initiatives elsewhere, also in line with [the] National Action Plan, to ensure enduring peace and stability,” the statement read.
The ISPR further said that the forum reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to Kashmiri and Palestinian self-determination, additionally calling for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, uninterrupted humanitarian access and a clear path to Palestinian statehood.
“In his concluding remarks, the COAS and CDF directed commanders to maintain the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, training, physical fitness, technological innovations and battlefield adaptability,” the statement read.
“He expressed full confidence in Pakistan Army’s capability to effectively counter [the] complete spectrum of threats, ranging from conventional and sub-conventional to hybrid and asymmetric challenges, while steadfastly safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”</p><small>2025-12-24 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641284-celebrating-the-season-of-festivities-at-karachis-christmas-market' target='_blank'><strong>Celebrating the season of festivities at Karachi's Christmas Market</strong></a><br><p>

For months, militants in the region have used quadcopters to drop explosives on security forces and the current year has seen an increase in such attacks.
In today’s attack, a quadcopter released its explosive payload over a residential area. As a result, three boys and a girl sustained injuries, confirmed official sources.
The injured minors were shifted to a nearby medical facility for medical treatment.
Security sources condemned the attack, calling it “an act of violence against innocent civilians and children”.
“Such incidents reflect a deliberate targeting of non-combatants and have nothing to do with religion or humanitarian values,” they added.
An investigation into the incident is underway, while security in the area has been tightened following the attack.
Last week, two women and two teenagers were injured in a quadcopter attack in the Janikhel area of Bannu district. A week before the Bannu attack, another attack in the same area injured four people, including two children.
Earlier in the month, three boys were killed, and another was injured when a quadcopter crashed in a residential area of Mamand Khel in Bannu.
Also in December, at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground in Lakki Marwat.</p><small>2025-12-24 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641307-no-malicious-interest-to-undermine-unity-security-will-be-tolerated-warns-army-top-brass' target='_blank'><strong>No political or other malicious interests undermining security to be tolerated: army top brass</strong></a><br><p>

A consortium headed by the Arif Habib Corporation emerged as the top bidder in a live-televised auction for a 75 per cent stake in PIA on Tuesday, marking a breakthrough for the government’s long-delayed privatisation of the carrier.
The Arif Habib consortium offered Rs135 billion, surpassing a government reserve price of Rs100bn, in a sharp turnaround from last year’s failed sale attempt.
Muhammad Ali, the privatisation adviser to the prime minister, told Reuters in an online interview that the state expects a new owner to be running the airline by April, subject to approvals.
The process now moves to final approvals by the Privatisation Commission board and the cabinet, expected within days, with contract signing likely within two weeks and financial close after a 90-day period to meet regulatory and legal conditions.
Ali said the government would receive about Rs10bn in cash upfront and retain a 25pc stake valued at around Rs45billion.
The deal was structured to inject fresh capital into the airline rather than simply transfer ownership, he said.
“We did not want a situation where the government sells the airline, takes its money and the company still collapses,” Ali said.
The winning consortium also comprises fertiliser maker Fatima, private school network City Schools and real estate firm Lake City Holdings Limited.
Ali said Fauji Fertiliser Company did not bid but could still join the winning consortium as a partner, noting the buyer can add up to two partners including a consortium partner or a foreign airline if they meet the qualifying criteria.
Allowing partners adds financial strength and could bring global aviation expertise, he said.
Fauji Fertliser was initially in the race to acquire PIA shares but it later opted out of the bidding process.
IMF pressure
Ali said safeguards, including retained earnest money and an additional payment on signing, would allow the government to move to the second-highest bidder if the deal fails to close.
On labour, Ali said the buyer must retain all employees for 12 months after the transaction, with contracts unchanged, adding that the PIA workforce has already shrunk in recent years.
The sale is closely watched by the International Monetary Fund, which has pressed Pakistan to halt losses at state-owned enterprises.
Ali said the privatisation was a key test of Pakistan’s reform credibility with the IMF, adding that failure to offload loss-making state firms risked renewed pressure on public finances.
He said closing the deal would signal momentum on reforms and privatisations, adding that the government was working through a pipeline of future transactions once PIA closes.
‘Haven’t lost our pride’
Separately, Ali also addressed a press briefing in Islamabad, where he said the process for the “strategic sale” of PIA was initiated 20 years ago. An attempt to sell the airline had also been made last year, which unfortunately had not been successful, he recalled.
The latest attempt, which resulted in the airline’s sale, was a result of six months of persistent efforts, hard work, due diligence and cooperation of all stakeholders, he said, adding that the process was completed with the guidance of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He recalled that there was a time, around 50 years ago, when PIA was operating around 50 aircraft. The number should have increased to 100-115 by now, but the airline was presently operating just 18 planes, he added.
“We reached this stage because several mistakes have been committed in the past, over the years,” Ali said, adding that the private sector was best-suited to run such businesses. “It‘s not the government’s job to run businesses.”
He further stated that now private entities would invest in the airline, more planes would be added to its fleet, aircraft would be revamped and service quality would improve.
Ali once again lauded PM Shehbaz for his guidance and support, adding that CDF Munir also played an “important role” and there was “total commitment from his side. He also guided us”.
He also acknowledged the support from Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and other members of the cabinet.
Ali also addressed the criticism on the transaction, adding that it was being said that the government was to receive just Rs10bn from the total bidding amount.
Under the transaction arrangement for PIA’s privatisation, the government is to get 7.5pc of the total bidding amount, which adds up to around Rs10bn, and the rest 92.5pc is to be injected back into the airline.
But, Ali contended that the government was getting a “value of Rs55bn”.
He explained: “The most difficult task in this transaction was to ensure that while selling PIA, we ensure that the new buyer invests money back into the company. So, we had to achieve both objectives.
“So our structuring was such that we get Rs10bn in cash and the value of our equities is Rs45bn. So the government will get a value of Rs55bn in total, and Rs125bn will flow back into PIA.
“In total, the valuation of PIA is Rs180bn.”
During a detailed presentation about the history of PIA, Ali pointed out that from 2015 to 2024, the airline incurred losses of Rs500bn over a period of 10 years.
In this connection, he said the government was being criticised for removing liabilities.
But, “who would buy this (PIA) with all those losses?” Ali questioned..
Defending the airline‘s privatisation and identifying areas where it had been lagging, he remarked, “We haven‘t lost our pride. There is no pride in owning airlines. But, pride is lost when our airline’s [aircraft] don‘t fly. Who knows, after a year or two the airline maybe wouldn’t have been able to [carry out] flights.”
The airline, he asserted, was privatised at the right time.
Referring to Arif Habib Corporation’s statement that they were planning to expand the PIA fleet up to 65 aircraft in four years, he said, “We can see how the thinking is changing.“
He also maintained that the impression that there were no liabilities in PIA was incorrect. “We are transferring RS180bn liabilities to the new buyer,” the PM’s adviser said.
He explained that the government had only removed the long-term debt otherwise, nobody would have invested in buying the airline.
Now, following PIA‘s sale, the government would initially get two-thirds of the total payment from the buyer and later the rest of the amount. Until one-third of the payment was made in the second installment, the buyer’s shares would remain pledged with the government.
“We have also taken standby letters of credit and a demand promissory note. So we have ensured that the government is protected,” he detailed, further stating that some privileges were offered to the buyers that “are necessary to run a business in a profitable manner”.
The buyer was exempted from general sales tax payment, and no other taxes, levies or surchage would be imposed on airline operations, Ali said, adding that companies part of the winning consortium would also establish a special purpose vehicle to avoid double taxation.
Moreover, the successful bidder had access to a large captive market, he said.</p><small>2025-12-24 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641298-uae-president-to-pay-first-official-visit-to-pakistan-on-dec-26' target='_blank'><strong>UAE president to pay first official visit to Pakistan on Dec 26</strong></a><br><p>

This will be the second time the Emirati president will visit Pakistan this year, having met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Rahim Yar Khan in January. However, Friday’s trip, according to the FO, will be his first official visit as president.
According to the statement, President Al-Nahyan will review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations with PM Shehbaz and the pair will “exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interest”.
“The visit will provide an important opportunity to further strengthen the longstanding brotherly relations between Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates,” the FO said.
The FO added that the visit reflects the depth of bilateral relations between both nations and their shared commitment to bolster collaboration in key areas, including trade, investment, energy, development and regional stability.







Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties, strengthened by historical connections and a large Pakistani expatriate community in the Emirates.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and a key source of remittances, with thousands of Pakistanis working in various sectors. Both countries collaborate on defence, energy, and investment projects, with the UAE frequently providing financial aid and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.
In April this year, Pakistan and the UAE signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen bonds between the people of both nations.
Two of the MoUs were for cooperation in the field of culture and the establishment of a joint committee for consular affairs, according to the report.
The third MoU was signed between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.</p><small>2025-12-24 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641288-pakistan-taught-india-unforgettable-lesson-in-may-war-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan taught India unforgettable lesson in May war: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

He made the remarks while addressing a press briefing at his office, where he gave a detailed breakdown of the overall law and order situation in the district and operations carried out against terrorist elements.
According to the DIG, Bannu police conducted comprehensive, well-organised and result-oriented operations against militants.
He said the data showed that during 2025, a total of 134 terrorist attacks targeted police stations, police posts, checkpoints, police mobiles and police parties.
In these attacks, 27 police personnel were martyred, while 79 sustained injuries. In retaliatory action by police, 53 terrorists were killed and 163 were injured, he said.
The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists and the elimination of 65 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said.
He further stated that police and security forces jointly conducted successful operations in the areas of Miryan, Haved, Daud Shah, Mamand Khel and Domel. During these joint operations, one police constable was martyred while 11 police personnel and five civilians were injured, he said.
As a result of these operations, 22 terrorists were killed and four were arrested, and several terrorist hideouts and houses were also demolished.
He also said that terrorists had carried out 20 drone attacks targeting police installations and civilian populations, in which 19 police personnel were injured. Further, nine civilians were martyred and 33 were injured, he said.
However, following the installation of an anti-drone system on July 18, a significant improvement was observed, with over 300 drone attacks thwarted and four drones neutralised.

 

DIG Khan said that despite limited resources, various security measures were implemented to protect police installations, including the installation of barriers, bunkers, double boundary walls, bullet-proof gates and CCTV cameras.
He said that work had also begun on the Safe City Project to further enhance the safety of both police personnel and the general public.
He added that for coordinated action against terrorists, jirgas were held with local elders in different areas, yielding positive results, and peace committees were formed.
With public cooperation, militant attacks on several police stations and checkposts were successfully thwarted, while effective operations were carried out in Kakki, Bharath, Khojri, Bargantu, Sheikh Landak, and other areas, he said.
According to the DIG, in order to align Bannu police with modern requirements, the force had been equipped with drones, anti-drone guns, sniper rifles, armoured personnel carriers (APCs), thermal imaging systems, tactical helmets and bullet-proof vehicles.
He reaffirmed his commitment that Bannu police would continue its struggle to maintain law and order in the district, efforts to eliminate terrorism, and ensure the protection of the lives and property of the public.</p><small>2025-12-24 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24111943dcb0a9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962969/asif-says-govt-satisfied-with-pia-sale-sees-it-having-great-symbolic-value' target='_blank'><strong>Asif says govt satisfied with PIA sale, sees it having great ‘symbolic value’</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday said that the government was satisfied with the sale of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), adding that it had great “symbolic value”.
He expressed these views on Geo News programme ‘Geo Pakistan’ when asked whether the government was satisfied with the process.







“Yes, the government is satisfied. This is the first biggest transaction of our privatisation process. This transaction has a great symbolic value,“ he said, recalling that previously First Women Bank had also been privatised but that transaction was not as big.
A consortium led by the Arif Habib group won the auction for a controlling stake in Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) on Tuesday with a bid of Rs135 billion after a competitive, televised process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
The sale is a central plank of the government’s plan to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises and a key condition under Pakistan’s $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout programme.
Speaking about the matter on ‘Geo Pakistan’, Asif said the PIA sale had “symbolic value because of the history of this transaction“.
Four years ago, he said, the country’s entire aviation sector had suffered following a statement by a then-minister from the PTI.
He was apparently referring to former aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement in June 2020 during a parliamentary session. Khan had said investigations revealed that more than 262 of the country’s 860 active pilots either held fake licences or had cheated in their exams.
Following the then-minister’s statement, European and UK authorities had ban­ned PIA from their territories, which were the airline’s most profitable routes. A number of foreign airlines had also grounded Pak­istani-origin pilots over concerns about their licences.
The developments followed the crash of a PIA flight from Lahore near Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­national Airport in 2020, killing around 100 people.
Asif said these events had led to PIA going “almost bankrupt”, adding that the government then restructured the company. “The government itself owned a big portion of its liability and only nominal liability remained,“ he said. “Against this backdrop, yesterday’s transaction is a very successful one.”
He also credited the civil aviation department for its considerable contribution in the matter and seeing the transaction through. “We went through a painstaking process,” he said, adding that PIA was now operating flights to Manchester.
The minister further stated that the airline now also had permission to operate flights to Birmingham and London, but it did not have aircraft for those flights. Similarly, he continued, PIA now also had permission to operate flights to New York and around 14-15 destinations in Europe.
The defence minister also appeared to be defending the arrangement under which the government is to receive just 7.5 per cent — around Rs10bn — of the amount from the PIA sale, saying that investing a “bigger portion” back into the airline increased its value.
He said the government still held 25pc of PIA’s shares and 92.5 of the amount from the sale being invested back into the airline was actually an investment into a national asset.
“We did not give a handout to anyone,” he asserted, adding that the country had borne losses for 50-55 years following nationalisation of businesses.
He also blamed the bureaucracy for state-owned enterprises’ losses, adding that politicians likely shared some responsibility for these losses as well.
“We have to construct such transactions [as that of PIA‘s sale] to rid [the national exchequer] of these losses. We don’t have a choice. We are beggars, not the choosers,” Asif said, adding that several other transactions were to be carried out in the future.
In this connection, he also mentioned that two power distribution companies in Sindh and one each in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were facing severe losses.
When the anchorperson pointed out that Asif had held Khan responsible for losses in the aviation sector in recent years and asked whether action would be taken over such matters, Asif said action would be taken.
“There is no other option. These people should be held answerable,” he said.
He said often retired bureaucrats would become part of boards of state-owned enterprises and earn in millions.
“This is an orgy of loot and plunder of the public sector that has been going on in our country for the past 55 years,” he commented. “The existence of a sick public sector is actually supported or pushed by the bureaucracy […] The government is largely responsible for it, and they [bureaucrats] are the major beneficiaries of this loot and plunder.”
Asked about over-staffing in PIA, he said even if a little more had to be paid to the employees than the actual payable amount to “get rid of them”, then it should be paid.
“Because the purpose should be to stop the continuous bleeding.”
Asked about the possibility of talks between the government and opposition, he said issues on which dialogue was to be held should be decided first.</p><small>2025-12-24 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24112922cba1800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962970/finance-minister-says-pakistans-economy-shifting-toward-export-led-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Finance minister says Pakistan’s economy shifting toward export-led growth</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Wednesday that Pakistan had reached a critical turning point, with macroeconomic stability, sustained reforms, and policy continuity restoring confidence and steering the economy toward export-led, long-term growth.
In an interview with USA Today, the minister said this was opening new horizons for domestic and global investors, and positioning the country for sustainable, long-term economic growth.
He said this transition was enabled by macroeconomic stabilisation, easing inflation and improved external balances, with the government driving export-led, productivity-based growth through structural reforms, sustaining reform momentum despite challenges, and actively encouraging global investment in emerging opportunities across agriculture, minerals, technology and climate resilience.

 

He noted that, for the first time in several years, Pakistan had achieved both a primary fiscal surplus and a current account surplus, signalling a decisive shift away from the cycle of recurring deficits.
He said that strong remittance inflows had played a critical role in supporting this turnaround, while inflation had fallen sharply from a peak of 38 per cent to single-digit levels.
He also noted that foreign exchange reserves had risen to over $14.5 billion, providing import cover of approximately two-and-a-half months, while the exchange rate had remained stable, helping to restore investor confidence.
Aurangzeb emphasised that while macroeconomic stabilisation was an essential foundation, sustainable growth remained the central challenge.
He pointed out that the economic growth of 2.7pc in the previous fiscal year, though positive, was insufficient to absorb the needs of a rapidly growing population.
He underlined that Pakistan was consciously moving away from a consumption and debt-driven growth model toward an export-led strategy.
The current budget, he explained, reflected this shift through structural reforms in taxation, energy pricing, and state-owned enterprises, alongside far-reaching tariff reforms aimed at dismantling decades of protectionism and enhancing global competitiveness.
He highlighted that Pakistan was aligning its economic strategy with changing global demand patterns, identifying information technology services, textiles, and agricultural exports as key areas with strong potential.
He said efforts were also underway to simplify the tax regime for exporters and reduce bureaucratic hurdles in order to foster long-term productivity and competitiveness.
Addressing the broader reform agenda, Aurangzeb said that the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, tariff liberalisation, and restructuring of the energy sector were designed to address deep-rooted inefficiencies that had historically strained public finances.
He said that these reforms were part of a long-term vision, echoing the World Bank’s (WB) assessment of Pakistan’s potential “East Asia moment”.
He referred to the ten-year Country Partnership Framework with the WB, the first of its kind, which placed an emphasis on economic reform alongside climate resilience and population management.
The minister stressed that Pakistan’s future hinged on addressing existential challenges beyond fiscal indicators.
Population growth, climate change, child stunting, learning poverty and the exclusion of girls from education were identified as critical issues that must be tackled to safeguard the country’s long-term productive capacity, he said.
Aurangzeb stressed that increasing women’s participation in education and the workforce was both a social imperative and an economic necessity.
On climate resilience, he highlighted Pakistan’s engagement with multilateral partners to strengthen preparedness against frequent floods and droughts.
Acknowledging the risks that remain, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to staying the course of reforms despite geopolitical and domestic challenges. He emphasised that discipline, consistency, and international cooperation remained central to safeguarding recent gains.
Highlighting opportunities for investors, the minister pointed to agriculture, minerals and mining, and the emerging digital economy as priority sectors.
He drew attention to Pakistan’s agricultural potential, the strategic importance of the Tethyan Copper Belt in Balochistan amid rising global demand for critical minerals, and the growing focus on data centres, artificial intelligence, and digital services.
He noted that regulatory frameworks were being updated to support innovation and encourage foreign investment, particularly from the United States, describing technological change as a major game-changer for Pakistan.
In conclusion, Aurangzeb invited global investors and partners to engage with Pakistan through trade, investment, and collaboration.
Emphasising the country’s reform momentum, economic potential, and natural beauty, he reiterated that Pakistan was transitioning from a narrative of crisis management to one of opportunity and transformation, offering promising prospects for those willing to engage with a market on the cusp of sustainable growth.</p><small>2025-12-24 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2411535069d6b48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962971/daytime-movement-of-heavy-vehicles-banned-in-karachi-for-2-months' target='_blank'><strong>Daytime movement of heavy vehicles banned in Karachi for 2 months</strong></a><br><p>The daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles has been banned in Karachi for two months, it emerged on Wednesday.
The development comes as the city has recently witnessed a steep increase in traffic accidents, with many resulting from collisions with heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
A notification issued on Tuesday by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said that the deputy inspector general of the Karachi Traffic Police had requested the imposition of a ban on the movement of heavy vehicles during the daytime “in order to resolve traffic congestion issues due to the influx of heavy vehicular traffic and to prevent road traffic accidents”.
The notification added that in the interest of protecting human lives and ensuring the smooth flow of traffic, there were sufficient grounds to proceed under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to regulate the movement of heavy traffic within the city.
As a result, the Karachi commissioner imposed a complete ban on dumper trucks carrying construction materials in all parts of the city, except between the hours of 10pm and 6am.
He also imposed a ban on the movement of heavy traffic within the city, except between 10pm and 6am. However, this excluded those carrying “essential commodities”, including water, edible oil, liquid nitrogen, meat, skin and medical gases classed as life-saving drugs.
A complete ban was also imposed on the movement of heavy traffic on Jinnah Avenue from Super Highway (M-9 Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway) near Saima Pari Classic and Rufi Global City up to Malir Halt, Sharea Faisal.
Three routes were also designated for heavy traffic, excluding dumper trucks carrying construction materials. These included the Super Highway (to New Karachi Industrial area via Slip Road) and the National Highway (to Godown Chowrangi, Younas Chowrangi, Dawood Chowrangi). The third route was the Northern Bypass, through which vehicles can access Gulbai and Mauripur en route to Karachi Port.
An alternate route was also specified from Link Road Kathore to Sassi Toll Plaza.
“The movement of dumpers equipped with approved tracking devices (trackers), whose access data has been integrated with the Karachi Traffic Police monitoring system, is exempted from the restriction timings within the industrial zones of Karachi,” the notification added.
It said the restrictions would remain in place for a period of two months, from Dec 23 to Feb 22, 2026.
This is not the first time a ban has been imposed on the movement of heavy vehicles in Karachi. In February, the provincial government placed a 60-day ban on heavy vehicle traffic in the city exempting certain nighttime hours. In April, this ban was extended for another two months.
On Dec 19, three people were killed in as many traffic accidents in Karachi involving “negligent and careless driving” of heavy vehicles. The previous week, a young motorcyclist was killed and his pillion rider injured by a trailer truck driver near Bara Board, PAF Gate, in Mauripur.</p><small>2025-12-24 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24122446dfba616.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962974/india-space-agency-launches-its-heaviest-satellite' target='_blank'><strong>India space agency launches its heaviest satellite</strong></a><br><p>India’s space agency launched its heaviest ever payload on Wednesday, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling the deployment “a significant stride” for the space sector.
The LVM3-M6 rocket launched the US-built AST SpaceMobile communications satellite into low-Earth orbit.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said it was the “heaviest payload to be launched from Indian soil”.
The launch is a boost for India’s ambitious low-cost space programme, with plans for an uncrewed orbital mission and human spaceflight in the coming years.
The satellite, weighing 6,100 kilogrammes (13,448 pounds), was launched on a modified version of a rocket that India plans to use for its future space missions.
India is vying for a larger slice of the booming commercial satellite business as phone, internet and other companies seek expanded and more high-end communications.
Modi said the launch marked “a proud milestone in India’s space journey”.







“It strengthens India’s heavy-lift launch capability and reinforces our growing role in the global commercial launch market,” he said in a statement.
Earlier this year, ISRO launched the CMS-03 communication satellite, which weighs about 4,410 kilogrammes.
For these heavy launches, India has deployed an upgraded version of the rocket it used to send an unmanned craft to the Moon in August 2023.
The world’s most populous nation has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade with its space programme growing considerably, and rivalling the achievements of established powers at a much cheaper price tag.
It has said it plans to launch an uncrewed orbital mission before its first human spaceflight in 2027.
Modi has also announced plans to send an astronaut to the Moon by 2040.</p><small>2025-12-24 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641209-pia-privatisation-asif-blames-bureaucracy-for-public-sectors-decline-seeks-accountability' target='_blank'><strong>PIA privatisation: Asif blames bureaucracy for public sector's decline, seeks accountability</strong></a><br><p>

“This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people,” Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement.
According to the Washington DC-based Stimson Centre, Libya has effectively split into two virtual quasi-states since 2014. The west is ruled by the Government of National Unity (GNU), of which Dbeibah is the prime minister, while the east is run by Field Marshal Khalifa Belqasim Haftar’s Libyan Armed Forces.
Dbeibah said the commander of Libya’s ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff’s office were also on the aircraft.
Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT.







He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district.







He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established.
The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.
Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation into the crash was under way.
The Tripoli-based GNU said in a statement that the prime minister directed the defence minister to send an official delegation to Ankara to follow up on proceedings.
Walid Ellafi, state minister of political affairs and communication for the GNU, told broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready, but that the jet was a leased Maltese aircraft.
He added that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history,” but said this would be investigated.
Turkiye’s defence ministry had announced Haddad’s visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.</p><small>2025-12-24 06:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/24103222352d419.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962967/gold-tops-4500-silver-and-platinum-hit-records-in-metal-markets-frenzy' target='_blank'><strong>Gold tops $4,500, silver and platinum hit records in metal markets frenzy</strong></a><br><p>Gold surged past the $4,500-an-ounce mark for the first time on Wednesday, while silver and platinum also scaled record highs, as investors piled into precious metals on safe-haven demand and expectations that US interest rates will fall further next year.
Spot gold rose 0.1 per cent to $4,492.51 per ounce by 3:59am GMT (8:59am PKT), after touching a record high of $4,525.19 earlier in the session. US gold futures for February delivery climbed 0.3pc to a record high of $4,520.60.
Silver gained 1.2pc to $72.27 an ounce, after hitting an all-time peak of $72.70 earlier, while platinum jumped 3.3pc to $2,351.05 after rising to a historic high of $2,377.50.
Palladium climbed almost 2pc to $1,897.11, its highest level in three years.
“Precious metals have become more of a speculative narrative around the idea that, with de-globalisation, you need an asset that can act as a neutral go-between, without sovereign risk particularly as tensions between the US and China persist,” said Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive.

 

Thin year-end liquidity exaggerated recent price moves but the broader theme was likely to endure, with gold targeting $5,000 over the next six to twelve months and silver potentially pushing toward $80 as markets respond to key psychological levels, Spivak added.
Gold has surged more than 70pc this year, its biggest annual gain since 1979, driven by safe-haven demand, expectations of US rate cuts, robust central-bank buying, de-dollarisation trends and ETF inflows, with traders pricing in two rate cuts next year.
Silver has jumped more than 150pc over the same period, outpacing gold on strong investment demand, its inclusion on the US critical minerals list and momentum buying.
Gold and silver have “been hitting the accelerator pedal this week” with fresh record highs, reflecting their appeal as stores of value amid expectations of lower US rates and lingering global debt, said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.
Platinum and palladium, primarily used in automotive catalytic converters to reduce emissions, have surged this year on tight mine supply, tariff uncertainty, and a rotation from gold investment demand, with platinum up about 160pc and palladium gaining more than 100pc year to date.
“What we’re seeing in platinum and palladium is largely catch-up,” Spivak said adding that the thin nature of those markets leave them vulnerable to sharp swings, even as they broadly track gold, once liquidity returns.</p><small>2025-12-24 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641194-former-pti-leaders-seek-parole-for-jailed-party-stalwarts' target='_blank'><strong>Former PTI leaders seek parole for jailed party stalwarts</strong></a><br><p>

Initially, pre-qualified bids were submitted by Lucky Cement, private airline Airblue and investment firm Arif Habib in the morning. Airblue exited the race after the first round of bidding, with a proposition lower than the reference price of Rs100bn.
In the first round, Lucky Cement put up a bid of Rs101.5bn, Airblue Rs26.5bn, and the Arif Habib consortium bid Rs115bn, after which the reference price was announced.
Following that, a 30-minute break was taken so that the two top bidders could hold consultations. A second round was then commenced.
It began with the base bid at Rs115bn, and the minimum increment was at Rs250 million. The base price was set on the basis of the highest bid made during the first round by Arif Habib.
Both bidders engaged in a brief competition to outbid each other during the round. However, when Lucky Cement raised its bid to Rs134bn, Arif Habib countered with Rs135bn, forcing Lucky Cement to bow out and congratulate Arif Habib.



The whole process was telecast live and streamed across all TV channels as well as the respective social media handles of the government.
Adviser to the prime minister on privatisation, Muhammad Ali, will also hold a press conference after the conclusion of the bidding process.
Privatisation will ‘promote’ investment
After winning the bid to acquire the national airline, business owner Arif Habib said the privatisation will “promote” investment in the country.
“PIA is our national institution,” Habib said.
“The national airline has witnessed days of glory and was once ranked number two in the world. All its employees are very competent,” he added.
Habib said he is hopeful of resolving all shortcomings with the new capital investment.
When asked about his expansion plans, he said, “Initially, we plan to expand the fleet to 38 aircraft in the first phase, then to 65, depending on demand.”
The successful bidder assured he would give “confidence to PIA employees” and help in “realising their potential.”
“Employment opportunities will grow as we expand,” Habib said. “The existing experienced employees will also get opportunities.”
“When all necessary capital investment is made, they will perform well.”
Later, speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the business tycoon said that he was willing to bring in foreign airlines once the transaction was completed.
Asked if he was willing to bring in additional investors, including foreign airlines, Habib expressed hope that they would come on board.
“Now that we’re the highest bidder and once the cabinet approves the deal, we will have about 90 days to negotiate with them and possibly bring them into the airline,” he replied.
Habib added that his company would approach airlines, adding that once the consortium acquires PIA, it will demonstrate that it is able to put more capital into the flag carrier.
He also noted that the consortium‘s bid was Rs4bn higher than their adviser’s valuation.
“I think our adviser’s valuation was Rs131bn, so when the bidding happened, we ended up paying an entry premium,” he said, adding that this provision is needed when buying an active business.
“Considering the Lucky Group is strong and has deep pockets, that was something we took into consideration. We were expecting that this transaction would be achieved at around Rs130bn,” the tycoon elaborated.
Habib said it was a “big comfort” because when bids increase, there is more funding available for development and turnaround.
“This was a big factor behind the valuation,” he said.
Habib stated that he wanted to purchase a 100pc stake in PIA, but the transition commission produced a “very good structure” and limited the bids to 75pc of the flag carrier.
“They gave us the option of a balance of 25pc, which we can exercise in 90 days,” he said.
“The payment can be made within a year with a 12pc per annum premium. We need to assess the company’s value and make a decision within three months. If we avail the option, we will have to make the payment at a 12pc premium.”
’A very good start“
Khaqan Najeeb, a seasoned economist and policy expert, hailed the privatisation as a “sought-after” micro-economic reform that “must take place”.
Talking to Geo News, Najeed said, “It is a very good start that after 19-20 years, we have successfully privatised a major institution.”
“We have achieved this milestone on the third attempt. We must always remember that, despite parking Rs650 billion – not a small amount – in a holding company, it couldn’t be achieved,” he said.
“After removing a liability of Rs33 billion from the balance sheet of PIA and adding various other incentives in the form of tax or other concessions, only then have we made this happen,” Najeeb said.
The economist termed the development a “good outcome” and “positive” for the national airline.
“However, we achieved this by offering tax favours, deferred credits, and creating positive equities,” he said.
“We must notice that, as a good sweetener, it was necessary to reinvest 92.5% of the sold 75% in PIA, while only giving 7.5% to the state to run the company, because it is in need of significant funds to manage its affairs.”
“The company needs money to grow despite having multiple landing rights and air services agreements.”
He highlighted that the national airline has 18 planes in its fleet and carries four million passengers, but “it will not be enough to achieve economies of scale.”
“We have to reconsider how we have supported our SOEs, giving repeated sweeteners and unnecessary concessions, while selling a national airline that holds dozens of landing rights.”
Najeeb said that if anyone runs this company with “financial muscle,” a hidden value could be rediscovered. “I hope that when we finalise this deal, we will design a proper business and investment plan to expand the current fleet from 18 to 50 aeroplanes, reach further destinations, and carry more passengers,” he said.
“It’s a long way to go.”
Labelling the development as “positive,” he added, “There was a time when we were losing Rs50 to Rs100 billion. We can now avoid such losses – a good way to save taxpayers’ money.”
“However,” he reminded, “we have to keep in mind that for the Rs650 billion parked in the holding company, we have to pay around Rs30 billion every year from taxpayers’ money, according to estimates.”
He remarked that an “overhang” exists in Pakistan’s aviation policy, which has to be “fixed.”
The economist further stated the three important aspects of a good economy. “The first is a good regulatory environment, the second is a smooth policy-making process, and the last is the efficiency of operations,” he explained. “That’s how the economy works.”
‘Historic day for Pakistan’
In a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the sale as “a historic day for Pakistan” and congratulated Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, among others.
“It was our firm commitment to the people of Pakistan that speedy and concrete steps would be taken to privatise loss-making state-owned enterprises that have been a burden on the economy,” the PM wrote.
“The successful completion of the transparent and highly competitive bidding process for the privatisation of PIA marks an important milestone in fulfilling that commitment.”







The PM added that he has always maintained that regardless of which consortium won the auction, “Pakistan would be the ultimate winner and today’s outcome fully vindicates that belief”.
“The strong participation of our leading business groups and some of Pakistan’s most seasoned and respected investors is a powerful vote of confidence in our economy and its future,” PM Shehbaz wrote.
“This is work in progress and we will continue our hard work with even greater vigour and perseverance in the days ahead to build a brighter future for our nation.”
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also offered his congratulations on the successful privatisation of PIA.
“Pakistan has won today,” he exclaimed.
“By the grace of God, the process has been conducted with transparency,” Naqvi said.
He also extended felicitations to Advisor on Privatisation Mohammad Ali and his team, the prime minister, and especially to those who “secured PIA”.
“We are all looking forward to travelling through PIA again,” he added.







The Ministry of Privatisation also congratulated the consortium for winning the auction.
Aurangzeb hopes PIA sale will bring investment
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, speaking at the bidding ceremony, thanked the PM‘s aide and his team for their efforts and hailed the bidding process in terms of transparency.
“It takes a lot of time and effort to get to a good place where we are today,“ he said.
“All of the bidders today are from Pakistan. I used to say that no matter which team wins, Pakistan would win.”
He lauded Pakistan‘s biggest conglomerates for “vying for the best airline” and said that the flag carrier would be led by investors and some of Pakistan’s most experienced businesspeople.
“The fact that they have stepped up is a doubtless sign that anyone who is the successful bidder will take it not only to where we were, but where we need to be in the comity of nations,” Aurangzeb added.
“We need to stop the bleeding and losses, but more importantly, our institutions need to be part of the comity of nations, and we will take them there,” he added.
Aurangzeb also expressed hope that the bidding would increase the number of local investors and, in turn, the number of foreign investors entering the country.
“The government, through the privatisation of business entities under state custody, will not only save itself from losses in the thousands of billions but also accelerate the process of economic recovery,” he wrote, congratulating the privatisation commission.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif took to X to celebrate the sale, calling it a “growing vote of confidence in the national economy”.
Asif added that Europe and the UK lifting bans on PIA‘s operations was a major contributor to the success of today’s deal.
“From a bid of Rs10bn in the past to a price of Rs135bn today, it is proof of trust in our Civil Aviation Regulator.”
He also assailed the PTI government for leaving “no stone unturned to destroy PIA”, adding that it took three years to rebuild the flag carrier.







At the outset of the ceremony, the adviser to the prime minister on privatisation addressed the audience.
Ali hoped that PIA’s privatisation would open “paths for investment in the country”.
“I would also like to thank all bidders who are present today, and those who were part of the bidding process but did not reach the final round. We wouldn‘t have been here without them, and this process wouldn’t have been completed,” he said.
“We actively engaged with all the bidders. Two of them demanded to take up to 75 per cent at least, and the other two demanded 100pc,“ he said.
“We wanted a multitude of bidders so the process of bidding would be transparent and competitive,” he continued.
He said that the government had “decided to sell at least 75pc of shares, and simultaneously, we also decided to offer the other 25pc”.
“Bidders will have the right to consider and let the government know if they also want to buy the other 25pc in the next 90 days,” he said.
He further said, “The transaction would be from 75pc up to 100pc; however, 75pc of them will be made available for sale today”.
“The government wanted to structure this transaction so it would also get a fair share and investment to be made,” he said, adding that the government did not just want to sell PIA but “to bring the national airline back to the glory it enjoyed in the past”.
He stressed the need for bringing in “new investment, buy new carriers and repair the engine, cut the liabilities, pay the employees on time”.
“If we want to expand the fleet from 18 planes to 30-40 or more, then investment is the only way,” he added.
Pre-qualified bids
In the morning, representatives of the bidding groups had walked in one by one to deposit sealed offers into a transparent box, briefly fumbling as they pushed envelopes through the slot in a separate public ceremony in Islamabad that was also broadcast on state television.
Following that, the reference price for PIACL’s bidding was approved by the Privatisation Commission Board and the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation after bids were received.







Meanwhile, speaking to the media, Ali said, “God willing, we will get a good bid, there will be good investment, and we will succeed.“
The auction was Pakistan’s second attempt at selling the once storied flag carrier after televised bidding last year collapsed when a solitary offer fell far below the government‘s reference price, derailing what would have been the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, thanked government officials and the Privatisation Commission for their role in the national carrier’s privatisation.
He stressed that the process has been made “transparent“, stating that it will be the “largest transaction” ever in Pakistan’s history.
“Today, as the bidding starts [..] the bids will come in sealed envelopes, there will be transparent boxes, there will be a live telecast. When the price is determined, the envelopes will be opened. They will compete, and whoever has the highest bid will [succeed],“ he said.
“Only God knows how high the bid will go, but the process must come back to the cabinet,” he said.
Unsuccessful bidders to be excluded from PIA management
Earlier, Ali said the two unsuccessful bidders will be excluded from any future role in the airline’s management thanks to a unique stipulation.
In recent remarks, he explained that losing bidders will have no right to join the winning bidder, and only those groups who were not party to the auction would be able to join the new management.
This means that while only one of the three consortiums currently in the running for the flag carrier will become part of its administration upon acquisition of a majority stake, Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd retains the option to join with them subsequently, if it wishes to.
The company was previously in the race for PIA but then decided to quit the bidding process.
Ahead of Tuesday’s bidding, reports surfaced of a behind-the-scenes deal involving at least two of the parties involved — the Arif Habib and Lucky Cement groups — that reportedly fell through.
In a tweet, journalist Kamran Khan alluded to a meeting where it was proposed to split the controlling stake among three of the four interested parties. However, Khan claimed, this arrangement fell through as one of the parties — i.e. the Muhammad Ali Tabba-led Lucky Cement group — did not agree to it.







Both Tabba and a high-ranking government official privy to developments confirmed this, but clarified that this was not a government-brokered mee­ting, but rather an informal interaction.
Talking to Dawn, Tabba expressed unwavering confidence in the privatisation process, and clarified that the proposal was floated to him after a meeting in Islamabad, which he did not pursue.

A special meeting of the cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also approved amendments to the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) Ordinance 2002, aimed at aligning public tendering and procurement procedures with contemporary requirements.
The cabinet approved the repeal of the National University for Security Sciences Islamabad Bill 2025 and constituted a committee to ensure effective consultation on private members’ bills and other legislation in the National Assembly.
Furthermore, it granted approval to the National Cannabis Control and Regulatory Policy 2025, which aims to promote the use of plant-based resources in the pharmaceutical and textile sectors under a regulated framework.

Approves visa clearance system to facilitate foreign travel

On the recommendation of the Ministry of Interior, the cabinet approved a visa clearance system designed to facilitate Pakistani citizens travelling abroad by providing a transparent and secure mechanism for visa acquisition.
The cabinet also ratified the decisions taken by the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases at its meetings held on Oct 20, Nov 5 and Nov 21 this year, as well as the decisions taken by the Economic Coordination Committee at its meeting on Dec 18.
In his concluding remarks, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed that the national interest would remain the guiding principle of the government’s decisions, particularly in matters concerning economic reform, political stability and public confidence.
The prime minister also congratulated the nation on Pakistan’s victory in the Under-19 cricket championship, calling it a moment of pride for the entire country.
He further referred to the recent conferment of the King Abdulaziz Award on Field Marshal Asim Munir in Saudi Arabia, saying the honour belonged not to an individual but to the entire nation and reflected Pakistan’s collective dignity.

KARACHI: Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar said on Tuesday that five major extortion networks operating from abroad were active in Karachi and that efforts were underway to have their ringleaders extradited and arrested.
Speaking at a press conference at the Central Police Office, the home minister identified the ringleaders of the five networks as Wasiullah Lakho, Jameel Changa, Bahadur PMT, Gul Sher Jagirani and Azeem.
Accompanied by Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon and Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho, the minister said the Sindh government had approached the federal government for extradition of the ringleaders of the five gangs.
Speaking on the occasion, IGP Memon said that gangster Lakho topped the list of those involved in extortion rackets.
He disclosed that the government had sent a request to Interpol for issuance of ‘red notice’ against Lakho.
He added that necessary documents regarding two other gangsters —Ahmed Ali Magsi and Samad Kathiawari — had been sent to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), which already forwarded the relevant letters for issuance of red notices against them.
The IGP clarified that the preparation and verification of documents to meet international legal requirements took some time.
Talking about police action against extortion rackets, the minister said law enforcers had recently conducted several operations against these gangs, arrested 37 members and killed one of them in encounters.
In a veiled reference to a raid on the house of Sunni Tehreek’s chief, he said recently an action was also conducted at an “important residence” in the metropolis and eight suspected extortionists were arrested with weapons.
To a question, the home minister, without naming the head of the religious party, said legal action would be taken against him for providing “shelter to criminals”.
He said these arrests were made within seven days after the Association of Builders and Developers raised concerns over incidents of extortion at a press conference and during a meeting with the chief minister.
He said a WhatsApp group had been created where the builders and traders could directly lodge their complaints to senior police officers.
Surrender or face consequences, dacoits warned
Talking about a recent joint police-Rangers operation in riverine area to recover over one dozen Quetta-bound passengers abducted in Ghotki district, he said that four hardened bandits were killed and ‘military-grade’ weapons were recovered from them.
He said these joint operations by Sindh and Punjab police and the paramilitary force were conducted in “hard-to-access riverine areas”.
The minister declared that they had adopted a policy of “surrender or face the consequences” for riverine bandits.
To a question, the home minister said that at least 11 arms dealers who provided sophisticated weapons to riverine area gangs had been identified and the Sindh government had asked the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to take action against them.
He hoped that after action against such dealers, flow of arms to the riverine areas would be reduced, which would lead to further improvement in law and order there.
To a question, the home minister said IGP Memon is going to retire on Dec 30. However, he evaded questions as to whether Sindh and federal governments finalised a name to be appointed as the new police chief.

Police said unknown miscreants had planted an improvised explosive device (IED) on the main railway track near the Notal area of Nasirabad district. The device detonated before the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express, coming from Peshawar, reached the site. The explosion damaged a portion of the track, forcing the suspension of train services.
“About four feet of the railway track was blown up in the powerful blast,” a senior police officer told Dawn, adding that another IED, weighing around 10 kilogrammes, was found planted at a similar distance from the first blast and was defused by the concerned authorities.
Railway officials stopped the Jaffar Express at Dera Murad Jamali and suspended train services between Quetta and other provinces until repairs to the track are completed.

Jaffar Express narrowly escapes another attack

Following the blast, a heavy contingent of police, the bomb disposal squad, and security forces rushed to the site, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation to arrest those involved.
Police said that over the past two months, around a dozen attempts had been made by miscreants to target the Jaffar Express.
In a separate incident, a landmine blast in Dera Bugti district killed three goats and injured five others. Police said the explosion occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area, where unknown individuals had planted an underground landmine for sabotage purposes. Further investigation is underway.

Justice Raheel Kamran issued the ruling while dismissing a petition filed by a government official seeking to overturn his removal from service for workplace harassment, a penalty imposed by the Punjab Ombudsperson and later upheld after the rejection of his representation by the governor.
The petitioner, Umer Shehzad, a district manager, was accused by his female subordinate, an ad hoc teacher, of persistent harassment.
According to the complaint, Sheh­zad allegedly used his supervisory position to cast indecent glances, send inappropriate WhatsApp messages and demand an illicit relationship in exchange for professional favours.
According to the complaint, Sheh­zad forcibly entered her residence, attempted to rape her and fled only after she called the police service Rescue 15.

Judge dismisses petition filed by govt official seeking to set aside his removal from service

Following an inquiry, the Punjab Ombudsperson found Shehzad guilty of “abuse of authority” and harassment under the 2010 Act and imposed the major penalty of removal from service. The decision was later affirmed by the governor.
Before the LHC, the petitioner argued that the incident took place at a private residence and therefore did not fall within the legal definition of a “workplace”.
However, Justice Kamran rejec­ted this narrow interpretation, holding that under Section 2(n) of the Act, a “workplace” includes any situation linked to official work or activity outside the office.
The judge observed that when a supervisor uses the leverage of emp­loyment — such as threats to terminate an appointment — to exert pressure on a subordinate, the statutory “nexus” is firmly established regardless of the physical location.
“The statutory emphasis, therefore, is not on geography alone, but on the nexus between the conduct complained of and the employment relationship, particularly where sup­ervisory authority is alleged to have been misused,” the judge noted.
Justice Kamran also addressed the petitioner’s objection to the use of unverified WhatsApp messages, noting that the petitioner had indirectly admitted to the communication in his initial defence and failed to challenge their forensics during the inquiry.
Furthermore, the judge clarified that proceedings before the ombudsperson are administrative and disciplinary, not criminal.
The judge noted that the ombudsperson is not bound by the rigid technicalities of the Code of Civil Procedure or the Qanun-i-Shahadat.
The judge also dismissed another argument of the petitioner that a pending criminal case on the same facts barred the ombudsperson’s jurisdiction.
Justice Kamran ruled that the principle of “double jeopardy” does not apply here because criminal trials and disciplinary inquiries engage distinct legal regimes — one for criminal culpability and the other for workplace dignity.
The judge concluded that the guilt of the petitioner reached by the ombudsperson, affirmed by the governor, appears to be not only in consonance with law but also a reasonable and logical inference that could be drawn from the material available on the record.
The judge ruled that the findings recorded by both the forums are neither perverse nor unsupported by the record, nor do they suffer from any jurisdictional defect or legal infirmity so as to warrant interference by the court.

Defence Minister Israel Katz, speaking at a settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said the military would never leave all of Gaza and planned to station a type of unit — Nahal — that has historically played a role in establishing Israeli communities, including settlements.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said that Katz’s announcement was “a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement” and “completely goes against” Trump’s peace plan.
After Israeli media reported the comment as a plan to resettle Gaza, where Israel dismantled settlements in 2005, Katz issued a statement saying “the government has no intention of establishing settlements in the Gaza Strip”.

US-backed peace plan bars Tel Aviv from establishing settlements and calls for it to pull out completely

Katz tried to further clarify his remarks, saying “the reference to the integration of Nahal … in the northern Gaza Strip was made in a security context only”.
The Israeli defence minister, in his comments at the Beit El settlement, said: “We are located deep inside Gaza and we will never leave all of Gaza. There will never be such a thing. We are there to protect, to prevent what happened. We don’t trust anybody else to protect our citizens.”
According to the US-backed peace plan signed by both Israel and Hamas in October, the Israeli military will gradually withdraw completely from the coastal enclave and Israel will not re-establish civilian settlements there.
The plan nevertheless provides for an Israeli “security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Netanyahu, Trump to meet next week
The comments point to complications facing Trump’s Gaza plan, ahead of his meeting with Netanyahu at the White House next week.
The US president’s plan secured a ceasefire in October and the release of the remaining living Israeli prisoners seized in the Oct 7, 2023, raids.
But there has been little sign of progress towards the other goals. Hamas has so far refused to disarm, as required by the plan, which also foresees the establishment of a transitional authority and the deployment of a multinational force.
Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank — part of the territory where Palestinians aim to establish a state — has accelerated under Netanyahu. Israel is gearing up for elections next year and settlers make up part of Katz and Netanyahu’s Likud party voter base.

Amanullah Khan and Malik Abdul Khaliq Lala Ghabizai, the tribal elders, addressing a press conference on Tuesday, said that trade had been suspended for the past two months, bringing all business activities in the border region to a standstill.
“Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan are not allo­wed by the authorities concerned to return to Pak­istan,” Malik Ghabizai said, adding that such a situation was causing hum­a­nitarian concerns. He dem­anded that those str­anded on the other side of the border be allowed to return home without any delay.
The tribal elders said thousands of people who travelled on valid passports and visas had been stranded in Afghanistan for several weeks, adding that many travellers’ legal documents had also expired, compounding their difficulties.
Similarly, thousands of trucks carrying household belongings of migrants are stuck at the border. The drivers and cleaners are facing severe shortages of food and have been left without any source of livelihood, leaving their families back home in dire conditions.
The jirga leaders also alleged that people are subjected to humiliation and extortion at 22 checkpoints between Chaman and Quetta, terming the practice highly condemnable. They urged the authorities to allow residents of Chaman to travel freely to their area and remove the checkpoints. The elders also announced that a three-day Pashtun National Jirga would be convened to highlight issues faced by residents of Chaman and other districts.

ISLAMABAD: A local court on Tuesday extended the interim bail of PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in the May 9 cases and five other matters, while directing the former prime minister to appear at the next hearing either in person or through video link.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the pre-arrest bail applications. Advocate Shamsa Kayani appeared on behalf of the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi. However, arguments on the bail pleas could not be advanced due to the unavailability of the ex-PM.
Consequently, the court extended the interim bail and adjourned the hearing till Jan 27, directing that the PTI founder’s appearance be ensured on the next date.
Apart from the May 9 cases, other cases, including attempt to murder and submission of alleged fake receipts, have been registered against the former prime minister. A separate case pertaining to the alleged submission of fake receipts related to Toshakhana gifts has also been lodged against Bushra Bibi.
Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Chaudhry Amir Zia also extended Bushra Bibi’s interim bail on her pre-arrest bail application and adjourned the matter till Jan 27. A case was registered against her at the Ramna police station under the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act and other relevant provisions.
Meeting denied again
Separately, PTI lawyer Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry was once again not allowed to meet Imran Khan to obtain his signature on the power of attorney papers for filing an appeal against his recent conviction in the Toshakhana case.
The PTI condemned what it termed “deliberate obstructions” to the party founder’s right to appeal in the Toshakhana-II case, alleging that prison authorities were preventing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi from meeting their counsel at Adiala jail to sign the power of attorney. In a statement, the party said that making the PTI founder’s counsel wait for hours, closing the legal desk and denying facilitation for execution of the power of attorney amounted to a “planned attempt to obstruct access to justice”.
The PTI maintained that under Rules 178 and 179 of the Punjab Prison Rules, 1978, every prisoner has the legal right to meet his/her lawyer, sign legal documents and file an appeal, adding that prison authorities were not empowered to create hurdles in this regard.
The party further alleged that the denial of the right to appeal violated Articles 10-A, 4, 9, and 25 of the Constitution, and demanded immediate and unhindered access of the ex-PM to his counsel to enable him to pursue his legal remedies.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday approved the process for the auction of 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum within two months, followed by the rollout of 5G internet in five to six months, on the recommendation of a US-based consultancy firm.
The decision was made at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, which also approved a Rs20bn (more than $7m) bailout package for Pakistan International Airlines Investment Limited (PIA-IL) to discharge $4m tax liability against Roosevelt Hotel, New York, and other domestic loan liabilities.
Speaking at a no-questions-asked recorded statement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khwaja said the new spectrum auction, to be completed by early February, would be ten times larger than the 60MHz auctioned over all past auctions put together because internet congestion was a major constraint to the nation’s digitisation transformation.
The finance minister said recommendations for the spectrum auction were prepared by National Economic Research Associates (NERA), based on experiences in recent spectrum auctions in other countries, including process, pricing mechanism, auction and implementation strategies. He said the success of digitisation, digital inclusion and financial inclusion was linked to faster, cheaper and better processes, and unsold spectrum was directly translating into economic losses.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima said that under the ECC decision, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) would complete all spectrum auctions by the end of January or early February because Pakistan was behind regional competitors due to the unavailability of spectrum capacity.

 

She said Pakistan’s 245m population had access to only 274MHz spectrum compared to 600MHz available to the 175m people of Bangladesh. That was the major reason for internet traffic congestion in Pakistan, she said, adding, “This means we are using two lanes for traffic which requires eight lanes…your internet does not work and you face challenges.”
She said the upcoming auction would not only improve 3G and 4G services but also enable the launch of 5G, and more international operators would enter the country. The operators would be obligated, under the terms of the auction, to roll out all spectrums within four to six months, so that service improvements become visible to the people in five to six months and to be followed by 5G rollout in six months.
Ms Khwaja said the internet was a basic ingredient to the government’s digitisation efforts, for which the Digital Nation Pakistan Act 2025 had already been put in place. According to Connect 2030, to be inaugurated by the prime minister soon, the government would ensure that over the next five years, the minimum connectivity available to users should be 100 Mbps.
Under the decision, Pakistan would now be offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands, including 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz and new bands 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600 and 3500MHz band are considered conducive to 5G.
PIA bailout
The ECC also approved about Rs20bn (about $7m) bailout to PIA-IL against $17.5m demanded by the Defence Division to meet tax liabilities of Roosevelt Hotel due on January 1, 2026.
In October, the Ministry of Defence sought around $17.5 million to meet urgent liabilities at the Manhattan property, which could require up to $20m to restart operations pending a joint-venture arrangement through the Privatisation Commission. The hotel’s $200m lease with New York City, under which it housed migrants, was terminated earlier this year.
The ECC had directed PIA-IL and the ministry to hold separate deliberations with the Ministry of Finance to rationalise their demand, which appeared exaggerated to the committee members. These meetings led to the identification of $4m tax payable by the end of the current month to avoid any adverse action in the United States.
In addition, the company was also in default in debt servicing to the National Bank of Pakistan, for which another $3.5m equivalent of rupee cover was approved for settlements and rollovers.

Inflows in November alone amounted to $511m, relatively higher than $471m in October, but almost 46pc lower than $944m in the same month of last year.
Of the total, foreign loan inflows rose 46.22pc to $2.521bn in 5MFY26 compared to $1.724bn last year. Grants, on the other hand, fell by 43pc to $54m from $94m in the same period last year.
These inflows do not include $1.2bn disbursed by the IMF early this month and would be accounted for later.

MoF reports Pakistan receives over $3.03bn, including grants

The target for total foreign inflows for current year has been set at $19.9bn compared to $19.4bn last year.
In July-November of 2023, Pakistan was able to materialise more than $4.3bn mainly because of signing of the 9-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF. As a result, Pakistan received a major injection of $2bn in time deposit from Saudi Arabia. In fact, total inflows in July 2023 had amounted to $5.1bn that also included $1.2bn from the IMF and another $1bn from the UAE.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs on Tuesday said that total foreign inflows in 5MFY26 stood at $3.032bn compared to $2.667bn last year. The EAD said that out of total inflows, $1.157bn was received for project financing compared while non-project inflows amounted to $1.875bn.
This meant about $966m loans were received in five months for budget support. This is despite the fact that annual target for budget support this year was set at $13.5bn compared to $15bn last year. The authorities were also able to materialise $500m against Saudi Oil facility in five months, at a set rate of $100m each month, of the fiscal year against an annual target of $1bn.
Against a full year target of $5bn from multilaterals (excluding IMF), Pakistan got only $1.258bn in five months from multilateral lenders against $1.46bn of same period last year when the annual target was $4.5bn.
Total inflows from bilateral lenders (other than three strategic friendly countries) in five months of the year amounted to $808m against annual target of $1.36bn but was 200pc higher than $269m of same period last year when the full year target was $523m.
Total inflows from bilateral and multilateral lenders amounted to $2.066bn in five months of this year against the annual target of $6.4b. Last year, the government had secured $1.73bn from bilateral and multilaterals against annual target of $5.05bn.
Inflows from overseas Pakistanis increased to $966m in five months, up from $735m of same period last year in the shape of Naya Pakistan Certificates. The government has targeted a total of $609m through these certificates during the current year, which has already been surpassed by a wide margin.
The full year $19.9bn target for current fiscal year includes $6.4bn from both multilateral and bilateral lenders including $5.05bn from multilaterals and $1.36bn from bilateral lenders, $400m in international bonds, $3.1bn foreign commercial loans, $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn SAFE deposit from China.
