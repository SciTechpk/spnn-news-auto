Mr Rind said the government took immediate action after an illegal use of a government vehicle was discovered.
Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir removed the officials and ordered a “transparent investigation… to identify all those involved in this illegal practice and ensure they are held accountable under the law.”
Mr Rind emphasised that the misuse of public resources is unacceptable and that the government is pursuing a zero-tolerance policy on this matter.
“The law is equal for everyone, and any abuse of authority will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he said.
The government is implementing stricter measures to ensure the honest and efficient use of public assets and to keep state machinery dedicated to serving the public, Mr Rind said.
He affirmed that action will be taken against anyone found guilty, in line with the administration’s commitment to transparent governance and accountability.
Law challenged
Separately, former senator Nawabzada Haji Lashkari Khan Raisani on Monday challenged the recently passed Mines and Minerals Act 2025 in the Balochistan High Court, claiming it undermines local rights and was passed by an “illegitimate assembly”.
Mr Raisani filed the constitutional petition, which was submitted on his behalf by Supreme Court Advocate Muha­mmad Riaz Ahmed.
The JUI-F and Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party have already filed separate petitions and the Balochistan National Party-Mengal has announced its intent to do the same.
After filing the petition, Mr Raisani told the media he contested the legitimacy of the assembly that passed the law, calling it a “dummy house” formed through a “hybrid political plan”.
“This Act, morally, has no weight as it has no mandate of the real representatives of the public,” Mr Raisani said.
He claimed the act was being used to grant resource rights to outside interests, endangering the province’s future.
“It is legalised plunder, endangering the rights of future generations,” Mr Raisani said.
He alleged that 17 land allotments comprising millions of acres in areas including Qila Abdullah, Zhob, Chagai and Washuk had already been made to non-local people under the new law.
The senior politician framed the issue as one of existential importance for the region.

“The federal cabinet has formally approved the summary for the creation of the PVARA, a landmark step towards establishing a comprehensive legal and institutional framework for overseeing the country’s rapidly growing digital assets ecosystem”, said a statement issued by the Ministry of Finance.
“The cabinet’s approval is a critical inflexion point in this journey. Once legislated, the authority will be responsible for issuing licences, supervising VASPs, setting technical standards, and coordinating compliance with FATF, IMF, and World Bank guidelines,” the statement said, adding that it will also oversee public protection mechanisms, anti-money laundering protocols, and cyber risk mitigation across all virtual asset transactions within the country.
This coordinated approach, combining sovereign asset reserves, surplus energy deployment and robust regulation, reflects Pakistan’s ambition to become a digital assets hub in South Asia. By building trust, attracting foreign investment, and fostering innovation in the blockchain sector, Pakistan is setting the foundations for a secure, inclusive, and future-proof digital economy, the statement added.

New authority to licence and monitor crypto platforms under FATF guidelines

This milestone comes less than four months after the launch of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on March 14, which marked the beginning of a new era in Pakistan’s digital finance journey, the statement said, adding that since then the PCC has led a nationwide push to regulate and enable blockchain technology, digital currencies, and tokenized assets in a responsible and innovation-friendly manner.
The PCC also welcomed international blockchain leaders and experts, including former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, as strategic advisors to help shape Pakistan’s regulatory outlook.
The council consists of key institutional stakeholders, including the of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan chairman, the State Bank governor, federal secretaries of Law and Information Technology divisions to ensure a whole-of-government approach to digital asset regulation.
This was followed by an announcement on May 28 —  by Bilal Bin Saqib, the PCC chief executive at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas — to form Pakistan’s first Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a sovereign reserve intended to hold Bitcoin for long-term national benefit and macroeconomic resilience.
Further advancing this momentum, the government announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres, leveraging Pakistan’s untapped energy potential to power the future of digital finance and computation. Strategic partnerships are underway to ensure that energy-intensive blockchain infrastructure is both sustainable and revenue-generating, the MoF said.
Pakistan is emerging as one of the most promising frontier markets for digital assets, with over 40 million crypto users and an estimated annual trading volume of $300 billion, according to industry sources. Despite previous regulatory ambiguity, Pakistani youth have been early adopters of blockchain technologies, with over 70pc of the population under the age of 30.

• Wants authorities to put an end to such practices
ISLAMABAD: Highlighting the legal and ethical ramifications of media coverage during criminal investigations, the Supreme Court on Monday urged media professionals to exercise responsibility in order to safeguard the rights of both the accused and victims while reporting on criminal proceedings.
“A disproportionate and excessive media spotlight and the manner it is presented is likely to create perceptions of guilt and influence the public as well as those who are associated with the criminal proceedings,” observed Justice Athar Minallah in a 25-page judgement.
Justice Minallah headed a three-judge bench that took up the appeal of accused Shahid Ali against the March 15, 2021, decision of the Sindh High Court which had upheld the death sentence earlier awarded by the trial court.
The case involved the gruesome murder of a seven-year-old boy, Wasim Akram, in Karachi. The boy’s body was discovered in a water tank on March 9, 2014. The appellant, Shahid Ali, was convicted under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and sentenced to death by the trial court. However, the Supreme Court acquitted him, extending the benefit of doubt, and directed that he be released forthwith.
The controversy arose when a journalist interviewed the appellant while he was on physical remand and in the custody of the investigating officer (IO). This interview was later aired on a private television channel on March 27, 2014, in its programme Jurm Bolta Hai.
Calling the case a classic example, the judgement pointed out that the accused was in custody under a court-ordered physical remand solely for investigation purposes. He was presumed to be innocent, but the in-charge of the police station and the IO granted a journalist access to interview him in custody.
The statement was recorded on camera and disseminated to the general public via the television broadcast. The judgement expressed concern for the victim’s family, who may also have been adversely affected by this act.
The court found that the police officials had adopted a process they were presumed to know was unlawful and one that could lead to grave violations of the rights of the accused. Their actions created a perception of guilt, despite the fact that the accused was in custody solely for investigation and had not yet been charged, nor had the investigation concluded.

Takes notice of broadcast of interview with accused in custody

The inadmissible purported confession was broadcast to the public, the judgement said, even though the accused had not been produced before a competent magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure
Code (CrPC).
The judgement also criticised the frequent practice of electronic media showing accused persons paraded before cameras or being questioned by reporters while in custody. Such practices gravely violate the rights of the accused and undermine the fairness of criminal trials, the court observed.
The court emphasised that both federal and provincial governments must take immediate and effective measures to ensure such practices come to an end.
The judgement also reminded the media — both print and electronic — of their responsibility to self-regulate their reporting and adopt standard operating procedures aligned with international best practices.
It called on regulatory authorities to propose such SOPs in consultation with stakeholders, with the aim of protecting the rights of the parties involved, particularly during investigations.
The court ordered its office to dispatch copies of the judgement to the interior and information secretaries, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), and the chief secretaries of the provinces, directing them to take immediate steps to protect the rights of those involved in criminal proceedings and to safeguard the integrity and fairness of investigations and trials.

Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, told the General Assembly that these groups were operating from ungoverned spaces inside Afghanistan.
His warning came amid a surge in terrorist violence in Pakistan in recent weeks. On June 28, a suicide attacker rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a military convoy in North Waziristan, killing 16 soldiers and injuring several civilians. Days later, five senior officials — including an Assistant Commissioner — were killed in Bajaur when a roadside bomb hit their vehicle during a routine visit.
Ambassador Ahmad noted that many of these attacks are carried out with sophisticated weapons and equipment left behind by international forces following their 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.
“These weapons have been used by Afghan-based terrorists to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks against Pakistan, including in the last two weeks,” he said.
Pakistan’s envoy said that the TTP, with an estimated 6,000 fighters, was the largest UN-designated terrorist group operating from Afghan soil, and poses a threat, not just to Pakistan, but to regional and global stability as well. He also identified other groups active in Afghanistan, including IS-Khorasan, Al Qaeda, and various Baloch separatist factions.
“We must ensure that Afghanistan does not become a breeding ground for terrorists that threaten its neighbours and the broader international community,” he said, urging the United Nations and regional powers to act against “spoilers” who could reignite conflict in the region.
 






Secretary-level talks
Meanwhile, Kabul and Islamabad held their first-ever additional secretary-level talks on Monday, in line with the agreement reached during Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Afghanistan in April.
Additional Secretary (Afghanistan & West Asia) Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani represented the Pakistani side while the Afghan side was led by First Political Division DG at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor. The two sides discussed trade and transit cooperation, security, and connectivity, the FO statement said.
Both sides also termed terrorism a serious threat to regional peace and agreed the region can’t develop without addressing security issues. Emphasising the need for “concrete actions against terrorist groups operating on Afghan soil”, the Pakistani delegation noted that such groups undermine the security and hinder regional development.
The meeting also reviewed measures to boost trade, including the facilitation of Afghan transit trade, the removal of 10 per cent processing fee, provision of an insurance guarantee, reduction in scanning and examination, and operationalisation of the track and trace system.

But is the state listening? In the aftermath of DawnMedia’s Breathe Pakistan conference held earlier this year, a Climate Justice Declaration has now been drawn up. It outlines a clear path for how the country must rethink its relationship with the environment and respond to the climate crisis.
But while the citizens call for transformation, the government continues to respond with tokenism. Labelled as Pakistan’s first-ever ‘climate budget’, the FY26 budget should have marked a turning point. Instead, it has revealed the government’s shallow engagement with the climate challenge.
As noted, the budget resorts to greenwashing — using the language of sustainability to mask what are essentially tax measures. A Rs2.5 per litre carbon levy on petroleum products and a 10pc tax on imported solar panels are presented as climate-friendly, yet they disproportionately burden the poor and discourage renewable adoption.
 
 

Meanwhile, coal-based power projects continue unchecked, and fossil fuel consumption remains central to energy policy. This is not climate leadership; it is revenue collection dressed in green.
This budget fails where it matters most: in building resilience. Pakistan is among the world’s most climate-vulnerable countries. Yet, instead of helping communities prepare for and survive climate shocks, the budget continues to pour money into mitigation-heavy projects like dams and infrastructure. While such investments may be a part of long-term goals, they do little for the millions already losing homes, livelihoods and lives to today’s climate disasters. According to analyses, 87pc of the climate budget is earmarked for mitigation, while only 10pc is allocated to adaptation. The tragic deaths of 18 tourists in the Swat river are only the latest reminder that climate volatility is not some distant worry — it is our present reality.
The government must urgently move beyond superficial gestures. To begin with, climate decisions must be based on facts, not politics — guided by independent science and open to public scrutiny.
Second, the government must focus on helping the people and places already hit hard by funding flood protection, rebuilding damaged areas and preparing for future disasters, instead of waiting until it’s too late.
Third, we must stop copying foreign models and back local solutions that actually work — from traditional farming practices to community-led forest protection. Real climate action needs serious reform. The government should stop dragging its feet, set up the promised climate authority, fund key sectors like forests and farming and hold polluters and officials accountable. Parliament must study, debate and translate this climate declaration into law.
Climate justice demands laws that work, budgets that deliver and a government that leads from the front. Most of all, it requires collective resolve — not just from citizens, but from those in power.

• Countries aligning with BRICS threatened with steeper tariffs
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced tariffs of 25 per cent on Japan and South Korea on Monday, stepping up pressure on the two key US allies and a dozen other economies to reach trade deals with Washington.
Trump issued similar letters to Malaysia, Myanmar, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Laos, saying he would slap duties on their products ranging from 25pc to 40pc.
However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday that Trump would sign an executive order later in the day to delay his original July 9 deadline for steeper tariffs to take effect — postponing their imposition to August 1.
Besides Japan and South Korea, she added, there would be approximately 12 other partners receiving letters from Trump soon.
With the deadline extension, Leavitt noted that Trump would set out the “reciprocal tariff rate” for partners in the coming month as negotiations continue.
Asked why Trump opted to start with South Korea, Leavitt said: “It’s the President’s prerogative, and those are the countries he chose.”
“This announcement will send a chilling message to others,” said Asia Society Policy Institute Vice President Wendy Cutler, referring to Trump’s initial announcements on Tokyo and Seoul.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believed there would be a number of deals coming up: “We are going to have several announcements in the next 48 hours.”
Trump imposed a 10 per cent tariff on imports from almost all trading partners in early April, but some economies including the European Union were slated to have this rate increase further. As markets plunged at the time, Trump halted the steeper levies to allow for talks. That pause expires on Wednesday.
‘Anti-American policies’
Also, in a social media post on Monday, Trump threatened another 10pc tariff on countries aligning themselves with the emerging BRICS nations, accusing them of “Anti-American policies” after they slammed his duties at a summit.
 

Screengrab from Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump

On Sunday, BRICS leaders described Trump’s stop-start tariff wars as “indiscriminate”, damaging, and illegal, drawing a quick rebuke from the pugilistic US president.
The 11-nation grouping — which also includes US allies Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia — is concluding a two-day summit in Rio de Janeiro.
BRICS members account for about half the world’s population and 40pc of global economic output.
Some US allies inside the bloc had tried to blunt criticism by not mentioning Trump by name in their summit statement.
Saudi Arabia — one of the world’s biggest purchasers of US high-tech weapons — even kept its foreign minister away from Sunday’s talks and a BRICS “family photo” of leaders, seemingly to avoid Washington’s ire.
Climate financing
Earlier, the leaders of the BRICS addressed the shared challenges of global warming on Monday, the final day of their summit in Rio de Janeiro, demanding that wealthy nations fund mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in poorer nations.
In his opening remarks, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva blasted denialism of the climate emergency, indirectly criticising President Trump’s decision to pull his country out of the 2015 Paris Agreement.
“The Global South is in a position to lead a new development paradigm without repeating the mistakes of the past.”
A joint statement from BRICS leaders released on Sunday argued that petroleum will continue to play an important role in the global energy mix, particularly in developing economies.
In their joint statement, BRICS leaders also underscored that providing climate finance “is a responsibility of developed countries towards developing countries,” which is the standard position for emerging economies in global negotiations.
The BRICS leaders also blasted policies such as carbon border taxes and anti-deforestation laws, which Europe recently adopted, for imposing what they called “discriminatory protectionist measures” under the pretext of environmental concerns.

In an evolving global environment, states are avoiding hardcore military alliances and embracing like-minded countries for issue-based cooperation. Some recent examples of such alliances are the Quad in the Indo-Pacific region and I2U2 in the Middle East. Pakistan seems to have learned this lesson and is following a similar path to secure its interests in the South Asian region.
During May and June, Pakistan, with China’s help, established stronger cooperation with two important regional countries — Afghanistan and Bangladesh. While the Strategic Dialogue Forum of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan was established a decade ago, it has gained prominence recently due to regional geopolitical dynamics. In May, the trilateral dialogue culminated in improved diplomatic ties between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Similarly, in June, Bangladesh, China and Pakistan held trilateral talks, during which they pledged to enhance cooperation in various spheres. It seems Pakistan is eager to establish a ‘South Asian Quad’ — a forum fundamentally immune to Indian interventions.
Why is Pakistan eager to establish minilateral forums? There are several considerations that have pushed Islamabad to adopt minilateralism as an important pillar of its foreign policy in South Asia.
First, Islamabad is concerned about Saarc’s ineffectiveness. This South Asian forum for regional cooperation has not held a summit-level meeting for over a decade. New Delhi’s decision to boycott the summit in Islamabad, and later, its consistent refusal to revive Saarc, dashed Islamabad’s hopes for regionalism. Furthermore, New Delhi’s eagerness to strengthen Bimstec as a parallel to Saarc pushed Pakistan to seek options beyond the South Asian forum.
Second, in contrast to major regional organisations, minilateral forums deliver quick results, because they are generally established for specific issues. The trilateral forum of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan has achieved several milestones in the recent past. China has agreed to build the Pakistan-Afghanistan-Uzbekistan railway project. This strategic forum has also helped mitigate irritants between Afghanistan and Pakistan. These successes have encouraged Pakistan to push for a similar  forum with Bangladesh.

Minilateral forums deliver quick results.

Third, Islamabad considers China  a stabilising factor in South Asia. Beijing’s ability to challenge Indian influence in South Asia has been viewed positively by Islamabad. Beijing’s role in South Asia has been significantly enhanced during the past decade. Except for Bhutan and India, all South Asian countries are signatories to the Belt and Road Initiative. China has pledged over $100 billion in these countries in various capacities. Therefore, Beijing has greater stakes in South Asia. Previously, Pakistan had proposed China as a dialogue partner of Saarc, but India rejected the idea. In Saarc’s absence, Pakistan is free to bring Beijing into the South Asian equation.
Fourth, the regional geopolitical environment is also conducive for such a forum. In 2016, India’s boycott of the Saarc summit in Islamabad was supported by Afghanistan, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Today, the altered domestic political environment of these countries has changed their attitude towards Pakistan. Bang­ladesh’s leadership has repeatedly echoed its desire for Saarc’s revival. Pakistan’s proactive approach, growing calls for Saarc’s revival by member states, and India’s refusal to re­vive Saarc have created fertile gro­und for alternative forums.
Naturally, New Delhi is concerned about these developments in its nei­ghbourhood. For New Delhi, creating such forums would be tantamount to its ‘strategic encirclement’. New Delhi has always viewed South Asia as its primary sphere of influence, and China’s growing influence in the region is a major concern for it. Although New Delhi could repair its ties with smaller South Asian states if it wanted to, the temptation of economic and strategic cooperation with the China-Pakistan duo might be too much to ignore.
Whether China and Pakistan continue to engage South Asian states —excluding New Delhi — by establishing strategic dialogue forums or create a ‘South Asian Quad’, the major concern will remain the sustainability of such a platform. In Bangladesh’s case, the interim government seems eager to be part of such forums, but will the next elected government there continue to cooperate with similar enthusiasm? Secondly, New Delhi’s strategic reaction to such arrangements will also determine the future prospects of such forums. However, for now, time is on Pakistan’s side and Islamabad is seizing this strategic moment.

Hindutva and its leaders are all about a parochial and violent quest at home they want to fulfil by tearing up a centuries-old social fabric, a challenge in which they will likely never succeed. Their USP was their anti-communism. The West needed it for its Cold War objectives. The West backed a military coup in Pakistan where communist parties were banned. In India, they had Nehru’s Fabian socialism to keep them in check. In any case, the comrades quarrelled with each other so furiously that they lost the plot. The Hindu right remained united and fleet-footed. It used the left to come to power first in 1977 and then in 1990. It didn’t need help after that.
Successful at home, the Hindu right fell on its face, dealing with the wider world on equal terms. The Congress had inherited its instinct for diplomacy from Nehru and Indira Gandhi, which the Hindutva right lacked. Its anti-communist USP was of little use post-Cold War, so it found other ways of courting the US, for example by joining anti-China military measures. Hindutva’s obsequiously pro-Western diplomacy found earlier occasions to bungle. When A.B. Vajpayee was foreign minister, Moshe Dayan paid a secret visit to Delhi, but the story was leaked. Jimmy Carter came, but lost the election.
The Shah of Iran was invited, but was overthrown soon after visiting Delhi. This is hilarious. Vajpayee struggled to find a Shia maulvi as a conduit to the new Khomeini regime. It picked the wrong cleric, who was publicly berated by Khomeini as a pretender. Hindutva’s proximity to Israel suggests they need the Chabahar port without investing the political capital in Iran. The bungling continues today. They tapped Sheikh Hasina as an ally and had to contend with her opponents, who chased her out to India. They canvassed for Donald Trump. He lost. When they didn’t canvas for him, he won. The result was humiliating. Hapless Indians were deported in handcuffs and fetters.
Skipping the Brics summit in Brazil at the weekend, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping allowed member states to give that extra space to the next important member in the group, India. And India under Narendra Modi’s watch always craves that extra spotlight. There’s an anomaly here, however. Under Modi’s leadership, India is seen as lacking the enthusiasm it once had for ushering radical change, the kind that Brics promises.
Hindutva’s self-limiting interests hobble India’s foreign relations. At the Brics summit, a little extra attention and encouraging applause should have been a great psychological boost to revive Delhi’s sagging profile. Going by Indian news headlines, however, a singular achievement for the country’s engagements at the global meet was the collective criticism by Brics of the Pahalgam terror attack. The media’s myopic obsession with Pakistan is of a piece with Hindutva’s worldview. The Brics statement, though critical of cross-border terrorism, would not name Pakistan, giving Delhi a point to ponder.
It was not the first diplomatic shock for Delhi over the Pahalgam horror. Donald Trump’s White House lunch with Pakistan’s army chief, who led the response to Modi’s Operation Sindoor, didn’t help. More recently, the Quad foreign ministers also condemned the April 22 tragedy — who wouldn’t? — but again stopped there. Deliberately bad relations with Pakistan are dictated by the communal appetite of Hindu nationalism, which is, of course, not quite the same thing as national interest.

The ability to cultivate friends in the neighbourhood comes with hard work and lots of humility, which the Hindu right clearly lacks.

For far too long, to Hindutva’s chagrin, the world had got accustomed to engaging with India’s Nehruvian élan that came with an upright moral spine. It may be difficult to believe for those who weren’t around, that there was a time when Indian passports were valid for every country except South Africa and Israel. One of Nelson Mandela’s first foreign tours as a free man was to India. The fight against apartheid was India’s national commitment to its own people. Israel’s commercial office in Bombay would issue visas on a separate document for Indians who needed to visit the country.
Nehru pitched India as a comrade of post-colonial Africa and Asia. Though Pablo Neruda met him without being too impressed, Che Guevara saw a kindred spirit in him. His political mettle was formidable and held in awe by friends and foes alike.
From his role as an honest broker in winding down the Korean War to his conjuring and launching the Non-Aligned Movement at the Belgrade summit in 1961, Nehru commanded respect. While NAM was regarded with suspicion in the West as a Soviet cat’s paw, which it wasn’t, Nehru inaugurated the Belgrade summit and within weeks was visiting Washington as JFK’s guest in November 1961.
For those who closely watch who was invited where and who wasn’t, or who spoke to whom on the phone and who initiated the call, Nehru’s arrival turned into a class act. Kennedy broke protocol and climbed to the door of Nehru’s plane to welcome him. This was way before China attacked India and Nehru would need Kennedy’s help. In any case, Kennedy was neck deep in trouble as he strained his sinews to save the world from nuclear annihilation.
The ability to cultivate friends in the neighbourhood comes with hard work and lots of humility, which the Hindu right clearly lacks. It was at a Saarc summit in 2004 in Pakistan where Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Pervez Musharraf met for a bilateral meeting. The outcome included a commitment by Pakistan not to allow terrorist activity against India from its soil. The implication was that terrorism or what passes for it can only be countered politically. Soon after Vajpayee gained that wisdom, however, he lost the elections. And the Hindu right returned to its old ways, tearing up the country at home, and squandering India’s hard-won prestige abroad.

The latest round of negotiations on the war in Gaza began on Sunday in Doha, aiming to broker a ceasefire and reach an agreement on the release of Israeli prisoners in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
A Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations told AFP a second session was held on Monday and ended with “no breakthrough”.
The Hamas and Israeli delegations were due to resume talks later on Monday, the official said.

Palestinian group’s response to US-backed ceasefire proposal, had ‘unacceptable’ demands, says Israeli PM

Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official said the delegations had exchanged views on Sunday via mediators, with representatives of the two sides seated in different rooms in the same building.
Ahead of Netanyahu’s third visit since Trump’s return to office this year, the US president said there was a “good chance we have a deal with Hamas… during the coming week”.
“We’ve gotten a lot of the out, but pertaining to the remaining [prisoners], quite a few of them will be coming out,” he told journalists.
Netanyahu, speaking before heading to Washington, said his meeting with Trump could “definitely help advance this” deal after 21 months of war.
Netanyahu said he had dispatched the team to the Qatari capital with “clear instructions” to reach an agreement “under the conditions that we have agreed to”.
He previously said Hamas’s response to a draft US-backed ceasefire proposal, conveyed through Qatari and Egyptian mediators, contained “unacceptable” demands.
Two Palestinian sources close to the discussions had earlier told AFP the proposal included a 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release 10 living Israeli prisoners and several bodies in exchange for Palestinians detained by Israel.
However, they said, the group was also demanding certain conditions for Israel’s withdrawal, guarantees against a resumption of fighting during negotiations, and the return of the UN-led aid distribution system.
 
 

Trump is scheduled to meet the Israeli premier on Monday, the White House said, without the usual presence of journalists.
In Israel’s coastal hub of Tel Aviv, hours before the meeting, an AFP photographer said dozens of people including relatives of Israeli prisoners demonstrated to demand their release.
“President Trump — make history. Bring them all home. End the war,” read a sign held by protesters outside the US diplomatic mission in the city.
Of the 251 Israeli prisoners taken by Palestinian fighters during the Hamas attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, but the Israeli military believes that 27 of them are dead.
Recent efforts to broker a truce have repeatedly failed, with the primary point of contention being Israel’s rejection of Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire.
In Gaza, the civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 12 people on Monday, including six in a clinic housing people displaced by the war.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties in accessing many areas mean media are unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.
Salman Qudum, who survived the attack on the clinic in Gaza City, said: “We don’t know where to go or what to do.” Qudum said the negotiators and mediators in Doha must “apply pressure” to secure a ceasefire “because the people can’t take this anymore”.
In a statement on Monday, the Israeli military claimed it had struck “dozens of terrorists, weapons depots, observation posts, military buildings and other terror infrastructures” across Gaza over the past 24 hours.
The war has created dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people in the Gaza Strip.
A US- and Israel-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), took the lead in food distribution in the territory in late May, when Israel partially lifted a more than two-month blockade on aid deliveries.
 
 

But its operations have had a chaotic rollout, with repeated reports of aid seekers killed near its facilities while awaiting rations.

The United States was shocked at the disaster over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, and forecasters warned of more flooding as rain falls on saturated ground.
“Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy,” Camp Mystic said in a statement confirming the 27 deaths at the all-girls camp, located next to a river.
The White House on Monday put the overall number of dead from the flooding at 91, while Texas Senator Ted Cruz told reporters that the toll was continuing to rise.

27 girls, camp counsellors among the deceased

“Texas is grieving right now — the pain, the shock of what has transpired these last few days has broken the heart of our state,” Cruz told reporters.
“The children, little girls, who were lost at Camp Mystic, that’s every parent’s nightmare.” Camps are a beloved tradition in the long US summer holidays, with children often staying in woods, parks and other rural areas.
Cruz described them as a chance to make “lifetime friends — and then suddenly it turns to tragedy.”
President Donald Trump is planning to visit Texas on Friday, the White House said, as it slammed critics claiming his cuts to weather agencies had weakened warning systems.
Helicopters and boats were taking part in the grim search across an area popular with tourists as well as summer camps.
Camp Mystic was a Christian camp where about 750 people had been staying when the floodwaters struck.
In a terrifying display of nature’s power, the rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached treetops and the roofs of cabins as girls at the camp slept.
Blankets, teddy bears and other belongings were caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.
Months’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours on Thursday night into Friday, and rain has continued in bouts since then.
The Guadalupe surged around 26 feet (eight metres) — more than a two-story building — in just 45 minutes.
“Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy,” the camp said in a statement on Monday.
Richard Eastland, 70, the co-owner and director of Camp Mystic, died trying to save the children at his camp during the flood.
“If he wasn’t going to die of natural causes, this was the only other way, saving the girls that he so loved and cared for,” Eastland’s grandson, George Eastland, wrote on Instagram.
In Hill County, where the worst flooding occurred, two to four inches of more rain were expected to fall, with isolated areas getting up to 10 inches of rain.
The weather service issued a flood watch through Monday night in the region.  State emergency management officials had warned on Thursday, ahead of the July 4 holiday, that parts of central Texas faced the possibility of heavy showers and flash floods based on weather forecasts.
Confluence of disaster
But twice as much rain as was predicted ended up falling over two branches of the Guadalupe just upstream of the fork where they converge, sending all of that water racing into the single river channel where it slices through Kerrville, a local official said. Governor Greg Abbott said the circumstances of the flooding, and the adequacy of weather forecasts and warning systems, would be scrutinised once the immediate situation was brought under control.
In the meantime, search-and-rescue operations were continuing, with hundreds of emergency personnel on the ground contending with a myriad of challenges.

• Muqam says no plan to roll back merger; federation has ‘responsibility to solve provincial problems’
ISLAMABAD: As a committee formed by the prime minister to bring reforms in the ex-Fata region met on Monday, the PTI leaders called out the federal government for alleged attempts to roll back the merger of the tribal districts, with the committee convenor Amir Muqam shooting down these claims as exaggerated.
The committee was formed last month apparently to revive the ‘jirga system’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for an ‘effective alternate dispute mechanism’.
It is supposed to examine proposals for the revival of the jirga system and strengthening of the civil administration in the province. Headed by PML-N’s Amir Muqam, its members are Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
The PTI, however, boycotted the Monday meeting and held a press conference instead, rejecting the committee as a “blatant constitutional violation” and “a political stunt to undermine provincial autonomy”. It said the body should be dissolved immediately. The PTI said the Centre through its actions was undermining provincial autonomy and asked the federal government to focus on paying over Rs700 billion owed to tribal districts.
In a joint press conference, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, flanked by party leaders Shah Farman, Sheikh Waqas Akram, and Iqbal Afridi, said that this was the second meeting of the ‘jirga committee’, but 14 out of 17 MPAs from ex-Fata were not part of the proceedings. He said this was a direct violation of constitutional and democratic rights.
The PTI leaders reiterated that following the 25th Constitutional Amendment, Fata had been merged into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and must be governed through its elected provincial representatives, not the federal nominees. Former KP governor Shah Farman warned against attempts to revive the colonial-era governance system, such as the draconian Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR).
“The federal government is staging all this drama to reassert control, using tools like the Mines and Minerals Bill to hijack provincial resources,” he alleged.
Iqbal Afridi, a former MNA from the tribal region, accused the federal government of fiscal discrimination. “Islamabad is taxing the people of Fata without providing them with their due share of funds and the new committee headed by a federal minister has no legal standing: it must be dissolved immediately,” he added.
Mr Akram said the committee was an attempt of intimidation. “This is not consultation—it’s coercion. The real ‘jirga’ already exists in the form of elected representatives. Fata’s people know how to protect their rights,” he stated.
However, PML-N’s Muqam, who heads the committee, hit back at the PTI in a press conference after the second meeting of the body. The Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan & States and Frontier Regions minister refuted the allegations that the government was planning to take back the administrative control of Fata from KP.
“Talks about ending the Fata merger are not true; FCR was a cruel and outdated law, and it was abolished by the PML-N,” he said, and emphasised that the merger should move forward under a unified national vision.
Highlighting the role of the federal government, the PML-N leader noted that, “Although it is being said this was a provincial matter, the federation has a responsibility to help solve provincial problems too.”
The minister commented that the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) representatives had participated in the committee meeting and said that JUI-F had its own position regarding the tribal districts. “But the goal should be collective national progress and it was disappointing that the PTI remained absent from the meeting; this is not responsible behaviour,” he added.
“Their members confirmed the participation in last night’s communication but later changed their minds, as the PTI members participated in the previous committee meetings they should have come to present their stance this time too,” he added.
Mr Muqam also clarified that the 18th Amendment was not being abolished, adding that the federal government wanted to work for Fata’s development within the current system.
In response to a question about whether the Centre planned to topple the KP government, the minister stated, “There is a time for everything, everything can happen — but there is no such plan for now.”
The erstwhile Fata comprised Bajaur Agency, Mohmand Agency, Khyber Agency, Orakzai Agency, Kurram Agency, North Waziristan Agency and South Waziristan Agency, which were converted into tribal districts and merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018 through a constitutional amendment. Before that, these agencies were semi-autonomous regions administered directly by the federal government under the FCR.

In a notification, the finance ministry said that an earlier order dated July 10, 2014 which capped earnings through board meetings of corporate entities at Rs1 million per annum, stood “withdrawn ab-initio” — meaning it was never issued.
The order, issued on June 12, 2024 with the approval of the then-federal cabinet, said that “government servants appointed to the board of companies/organisations and who become entitled to [a] fee, shall only be allowed to retain remuneration to a maximum of Rs1m in a financial year”.
Any amount in excess of Rs1m so received was required to be deposited by the officer in the government treasury.
The decision on capping meeting fees was originally announced by then finance minister Ishaq Dar almost a decade ago.
That order remained in the field for a couple of years and then ignored. It was categorically reiterated last year, but has now been ‘withdrawn ab-initio’, meaning that the amounts earned throughout FY2024-25 would become legalised as the earnings of those officers.
The finance ministry issued another notification for continuation of austerity measures, which have now also been extended to federal government’s attached departments, SOEs and statutory bodies including regulatory authorities.
In case of SOEs, “these austerity measures shall be considered a direction of the federal government under Section 35 of the SOEs (Governance & Operations) Act 2023 and under the relevant sections of their respective organic laws in the case of statutory bodies”, the notification said.
The restrictions include a complete ban on purchase of all types of vehicles. The ban also includes creation of new posts, treatment abroad and non-obligatory foreign visits at government expense.
Separately, the ministry also notified an increase of 7pc in net pension of all civil pensioners, including civilians paid from defense estimates, as well as retired armed forces personnel and civil armed forces personnel.

• KP records six deaths in Malakand, Karak, Buner and Manshera
• PM orders authorities to remain on their toes as NEOC forecasts ‘moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall’ till 10th
ISLAMABAD: Amid heavy monsoon rains, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) on Monday issued an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country over the next two days, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to extreme weather.
Moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall is expected till July 10, particularly in the catchment areas of all major rivers, which will likely cause flash flooding in various regions of Pakistan, according to the NEOC. The alert also prompted the prime minister to order the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and other authorities to remain on high alert to deal with potential emergency situations, particularly floods.
In Balochistan, at least seven people were killed and many others were injured as a result of the fresh monsoon spell over the past 48 hours, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said. Almost 22 districts of Balochistan have been affected by the rain, and PDMA has already issued an alert of heavy rains and flash floods. The PDMA confirmed seven deaths. It said that 22 houses were damaged while five houses were destroyed.
The areas which were badly affected by the monsoon spell included Awaran, Jhal Magsi, Khuzdar, Musakhail, Qila Saif­ullah, Barkhan, Kohlu, Loralai, and parts of Zhob and Sherani districts. “At least 22 districts of northern, southern and central Balochistan were affected while the monsoon spell is continuing in these districts,” said the PDMA officials.
“Washuk district bordering Iran was badly affected, where standing crops were washed away and many houses were damaged, which rendered a large number of people homeless,” officials confirmed and added that the rain also damaged solar panels in Loralai and Surab.
At least six people including three children drowned in rain-related incidents in different parts of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, police and emergency services reported.
 
 

In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, six persons lost their lives in Malakand, Buner, Manshera and Karak districts.
PM Shehbaz directed the National Disaster Management Authority, rescue agencies, and adm­inistrative authorities to remain on high alert to cope with any potential emergency.
He also expressed concern that the operation of the Tarbela Dam spillways may increase flooding in the lower districts along the Indus River.
Potential riverine flooding
According to NEOC’s forecast, increased water flows are expected in all major rivers, including Kabul, Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab. Currently, low flood levels are being observed at Tarbela, Kalabagh, and Chashma on the Indus River, while Taunsa is also expected to reach the low flood mark. River Chenab is likely to experience low flood levels at Marala and Khanki stations. River Kabul at Nowshera is expected to rise to low flood levels, while Swat and Panjkora Rivers, along with their associated streams and nullahs, may swell due to rainfall in their catchment areas. River Jhelum, along with its tributaries, is expected to experience elevated inflows, resulting in localised flash floods. Inflows at Mangla Dam on River Jhelum are projected to reach the low flood limit.
Hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts may once again become active, generating medium to high flows.
In Balochistan, nullahs and seasonal streams in the northeastern districts, including Jhal Magsi, Kachi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, and Musakhail are also likely to experience high flows.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, the Hunza and Shigar rivers may see increased water discharge.

Trump had said on the weekend that starting from today, he would send a first batch of up to 15 letters to countries informing them that he would reimpose harsh levies that he had postponed in April.
In near-identically worded letters to the Japanese and South Korean leaders, Trump said the tariffs would apply from August 1 because their trading relationships with Washington were “unfortunately, far from reciprocal”.
Trump warned the countries, both key US allies in East Asia, of an escalation if they responded to the new US tariffs.
But he also said he was ready to modify levies “downwards” if Japan and South Korea changed their trade policies.
Later, Trump also announced the US will impose 25pc tariffs on Malaysia and Kazakhstan, 30pc on South Africa and 40pc on Laos and Myanmar in letters posted on Truth Social.
Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Sunday that he “won’t easily compromise” in trade talks with Washington.
Trump originally announced sweeping tariffs on world economies on what he called “Liberation Day” on April 2, claiming the United States was being “ripped off”. Amid market turmoil, Trump then suspended the initial tariffs for 90 days, a deadline that expires on Wednesday.
But the Trump administration has said that the duties will not “boomerang” back until August 1, apparently extending the deadline despite denials from officials.
While the Trump administration has signalled hopes of striking dozens of deals by early July — at one point boasting of “90 deals in 90 days” — there have been limited results so far.
Washington has unveiled pacts with only Britain and Vietnam, while the US and China agreed to temporarily lower tariff levels on each other’s products that earlier reached three digits.
Later, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that 12 other countries will also receive letters about the new tariffs.
“President Trump will also sign an executive order today delaying the July 9 deadline to August 1, so that the reciprocal tariff rates or these new rates … will be going out the door within the next month and those countries continue to negotiate with the US,” she said during a press briefing.
She added that “in the effort of transparency”, the letter will continue to be posted to Truth Social.
When asked about which other countries would receive letters, Leavitt told reporters to “keep your eyes on Truth Social”.
 


‘Change their tune’
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there would be a number of deals coming up.
“We are going to have several announcements in the next 48 hours,” Bessent told CNBC in an interview today. “We’ve had a lot of people change their tune in terms of negotiations. So my mailbox was full last night with a lot of new offers, a lot of new proposals.”
There was no immediate response from the White House on whether Trump would formally extend the Wednesday deadline for the tariffs to snap back.
Asked about Trump’s letters, Bessent said these would inform partners of the tariff rate their products face when trading with the US unless they want to “come back and try to negotiate”.
Bessent told CNBC that he would “be meeting with my Chinese counterpart sometime in the next couple of weeks”. The two sides have so far held high-level talks in Geneva and London. But Washington and Beijing’s pause on tit-for-tat tariffs is due to expire in mid-August.
 


On whether he was disappointed in the number of trade deals achieved so far, Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro maintained that he is “happy with the progress we’ve had”.
“Every country that we run a major deficit with is fully engaged,” he told CNBC.
Trump has also threatened another 10pc tariff on countries aligning themselves with the emerging BRICS nations, accusing them of “Anti-American policies” after they slammed his duties at a summit.
For now, partners are still rushing to avert Trump’s tariffs altogether.
The European Commission said that EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had a “good exchange” with Trump on trade when the pair spoke on Sunday.</p><small>2025-07-07 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07232329d8f3699.jpg?r=234633' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922614/pakistan-afghanistan-recognise-terrorism-as-serious-threat-in-1st-round-of-additional-secretary-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan recognise terrorism as serious threat in 1st round of additional-secretary talks</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Afghanistan recognised terrorism as a serious threat as the inaugural round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism between the Foreign Ministries of Pakistan and Afghanistan was held in Islamabad on Monday.
The talks are the latest in a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the upgrading of each country’s diplomats from the rank of chargé d’affaires to ambassador.
According to a press release from the Foreign Office, the Pakistani delegation was led by Additional Secretary (Afghanistan and West Asia) Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani, while the Afghan side was led by the Director General of the First Political Division at the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mufti Noor Ahmad Noor.
 
“Discussions covered key areas of bilateral interest, including trade and transit cooperation, security, and connectivity. Both sides recognised terrorism as a serious threat to regional peace and security. The Pakistani side emphasised the need for concrete actions against terrorist groups operating on Afghan soil, noting that such groups undermine Pakistan’s security and hinder regional development.”
 
According to the FO, both sides discussed deepening trade and transit cooperation and reviewed the implementation of measures announced to facilitate Afghan transit trade during the April visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Kabul, including the removal of a 10 per cent processing fee, the provision of an insurance guarantee, reduction in scanning and examination and making the track and trace system operational.
 
The delegations “underlined the importance of enhanced regional connectivity as a catalyst for sustainable growth and shared prosperity”, the FO said, adding that they agreed to work towards finalising the framework agreement for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway.
 
“The two sides also discussed matters related to the repatriation of Afghan nationals,” the FO said.
 






According to the statement, Pakistan highlighted its efforts to facilitate documented travel from Afghanistan through the issuance of over 500,000 visas across a range of categories, such as medical, tourist, business, and study, from January 2024 till now.
“Both sides agreed to work together to further strengthen the legal movement of individuals across borders,” the press release read.
 
The delegations reaffirmed their commitment to sustaining engagement and addressing mutual challenges, the FO said.
“They recognised lasting security as a cornerstone for both the region’s optimal development as well as for further advancement of bilateral relations.”

Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com, “As per the family and the police record, the 19-year-old girl married in Lyari on June 15. She is now in a coma. Her physical examination findings are consistent with sexual violence.”
According to the contents of the first information report (FIR) registered at the Baghdadi Police Station on July 5 under Sections 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) and 376-B (punishment for gang-rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code, the complainant, the brother of the victim, said that he was a resident of Shah Beg Lane in Baghdadi, Lyari.
“On the third day of her marriage, my sister was subjected to brutal sexual violence allegedly by her husband. She remained admitted at a private hospital in the city and was later taken to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital Karachi in a critical condition the other day,” the FIR read.
The complainant said his 19-year-old sister married the suspect on June 15. Her health condition deteriorated on June 30, compelling the family to bring her back home. She informed the parents that on July 17, her husband subjected her to an “unnatural sexual act”, per the FIR.
It added that the husband also sexually assaulted her with a foreign object. Subsequently, the husband subjected her to sexual violence, leading to bleeding. As per the FIR, the suspect threatened his wife with “dire consequences” if she disclosed anything to anyone.
The complainant said the family took his sister to a private hospital on Garden Road when her condition deteriorated, but no improvement was seen. The in-laws again took the victim to their home. Later on, she was brought to the trauma centre on July 4, where she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), the FIR said, adding that the complainant was seeking legal proceedings against the suspect.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the suspect had been arrested and an investigation has been launched.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Last week, police had said that they had arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.
In May, two sisters were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors had said.
In April, in a rare verdict, an additional district and sessions judge in Gujranwala handed down 10-year rigorous imprisonment to a man for subjecting his wife to an unnatural sexual offence.</p><small>2025-07-07 17:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07224213c4bf831.jpg?r=224218' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922604/armed-men-hijack-3-oil-tankers-abduct-7-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Armed men hijack 3 oil tankers, abduct 7 in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>Armed men hijacked three oil tankers and abducted seven crew members from the Tuchi bridge area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Monday, according to the police.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, leaving both provinces in a state of uncertainty. The provincial security situation has also been plagued by lawlessness.
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Khan Kulachi told Dawn.com: “The incident occurred near Marwat Canal in the Tuchi bridge area and a total of three oil tankers were hijacked and their seven crew members abducted” after the convoy was intercepted while coming from North Waziristan.
Kulachi said that a first information report was lodged at the Baka Khel Police Station and a search operation was being conducted in the area. He added that no one had claimed responsibility or contacted anyone of the abductees’ families for ransom.
Last week, at least one person was killed and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in Bannu.
Earlier in the month, a police official embraced martyrdom when unknown armed motorcyclists opened fire on him near his house in Ghoriwala town of Bannu district.</p><small>2025-07-07 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0722104031f737f.jpg?r=222806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922612/president-zardari-appoints-chief-justices-of-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari appoints chief justices of high courts</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari appointed the chief justices to the four high courts on Monday.
Letters from the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) last week said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court.
The JCP had held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.
Four identical notifications from the law ministry said that the president appointed the chief justices, with effect from the date they take their oath of office, under clause (1) of Article 193 of the Constitution.
Article 193 outlines the process for the appointment of high court judges.
The chief justices are likely to take the oath sometime this week. Sources had said the notifications were expected today and the top judges may take oath the following day.
President Zardari would administer the oath to Justice Dogar at the Presidency, while the chief justices of the other high courts would take the oath from the respective governors.</p><small>2025-07-07 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07194018e61dcf7.jpg?r=194706' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922600/iran-president-says-tehran-open-to-nuclear-dialogue-with-us-accuses-israel-of-assassination-attempt' target='_blank'><strong>Iran president says Tehran open to nuclear dialogue with US, accuses Israel of assassination attempt</strong></a><br><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in an interview released on Monday that his country has “no problem” restarting nuclear talks with the United States, provided that trust can be reestablished between Washington and Tehran, and also accused Israel of attempting to assassinate him.
The remarks, made during an interview with US journalist and former Trump confidante Tucker Carlson, came less than a month after Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on June 13 against Iran and the US struck the Islamic republic’s nuclear facilities.
The attacks took place days before Tehran and Washington were set to meet for a new round of nuclear talks, stalling negotiations that were aimed at reaching a deal over Iran’s atomic programme.
“We see no problem in re-entering the negotiations,” the Iranian president said. “There is a condition … for restarting the talks. How are we going to trust the US again?
“We re-entered the negotiations, then how can we know for sure that in the middle of the talks, the Israeli regime will not be given the permission again to attack us?”
 


Pezeshkian also said that Israel attempted to assassinate him after Tel Aviv’s strikes killed top military commanders and nuclear scientists.
“They did try, yes. They acted accordingly, but they failed,” Pezeshkian told Carlson in response to a question on whether he believed Israel had tried to kill him.
“It was not the US that was behind the attempt on my life. It was Israel. I was in a meeting … they tried to bombard the area in which we were holding that meeting,” he said, according to a translation of his remarks from Persian.
More than 900 people were killed in Iran during the conflict, according to the judiciary. The Israeli attacks drew waves of retaliatory drone and missile fire, killing 28 people in Israel, according to authorities.
‘Forever wars’
The 12-day war between Iran and Israel saw it, along with the US, launching strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. A ceasefire between Iran and Israel has held since June 24.
On June 16, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not rule out plans to assassinate Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying it would “end the conflict” after reports emerged at the time that US President Donald Trump had vetoed the move.
During the interview with Carlson, Pezeshkian accused Netanyahu of pursuing his “own agenda” of “forever wars” in the Middle East and urged the US not to be dragged into it.
“The US administration should refrain from getting involved in a war that is not America’s war, it is Netanyahu’s war,” he said.
“I believe the US president can guide the region and the world to peace and tranquillity, or, on the other hand, to lead it to forever wars,” Pezeshkian said.
When asked about giving up Iran’s nuclear programme, Pezeshkian reiterated that Tehran was not pursuing nuclear weapons, nor was it in the past.
“Netanyahu, since 1984, has created this false mentality that Iran seeks a nuclear bomb … and it has put it in the minds of every US president since then,” the Iranian president said.
“We have never been after developing a nuclear bomb … because this is wrong and in contrast to the religious decree which has been issued by his eminence, the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is religiously forbidden for us to go after a nuclear bomb.”
When asked if Americans should be afraid of Iran, Pezeshkian tried to dispel those fears and said it was “a very wrong impression” of Iranians.
“Iran has never invaded another country in the last 200 years,” he explained. He added that when Iranians chanted, “Death to the United States”, they did not mean “death to the people or officials of the United States”.
“They mean ‘death’ to crimes, atrocities, bullying, to the use of force and anyone who would become an accomplice in crimes perpetrated by others,” Pezeshkian stated.
Later, Pezeshkian said on X: “I told Tucker Carlson: While we were negotiating in good faith at the request of the US, Netanyahu dropped bombs — literally — on diplomacy.
“Israel torpedoed the talks and killed peace. The world should remember who derailed the process,” he wrote.
The Iranian president said that his country neither started the war nor wanted it to continue.
“From day one, our policy has been clear: unity at home, peace with our neighbours, and stability in the region,” Pezeshkian wrote. He noted that the US must choose between reining in Netanyahu or following him “into another forever war”, adding that only US President Donald Trump can stop Netanyahu.
Pezeshkian quoted Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying that American investors “are welcome in Iran”.

A citizen filed a first information report (FIR), dated July 6, at the Satellite Town Police Station and said that the incident occurred on July 6 at 4:30pm. The case was registered under Section 298(C) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC)  which criminalises certain acts by members of the Ahmadi community, including calling themselves Muslims or referring to their faith as Islam.
Muhammad Irfan, public relations officer to the Gujranwala city police officer, told Dawn.com: “The suspect has been arrested and sent to jail on judicial remand for seven days.”
The FIR said that the complainant saw the Ahmadi man distributing biryani at a langar and “identifying himself as a Muslim and speaking and acting like a Muslim.”
Langar refers to the tradition of distributing free food, often associated with religious institutions and charitable organisations.
The complainant stated that he called two people but “the suspect fled from the scene when he saw us.”
Referring to the Ahmadi man in the report, the complainant said that he could not perform the rituals of Islam.
Condemning the development, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman expressed hope that the government would annul the FIR.
 






Last month, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) asked the Punjab police chief to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and take action against its members if found violating the law.
In a letter, the LHCBA said that the followers of other religions and sects — especially the Ahmadis — are neither legally nor religiously permitted to use Islamic symbols and practices.
In March, the Human Rights Com­­mission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it had observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.
 
 

The HRCP also spoke of Ahmadis’ “arbitrary detention”, “desecration of their graves” and the “vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women” to forced conversion.
The report, titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24, said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.
One of the key findings of the report said that disinformation on social media sparked most of the registered blasphemy cases.
HRCP observed an “increasing weaponisation of blasphe­­my laws against Ahmadis”, with cases often initiated by law enforcement officials themselves.</p><small>2025-07-07 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/072023081784dbb.jpg?r=203159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922603/us-revokes-foreign-terrorist-designation-for-syrias-hayat-tahrir-al-sham' target='_blank'><strong>US revokes foreign terrorist designation for Syria’s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked the foreign terrorist organisation designation for Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, according to a State Department memo filed on Monday, a major step as Washington moves to ease sanctions on Syria.
The memo dated June 23 was signed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was published in a preview of the Federal Register before official publication on Tuesday.
 






The move comes a week after Trump signed an executive order terminating a US sanctions programme on Syria, to help end the country’s isolation from the international financial system and build on Washington’s pledge to help it rebuild after a devastating civil war.
“In consultation with the attorney general and the secretary of the Treasury, I hereby revoke the designation of Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (and other aliases) as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Rubio wrote in the memo.
 
 

Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, was previously Al-Qaeda’s Syria branch. In December, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa led the HTS, which, together with other rebels, conducted a lightning offensive that ousted Syria’s former president Bashar Al-Assad.
Sharaa’s HTS severed Al-Qaeda ties years ago and says it wants to build an inclusive and democratic Syria.
Syria’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment.
Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May, where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift US sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.</p><small>2025-07-07 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07151603d0e906f.jpg?r=203829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922569/punjab-assembly-speaker-defends-seeking-disqualification-of-pti-mpas-says-gladly-accepts-criticism' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly speaker defends seeking disqualification of PTI MPAs, says ‘gladly’ accepts criticism</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan on Monday defended his recent move to seek the disqualification of 26 PTI MPAs for their “unparliamentary conduct”, saying he was fulfilling his responsibility to uphold the Constitution.
On June 27, the speaker ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sittings of the provincial legislature after their protests disrupted Chief Mi­­nister Maryam Nawaz’s speech and caused chaos in the house. Days later, he filed a disqualification reference with the Election Com­mission of Pakistan against them.
Out of those MPAs, 17 were listed as belonging to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which PTI-affiliated candidates joined last year after their party was deprived of its election symbol. At least eight others, however, were stated as PTI MPAs.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore today, Malik stressed that his responsibility was to uphold the Constitution and he did not discriminate against any party.
“I am someone who brings things into my domain. I will accept criticism wholeheartedly, but while doing the calculations, while having a conversation.”
 


The speaker questioned the criticism against him from the opposition and the media, which suggested that the speaker did not have the authority to file such a reference.
“Many credible names in journalism who have a biblical position, […] editorials were written as well that a Constitutional red line must be there, and not a party leadership red line,” Malik noted.
“It was also written that it is an extreme step,” the speaker added, apparently referring to a Dawn editorial.
“It was further written that jurists think that the speaker does not reserve the right to approach the election commission,” Malik said.
The speaker highlighted he wanted to address the matter and the relevant laws, considering “such a huge editorial was written [and] such respected people were voicing their opinion on the media, including anchorpersons”.
 
 

Malik emphasised he had always tried to present himself as a “custodian”, with an understanding of his Constitutional responsibilities.
“If, as a speaker, the opposition believes I am a custodian and must protect their rights, should I not also give the same right to the treasury benches to be heard, to speak? […] Is that not their right?”
The speaker strongly rejected the allegations that the move to disqualify the MPAs was a means of silencing the opposition, saying that he “prioritised every point of the opposition […] at every opportunity”. “I have given them their due.”
He asserted he made every effort to ensure the opposition members were given as much time as possible to speak and that their rights were respected, adding, “I am not a man who steals the right to representation in assemblies.”
Malik recognised the MPAs’ right to protest under the Constitution, but said that it did not override his rights: “You cannot say vandalism is your absolute right or obstructing the house is your absolute right.”
The PML-N leader stressed that this applied regardless of party affiliation.
Malik acknowledged that assemblies and parliaments often featured scuffles and raised voices, rejecting the notion that a speaker had to take a “draconian position” against these. However, he stressed the need for this fighting to have limits.
 
 

“I have been in this House for two decades,” Malik said, adding that during that period he had never heard a finance minister — of any government — make a budget speech without being met with “noise, budget books being torn, uproar in the assembly, even attacks on the finance minister”.
Ten Punjab MPAs, including six who were suspended, have been fined Rs203,550 each for allegedly damaging public property during the June 16 session, when opposition members had tried to interrupt the budget speech by Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman.
“Will a finance minister not be able to make a speech for 22 years?” Malik said.
“Will any leader of the House […] ever have the right to speak here? Will their freedom of expression here become [suppressed] and will only the expression of the ones causing an uproar be treated as the right to protest?
“Will this be the order of the day? Will this be a new normal?”
The speaker further said: “If the leader of the House wants to speak, even if he was [PTI Founder] Imran Khan, should my party members obstruct him? I don’t support this. I only recognise one point: that you have taken an oath, that you will uphold the proceedings of the assembly according to the rules.”</p><small>2025-07-07 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07164029fe72888.jpg?r=170035' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922576/army-chief-dismisses-factually-incorrect-claims-of-external-input-in-operation-bunyanum-marsoos' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief dismisses ‘factually incorrect’ claims of external input in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on Monday dismissed Indian claims of Pakistan receiving external support in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent tensions with India, terming them “irresponsible and factually incorrect”.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns.
Reuters reported that the deputy chief of India’s army alleged last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict. India fought two adversaries during the conflict, with Pakistan being the “front face” while China provided “all possible support”, Lieutenant General Rahul Singh had said at a defence industry event in New Delhi.
“When the DGMO (director general of military operations) level talks were going on, Pakistan … said that we know that your such and such important vector is primed and it is ready for action … he was getting live inputs from China,” he said. Singh did not elaborate on how India knew about the live inputs from China.
A statement issued by the Inter-Services Publications said that Field Marshal Munir addressed the matter today while speaking at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad.
He said that India’s “inability” to achieve its military objectives during Operation Sindoor and the subsequent claims signified “its lack of operational readiness and strategic foresight”.
“Insinuations regarding external support in Pakistan’s successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.
“Naming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics and desperately trying that India remains the beneficiary of larger geopolitical contestation as the so-called net security provider in a region which is getting increasingly weary of its hegemonic and extremist Hindutva ideology.”
 






It further stated that “in contrast to India’s strategic behaviour resting on parochial self-alignment”, Pakistan had forged “lasting partnerships based on principled diplomacy, anchored in mutual respect and peace, establishing itself to be a stabiliser in the region”.
In his remarks, the army chief reiterated the country’s “principled stance”, warning that any misadventure or attempts to undermine national sovereignty or territorial integrity would be met with a “swift and resolute response”.
“Any attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a ‘deeply hurting and more than reciprocal response’. The onus of escalation will squarely lie on the strategically blind arrogant aggressor who fails to see the grave repercussions of such provocative actions against a sovereign nuclear state,” the statement quoted him as saying.
“Wars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,” the army chief concluded.
He lauded the armed forces and urged the graduating officers to remain steadfast in the values of integrity, selfless service, and unwavering commitment to the nation, the statement added.</p><small>2025-07-07 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07191532975f13f.jpg?r=193415' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922598/two-men-shot-dead-over-honour-in-karachis-mangophir-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two men shot dead over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Mangophir: police</strong></a><br><p>Two men were shot dead while a third one was injured over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Manghopir area on Monday, police said.
‘Honour’ killings refer to the murder of individuals, predominantly women and girls, by family members who believe the victim has brought “dishonour” upon the family.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
Manghopir police SHO Imran Ahmed Khan told Dawn.com, “The victim was in a relationship with a woman from their native town in Balochistan’s Bolan district.”
Khan added that the couple had arrived in Karachi about four days ago and were living with the man’s relatives near Gulshan Chowk in Mohammed Khan Colony.
He said as per the initial probe, the woman’s brother and other relatives traced the couple and shot the man along with his maternal uncle. Meanwhile, another maternal uncle was injured during the attack.
“Shaman, 25, and Ishaq Balach, 30, were killed, while Habibullah, 35, was injured,” SHO Khan said. “The suspects took the woman back to Balochistan after killing the two men.
He added that the bodies and the injured were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, and that the police were waiting for the victims’ heirs to lodge a first information report to initiate formal legal proceedings.
Last month, two men were shot dead while a third was injured in what police described as an ‘honour’ killing in Karachi’s Ittehad Town, while in a separate incident in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a young man was also killed for the same reason, according to an FIR.</p><small>2025-07-07 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612873-pakistanis-to-learn-from-dubais-governance-and-public-service-excellence-in-exchange-programme' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistanis to learn from Dubai's governance and public service excellence in exchange programme</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025. Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently intensified their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a key perpetrator of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.
“Three personnel were injured in a blast targeting a patrolling vehicle of the highway police in Nasirabad’s Rabbi area,” Highway Police’s Senior Superintendent of Police Khadim Husain said.
He added that the incident took place when the highway police team was patrolling the area as per routine.
Citing preliminary reports, Husain said the blast was conducted through a remote-controlled device. The injured were immediately taken to a hospital in the Dera Murad Jamali town, located 12km from Rabbi, the SSP added.
“The police have initiated an investigation,” SSP Husain said.
In June, Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).
 
 

Over a week ago, security forces killed two terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Duki district.
Earlier this month, security forces eliminated two “India-backed” terrorists after an attack on government offices in the Mastung district killed a teenager and injured seven others.
On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area. In a separate attack in Kalat, a CTD officer was gunned down by unknown armed men, while a police official was among two killed in Mastung.
In May, four people were injured when unidentified motorcyclists threw a grenade at a house in Nasirabad. In March, Nasirabad police claimed to have foiled a sabotage attempt ahead of the Pakistan Day celebrations and seized explosives.</p><small>2025-07-07 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612867-sweden-announces-resumption-of-visa-services-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Sweden announces resumption of visa services in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier in the month, a meeting of top federal and provincial government officials discussed and stressed the need to revive the jirga system in the merged districts. A jirga is a traditional form of conflict resolution, primarily found in Pashtun societies of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where a council of male elders gathers to settle disputes based on local customs and traditions
The meeting discussed ways to promote an effective alternative justice system in tribal districts.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad along with other party leaders, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said: “In none of the committee meetings was reviving the jirga system discussed for the tribal areas, and after the 18th Amendment, that right was with the provincial government.
“After the 25th Amendment, when the tribal areas were merged with KP, the federal government no longer had the right to make a committee there.”
Former KP governor Shah Farman, MNA Iqbal Afridi, KP Finance Minister Aftab Alam Afridi, PTI central information secretary and MNA Sheikh Waqas Akram and others accompanied Gohar.
“I would like to thank the PTI chairman and other leadership for stopping the mines and minerals bill. When the federal govt got to know that this [bill] would be stopped, this is where this ruse started to gain access to the mines and minerals,” Iqbal said.
Meanwhile, the KP finance minister said, “Today, the (Ministry of States and Frontier Regions) Safron ministry called a meeting to interfere in the province’s issues, although after the merger, it is completely the provincial government’s right to legislate for the merged districts.
“We have a 2020 act for alternate dispute resolution, and we are trying to improve on it, but then why is the Safron ministry interfering in the province’s issues?”
He said that the increased share in the National Financial Commission award after the merger was also not provided by the federal government to KP.
In May, a multi-party conference organised by the Awami National Party rejected the proposed KP Mines and Minerals Act, 2025, declaring it a “clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan”.
The bill recommended the establishment of licensing and exploration sections at the directorate of the mines and minerals directorate, as well as a mines and minerals force in the province.
Though the bill provides for the protection of landowner rights and training and other opportunities for the local communities, it is silent about if those communities are to receive any share from the mining operations in their respective areas.</p><small>2025-07-07 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612865-vulnerable-citizens-urge-to-prepare-emergency-kits-amid-flood-warning' target='_blank'><strong>Flood warning: Vulnerable residents urged to prepare five-day emergency kits</strong></a><br><p>

Sweden in April 2023 indefinitely closed its embassy in Islamabad, citing the security situation as the reason. As a result, the Migration Section was unable to handle requests, nor could any documents be sent to consulates, Gerry´s, or applicants’ addresses.  “We understand that this will cause inconvenience; however, the safety of our applicants and staff members are of highest priority,” a notice placed on the embassy’s website had read at the time.
The embassy reopened in April this year, according to its website.
According to the FO, the Swedish and Pakistani foreign ministries held bilateral consultations in Stockholm on July 2, where the decision to resume visa services was announced by the Swedish side.
“Effective July 7, 2025, Pakistani nationals can apply for a Schengen visa from within Pakistan for visits to Sweden of up to 90 days,” the FO said.
 






It welcomed the positive development, saying it “reflects the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries”.
The FO added that the Pakistani delegation to the bilateral consultations in Stockholm was led by the additional foreign secretary (Europe), while the Swedish side was led by the director general for global affairs from the Swedish foreign ministry.</p><small>2025-07-07 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612859-african-lion-kept-as-pet-in-gujar-khan-home-confiscated' target='_blank'><strong>African lion kept as pet in Gujar Khan home confiscated</strong></a><br><p>

The woman suffered scratches and bruises, and the two children, aged five and seven, were hospitalised after the attack last week, but their injuries were not life-threatening, provincial wildlife officials said.
The lion, which was kept without a licence in a house in Lahore, was confiscated and sent to a local safari park, said Mubeen Elahi, Director General of the Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department.
The owner was later arrested, police said.
Keeping exotic animals as pets has been fueled by social media, with owners often showing off their animals online as status symbols.
“According to the new regulations for keeping big cats, no individual is allowed to keep a lion without a licence, without adhering to the required cage size and without following other standard operating procedures,” Elahi said, adding that the punishment is up to seven years in jail.
“As well as confiscating the 18 animals, the department raided 38 lion and tiger breeding farms and arrested eight people for violating the rules,” he said, adding that all farms will be inspected by the end of this week. “There are 584 lions and tigers in homes and breeding farms in Punjab.”
“I know plenty of people who keep big cats as pets,” said Qaim Ali, 30, who himself had a lion but sold it after it attacked his nephew. “Most of them are not interested in breeding but keep them as a symbol of power and influence in society.”
The department on Saturday arrested five individuals and seized 13 lions after launching a crackdown against people illegally keeping the big cats without a licence.
A press release issued by the provincial government said that the wildlife department launched a “major province-wide crackdown” on the special directives of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz against those keeping lions without a licence.
“This operation is being carried out under a zero-tolerance policy and has already led to significant progress,” the press release said, adding that authorities conducted inspections of 22 locations across the province.</p><small>2025-07-07 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071409496ddc8bf.jpg?r=141626' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922557/sindh-govt-suspends-sbca-dg-over-lyari-building-collapse' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt suspends SBCA DG over Lyari building collapse</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Monday suspended Sindh Building and Control Authority (SBCA) Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the recent building collapse in Karachi that claimed 27 lives.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding yesterday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
A notification issued by Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated that the SBCA DG’s services were “placed under suspension with immediate effect for the reason of misconduct and inefficiency”.
It added that Khuhro’s headquarters during the suspension period would be at the Services, General Administration and Coordination Department. He would “draw his salaries and allowances during the suspension period as admissible under the rules”.
Shahmir Khan Bhutto, a Grade-20 officer serving as the secretary of the chief minister’s Inspection, Enquiries and Implementation Team Department, was notified as the new SBCA DG.
Speaking on the development, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said: “Today, the chief minister has also suspended the DG SCBA and has ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR (first information report) on the incident and that strictest action be taken against all those involved.”

Memon was addressing a press conference in Karachi alongside Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar and Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani.
According to Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.
Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have condemned the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence”.
They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families, but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.
Noting the loss of 27 lives, Memon said: “The entire province, nation and all of us as the government representatives are saddened and equally share the grief of the bereaved families.”
“The chief minister has taken a very strict notice of this,” he asserted.
 
 

Memon said CM Murad’s notice of the incident was aimed at ensuring strict action “against those who did not fulfil their duties or even if they fulfilled, they were not able to implement them”.
He added that the fact-finding committee formed on the incident, which was given three days to present a report, would submit its report within two days due to the Ashura public holidays over the weekend.
Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi will now head the committee, according to Ghani.
51 ‘extremely fragile’ buildings
During the media briefing, Ghani also mentioned that there were 51 buildings in Karachi that were “extremely fragile and should be demolished”.
He said the city commissioner has been directed to provide the number of residents and units in those buildings, as well as the details of whether they own the property or have rented it, so that the process of demolishing them can be started.
“The Karachi commissioner has to also provide assessments of the 588 buildings which were declared dangerous within two weeks so that we can decide which of the buildings need to be destroyed and which can be fixed through major repair,” he added.
In a recent statement, the SBCA noted that 588 buildings have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi, with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone.
 


Ghani asserted that all SBCA officers appointed in Lyari since 2022 will be identified and included in the inquiry, adding: “If the committee finds involvement or criminal negligence of any officer, they will be included in the FIR and face legal action.”
“If any negligence even by the [SCBA] DG is found in the inquiry, then he will also be included in the FIR,” the LG minister said, noting that Khuhro was in the role in 2022, when the building’s survey was conducted.</p><small>2025-07-07 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612849-senate-committee-divided-over-adding-reproductive-health-to-school-curriculum' target='_blank'><strong>Senate committee divided over adding reproductive health to school curriculum</strong></a><br><p>
