Twelve people were killed and 36 were injured in a suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area. The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the first one-day international (ODI) match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Rawalpindi.
Following the bombing, some Sri Lankan players reportedly expressed fears for their safety.
“The second ODI against Pakistan tomorrow is in doubt, but substitute players will be sent to continue the tri-nation series,” a Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) source told AFP. The source added that at least eight Sri Lankan cricketers would return home without playing in the tri-nation white-ball cricket series against Pakistan and Zimbabwe.
However, a statement issued later by SLC said it had “instructed all players, support staff and team management to continue with the tour as scheduled”.
“SLC was informed by the team management this morning that several members of the national team currently touring Pakistan have requested to return home, citing safety concerns.
“Following this development, SLC immediately engaged with the players and assured them that all such concerns are being duly addressed in close coordination with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the relevant authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of every member of the touring party.”
The SLC said that if any player or member of the touring party decides to return to Sri Lanka despite the directive issued to continue with the tour, the board would immediately send replacements to ensure that the tour continued without interruption.
“If any player, players or member of the support staff return despite SLC’s directives, a formal review will be conducted to assess their actions, and an appropriate decision will be made upon the conclusion of the review,” the board said.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif expressed gratitude to the Sri Lankan team for “their visit and for a good display of cricket” in a post on X.
 






Similarly, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar expressed heartfelt gratitude to the team for visiting Pakistan, writing in his own post on X: “My heartfelt gratitude to the Sri Lankan Cricket Team for their visit to Pakistan and for always supporting the game of cricket. Keep up the sportsman spirit. We are honoured by your presence.”
 






The PCB said that security around the visiting team had been increased following the attack, and Sri Lankan High Commissioner Rear Admiral (retired) Fred Seneviratne expressed satisfaction with security arrangements for the team during a meeting today with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the PCB chairman.
The remaining matches are scheduled to take place on Thursday and Saturday, in Rawalpindi.
Pertinent to note is that the Sri Lanka team was the victim of a terrorist attack during a Test match in Lahore in March 2009. The attack left eight people dead, besides injuring seven Sri Lankan players and their assistant coach.</p><small>2025-11-12 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633344-minister-confirms-afghan-national-involved-in-islamabad-deadly-suicide-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Minister confirms Afghan national involved in Islamabad deadly suicide attack</strong></a><br><p>

The provincial home department stated a security alert had been issued and that these services would remain suspended due to the prevailing situation.
“The Internet service will remain suspended in the rural areas of the entire province,” officials said, adding that Quetta district will remain exempt from this restriction.
However, people were complaining that many parts of Quetta were not receiving signals, and people faced difficulties accessing internet services.
The provincial government also temporarily suspended the movement of all transport services, including taxis and private vehicles, on the Loralai section of National Highway N-70 until November 14, 2025, citing security concerns and law and order considerations.
However, the ban will not apply to local or intra-city traffic, allowing residents to travel for daily needs within their areas.
The home department has instructed all district administrations, police and relevant authorities to ensure the immediate implementation of the decision and make alternative arrangements for the public’s convenience.
Citizens were advised to verify the official travel advisory before planning any journey on the Loralai route to avoid inconvenience.
Meanwhile, all educational institutions remained closed in the Cantonment area of Quetta on Wednesday, with officials stating that schools and colleges in the area will remain closed from November 12-16 due to security concerns. However, some government schools in Quetta remained open.
Internet services were also suspended in Quetta for 24 hours on October 31, due to security concerns.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.
According to a report published in January, Pakistan was leading the world in terms of financial losses suffered as a result of outages and shutdowns of internet and social media apps last year.
Pakistan topped the charts with a cumulative financial impact of $1.62 billion. This was higher than the cost in countries like Sudan and Myanmar, which are ravaged by civil wars.

The jirga, organised by the KP government, demanded a provincial action plan, reopening of all trade routes with Afghanistan, and also reducing tensions between the KP and federal governments.
The peace jirga had been called by the KP government to discuss the law and order situation in KP and discuss strategies for re-establishing peace in the province. At the previous jirga held in the Khyber district on October 25, CM Afridi had warned against launching any new military operation in the tribal districts.
Today’s gathering, chaired by KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, was attended by former governors, chief ministers, tribal elders, lawmakers, representatives of all the political parties in KP — both from the provincial and National Assembly — legal experts, business community, media, and members of the civil society.
The participants gave written suggestions to the organisers and also shared then during their speeches, with most suggesting talks with the Afghan Taliban regime for lasting peace, taking the provincial government on board before making any decision regarding peace in KP, and resolving the differences between the federal and provincial governments for the larger public interest.
After an hours-long debate in the KP Assembly, the participants, in a declaration issued after the gathering’s conclusion, condemned terrorist attacks in the province, especially in the merged districts, and reiterated that the provincial government utilise all available resources to root out militancy for lasting peace in the province.
 






The participants also demanded an in-camera briefing for the lawmakers on the ongoing military actions against terrorists within a stipulated time period, besides, immediate implementation of all the resolutions passed by the KP Assembly for peace in the province, in letter and spirit.
The gathering demanded constituting ‘peace forums’ with its members comprising youth, politicians, minorities and women. The declaration stated that the provincial finance commission should be linked with the National Finance Commission (NFC) to give financial protection and stability to local governments.
The participants also demanded that KP should be provided its rights, including Net-Hydel Profit, federal excise duty on oil, water share, precedence of natural gas, NFC share for the merged districts, implementation of 11th NFC Award, Galyat Drinking Water initiative besides implementation of Article 151 for wheat supply to KP.
Earlier today, KP CM Sohail Afridi called for a “shift” in the Centre’s counterterrorism policies by including all stakeholders in the decision-making process, as his government convened a multi-party jirga.
“I expect that a durable and permanent solution to this menace of terrorism, which has been eating away at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for more than 20 years, will be found,” CM Afridi said while addressing the moot.
The KP CM called for a policy shift, which he said would entail “coming out of the closed rooms, considering other individuals intelligent, considering politicians as wise”, and including security forces, stakeholders of KP, leaders of all political parties, and members of all schools of thought in the policymaking process.
Afridi added that the policy should not be a short-term one where terrorism could see a resurgence after a few years, but one that “wipes out the menace of terrorism from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for once and for all”.
 


The Awami National Party (ANP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), all of which are part of the opposition in the KP Assembly, participated in the moot as well.
KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati chaired the jirga, with PTI MNA Junaid Akbar and PML-N’s Ibadullah Khan, the opposition leader in the KP Assembly, also seated on the stage.
At the outset of his remarks, CM Afridi welcomed all attendees from various segments of political circles and civil society.
“We repeatedly speak of peace, but unfortunately, some people dislike it,” the chief minister said. Noting that terrorism needed to be eliminated for peace to be achieved, CM Afridi said militancy had not been eradicated by “decisions taken behind closed doors and imposed on us”.
“Our politics is each of our own, but our peace is shared,” the chief minister said, highlighting that all political parties and the public of the province had given sacrifices in the war against terrorism.
“Our security forces, whether it’s the army, the police or the CTD, they all gave sacrifices and then peace was established in 2018,” Afridi noted.
The chief minister said war should be the last option for resolving any issue.
CM Afridi reiterated the call for KP being given its complete due share in the NFC, which he said amounted to around Rs400 billion. He added that while erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas had been merged administratively with KP, the economic merger was still not complete.
‘Must set aside politics’: Kundi urges unity
In his address, Governor Kundi termed the convening of the jirga an “excellent move that evokes our sense of collective wisdom and seriousness and national unity”.
He asked Swati to form a committee that would include parliamentary leaders of all parties in the assembly, as well as representatives from those parties not in the provincial legislature, to ensure continuity of such discussions and reduce inter-party differences.
The governor underscored the need to think about the province’s future and next generations rather than discussing matters of the past.
 
 

He mentioned the Afghanistan issue, saying: “Every few years, a superpower comes and tries to conquer it, and when it leaves after failing, it leaves behind its filth in the form of weapons, which is used against us.”
Kundi pointed out the usage of modern weapons, such as night-vision thermal snipers, by militants in KP, adding that the province perhaps did not have enough capacity to fight against them.
“We must set aside our politics and think about our province’s prosperity and development,” the PPP leader emphasised.
“I agree with what Junaid Akbar sahib said, […] but we will have to speak with grounds and facts with Islamabad to get our rights,” he said, assuring that he and the opposition will stand with the KP government for that.
“We have a lot of matters, our resources, which we have to discuss with the Centre,” the governor said, calling for the federal and provincial governments, the security forces, and the military to work together.
Use diplomatic channels with Kabul: PTI
Addressing the jirga, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser urged the Afghan government to address the ongoing issues, and also demanded that the federal government utilise diplomatic channels.
“Pakistan and Afghanistan cannot survive without each other,” the former National Assembly speaker emphasised.
Akbar said the decision to join the Afghan war in the 1970s was “never a political but a decision by the military”. “They [the military leadership] told us that these are our people and they would be rehabilitated,” he said, claiming that the entire political leadership had expressed reservations.
The KP speaker said that while there was “no doubt” that the country possessed brave armed forces, it “makes you think that peace is not being established despite having intelligence [operations]”.
The jirga began with prayers for those martyred in terrorism across the province.
 






ANP KP President Mian Iftikhar Hussain, former JI emir Sirajul Haq, PPP provincial leader Akhunzada Chattan, and delegations of the JUI-F and the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) participated in the peace jirga.
Former CM Mehmood Khan, ex-governor Shaukatullah Khan, Pakistan Mazdoor Kisan Party central chairman Afzal Shah Khamosh, lawyers, and stakeholders from various schools of thought were among other attendees.
 






The moot came amid a recent spate of terror attacks across the country, with the federal capital also witnessing a rare deadly blast yesterday that killed at least 12 people.
The terrorism situation in KP also remains concerning. In Dera Ismail Khan’s Daraban tehsil, a bomb attack targeted a security forces’ convoy yesterday, injuring at least 14 personnel.
On Monday, the Cadet College in South Waziristan’s Wana came under attack. While all students and teachers were reported to have been safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed, the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals.
“The actions by the enemies of peace in Bannu, Wana, and Islamabad before the jirga are a conspiracy to sabotage the peace process. The enemies of peace will fail, and peace is our future,” former KP minister Kamran Khan Bangash said on X before the moot began.
 






Swati and Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi were welcomed by a police contingent when they arrived at the venue.
 






JUI-F provincial emir Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman and provincial general secretary Senator Maulana Attaul Haq Dervesh were to represent the party in the jirga, according to party spokesperson Abdul Jalil Jan.
From the JI, party leaders Prof Mohammad Ibrahim Khan and former senior minister Inayatullah Khan were to attend the peace moot, a spokesperson had told Dawn.
No more good Taliban, bad Taliban: ANP
Addressing the jirga, ANP’s Iftikhar said that there should be “no more good and bad Taliban” narrative, and that the policies of the past should be discontinued.
“A complete implementation of the National Action Plan is important for eradicating terrorism and establishing peace. We can only make suggestions as the government would have to implement them,” he said.
“The government must own it. The ANP bravely faced militancy, and we held talks but also owned the problems. We took all the stakeholders and launched an operation, cleared the Malakand division and rehabilitated the displaced people,” he noted.
Regarding Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan, Iftikhar said: “Both countries should respect each other and only dialogue could resolve the issues. All the trade routes with Afghanistan should be reopened immediately, and the border economy promoted. The federal and provincial governments must sit down and resolve issues.”
 






What happened to past peace jirgas, asks ex-CM Mehmood Khan
Ex-CM Mehmood, chairman of the PTI-Parliamentarians, shed light on the importance of holding talks and reaching a consensus.
“I wonder what happened to the past peace jirgas?” he asked the participants. “You are the government, and people gave you the mandate,” he said, addressing the provincial government.
“You will have to sit with the ‘key stakeholders’ and talk to them. A jirga comprising these people should be formed to discuss issues related to the province’s rights with the federal government.”
‘Peace above politics’
“Peace is more important for us than politics,” PTI’s Qaiser said before the jirga began, pointing out that political leaders of the entire province had been gathered today.
Qaiser welcomed the participation of all political parties, including those in the opposition. “We will formulate a national policy through this jirga,” he said, adding that his party will present their demands before the Centre related to counter-terrorism.
The PTI leader, reiterating his party’s stance, said the Pak-Afghan tensions should be resolved diplomatically. “There will be peace in Pakistan once there is peace in Afghanistan,” he said, adding that the KP government will also present its demands before the Afghan ruling administration.
 






Echoing Qaiser’s sentiments, PML-N’s Ibadullah told the media, “We have set aside a myriad of differences and are sitting with the PTI.”
He highlighted that a jirga was being convened in the KP Assembly for the first time and said he was hopeful for a positive outcome of it.
The KP opposition leader noted that today’s moot had a single-point agenda of peace. “Terrorism is the number one issue. Amendments are the parliament’s matter,” he said.
“There should be no talks with terrorists,” Ibadullah asserted. “There will be no pardon for those who slew our children’s heads.”
PPP parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly Ahmad Karim Kundi had hailed the decision to hold the peace jirga, noting that the poor law and order situation was the biggest issue faced by the province.
He said that while political parties had held jirgas for peace, a jirga was being held at the provincial assembly for the first time, representing the will of 40 million of the province.</p><small>2025-11-12 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12191217a0da54a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954683/what-new-changes-has-the-national-assembly-made-to-the-27th-constitutional-amendment-bill' target='_blank'><strong>What new changes has the National Assembly made to the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill?</strong></a><br><p>The National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill during a ruckus-marred session attended by political heavyweights, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
 
 

The bill was passed by a two-way voting process — voting by division and clause-by-clause voting. Presented in the house for voting by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the bill will now be referred back to the Senate for the new amendments to be debated upon again and then will be passed by the upper house.
During the session, Tarar presented a list of amendments to the bill, while also omitting some of the bill’s clauses.
From the law minister’s speech in the National Assembly, the amendments were promulgated mainly to incorporate the newly setup Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) in the scheme of the Constitution and to provide clarity regarding the incumbent and future chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) since the new constitutional court means it will have its own chief justice (CJFCC), along with the chief justice of the Supreme Court (CJSC).
Amendments related to Federal Constitutional Court
Substitution of new Clause 2
The first change pertained to Clause 2 of the 27th Amendment Bill, 2025, which dealt with a change to Article 10(4)(1) of the Constitution (safeguards as to arrest and detention). The relevant section currently says that the CJP will form the review board in a case of someone detained under a federal law.
The amendment sought to insert the words “Supreme Court of” in front of the “chief justice of” to now show that the CJSC would be the one to form the board.
However, the new Clause 2 as per the amendments deals with changes to Article 6’s (high treason) clause 2A, which reads as follows:
An act of high treason mentioned in clause (1) or clause (2) shall not be validated by any court, including the SC and a high court.
In the latest amendment, it was stated that after the word “the”, the words “Federal Constitutional Court” and a comma would be inserted, thus adding the FCC to the list of courts that cannot ratify any act of high treason and placing it before the SC in the listing.
Amendments related to Supreme Court, its chief justice and CJP
Insertion of Clause 2A
Meanwhile, the previous Clause 2 of the bill would now be labelled as Clause 2A.
As explained before, the CJSC will now be the one to form the review board for the case of someone detained under a federal law.
Substitution of Clause 23
Article 176 that deals with the makeup of the SC currently says: “The Supreme Court shall consist of a chief justice to be known as the chief justice of Pakistan and so many other Judges as may be determined by Act of [Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament)] or, until so determined, as may be fixed by the president.”
The original Clause 23 sought to insert the words “of Supreme Court” after the second mention of “justice”, thus meaning that the apex court would comprise its own chief justice — who would not necessarily be the CJP.
However, the law minister said in his NA speech that confusion had been created about the continuity of the CJP, thus the following new amendment was proposed that includes the original Clause 23 but also adds the following part to the full definition at the end of Article 176:
“For the full stop, at the end, a colon shall be substituted and thereafter the following proviso shall be added, namely: ‘Provided that and notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution, the incumbent chief justice shall be and continue to be known as the chief justice of Pakistan during his term in office’.”
CJP Yahya Afridi will thus continue to be the country’s chief justice until the end of his term.
Amendment of Clause 56
In the bill, an amendment to Clause 1 of Article 260 (definitions) was proposed, specifically for the definition of the chief justice. The article currently states:
“Chief justice”, in relation to the Supreme Court or a high court, includes the judge for the time being acting as chief justice of the court.
The change (subclause ‘a’ of Clause 56) proposed in the bill sought to add the words “Federal Constitutional Court” to clauses and sub-clauses of Article 260 to incorporate the new court in the framework of the Constitution.
Today’s latest amendment proposed the addition of the following subclause to Clause 56’s subclause ‘a’:
“Chief justice of Pakistan” means the senior amongst the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court and the chief justice of Supreme Court.“
Thus, after CJP Afridi’s term comes to an end, the future CJP will be the senior-most judge from the chief justices of the FCC and SC.
Omissions
Omission of Clause 4
Some of the proposed changes in the bill were omitted during the reading, one of which was Clause 4 of the bill.
Clause 4 would amend Article 42 of the Constitution, which reads as follows:
Before entering upon office, the president shall make before the chief justice of Pakistan oath in the form set out in the Third Schedule.
The proposed amendment would have seen the word “Pakistan” replaced with “the Federal Constitutional Court”.
Omission of Clause 19
Clause 19 of the bill proposed an amendment to Article 168 of the Constitution, which mandates that there will be an auditor-general who is appointed by the president. There was meant to be an amendment to Clause 2 of Article 168, which reads as follows:
Before entering upon office, the auditor-general shall make before the chief justice of Pakistan oath in the form set out in the Third Schedule.
The amendment in the bill would insert the words “Supreme Court of” after the words “chief justice of”.
Omission of Clause 51
Clause 51 of the bill proposed an amendment to Article 214 of the Constitution, which states that the chief election commissioner must swear an oath to the chief justice before assuming office, as follows:
Before entering upon office, the commissioner shall make before the chief justice of Pakistan [and a member of the Election Commission shall make before the commissioner] oath in the form set-out in the Third Schedule
The amendment was to replace the word “Pakistan” in the Article with the words “Federal Constitutional Court”.
Omission of Clause 55
Clause 55 of the bill proposed an amendment to Clause 2 of Article 255 (oath of office), which states that if someone cannot take the oath of office before “a specified person”, the chief justice can swear them in, as follows:
Where, under the Constitution, an oath is required to be made before a specified person and, for any reason, it is impracticable for the oath to be made before that person, it may be made before such other person as may be nominated by 3 [the chief justice of a high court, in case of a province and by the chief justice of Pakistan, in all other cases]
The bill proposed an amendment to the second clause of Article 255, substituting the word “Pakistan” with the words “Federal Constitutional Court”.</p><small>2025-11-12 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633325-blessing-in-disguise-minister-links-afghan-trade-drop-to-lower-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>'Blessing in disguise': Minister links Afghan trade drop to lower terrorism</strong></a><br><p>

The bill was passed by a two-way voting process — voting by division and clause-by-clause voting. Presented in the house for voting by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the bill will now be referred back to the Senate for the new amendments to be debated upon again and then will be passed by the upper house.
National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said the bill received 234 votes in favour and four against.
 



Major amendments:

Addition of Federal Constitutional Court to the list of courts that cannot ratify the act of high treason
Incumbent chief justice will continue to be known as the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) during his term
CJP now means the senior-most judge among the chief justices of the Supreme Court and Federal Constitutional Court


Speaking on the occasion, PM Shehbaz said the house exhibited solidarity and national unity was promoted. He thanked the lawmakers on his behalf and that of the nation.
The prime minister also paid tribute to deceased PML-N senator Irfan Siddiqui, hailing him as the “teacher of teachers”, and lauded his loyalty to Nawaz.
The premier also condemned the “dastardly” attempt by terrorists to carry out an incident in Wana, saying the event made one think of the Army Public School massacre. “These khawarij, in which unfortunately Afghans were also involved, were all sent to hell and all cadets, students and teachers were safely rescued. I want to congratulate the nation on this and want to thank the army and law enforcement agencies who exhibited professionalism and saved the nation’s youth,” he added.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

PM Shehbaz also addressed the suicide blast in Islamabad and said it was no hidden matter now that the hand of terrorists was plain to see in such incidents.
Referring to his statement yesterday in which he had blamed Indian involvement, the Fitna al-Khawarij and said “footprints of Afghanistan are also seen”, the prime minister said India had subsequently issued remarks rubbishing the allegations.
“I don’t need to say a lot. The terrorists who abducted a train in Balochistan, the Jaffer Express, we brought its evidence before the whole world how TTP and BLA were active from Afghanistan and were in contact with terrorists there and also with their supporters in India.
“We presented these facts before the whole world and no one challenged or rebutted them.”
Thus, the prime minister said the notion that Pakistan’s terrorist enemies were not involved in the attacks was akin to calling “day as night and vice versa”.
“I want to say something with great satisfaction and force to these terrorist elements and enemies of Pakistan, that we are fully aware of your actions and we have given you a befitting response before and will do so again as well.”
Referring to the negotiations with Afghanistan in Turkiye, he said Pakistan had only one demand in the talks and for the past two years, that the Afghan Taliban rein in terrorist outfits operating from their soil and waging attacks here.
The premier said Pakistan wanted peace and for Afghanistan to become an equal partner in the endeavour because “we believe what is good for Pakistan is good for them and vice versa, but this cannot happen that they make false promises and then don’t clamp down [on terrorists].”
Referring to the Afghan foreign minister’s visit to India and his engagements there, PM Shehbaz said: “We are perfectly understanding these messages but I still want to take advantage of the opportunity and say: come, sit with a sincere heart and clamp down on terrorists, give a commitment so there is peace in the whole region and it becomes a centre of prosperity and development.”
Coming to the 27th Amendment, the prime minister thanked President Asif Ali Zardari, Nawaz, Bilawal and other allies. He said the amendment had become part of the Constitution after the consultation process, adding that the Charter of Democracy had always envisioned a constitutional court, and now that “dream” was fulfilled.
Referring to Pakistan’s military performance in the May conflict against India and subsequent diplomatic outreach, PM Shehbaz said the series of moves had rendered India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “helpless”, adding that the Indian premier was still helpless.
“Regarding this, we fully need to promote national unity and solidarity and I think the constitutional court that has come into being is the peak of the Charter of Democracy. I also want to thank Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi for supporting us within the ambit of the Constitution.”
Shehbaz also pointed out that the Supreme Court’s chief justice would continue to head the Supreme Judicial Council, Judicial Commission of Pakistan, Law and Justice Commission and other important constitutional institutions.
The prime minister again credited Pakistan’s military performance in May for raising the country’s reputation and prestige in the wider international community. He said that was the reason why the whole nation supported the decision of the government and its allies to give the rank of field marshal to the army chief.
PM Shehbaz further said that there was no difference in thinking between him and Bilawal, saying the provinces would be strong if the Centre was strong and vice versa. He said rolling back the 18th Amendment or the National Finance Commission award unilaterally was out of the question until there was complete consultation on the matter.
However, the premier said here: “I am with that which strengthens Pakistan and the federation and against that which weakens them.”
He further said: “That thing which weakens the federation, no matter how good it is on its own, is not good for Pakistan.”
‘Sunk the ship of democracy’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the passing of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, stating that in rushing the amendments, “you have sunk the ship of democracy and judicial independence”.
“They introduced another amendment that we’re only seeing for the first time,” Gohar said.
“In Article 260, there are definitions for everything. There is a definition for the chief justice in Article 260(A), but they added a subclause AB.”
He read the bill’s amendment to Clause 56, which states: “After the definition of the Chief Justice, as amended aforesaid, the following new definition shall be inserted, namely: ‘Chief Justice of Pakistan’ means the senior amongst the Chief Justice of the Federal Constitutional Court and the Chief Justice of Supreme Court.”
Gohar said that this means that, as per Article 176, CJP Yahya Afridi will remain in his office so long as he holds the post.
“He took his oath on October 26, 2024, and it is a position with a tenure of three years,” the PTI chairman explained, adding that the CJP’s tenure would expire on October 26, 2027.
“The subclause AB in Article 260 states that the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court will become the CJP upon the vacation of the position.”
“They are playing musical chairs with the Supreme Court: there will be one CJP for three years, then there will be another one for another three years,” Gohar claimed.
“If you wanted to appoint a CJP, you could have just appointed someone from the Supreme Court. You could do it ceremonially, so that the chief justice of the Supreme Court shall also be known as the chief justice of Pakistan.”
“By rushing these amendments, you have sunk the ship of democracy and judicial independence and given nothing to the people,” he added.
“However, I am hopeful that we will be able to reverse this whenever we get a majority in parliament and free judges. Decisions are made in the House, but not for personal gain.”
Political bigwigs attend session, opposition stage protest
As soon as PM Shehbaz, Nawaz, and Bilawal entered the house, PTI members tore up copies of the bill and threw them towards the PM’ chair. PML-N parliamentarians immediately created a human shield around the premier and Nawaz to protect them, so that no PTI member could come close to them.

Moreover, as soon as Tarar, who had tabled the bill during yesterday’s NA session, began today’s speech, opposition members gathered near the speaker’s dais to register their protest. After that, they staged a walkout from the assembly.

The law minister said that consultation with the legal fraternity showed that there was confusion about the continuity of the chief justice of Pakistan’s position. “To remove this confusion, I will introduce an appropriate amendment in which it will be clarified that the current CJP … will remain the CJP,” he added.
 
 

He also mentioned Article 6 of the Constitution, saying that, as per the 18th Amendment, neither the Supreme Court nor any high court could ratify the abrogation of the Constitution.
Now, the law minister said, the constitutional court was also added to the list to remove any confusion.
The PML-N-led coalition government had succeeded in manoeuvring the passage of the bill through the Senate amid the opposition’s protest on Monday.
It now needs the NA’s approval, which means the support of a two-thirds majority in the 336-member house, followed by the president’s assent.
The ruling coalition commands the required number, with the PML-N holding 125 seats, PPP 74, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan 22, Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and the Pakistan Muslim League-Zia and Balochistan Awami Party and National Peoples Party one seat each. Meanwhile, the opposition has 103 seats.
PPP supports Article 243 changes ‘in context of war situation’
Bilawal addressed the assembly after getting up from his seat to meet PM Shehbaz and Nawaz.
However, the Bhutto scion’s speech was marred by opposition benches and PTI’s sloganeering in favour of party founder Imran Khan. They also carried the incarcerated ex-premier’s photos to the assembly. PTI stalwarts repeatedly disrupted Bilawal’s speech and tore up copies of the bill to express their disapproval.
Unaffected by the commotion, the PPP chief began his address by condemning yesterday’s terrorist attacks in the country.
“I want to remind the elected representatives in this house, whether in opposition or treasury benches, that we can have political and ideological differences, but as far as this country’s security and enemies, and combatting these terrorists [is concerned], not only this house but the entire country should unite in facing them.”
He said terrorism was once again on the rise in the country, but added that Pakistan had managed to defeat the menace before and would do so again.
The PPP chairman said his party decided to support the changes in Article 243 in the “context that Pakistan is going through a situation of war”.
 
 

“On the one hand, we defeated India. On the other hand, India hosted the Afghan foreign minister, and what is happening on our second border after that, the blood spilling of our citizens is in front of you.”
“In the 27th Amendment, we are about to fulfil the unfulfilled promises of the Charter of Democracy. We are about to establish constitutional courts, and in Article 243 — after defeating India, the prime minister decided to make the army chief the field marshal — not only are we providing constitutional protection to that rank of field marshal, but also bringing some changes to the defence institutions.”
The PPP chief said his party had decided to give constitutional cover to the field marshal after the way he and the military received praise after the May conflict against India.
He added that when a government brought a constitutional amendment, it meant that it had consulted with the defence institutions for changes relevant to them, as well as considered the legal aspects with the courts, judges, and lawyers for changes to the judicial structure.
 


Bilawal said that in his opinion, any legislature’s real strength was not in the majority by which it could pass an amendment, but in the consensus that was present, pointing to the consensus that was present at the time of the 1973 Constitution and the 18th Amendment.
“The constitutional amendment we are bringing today, we have the majority, but we could not form that consensus,” he acknowledged.
On the 26th Amendment, Bilawal said the PPP had strove to ensure that legislative activity took place with consensus, adding that the party had done the same at the time of the 18th Amendment and the 1973 Constitution.
He said that both the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) were on board with the decision to form the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, claiming that the PTI’s other protestations were also catered to.
Speaking of the Charter of Democracy, Bilawal stressed, “We must move forward towards a truth and reconciliation. We must acknowledge that this Pakistan is as much mine as it is of Shehbaz Sharif, of Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and of Imran Khan.”
Noting that political differences ought to be there, he said: “Unless we open such doors that decrease political polarisation, unless we are able to speak to each other and make decisions while having differences […] unless politicians take their fate into their hands […], this house and this country would not function as they should.”
The PPP leader urged the opposition not to leave the political and parliamentary grounds, and called for consistent communication between parties to break the existing deadlock.
‘Don’t empower separatists’: Bilawal says no to any 18th Amendment rollback
During his address, the PPP chairman reminded the ruling allies of other promises made in the Charter of Democracy, calling for their implementation in full.

Mentioning the initial proposals of making changes in the NFC award, which then did not make it to the draft bill due to the PPP’s outright rejection, Bilawal reiterated that his party would not back any reversal of those provincial rights as long as he was its chairman.
Bilawal said he was willing to discuss the matter of “provincial protections” with the government, adding that the province’s tax collection for certain devolved taxes had been better than the Centre’s.
However, he added, “We can talk [with the government] but when we do, the PPP would not discuss what powers and resources the Centre can take from provinces. We will talk about what more resources provinces can take from the Centre to give better performance.”
 
 

The PPP chairman asserted that the 18th Amendment had “buried the politics of separation” by devolving certain ministries to the provinces. “I beg the Centre not to take such steps that will empower separatists, your enemies and opponents.”
At the same time, Bilawal appreciated the government for accepting his party’s demand that the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) include judges from all provinces.
He added that even those against the Amendment must acknowledge this “huge success”, recalling that the bench that sentenced his grandfather Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to death did not have equal representation.
The Bhutto scion said the PPP, the PML-N and other ruling parties “suffered from the suo motu powers” following the tenure of ex-chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry.
 
 

“We saw how courts said suo motu, suo motu and disrespected prime ministers, ministers, governments and embarrassed elected representatives […] After this constitutional amendment, there will be no suo motu,” Bilawal said, adding that only cases filed by a citizen will be heard.
Information minister castigates opposition
Earlier, referring to opposition members’ speeches before his, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said it seemed the others could not recall any events preceding 2022, when Imran, whose party is now in the opposition, was removed as the prime minister.
He took an exception to the opposition protest movement against the 27th Amendment under the slogan of Aise dastoor ko subh-e-be-nur ko main nahi manta main nahi janta (This constitution, this morning bereft of light, I refuse to accept, I refuse to acknowledge).
They read this but fail to say “Iss khule jhoot ko zehen ki loot ko main nahi manta main nahi janta”. (This blatant lie, this stealth of intellect, I refuse to accept, I refuse to acknowledge).
“When they read this couplet of Habib Jalib, they do it selectively. When they talk about fascism, they talk about what they deem fascist,” he said.
He alleged that the PTI had been accepting of “fascism” in the past, saying that in contrast, they had a problem today when Parliament — the highest institution of the country — was on its way to pass a constitutional amendment through a legal strategy, political process and consultation.
“This selective morality, selective justice, double standards —  what exactly is their politics other than this?” Attaullah said, asking why the PTI did not chant such slogans when former NA deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri made the unconstitutional move of dismissing the no-confidence motion against Imran in 2022.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“This is their selective memory,” the PML-N leader added. He noted that many politicians were once part of the PML-N, including PTI’s Shahid Khattak, and said a person “who cared more about his own self than national interests sowed the seeds of hatred”.
“Will he apologise now? […] Will he apologise today for violating the Constitution? It was violated in this very assembly, in this chair. They talk about an apology, so I would like to hand them the list of their sins,” Attaullah said.
The minister questioned whether PTI’s Shehryar Khan Afridi gave any suggestions for “improving” any clause in the proposed 27th Amendment.
“Their selective memory and thinking do not go back any further than 2020,” Attaullah said, referring to the PTI. “They should apologise for what they did in 2017 and the way they came into power through the back door.”
The PML-N leader also criticised the PTI for consistently bringing up the Form-47 controversy following the 2024 general elections.
He taunted the opposition party for having different factions: “There is one faction which brings laptops inside the assembly, but it is Zain Qureshi who suffers, and these people who are sitting here turn on their YouTube camera and preach to people.”
Attaullah quipped that some leaders would be part of the government cabinets but would “flee on the first flight they can find when things get even slightly difficult”. “It is a policy of their party to play good cop, bad cop. They will sit here and talk about the political process while someone out there in different countries will attack state institutions.”
He regretted that “most of Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s speech today was all about Kabul”.
“It is a new trend now to say something that will become a headline in India or Kabul,” he decried.
He then accused the PTI of “polluting the minds of political workers and inciting them to commit crime for political interests”, and later “ditching them” — a reference to the May 9, 2023, protests and their consequences for the party.
Continuing his criticism, he said the PTI had not given any recommendation for the proposed amendment and boycotted parliamentary committee meetings.
“They refuse to become a part of the process.”
He said the PTI had not learned anything in the past four years. “If they had, they would have held talks on the 27th Amendment and become a part of the political process.
“Had they done some research […] we would have had a productive discussion here in the house. We would have sent out a message to the world that Pakistan’s Parliament had held a very fruitful debate on the matter.”
Speaking of Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he mentioned the improved perception of Pakistanis worldwide.
Referring to Achakzai’s speech again, he said the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan would not be tolerated.
He argued that the primary purpose of the 27th Amendment was to improve governance, defence and the delivery of justice. The minister also maintained that the amendment was not being passed in haste and all issues included in it were being discussed for years under the Charter of Democracy.
However, speaking before him, PTI’s Sheh­r­yar Khan Afridi had alleged that the government was “protecting themselves in their haste”.
Referring to a proposed change under the amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings, he said that had President Zardari refused this relief, his respect and honour would have increased. “But today, his actions have resulted in not just the funeral of his honour, but also the PPP’s.”
He termed the 27th Amendment “a simple mockery of the people of Pakistan” and called for the government to learn from past instances. He said the 27th Amendment was a “scar on the face of democracy. The 27th Amendment will humiliate us globally at all levels”.
PPP’s Nafisa Shah defends her party’s role
PPP’s Nafisa Shah also addressed the house, defending her party’s role in the proposed legislation.
Responding to the opposition’s criticism, she said the PPP’s role in the 26th or 27th Constitutional Amendments would have to be viewed taking into consideration the clauses that had not been included in those bills.
“I want to make a list of those. Some of them are a work in progress, but some of them are those that the PPP had already crushed,” Shah continued. “And for that, you will have to acknowledge and laud the PPP’s role”.
She then went on to say that some of the provisions that had not been included in the amendment bill were those regarding the federal structure and resources.
Shah then held up a paper, apparently the draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill, and said: “Article 163-A is not mentioned in here. Why is it so, and why is it important? It is important because whether it is the 18th Amendment [or the] NFC (National Finance Commission) award, 163-A is a very important provision.”
 


She said the proposed changes pertaining to this subject had not been included in the bill because the PPP refused to accept them. The provincial autonomy has to remain intact, she emphasised.
“So, 163-A, which is limiting the provincial share in the NFC, has not been tabled,” she asserted, adding, “I think you have to credit the PPP for that.”
Shah further stated that changes had also been recommended to “enhance executive powers, executive magistracy”. The PPP, she said, had also raised objections to this proposal and did not let it become a part of the bill.
Likewise, the PPP had also ensured the exclusion of amendments pertaining to dual nationality in the bill.
Moving on to the appointment of the chief election commissioner (CEC), she called for the opposition to engage on this matter.
“There is an ongoing debate on this, and all political parties should sit together on this,” she emphasised, adding that the provision relating to the CEC’s, too, had not been tabled.
On the proposed amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which deals with the command of armed forces, she said the suggested changes were about the “command structure”.
“The reform of this command structure just has to be viewed in the perspective of [us] winning a war, winning a difficult war,” Shah said, adding that the other war that the country was engaged in could not be pinned down.
Referring to yesterday’s bomb blast in Islamabad, she said, “This asymmetric war is not just on wars. It is neither [being fought] in the east or the west. Neither it is being fought on our frontiers with Afghanistan nor on the eastern border.
“This is going on internally. And to face these proxy wars, asymmetric wars, we not just need national unity, but also we need to support our armed forces.”
On the basis of these ground realities, Bilawal took the stance to “support this change in command”, she explained.
Shah then went on to address the “most contentious” issue of judicial structure under the proposed amendment. She highlighted two key matters in this regard: the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court and the transfer of judges.
“We have a historical baggage, having faced the consequences of such judicial judgements that are quoted in jurispudence world over because they are strange concoctions. This is the doctrine of necessity,” she said, adding: “It was a concept that had been buried in jurisprudence. In fact, it had been buried in the annals of history.”
But then, she continued, “some judge — I think you will better remember his name, justice Munir I think — he brought it out of nowhere. And this dictum means that which is illegal by law is law by necessity”.
This dictum was used to dismiss elected parliaments, constituent assemblies
and several prime ministers, she added.
In view of this, late prime minister Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz maintained in their wisdom that “we do not want a judiciary that rationalises unconstitutional rule, that dismisses elected prime ministers, dismisses parliaments”.
It was in this perspective that the establishment of an FCC was suggested, and therefore, “we are talking about a constitutional court here”.
On the transfer of judges, she said the PPP endorsed the relevant proposed changes to the extent that transfers should not be used to “arm twist the judges”.
Earlier in her speech, she admitted that many provisions of the proposed 27th Amendment “are something that really need a lot of discussion, that may be a little bit controversial”. But, she continued citing PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, “the circumstances that we are in, you cannot let go off whatever space you are getting — be it a mile or an inch — if you have to move toward civilian supremacy”.
“We have to take whatever space we get. Boycott is not an option,” she asserted.
She added that the PPP had “always engaged positively with the Constitution, with the parliament”.
Speaker urges opposition to hold dialogue
The NA proceedings began today with Sadiq giving the floor to Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai. At this point, the live feed from the NA on its YouTube channel was disrupted.
A recording of his speech was later uploaded to the NA’s YouTube channel, with parts of the speech seemingly edited out and expunged.
When the live feed was restored, Sadiq appeared on the screen, thanking Achakzai. He said PM Shehbaz had repeatedly invited the opposition in the house to hold talks.
“As the speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, I am ready to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition. We will find ways out when you hold talks,” he continued.
Addressing the NA, Achakzai termed the proposed amendments “undemocratic and of the wrong kind”.
He noted that even those were included in advancing those who had “given huge sacrifices”, recalling that ex-premiers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto had to spend years abroad in exile for “wanting rule of the people”.
“You stole the mandate, respected Speaker. I am sorry [but] you have stolen the mandate,” the opposition alliance leader thundered.
 


Achakzai alleged that one of the PML-N MNAs was losing by 6,000 votes last year, and therefore “refused a [seat] saying his people did not vote for him”. Without taking the person’s name, he described him as “respected” and “one of the closest” to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The opposition leader went on to cite two more such alleged cases, but his full comments were unclear as the video uploaded by the NA was censored.
 
 

The PkMAP leader said, “Whether Imran Khan is a good person or a bad person … why did you let him become the prime minister? Why did you keep all institutes of the country in front of him? And then obstructed his path from the courts to the streets.”
Achakzai recalled the revocation of the PTI’s electoral symbol last year and appreciated the youth for voting “on 200 symbols” to foil those “dramas staged while colluding with undemocratic forces”.
The stream was then briefly disrupted again, and when it resumed, Sadiq was saying if “you want to find an excuse not to hold negotiations, then it is our bad luck. Accept my offer, hold talks. You will get results through talks.”
Following that, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan asserted that “we never gave up on dialogue”.
“When our mandate was stolen, [Imran] Khan sahib had nominated Shibli sahib, Omar sahib and Ali Amin Gandapur to hold dialogue. People then started saying that we wanted to talk to the establishment and not politicians.
“So I visited Khan sahib, and we announced outside Adiala Jail that Achakzai sahib had the complete mandate if he wanted to engage the party and make any suggestions from his platform. Achakzai sahib is present here [today]. Efforts were made, but nothing transpired,” Gohar said, with the live stream being disrupted again at this point.
When it resumed, the PTI chairman was reiterating his party’s request to let Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi meet PTI founder Imran Khan in jail.
Responding to him, the speaker said: “Gohar sahib, when your offer was made, you did not even come to me personally. The prime minister showed grace and formed a high-powered committee of the allies.”
The committee held three meetings, but they were not boycotted by this side, Sadiq said, pointing towards the treasury benches. The meetings were boycotted from this side, he added, pointing towards the opposition benches.
‘If bill is tabled today, it will surely be passed’
Speaking to the media outside Parliament earlier today, the information minister said if the amendment bill was tabled in the NA for voting today, it would surely be passed.
He also expressed his wish for the opposition to have “engaged in a fruitful clause-by-clause discussion” on the bill.
 






Creating an uproar without even going through the bill and spinning a narrative would not result in any gain, he said.
Upon being asked whether Nawaz would be visiting Parliament today, he said: “We will also have him meet you”.
Opposition to the bill
The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) as well as changes to the military leadership structure.
 
 

Taking exception to the proposed tweaks, opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pak­­istan has ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the proposed am­­end­ment, urging the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution.
While debating it in the NA yesterday, Barrister Gohar accused the government of attempting to “create another elite class” by means of the bill. He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal in the bill to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, except for the period during which he holds public office following the end of their tenure.
Gohar also warned that “with the passing of the [27th] Amendment, democracy here will only exist in name,” adding that his party “will not accept” it.
Sardar Latif Khosa from his party accused the PPP of “playing naughtily” with the Constitution at the behest of the ruling PML-N.
Similarly, PTI leader Amir Dogar warned the 27th Amendment would paralyse the judiciary, adding that none of its clauses served the public interest.
On the other hand, PML-N’s Barrister Daniyal Chaudhry defended during yesterday’s NA session the planned establishment of the FCC, saying the move was aimed at preventing extra-judicial decisions and reducing the Supreme Court’s (SC) workload.
Speaking on the occasion, PPP leader Shazia Marri asserted that President Zardari did not seek immunity as he had already endured eight years of imprisonment without conviction. She said the PPP would never compromise on the 18th Ame­n­dment or the rights of the people.
Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal of the MQM-P referred to Article 140-A, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments to the article “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of a 28th amendment.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif endorsed the MQM’s call for strengthening local governments to address people’s issues at the grassroots level.
 
 

Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
Passage of the bill so far
The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution is taking shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved.
The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when Bilawal announced on social media platform X on November 3 that a PM Shehbaz-led delegation had sought his party’s support for the amendment.
Subsequently, PM Shehbaz had also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment.
The bill was then tabled in the Senate on Nov 8, just hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet in a meeting chaired by PM Shehbaz via a video link from Baku. It was subsequently referred to the Senate and NA standing committees on law and justice, which approved it the very next day with some minor changes to the initial draft.
The law minister tabled it in the Senate for voting on Nov 10. The contentious bill was approved by the upper house of Parliament after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The PML-N led coalition government had managed to secure a two-thirds majority to get the bill passed with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.</p><small>2025-11-12 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12162645b9bc53d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954673/india-says-delhi-blast-was-terror-incident-death-toll-rises-to-12' target='_blank'><strong>India says Delhi blast was ‘terror incident’, death toll rises to 12</strong></a><br><p>India’s government confirmed on Wednesday that it was treating a car blast that killed 12 people and wounded at least 20 others in Delhi as a “terror incident” and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice as swiftly as possible.
In a resolution adopted late on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet said: “The country has witnessed a heinous terror incident, perpetrated by anti-national forces, through a car explosion.“
“The Cabinet directs that the investigation into the incident be pursued with the utmost urgency and professionalism so that the perpetrators, their collaborators, and their sponsors are identified and brought to justice without delay.”
Meanwhile, India’s anti-terrorism agency spearheaded the third day of investigations into the car blast.
Police are yet to give exact details of what caused the intense explosion near the historic Red Fort in the crowded Old Delhi quarter of the city, one of India’s most well-known landmarks, and the site of the annual prime minister’s Independence Day speech. The blast was the first such explosion in the heavily guarded city of more than 30 million people since 2011.
“Twelve people have died and more than 30 are injured,” Ritu Saxena, the chief medical officer of Delhi’s LNJP hospital, told AFP.
India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) is leading the probe into the explosion, which came hours after police said they had arrested a gang and seized explosive materials and assault rifles.
Home Minister Amit Shah, after chairing security talks following Monday’s blast, said he had instructed officials “to hunt down each and every culprit behind this incident”.
Indian police claimed the men were linked with groups Jaish-i-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind. India lists both groups as terrorist organisations.
Police are also investigating if there is a link between this week’s car blast in Delhi and the earlier arrest of a group of seven men from occupied Kashmir with arms and bomb-making material, according to three sources familiar with the probe.
Indian authorities are investigating the blast under a stringent anti-terrorism law and have said that all angles are being probed. They have not named anyone or made any arrests in connection with the explosion.
Two doctors arrested
Hours before the blast in Delhi, police in Indian occupied Kashmir said they had arrested seven men, including two doctors, in connection with a separate anti-terror probe and searches in the region and in the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh that border Delhi.
Police found two pistols, two assault rifles and 2,900 kilogrammes of bomb-making material during the raids, a police statement said.
“The investigation has revealed a white collar terror ecosystem, involving radicalised professionals and students in contact with foreign handlers, operating from Pakistan and other countries,” it alleged, claiming that the men were linked to groups Jaish-i-Mohammad and Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind.
The Foreign Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Senior Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have vowed to punish those behind the Delhi blast, with Modi saying no “conspirator” would be spared.
In April, 26 men were killed in an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed on Pakistan, a charge denied by Islamabad. The crisis led to the worst military conflict between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades before they agreed to a ceasefire after four days.
Raids in occupied Kashmir
The connection between the Delhi car driver and the seven men arrested is being investigated, the three sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media on the sensitive issue.
Investigations were focused on whether the driver was a doctor and a colleague of one of the two arrested, one of the sources said.
Spokespersons for the Delhi Police and the NIA did not respond to requests for comment.
Following the Delhi blast, police in occupied Kashmir carried out raids at hundreds of locations in the region and about 500 people were detained, a police source told Reuters. Most were let off after questioning, the source said.</p><small>2025-11-12 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12204624cd87c67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954686/house-democrats-release-epstein-papers-saying-trump-knew-about-the-girls' target='_blank'><strong>House Democrats release Epstein papers saying Trump ‘knew about the girls’</strong></a><br><p>Democrats released emails on Wednesday in which convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein suggested that United States President Donald Trump was aware of the financier’s sexual abuse and definitely “knew about the girls”.
Trump has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the sex-trafficking activities of his former friend, who died by suicide in federal prison in 2019 as he was awaiting trial.
But Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said the emails “raise serious questions about Donald Trump and his knowledge of Epstein’s horrific crimes”.
The furore around the disgraced financier is still roiling Trump’s administration four months after his Justice Department effectively closed the case, announcing there was no more information to share.
Democrats in the House — keen to capitalise on the simmering controversy — have been trying to force a vote that would compel publication of the full Epstein case files.
The newly released emails were written to longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking after Epstein’s death, and author Michael Wolff.
In them, Epstein asserts Trump spent significant time with a woman whom Oversight Democrats describe as a victim of Epstein’s sex trafficking.
In one email to Wolff shared by Democrats and dated January 31, 2019, Epstein allegedly wrote: “Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever… of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.”
In another message from April 2011, Epstein told Maxwell: “I want you to realise that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump.”
He added that an unnamed victim “spent hours at my house with him … he has never once been mentioned”.
Maxwell replied: “I have been thinking about that.”
Democrats on the House Oversight Committee obtained the emails after subpoenaing Epstein’s estate earlier this year.
Trump has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or Maxwell.
The White House issued a response accusing Democrats of pushing a “fake narrative” after the emails were released.
“The Democrats selectively leaked emails to the liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
The release came on the day that House Speaker Mike Johnson is scheduled to swear in Democratic Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva to succeed her late father in Congress.
Grijalva is expected to provide the final signature needed for a petition to force a House vote to release all unclassified records related to Epstein, something Johnson and Trump have resisted up to now.
The top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Representative Robert Garcia, called on the Justice Department to fully release the Epstein files to the public.
“The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover. These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the president,” he said in a statement.
Conspiracy theories
In a July 7 memo, the Justice Department said the Epstein “client list” that Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed to have been reviewing did not in fact exist, and reaffirmed that he died by suicide in his prison cell.
It sparked a furious backlash from Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) support base, who have for years been told by their leaders that a “deep state” cover-up was protecting figures in the Democratic Party whom they accused of being Epstein’s clients.
 
 

Trump’s MAGA lieutenants, including two allies who have since been hired to run the Federal Bureau of Investigation, made careers of fanning the conspiracy theories, including that Epstein’s suicide was actually a murder ordered by his powerful clients.
Prominent online influencers and media figures in the movement — as well as ordinary voters — have spoken of feeling betrayed after Trump began publicly castigating them for wanting answers.
Trump’s ties to Epstein are extensive. The pair were pictured partying together during a 15-year friendship before they reportedly fell out in 2004 over a property deal, and when Trump subsequently denounced his former ally.
Epstein admitted to two state felony prostitution charges in 2008 as part of a plea deal — arranged by a prosecutor who would go on to serve in Trump’s cabinet — that was widely criticised as being too lenient.</p><small>2025-11-12 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12195711a24b6a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954682/3-final-year-medical-university-students-drown-at-manora-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>3 final-year medical university students drown at Manora in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Three final year students from Karachi’s Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) drowned during a picnic at Manora, while three others who survived were moved to a medical facility for treatment, a statement by the university said on Wednesday.
According to the statement, a batch of 150 university students was on a picnic at Hawkesbay beach, while 15 students from the same batch had planned a separate picnic at Manora.
The beach trip is part of a “long-standing tradition” where final-year students spend a week celebrating.
“It has been reported that the venue (a hut) was booked by the father of one of the students, where the group went to enjoy their outing,” said the statement.
It added that the college administration had arranged for 150 students to travel to Hawkesbay with security guards and all necessary safety measures.
“However, the college administration and the principal of Dow Medical College were not informed about the separate Manora picnic organised by the 15 students,” the statement clarified.
It noted that the students who went to Hawkesbay beach returned safely to the college, while the tragic incident occurred at Manora.
“In the afternoon, a powerful wave swept one student into the sea; as others rushed to rescue him, the mishap occurred,” the statement said, adding that their bodies have been moved to the mortuary of Karachi’s Civil Hospital.
The statement added that three other students who survived the ordeal were shifted to a medical facility for treatment.
However, DIG South Syed Asad Raza said that five students drowned, out of which two were rescued and none are missing.
The university administration has “issued special instructions to ensure the best medical care for the injured students”.

A day prior, 12 people were killed and 36 were injured in a suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area, according to officials. Security was tightened in the federal capital and in other major areas like Lahore.
The fake warning doing the rounds stated: “Based on verified intelligence reports received from federal and provincial law enforcement agencies, the Government of Sindh has declared a high-level security alert in the Karachi Metropolitan Area, effective from 12:01am on November 12, 2025, until 11:59pm on November 30, 2025.”
The alert listed several public places such as shopping centres and schools that were declared “high-risk locations” and to be avoided by the public, including Dolmen Mall, Empress Market, Jinnah International Airport and all schools, colleges, academies and tuition centres.
It also provided security measures that malls and markets, educational institutions and the general public should employ, ranging from walkthrough gate and metal detector searches to reporting suspicious, unattended vehicles.
“Failure to comply with these instructions will result in strict legal action under the Sindh Security of Vulnerable Establishments Act 2024 and the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997,” the notice read, bearing the name of Sindh Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Syed Kaleem Imam.
Later today, the Sindh Home Department issued a statement clarifying that the alert was fake and refuted that it issued any such notification under the reference number HD/Sec/Clarification-11/2025.
“No official correspondence bearing the aforementioned reference number or title has been released by this department or by any law enforcement agency operating under its administrative control,” the home department stated.
“It is further clarified that all genuine security advisories, alerts, and notifications are issued exclusively through official channels of the home department or through duly authorised law enforcement agencies,” it added. “Any document or message circulated outside these channels should be considered unauthentic and misleading.”
The press release urged the general public and the media to refrain from “sharing or relying upon unverified information” on social media and to verify official communications through government sources.
Yesterday, the imposition of Section 144 across the province was extended for another month, a notification from the Sindh Home Department stated.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
The department imposed Section 144 across the province for a period of one month on October 12 to maintain law and order in the interest of “public and peace”.
According to the notification the ban on all public gatherings and demonstrations was extended for another month, effective from November 12 (Wednesday).</p><small>2025-11-12 15:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633304-islamabad-blast-motorcycle-rider-who-brought-suicide-bomber-taken-into-custody' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad blast: Motorcycle rider who transported suicide bomber 'taken into custody'</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, the association said that the figure of 32pc represents the cumulative increase over the past two years, not just after deregulation.
“The actual increase of 15pc includes around 2.5pc growth in production units and new product introductions, meaning the real impact on existing medicines is closer to 13.5pc,” the statement highlighted.
Citing the latest IQVIA report, considered the most reliable global source for pharmaceutical sales and pricing data, the PPMA said the overall price increase stood at only 16pc over the last 12 months.
“Before deregulation, Pakistan’s pharmaceutical sector was facing a severe crisis due to strict price controls, unprecedented rupee depreciation, and record inflation of up to 35pc,” as per PPMA.
These factors, according to the statement, led to acute shortages of vital medicines, including anti-cancer drugs, insulin, anti-TB medicines, heparin, and cardiovascular drugs, forcing patients to rely on counterfeit or smuggled alternatives.
The deregulation policy for non-essential medicines, it said, has helped restore the availability of over 50 life-saving and critical drugs in local pharmacies, as manufacturers have resumed production.
“The association thanked the government for taking timely action to stabilise the market and align Pakistan’s policy with international standards, where only essential medicines remain under price control, as practiced in India and Bangladesh,” the statement noted.</p><small>2025-11-12 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633292-karachi-security-threat-alert-goes-viral-sindh-govt-issues-clarification' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi security threat alert goes viral: Sindh govt issues clarification</strong></a><br><p>

Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar told Dawn, “After the incident, the police reached the spot and began a search operation, which is still underway.”
According to the official, Khan was on his way to attend a funeral when a pre-planted bomb exploded 300 feet away from his house. However, no casualties have been reported.
DPO Umar said that the Swat police were ready to deal with all kinds of situations.
Khan was also the senior vice president of the ANP. The party’s central president, Aimal Wali Khan, in a statement on social media, condemned the attack.
“The people of Swat have made unparalleled sacrifices against terrorism and extremism,” said ANP’s post on X.
“This recent incident clearly shows that terrorists are attempting to silence those voices that speak for peace, tolerance, and democracy through organised planning,” the statement added.
 






“ANP’s stance has been clear from day one that terrorists are not the enemies of any sect, nation, or group, but of all humanity,” it said, adding that the government and law enforcement agencies should conduct a thorough investigation of the incident and take strict action against those responsible.
Politicians and ANP workers have been targeted in the past as well.
In July this year, Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead by unidentified suspects in KP’s Bajaur district. Two months later, a worker of the party, Mir Azam Khan, was shot dead by unknown assailants in the same district.
In 2018, Haroon Bilour, a senior ANP leader and candidate, was killed in a suicide bombing in Peshawar during an election rally. His father, Bashir Bilour, also a senior party leader and ex-provincial minister, was killed in a suicide attack in Peshawar in December 2012.</p><small>2025-11-12 10:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633274-kp-aman-jirga-cm-afridi-opposes-making-anti-terror-policies-behind-closed-doors' target='_blank'><strong>Aman Jirga urges Centre to consult KP govt over Pak-Afghan foreign policy</strong></a><br><p>

The Hague’s Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had issued its Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the IWT on August 8. On September 19, Pakistan initiated an arbitration against India under the provisions of the IWT, which India suspended unilaterally following a four-day conflict between the two countries in May.
The PCA on Saturday issued clarifications on its decisions surrounding the treaty in response to the request, which concerned the interpretation and application of the IWT to certain design elements of run-of-river hydroelectric plants (HEPs).
The FO statement added that Pakistan had also taken note of the procedural order issued in parallel with the decision.
In response to a Procedural Order also issued in light of the decision, in which the court invited both parties to report on the status of Neutral Expert Proceedings, the FO said, “The Neutral Expert proceedings were initiated on India’s request with their next phase scheduled to take place in Vienna from 17-21 November 2025. While India has decided to halt its participation, Pakistan continues to fully participate in the Neutral Expert proceedings in good faith.”
It added that in this regard, the Neutral Expert had ruled that India’s non-participation could not operate as a bar to the proceedings going forward.
According to a press release issued by the PCA, the requested clarifications included those in relation to Article III, which concerns the Western rivers, and paragraph 8 of Annexure D, which concerns new run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on these rivers.
“The award also addressed a related question on the legal effect of decisions issued by dispute resolution bodies under the Treaty (namely, courts of
arbitration and neutral experts),” the press release said.
The court found Pakistan’s request for clarification to be “timely” and provided clarifications as to the meaning and scope of several aspects of its decisions, as well as its reasoning behind them. According to the statement, it also found that its clarifications would have the same binding effect as the original award.
The court clarified that its decisions on paragraph 8(a) of Annexure D to the treaty were “not limited to freeboard but, rather, extend to all components of run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on the Western rivers”. It also stated that the decisions “further prohibit any design that would allow … the works themselves to be capable of raising artificially the water level in the operating pool above the Full Pondage Level specified in the design”, whether from the outset or via later modifications.
The body further clarified that its references to “designing an Annexure D, Part 3 HEP” and the “design” of an Annexure D referenced mandatory design criteria, to be applied at the outset — i.e. at the time of planning. It added that these criteria were distinct from post-commissioning operational constraints on a HEP and could not be satisfied “simply by an acknowledgement of or commitment to operational restraint”.
However, it declined Pakistan’s request to clarify that a crest-gated spillway with gates extending above Full Pondage Level was prohibited under paragraphs 8a and 8e of the annexure, as well as that the design of an Annexure D, Part 3 HEP must always include an ungated spillway. It stated these clarifications to be outside the scope of its award.
The Court of Arbitration further clarified that its reference in paragraph 742 to the list of data and information that India is required to convey to
Pakistan is an indicative list and is not comprehensive.
It additionally clarified its finding that pondage required for firm power would be calculated “based on, among other things, a realistic, well-founded, and defensible projection of the proposed Annexure D, Part 3 HEP’s installed capacity and anticipated load, reflecting the fluctuations in the discharge of the turbines arising from variations in the daily and weekly loads of the plant, as set forth in Paragraph 2(c) of Annexure D”.
Once again, it declined the request for clarification as to how the treaty regulated the basis upon which India must determine the installed capacity and anticipated load of a proposed Annexure D, Part 3 HEP, and, once
determined how these elements were to be taken into account to calculate maximum pondage.
As well as terming this to be outside the scope of the award, it recalled its conclusion that “Pakistan or India may seek to pursue the matter through the Treaty’s dispute resolution procedures, including a further phase of these proceedings”. It confirmed that it was open to conducting a further phase of
These proceedings upon request from either party.
The court also issued Procedural Order No. 16, as part of which it confirmed that it would continue to conduct these proceedings “in a phased manner, bearing in mind the status of, and developments concerning, the proceedings taking place before the Neutral Expert”.
It invited each party to provide written submissions on the status of these proceedings and its views as to any further phases of the proceedings with respect to any matters that were not resolved in the award.</p><small>2025-11-12 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633268-dialogue-always-our-preferred-instrument-for-stability-progress-says-dpm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Dialogue always our preferred instrument for stability, progress, says DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

On his return to international cricket, the grind of first-class cricket paved the way for a fiery spell of fast bowling that clinched victory for Pakistan with the 32-year-old ripping through the Sri Lankan top-order, and finishing with figures of 4-61, as the hosts scraped to a six-run win in the first One-day International at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Tuesday night.
“It wasn’t easy to win tonight,” Haris said at the post-match press conference. “It wasn’t easy to bowl in the dew but you keep trying as a bowler to pick wickets and in the end we won, which was important.”
 
 

The performance was important for Haris as well. Slammed for being too easy to put away in the highly-charged Asia Cup final against arch-rivals India, the right-armer got back to work with Islamabad in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy.
“You keep giving your best effort and try to make an impact,” he said. “In our field, there is no forgiveness. Expectations are always high but sometimes you win, some times you lose. We are not machines. As a player, you have to keep believing in yourself as there is always the next morning after the night.”
The first Quaid-e-Azam Trophy outing at the start of October against Lahore Whites didn’t give Haris much of a chance to flex his arm. In a match that petered out to a draw, he bowled just eight overs, picking 1-21.
The second match, at the end of last month, also didn’t go very much to plan with the speedster returing figures of 2-82 in 17 years in the first innings before getting 1-34 in 10 overs of the second innings as Islamabad were handed a crushing 311-run defeat.
The key, though, as he noted on Tuesday, was about getting the overs in the tank.
“As a player, as a bowler, you start preparing for the next assignment,” he told reporters, adding that was also looking to return to the Test side.
“One-dayers demand longer spells so I played four-dayers, which helped. You aim to bowl around 40 overs during the match and fine-tune your body.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Having been dropped for the T20 series against South Africa, Haris was set to return for the three-match ODI series against South Africa in Faisalabad last week, only to be suspended for the first two games after being found guilty of violating ICC’s Code of Conduct during the Asia Cup match against India.
He played the third ODI, but bowled just three overs as spinners took charge and led Pakistan to a series win over the Proteas.
Different story
On Tuesday, however, it was a different story.
Pakistan had rode on a brilliant unbeaten century by Salman Ali Agha and a maiden ODI half-century by Hussain Talat to post 299-5 and after Sri Lankan openers had given their side a solid start in the chase, Haris made the difference.
 






He broke the 85-run opening partnership between Kamil Mishara and Pathum Nissanka, getting the former caught at mid-off and then had Kusal Mendis chop him onto his stumps on the very next delivery.
Haris then found the seam movement that led to Nissanka’s undoing, the opener getting caught behind, and Sri Lanka having been reduced to 90-3.
The pacer, though, wasn’t done for the night as he returned to end a fourth-wicket stand of 57 by sending back Sadeera Samarawickrama, after a brilliant catch in the slip by Babar Azam.
Sri Lanka were down and out at 210-7 and although Wanindu Hasaranga made a 52-ball 59, Pakistan got over the line.
“It was a team effort that took us to victory,” said Haris. “You win as a team and you bowl in partnerships. Sometimes you don’t get wickets from one end but you get it from the other end.”
Turning point
The second match of the series is on Thursday and Sri Lanka will look to hit back, having lost their way after they had Pakistan on the ropes early on.
Hasaranga, who picked up 3-54, had reduced Pakistan to 95-4 halfway through their innings only for Salman (105 not out) and Hussain (62) to wrest back momentum and power the hosts to what proved to be a winning score.
“That was the turning point,” Hasaranga said at the post match press conference. “Credit should go to Salman and Hussain as they batted really well. In the first 20-25 overs, we did really well but then our plans and their execution went wrong.”
It was a sentiment that his captain Charith Asalanka had shared earlier at the post-match ceremony.
“The way Salman and Hussain batted, it took the game away,” said Asalanka. “We gave away too many runs, it should have been under 270.”
Pakistan skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi admitted the partnership between Salman and Hussain was key but added a word for Haris: “A target of 300 was good and then Haris gave us crucial wickets.”</p><small>2025-11-12 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633264-student-recounts-terror-attack-at-cadet-college-wana-foiled-by-pakistan-army' target='_blank'><strong>Student recounts terror attack at Cadet College Wana foiled by Pakistan Army</strong></a><br><p>

The polling firm Ipsos asked 9,000 people to listen to two clips of AI-generated music and one of human-made music in a survey conducted for France-based streaming platform Deezer.
“Ninety-seven per cent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,” said Deezer.
The survey came out as a country music song featuring a male singer’s voice generated by AI reached the top of the US charts for the first time this week.
“Walk My Walk” by Breaking Rust — an artist widely reported by US media to be powered by generative AI technology — made it to the top spot on Billboard magazine’s chart ranking digital sales of country songs, according to data published on Monday.
Deezer said more than half of the respondents to its survey felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.
Pollsters also asked broader questions about the impact of AI, with 51pc saying the technology would lead to more low-quality music on streaming platforms and almost two-thirds believing it will lead to a loss of creativity.
“The survey results clearly show that people care about music and want to know if they’re listening to AI or human made tracks or not,” Deezer CEO Alexis Lanternier said.
One in three streamed tracks AI
Deezer said there has not only been a surge in AI-generated content being uploaded to its platform, but it is finding listeners.
In January, one in 10 of the tracks streamed each day were completely AI-generated. Ten months later, that percentage has climbed to over one in three, or nearly 40,000 per day.
Eighty per cent of survey respondents wanted fully AI-generated music clearly labelled for listeners.
Deezer is the only major music-streaming platform that systematically labels completely AI-generated content for users.
The issue gained prominence in June when a band called The Velvet Sundown suddenly went viral on Spotify, and only confirmed the following month that it was in fact AI-generated content.
The AI group’s most popular song has been streamed more than three million times.
In response, Spotify said it would encourage artists and publishers to sign up to a voluntary industry code to disclose AI use in music production.

He made the remarks while addressing the two-day Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference being held in Islamabad, where he mentioned the suicide blast in the federal capital and the attack on the Cadet College in Wana.
“Let me be very clear — these cowardly acts will never shake or weaken our national resolve to deal with this menace [terrorism],” he said.
“If anything, they reaffirm our conviction that dialogue, understanding and partnership are the only sustainable path of peace and security,” he asserted.
“We just witnessed two heinous acts of terrorism in Wana and Islamabad in the last 48 hours, resulting in the loss of 15 precious lives,” the minister said.
Condemning the attacks and extending sympathies to the victims’ families, Dar went on to say: “We categorically reject acts of terrorism in all forms and manifestations, whether these take place in Islamabad or anywhere in the world.”
Dar noted that terrorism was “one of the major global challenges of our time,” stressing that “Pakistan has been a bulwark against this menace that does not recognise any boundary or religion, gender, ethnicity or race”.
The suicide blast in Islamabad, the first in the federal capital in nearly three years, came against the backdrop of international events being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a tri-nation cricket series featuring Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe was also underway, with a match in Rawalpindi on Tuesday.
Officials said the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had claimed responsibility for the suicide attack in Islamabad. According to the police, a lone bomber blew himself up at the main entrance to the complex, located in the G-11 sector, after failing in repeated attempts to enter the premises, where hundreds of litigants and lawyers were present.
Meanwhile, security sources said on Wednesday that all the khawarij involved in the attack on Cadet College in Wana had been killed.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-11-12 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/12111156e050362.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954654/turkiye-says-military-plane-crash-in-georgia-killed-all-20-onboard' target='_blank'><strong>Turkiye says military plane crash in Georgia killed all 20 onboard</strong></a><br><p>Turkiye on Wednesday said all 20 people onboard a military cargo plane that crashed in Georgia on its return from Azerbaijan had died.
The plane had taken off from Ganja airport in western Azerbaijan on Tuesday afternoon but crashed shortly after crossing the border into eastern Georgia, the defence ministry said after the incident.
It said there were 20 people on board, including the flight crew.
“Our heroic comrades-in-arms were martyred on November 11, 2025 due to the crash of our C-130 military cargo aircraft, which had taken off from Azerbaijan to return to Turkiye,” Defence Minister Yasar Guler said in a statement posted on his X account alongside 20 photographs of those who died.
Turkiye has not said what caused the accident but dramatic footage taken by eyewitnesses and published by Azerbaijani media appeared to show the plane spinning horizontally alongside several bits of debris as it fell.
Georgia’s interior ministry had confirmed the plane went down in the Sighnaghi area, “about five kilometres (3.1 miles) from Georgia’s state border” with Azerbaijan.
Georgian air traffic control said the plane had disappeared from its radar shortly after entering its airspace “without transmitting a distress signal” and that it had been alerted to the crash by the emergency services.
The C-130 Hercules military cargo plane is made by US manufacturer Lockheed Martin.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said he was “deeply saddened” by the crash and extended his condolences to Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and to the people of Turkiye.
 






“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the departed. Pakistan stands in full solidarity with our Turkish brothers and sisters in this hour of grief,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-12 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633235-govt-eager-to-see-constitutional-court-in-place-by-thursday' target='_blank'><strong>Govt eager to see constitutional court in place by tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

Canberra has drawn ever nearer to longtime ally Washington, bolstering its military in an attempt to deter the might of a rising China in the Asia-Pacific region.
Jakarta has walked a more neutral path, wary of drawing too close to Washington and far less willing to needle Beijing.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, speaking alongside President Prabowo Subianto at a Royal Australian Navy Base in Sydney, said they had “just substantively concluded negotiations on a new bilateral treaty on our common security”.
“This treaty is a recognition from both our nations that the best way to secure … peace and stability is by acting together,” Albanese told reporters.
The Australian leader said he hoped to visit Indonesia next year to sign the new treaty.
He said the agreement builds on a bilateral defence pact signed in 2024, which pledged closer cooperation in the contested Asia-Pacific region and included provisions for each military operating in the other country.
The new agreement will commit the two countries to “consult at a leader and ministerial level, on a regular basis on matters of security”, Albanese said.
It will also facilitate “mutually beneficial security activities, and if either or both countries’ security is threatened, to consult and consider what measures may be taken, either individually or jointly, to deal with those threats,” he said.
Prabowo said the deal committed the two countries to “close cooperation in the defence and security field”.
“We cannot choose our neighbours … especially countries like us,” he said.
“Good neighbours will help each other in times of difficulties,” he added.</p><small>2025-11-12 05:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633227-na-expected-to-pass-27th-amendment-bill-as-crucial-session-resumes-today' target='_blank'><strong>National Assembly passes 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill amid opposition's walkout</strong></a><br><p>

A police official said the bodies and the injured were shifted to the district headquarters hospital.
He identified the deceased as Habibullah, 5, a resident of Malikhel Janikhel, and Amjad Ali, 35, and Irfanullah, 35, residents of Sardikhel Janikhel, and said the injured included Rukhniaz, 35, Naheedullah, 24, Mohammad Rauf, 33, and Irshadullah, 35, all residents of Janikhel.
 
 

Similar quadcopter attacks were carried out by terrorists against police installations and civilians in the district in the recent past.

Terrorists kill police official; attack on police station repulsed

On July 31, six security personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station amid an operation against terrorists in the Nurar area.
In another quadcopter strike that took place four months ago, a woman was killed and three others were wounded in the Sra Bangla area of the district.
 
 

Police said the Miryan police station had come under multiple quadcopter attacks in the last several months. They said that the attacks were being carried out by terrorists in the district.
Meanwhile, a policeman was martyred when terrorists attacked him in the Walkhi Mammakhel area of Bannu district on Tuesday.
A police official said the attack was reported within the limits of the Havaid police station.
The deceased was identified as Ilyas, who was posted to the investigation wing at the Saddar police station.
“Unidentified men opened fire on constable Ilyas near his house when he was coming to the Saddar police station to join his duty,” the official said, adding the assailants fled on motorcycles.
He said that the body was transported to the district headquarters hospital to fulfil medico-legal formalities. The official said after the targeted killing of the constable, a large police contingent reached the area and launched a search for attackers.
On Monday night, police repulsed a terrorist attack on a police station in the Ahmadzai area of Bannu district.
The official said the terrorists carried out the attack with advanced light and heavy weapons in an attempt to breach the building, but the policemen foiled the bid.
He added that in the retaliatory action, several terrorists were killed and injured but their accomplices took them away.
According to a statement issued by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police director (public relations), Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi lauded policemen for their bravery and professionalism and said that the region’s police were in the frontline to protect their motherland and defeat terrorism. They said that the police were fully prepared and capable of countering any challenge effectively.
Provincial Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed also praised the police for their quick and effective action against terrorists to protect the police station and said the police were always ready and alert for protecting people’s lives and properties.
“Bannu police always showed excellent commitment to maintaining law and order and ensuring establishment of lasting peace in the region,” he said.
The IGP announced cash rewards and appreciation certificates for the police team which foiled the terrorist attack.
Separately, the terrorists torched the furniture in the government primary school in the Paharkhel Pacca area of Lakki Marwat district.
The incident occurred at midnight within the limits of Ghaznikhel police station, according to an official.
He said that unidentified armed men entered the school building and set the furniture and other goods on fire. The official said that the police had launched a search for culprits.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, the college came under attack on Monday as terrorists rammed an explosives-laden vehicle against the main gate of the college, entered the educational facility and were then “cornered in the college’s administrative block”. Security sources on Tuesday had continued the clearance operation against the terrorists hiding inside the educational institute.
Early on Wednesday, security sources said that one suicide bomber and four other khawarij were killed in a successful operation. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Security sources said that the college building was currently being cleared due to the threat of landmines. They asserted that no student or teacher at the college was harmed during the successful operation.

Speaking to Geo News shortly after midnight, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar termed the operation a “huge achievement” of the Pakistan Army, adding that 550 students were safely evacuated.
He said that the attack on the college could have been a bigger incident than the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in 2014. “The lives of these students were successfully saved using perseverance and expertise,” he said.
“This was a difficult task and a sensitive operation. And our army has proven once again that it is included among the world’s best,” he said. The minister said that Pakistan had “won two wars” against India and Pakistan, lauding security forces.
The minister said that Pakistan had proven its worth in conventional warfare and was also doing the same in the “proxy war”. He reiterated Islamabad’s demand that Afghanistan’s soil not be used for carrying out terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
He said that investigations would be carried out into the attack in Wana as well as the suicide attack in Islamabad on Tuesday. “Concrete evidence of the attacks will be shared with friendly countries and international forums,” he said.
The minister asserted that Pakistan would uncover those involved in terrorist activities. He said that security forces were alert and ready to deal with any eventuality.
“We are in good hands. Our security is in strong hands, so there is nothing to worry about,” he said, reiterating that the operation was a “huge success”.
On Tuesday, a report from DHQ Hospital Wana confirmed that nine civilians, including men, women and children, sustained injuries when the explosion caused nearby structures to collapse. Hospital MS Dr Jan Muhammad said all injured individuals were receiving full medical treatment and necessary facilities.
PM, president vow action against foreign-backed terrorism
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari met at the Presidency a day earlier, where they discussed the country’s security situation in the wake of the attacks in Wana and Islamabad.
Condemning the incidents, the premier and the president had an “exchange of views on the country’s overall political and security situation”, state-run PTV said in a post on X.
 






“Both leaders reaffirm their resolve that actions against foreign-backed terrorists and their facilitators will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism,” PTV added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past few years, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
‘Clear Afghan involvement’
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Tuesday that it was “clear” that Afghanistan was directly involved in the attack.
Noting that the terrorists had been identified as Afghan, the interior minister said the attackers’ “communication with their people in Afghanistan also continued the entire night”.
Referring to multiple visits carried out by top Pakistani leadership to Afghanistan, Naqvi said: “The foreign minister, deputy prime minister, defence minister — we all have gone numerous times and presented them with evidence and details on how they (terrorists) are being trained in Afghanistan, how they plan and then come here to carry out attacks.”
“We are very clear in this that Afghanistan must stop them under all circumstances. In case of not stopping them, we will have no other option but to deal with the terrorists who are attacking our country,“ he asserted.
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Tuesday that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-11-12 04:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/120808562f0ec65.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954608/ihc-issues-notices-to-adiala-jail-official-on-contempt-plea' target='_blank'><strong>IHC issues notices to Adiala jail official on contempt plea</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday issued notices to relevant authorities while hearing a contempt of court petition filed by lawyer Salman Akram Raja for having been denied a meeting with the incarcerated founder of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), despite a clear judicial order permitting it.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir heard the petition and sought explanation from officials concerned over non-implementation of the court’s earlier directive.
Mr Raja appeared in person and informed the court that despite the written order, he was not allowed to meet the former prime minister at Adiala jail.
He said SHO Aizaz failed to comply with the court’s instructions, saying, “The order was explicit, yet I was barred from meeting my client.”
He further requested the court to allow the deputy registrar (judicial) to accompany him to the jail to ensure compliance. However, Justice Tahir declined, observing, “No, we cannot send him along. We will issue notices, and action will be taken strictly according to the law.”
The court then summoned the assistant attorney general to the rostrum and questioned why the meeting did not take place despite the IHC’s clear direction.
Justice Tahir remarked that if Mr Raja could not meet his client, “how will he assist us in the Twitter/X case?”
The assistant attorney general responded that he would again convey the court’s order to the authorities concerned to ensure its implementation. Subse­quently, the bench issued notices to the home secretary, Adiala jail superintendent, and other respondents, seeking their replies before the next hearing.
The court adjourned the proceedings, with the next date to be communicated through a written order.

The draft, presented to the UNSC on Monday, triggered a “silence” period until 10:30am on Tuesday. Under this procedure, the council’s 15 members must register objections or propose amendments within the allotted timeframe; if none are raised, consensus is assumed and the resolution proceeds to a vote, likely later this week, on Thursday or Friday.
 
 

The proposed force wou­ld operate under a Board of Peace (BoP), with Pres­ident Donald Trump as its head. The board would also establish operational entities to oversee Gaza’s reconstruction, economic recovery programmes, and the demilitarisation of non-state armed groups.
Washington has embedded the full “20-point” Trump peace plan into the draft, signalling the United States’ dominant role in shaping the international effort.

Several states remain cautious as US circulates revised draft resolution to be tabled in UNSC

Yet the initiative faces significant diplomatic and practical obstacles. Several countries remain cautious: the United Arab Emirates (UAE) cites legal uncertainties and has refused participation until they are addressed; Jordan has ruled out deploying troops; Azerbaijan says it will join only if a full ceasefire is in place; and Turkey has been excluded at Israel’s insistence.
Indonesia, Pakistan, and other Muslim-majority states that appear willing to contribute forces are also concerned. While they are open to participating in a UN-mandated mission, they “do not want to be a joint B team of the Israeli military focused solely on disarming Hamas,” a UN diplomat explained.
Israel, too, has begun voicing complaints that it is being sidelined, with its liaison unit effectively restricted to limited aid delivery rather than full participation in force planning.
Into this complex mix comes the World Bank’s endorsement. In a letter to Washington, Bank President Ajay Banga affirmed that the institution “backs language in the US-drafted resolution” authorising the two-year BOP mandate and allowing the Bank’s operational engagement in Gaza.
The draft explicitly calls on the Bank and other financial institutions to provide resources for reconstruction, including the establishment of a dedicated trust fund governed by donors. Estimates for Gaza’s rebuilding costs have recently been revised upwards to roughly US$70 billion.
Meanwhile, US media reports on Tuesday revealed deep internal concerns within the Trump administration over the feasibility of the broader peace deal underpinning the resolution.
Documents obtained by Politico show that the administration convened a two-day symposium last month in southern Israel with around 400 participants, drawn from the RAND Corporation, NGOs, and the State and Defence Departments, alongside a newly formed Civil-Military Coordination Center. The event, led by Michael Fenzel, the US security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority, featured 67 slides across six segments.
Participants were reportedly “concerned about whether a so-called International Stabilisation Force — a multinational initiative meant to maintain peace in Gaza — can realistically be deployed,” the report noted.
Materials obtained by Politico included situation reports on Gaza, advisory documents from the Blair Institute, led by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, and internal government slides. A US defence official told the newspaper that the documents “reflect the administration’s close-held concerns” about the region’s future. The Blair Institute declined to comment on its involvement but stressed its documents were factual assessments, not policy advocacy.
The report observed that “the mood behind the scenes is more guarded than public statements suggest,” noting that challenges remain in securing troop commitments, clarifying legal and governance frameworks, raising reconstruction funding, and achieving buy-in from Hamas and regional states.
State Department spokesperson Eddie Vasquez, however, dismissed this assessment. “Everyone wants to be part of President Trump’s historic Middle East peace effort,” he told Politico.
“From the moment President Trump announced his 20-point plan, there has been an avalanche of ideas … The Trump administration will continue to uphold the ceasefire and effectively implement the plan,” he added.

• Argues certain constitutional commands can’t be altered in a way that destroys their essence
ISLAMABAD: Former chief justice Jawwad S. Khawaja on Tuesday challenged the 27th Amendment, seeking a direction that the Supreme Court (SC) retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness and constitutionality of the proposed amendment.
Filed through Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, the petitioner pleaded before the apex court to strike down or suspend any provisions in any Act of Parliament, including the 27th Amendment, which reduce or abolish any constitutional jurisdiction of the SC or which purport to vest any such jurisdiction in any other court or body.
The petition also requested the apex court to set aside provisions of the 27th Amendment, which relate to transfer of high court judges with a request that until a final decision of this petition and as a matter of urgency.
 
 

The ex-CJ explained that he has filed the petition to save the SC that he claimed was on the verge of being abolished as a constitutional court. By the time of hearing of this petition, the petition argued, the Constitution might have already been amended in a manner that purports to take away SC’s constitutional jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the terms of such amendment, it is the petitioner’s case that the country’s top court must hear this petition immediately, as at the date of filing of this petition, the apex cou­rt exists as a constitutional court.
The petition seeks to enforce the command of the Consti­tution, which stipulates that “the independence of the judiciary shall be fully secured”. The petition contended the question before this court was whether the constitutional jurisdiction of the apex court could be abolished.
The ex-CJ argued that he had “no personal interest” in this case, adding the relief sought was for the benefit of all citizens of Pakistan.
“This petition and any adjudication will have an immediate impact on the fundamental rights of citizens,” he stated, adding that if SC’s constitutional jurisdiction was abolished, the people would be deprived of an independent apex forum to approach for enforcement of fundamental rights.
Cornerstone of Constitution
According to the petitioner, the constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as an independent apex judicial body was a cornerstone of the 1973 Constitution. Any att­empt to abolish, diminish, or subordinate the apex court undermines the very architecture of the constit­utional order and is inconsistent with the will of the people as expressed in the 1973 Con­stitution, he argued.
According to him, the independence and jurisdiction of the SC are constitutional commands and the parliamentarians act as fiduciaries of the people and cannot go against these constitutional commands as set out in the preamble of the Constitution.
 
 

He was of the opinion that even a constitutional ame­ndment could not abr­ogate SC’s constitutional jurisdiction. Therefore, any attempt to abolish or und­e­rmine the SC’s constitutional aut­hor­ity would violate the foundational principles of Constitution and thr­eaten the continuity of the constitutional order itself, he added.
The framers of the Constitution intentionally enshrined SC’s authority in a manner that underscored its independence and centrality to the constitutional system, he said. Its powers and jurisdiction were constitutional imperatives integral to the Con­s­titution, according to the former chief justice.
The petitioner argued that the SC had already recognised that certain constitutional commands set out by the people, including judicial independence, could not be altered in a way that destroyed their essence.

• Police say attacker came from outside Islamabad; bomber’s route traced with help of AI
• TTP claims responsibility; explosive weighed 4kg
• Naqvi vows to punish masterminds; PM, president review situation
ISLAMABAD: A suicide attack outside the judicial complex housing the Islamabad district and sessions courts on Tuesday killed 12 people and injured at least 36, including four women and four policemen. It was the first such attack in the capital in nearly three years.
The blast occurred as Islamabad was hosting several international eve­nts, including the Inter-Parliamentary Spea­kers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a tri-nation cricket series featuring Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe is underway, with a match in Rawalpindi on Tuesday.
Officials said the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had claimed responsibility for the suicide attack.
Police said a lone bomber blew himself up at the main entrance to the complex, located in the G-11 sector, after failing in repeated attempts to enter the premises, where hundreds of litigants and lawyers were present.
A lawyer at the scene, Mohammed Shahzad Butt, told AFP that there was a “massive blast”, adding: “Everyone started running inside out of panic. I have seen at least five dead bodies lying at the front gate.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Rustam Malik, another lawyer, told the news agency that he “heard a loud bang at the gate” as he was entering the complex. “It was complete chaos, lawyers and people were running inside the complex. I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate and several cars were on fire,” he said.
Police officers told Dawn that investigators had reco­v­ered a face, believed to be that of the bomber, from the scene. The remains have been sent to the relevant authorities for reconstruction and identification, for which Nadra’s assistance would be sought.
Multiple teams have started working on the incident. CCTV footage from the Safe City Islamabad Authority and nearby buildings is being examined to trace the bomber’s route to the judicial complex and identify any facilitators or handlers. Footage from bus terminals and checks at nearby hotels are also underway.
Police officials said preliminary investigations suggested that the suicide attacker came from outside Islamabad.
 
 

According to initial findings, the bomber arrived in Islamabad on Friday and travelled from Pir Wadhai to the judicial complex on a motorcycle while wearing a shawl. Investigators have collected about 92 CCTV recordings with the help of artificial intelligence during the initial inquiry.
The explosive used in the attack weighed roughly four to five kilograms and was packed with ball bearings. Officials said the attacker appeared to have acted alone, but verification was underway regarding any handlers or facilitators.
A car and a motorcycle spotted in the footage have been marked as suspicious, and additional evidence is being gathered through camera backtracking.
‘Perpetrators will bear consequences’
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told reporters outside the complex that the suicide blast took place at 12.39pm. He confirmed that 12 people had been killed and 27 were initially injured, later revised to 36.
Providing details of the incident, Mr Naqvi said CCTV footage showed the attacker waiting outside the court building for around 12 minutes. “He first attempted to go inside the court but then targeted the police vehicle after he was unable to do so,” the minister said.
He added that an investigation was underway and identifying the attacker was a top priority. “I assure you we will identify him in the next few hours,” he said. “We are linking this blast today with a lot of things and, in the coming hours or days, we will be very clear about it.”
 
 

“We are not taking this blast as just another one,” he added, noting that its timing and the federal capital being targeted “has a lot of messages”.
“I don’t want to say anything about how Indians do…. like where and what happened half an hour before the blast even occurs,” he said.
“We will go with complete evidence and details. Whoever is involved in this, whether locals or foreigners, we will not spare anyone,” the minister vowed, affirming that the state will not remain quiet on the matter. “We have a clear message that whoever did this will bear the consequences.”
According to Mr Naqvi, CCTV footage showed that the suicide bomber, standing outside the court building, “kept trying to figure out from different angles how to go inside”.
Responding to queries about those behind the blast, he said, “As far as this (Islamabad blast) is concerned, we will let you know as soon as this individual is identified.”
Officials said the bomber looked like Pashtun or Afghan. The minister noted the injured included some police personnel, adding that the driver of the vehicle targeted remained safe. A lawyer was among the casualties, he added.
Asked about any security alerts, the interior minister replied, “There is nothing as such; routine matters are taking place.”
Mr Naqvi noted that various activities were taking place in the capital, including political developments, events involving international guests and sports games. He assured the public that the law enforcement agencies, the army and the Rangers were working together to keep the city secured.
The minister said he had directed the chief commissioner not to allow any vehicles into Islamabad without an e-tag on them after two weeks.
Victims identified
Those who were killed in the incident included Iftikhar Ali, Sajjad Shah, Tariq Khan, Subhan Uddin, Saqlain, Safdar Ali, Shah Mohammad, Zubair Ghuman, Abdullah and Iftikhar Khan. Among the wounded cops were Assistant Sub-Inspector Arshad, Head Constable Mohammad Imran and Constable Imran Javed, while other injured included Nusrat Zafran, Shamsha Khizer, Shumaila and Bushra Bibi.
Security around the Judicial Complex, adjoining courts and other sensitive buildings in Islamabad has been further tightened, police officials told the state-run APP news agency. Similar steps have also been taken at the capital’s entry and exit points.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and key members of his cabinet and ruling coalition met President Asif Ali Zardari at Aiwan-i-Sadr on Tuesday to review the security and political situation in the country following the Islamabad suicide blast.
According to a statement issued by the President House, the meeting condemned the recent acts of terrorism and reaffirmed that operations against “foreign-sponsored terrorists and their facilitators” would continue until the menace was eliminated.

Sources told Dawn the FCC would initially comprise six other judges — four from the Supreme Court and two from the high courts — besides the chief justice. The names being discussed for the inaugural composition incl­ude Just­ice Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Musa­rrat Hilali, Justice Aamer Far­ooq, and Justice Baqar Najafi from the SC, while Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court and Justice Rozi Khan Bar­rech, the incumbent Chief Justice of Balochistan Hi­gh Court, are being considered from the high courts.
Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require approval through an Act of the Parliament.
The sources further disclosed that the President would administer the oath to the Chief Justice of the FCC, while the remaining judges would take oath from the newly-appointed Chief Justice.
Officials at the law ministry confirmed that the President, acting on the advice of the prime minister, would issue the formal appointment orders. They added that under the provisions of the proposed amendment, the President would be constitutionally empowered to make such appointments to the newly-constituted court.
The proposal to establish the Federal Constitutional Court has been revived as part of the judicial reforms package incorporated in the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill.
The amendment aims to rationalise the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and introduce greater efficiency in the adjudication of constitutional questions.
 
 

According to government officials, the creation of the FCC is intended to reduce the Supreme Court’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases, and strengthen the independence and credibility of the judicial system. The concept of a separate constitutional court is not new.
It was first introduced in the Charter of Democracy (CoD) signed by the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in 2006.
The CoD envisaged the establishment of a specialised court dedicated solely to constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus primarily on its appellate jurisdiction.
The idea resurfaced during discussions on the 26th Const­it­utional Amendment, but was shelved at the time following resistance from the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and certain other political factions.
Under the current proposal, judges serving in the FCC will retire at the age of 68 years — three years higher than the retirement age for Supreme Court judges, who retire at 65.
The new court will not be housed within the Supreme Court premises. Officials indicated that it is likely to be established in the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building in Islamabad. In turn, the Federal Shariat Court is expected to be relocated to the third floor of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) building.
However, sources within the Shariat Court revealed that its judges are unhappy with their abrupt relocation and have raised their concerns before the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
Meanwhile, preparations are underway for the oath-taking ceremony of the Chief Justice of the upcoming Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which is likely to be held on November 13 (tomorrow).
The sources said that President Asif Ali Zardari is expected to give his assent to the 27th Amendment Bill by November 12 (today), paving the way for the establishment of the new judicial body.
