The plan, long in the pipeline, was finally formalised when the Sindh-Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) filed a petition with the Thar Coal Energy Board (TCEB) in June, seeking — through a multi-year tariff — an increase in coal price to support the planned expansion of coal extraction capacity from the current 7.6 million tonnes to 11.2m tonnes for power generation as well as use by other industries.
A public-private partnership venture of the Sindh government and a consortium of private firms, SECMC’s petition has requested for a levelised tariff of $37.30 per tonne for the next 30 years. The proposed tariff includes a capacity payment of $19.89 a tonne. This translates into over 53pc of the tariff, which will be $39.42 per tonne (including $21.77 as a capacity charge) for the first 10 years and $28.79 per tonne (carrying the capacity payment of $12.79 per tonne) for the next 20 years.
In July, while chairing a meeting of TCEB held to deliberate on measures to bolster Pakistan’s indigenous coal-based energy sector, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah (who is also chairman of TCEB) said that Thar’s coal power initiatives were already generating over 2,600 MW of electricity at a significantly lower cost of around Rs4.8 per kWh compared to power from imported coal that costs roughly Rs19.5 per kWh. “This has resulted in savings of approximately $1.3 billion in foreign exchange for the country since 2019,” he explained.
The TCEB — an entity for accelerating Thar coal development — had reviewed ongoing projects and unanimously approved several strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing the region’s coal mining and electricity generation capabilities.

Civil society organisations and Thar residents reject SECMS’s coal tariff petition, lamenting the severe damage mining has caused the surrounding region

However, civil society groups have a different view. The petition, they argue, is riddled with legal, procedural, environmental, and financial deficiencies that make its acceptance not just questionable but dangerous. In its comments submitted before the board, the Alliance for Climate Justice and Clean Energy (ACJCE), a coalition of civil society organisations committed to Pakistan’s transition from fossil fuels, rejected the petition for the revision of the Thar coal tariff and expansion of mining.
“It would deepen Pakistan’s already unhealthy reliance on coal, flying in the face of the commitments the country has made under the Paris climate accord,” Abdul Rafay from ACJCE shares. He urged policymakers, regulators, the media, and the public to recognise the grave implications of unchecked coal expansion. “This is not merely an environmental issue to be brushed aside as the cost of development; it is fundamentally a question of economic justice, legal accountability, and public welfare.”
 
 

Local communities have on multiple occasions pointed out that the damage already inflicted on Thar’s fragile water resources by existing mining and coal-fired power generation is undeniable.
“To authorise further expansion is to knowingly accelerate the depletion of water, intensify ecological harm, and condemn local communities to bear disproportionate costs for a model of energy that serves short-term corporate and political interests over long-term national welfare,” laments Leela Ram, a resident of Gorano, one of the worst-affected villages due to coal mining in the region.
Mr Ram is also suspicious of the TCEB for trying to keep the developments related to the tariff petition under wraps. “For one, the local communities were not informed about the public hearing on the tariff petition to deprive them of the opportunity to present their point of view. When we raised the issue with the board, they told us that they had done their job by putting out a message about the hearing in the newspapers. Secondly, the hearing was organised in Karachi to prevent the affected local communities from attending it,” he complains.
Nonetheless, this couldn’t deter him or other villagers from ensuring their presence at the hearing and submitting their views. “It is extremely concerning that the expansion of coal mining in Thar will severely undermine the rights of Thar citizens to a healthy, clean and sustainable environment guaranteed by the constitution. Given that coal mining and coal-based power generation have already damaged Thar’s precarious water resources, any expansion in mining activity will only increase the speed and intensity of this damage,” Mr Ram goes on, referring to various independent studies on the impact of coal extraction and power generation on the environment, livelihoods and health of local communities.
ACJCE points out that the tariff petition fails to include critical documentation such as updated feasibility studies, environmental and social impact assessments, details of engineering and procurement contracts, financing term sheets, and evidence of public consultation.
“The absence of these disclosures not only contravenes transparency, but also renders the petition legally untenable and susceptible to regulatory capture,” the submission from the alliance emphasises.
Similarly, the petition has failed to assess or disclose the broader environmental implications, such as deeper resource extraction, intensified dewatering, increased waste generation, and further land acquisition. “This has resulted in a gross underestimation of environmental, social and economic harms caused by expansion in the coal mine.”
Mr Rafay also questions the legality of diverting Thar coal to industries other than power generation. It argues that the land for the Thar coalfield was acquired for a specific public purpose: to set up mine-to-mouth electricity production plants. “Any change in the coal’s end-use constitutes a material alteration of that public purpose and, therefore, violates the land acquisition law,” he says.
The anguished voices rising from Thar’s villages should serve as a stark reminder that Pakistan’s coal ambitions are exacting an unacceptable human cost. In their submissions, residents of Thario Halepoto, Bitra, Khario Ghulam Shah, Meehari, and other villages reject the tariff petition. Their grievance is simple: decisions that will upend their lives are being taken in boardrooms far from their homes, without their consent, and without acknowledgement of the devastation they already endure.
The villagers are not rejecting “development”. They are asserting something more fundamental: their right to live with dignity, safety and justice. They speak of poisoned water, vanishing lands, dislocated families, and a culture under siege. At the very least, this requires a written and publicly accessible resettlement and compensation policy for all villages affected by existing and future coal mining and coal-based power generation in Thar.

Justice Afridi observed that the conference, initiated in 1970, provided the court with an opportunity to reflect on its performance. He said that after assuming the CJP’s office in October 2024, he felt the need for reforms, which were categorised based on “five principles”.
“We prioritised service delivery through technology, transparency in cases, and legal framework,” the CJP said. Noting that the apex court had eight sections, CJP Afridi said each section prioritised speedy justice.
Highlighting that the six interactive meetings were held to discuss the SC’s reform plan, the top judge said digital case-filing and case-tracking were among the measures raised.
 


“Everyone speaks of technology and artificial intelligence,” Justice Afridi said, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
“Cases will be fixed using artificial intelligence,” he announced. However, he cautioned, the judiciary was “not yet ready” to utilise AI. The usage of AI would be initiated once the digital scanning project is completed, according to the CJP.
Justice Afridi also spoke of a facilitation centre, which will begin its operations on October 1 and will provide “all details” related to cases. Reiterating the need for speedy disposal of cases, he asserted: “We have always worked for the supremacy of the law.”
Emphasising that rules cannot be made within a single day, the judge said suggestions will be presented before a proposals committee, which would then make recommendations.
During his address, the chief justice also said the security provided to him and other judges has been reduced, as well as the protocols in Islamabad’s Red Zone, which houses key government buildings.
“I used to have nine security vehicles with me so, I said that this much security was not needed inside the Red Zone as it has the court and residences,” the top judge recalled, adding that now he only had two security vehicles.
He remarked that judges could need security when going outside of Islamabad, but not as much when in the Red Zone.
 
 

Apparently indirectly responding to one of the questions raised in Justice Mansoor Ali Shah’s recent letter on the CJP having powers to grant or refuse judges’ leaves, Justice Afridi said: “The matter of judges’ leaves is clearly stated in the Supreme Court Rules.
“No judge needs permission [for leave] during judicial holidays, but other than that, it is required to inform [the court] about it.”
Just last month, the SC issued a number of policy decisions taken between Oct 26, 2024 and Aug 12, 2025. One such decision, reflected in a General Standing Order dated July 29, 2025, amended the Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and Privileges) Order 1997, empowering the CJP to grant or refuse leave, whether within or outside Pakistan, or to revoke or curtail leave already granted to judges of the court.
Continuing his speech, Justice Afridi noted that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) had decided on 64 complaints against judges, 72 had been referred to the council’s members, and 65 were pending, which would be considered in the SJC meeting later this month.
Stating that the court was taking up cases on a “first-come, first-served” basis, the top judge clarified that the court would not hear cases out of their order.

Justice Shah, Munib Akhtar, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Athar Minallah and Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shafi Siddiqui were among the fellow SC judges seen attending the event. Judges of the high courts were also present.
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Tahir Nasrullah Warraich, and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Mian Rauf Atta addressed the event.
Separately, CJP Afridi also inaugurated a “Media Station” at the SC, telling mediapersons on the occasion: “You people are necessary for the system because you keep everyone in check. […] Please keep us on check but it should be healthy.”
The chief justice also inaugurated a “Public Facilitation Centre”.

The  High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules-2025 were passed at the recent full court meeting of the IHC by a narrow margin, with six of the 11 judges voting in favour.
Justice  Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar  Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — the five senior judges who opposed the move and demanded certain amendments — would file their dissenting notes.
The newly promulgated rules substantially enhanced the authority of the chief justice, empowering him to nominate any judge to the powerful administration committee, while simultaneously eliminating the inclusion of the senior puisne judge as a de facto member of that body.

Dissenting notes ready to be filed after new rules divide judges

‘Misuse of powers’
A  day before the full court meeting, Justice Babar Sattar and Justice  Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan wrote a letter among their colleagues, expressing  grave concerns that administrative powers were allegedly being misused  to “sideline dissenting judges”. Later, they also objected to the way  the rules were presented at the meeting, complaining that “insufficient  time” had been provided for a proper review.
Also, according to  Justice Ejaz, the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR) were officially gazetted without meaningful debate or approval by the full court. He claimed the voluminous document — spanning more than 600 pages — was circulated only a day and a half before the meeting, thereby reducing consultation to a “mere formality and making substantive input impossible”.
A senior IHC official, however, disputed this claim,  insisting that every judge had been fully on board during the rule-making exercise. He cited an office order, dated June 12, 2019, and issued by then chief justice Athar Minallah, which constituted a committee to draft the rules in line with those of the Lahore High  Court. The committee included additional registrars Ijaz Ahmed and  Salamatullah.
Input of all judges sought
According to the official, the draft rules were duly circulated among all the judges,  months before the meeting was convened, and their input was solicited.  Apart from Justice Sattar, he said, no judge provided any suggestions.
However,  the recommendations submitted by Justice Sattar were rejected by the then chief justice on the grounds that they appeared tantamount to empowering judges with suo motu authority.
One of the dissenting judges, nonetheless, claimed that the version of the rules presented at  the full court meeting was “different from the one previously  circulated”.
Administration committee
Defending the changes, the official maintained that only minor alterations had been made. For instance, Rule 237 now provides that the administration committee, headed by the chief justice, shall ordinarily comprise three judges, though the chief justice may nominate additional members if deemed necessary. Likewise, Rule 239 now stipulates that each member of the administration committee shall serve as an administration judge,  with their powers and responsibilities to be defined by the chief justice from time to time.
Previously, the senior puisne judge automatically served as an administration judge, granting him significant authority over court affairs. Under the revised framework,  however, the chief justice has complete discretion to assign administrative functions, a change that effectively curtails Justice  Kayani’s role.
Justice Sattar and Justice Ejaz reportedly objected to the way case assignments were being structured, alleging that the  process was “manipulated to favour” judges transferred to the IHC along with the chief justice, while sidelining permanent judges who had opposed his transfer.
Special bench
They specifically referred to the formation of a special bench to address the backlog of tax cases. on which both dissenting judges were placed and assigned more than 200 tax references to be heard daily from 9am until the court’s rising.
Their pending cases were reassigned to other judges. The IHC official, on the other hand, rejected the objections, citing the LHC  practice where specialised benches are also assigned to senior judges.
Referring to the ‘Roster of Sitting’ at the LHC’s principal seat, he pointed out that Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh and Justice Javid Iqbal Wains sit on a bench for tax and commercial cases and hear such matters full-time from  Monday through Friday.

The intensity and frequency of floods, torrential rains, cloudbursts, windstorms, heatwaves, and droughts have risen sharply, alongside an ever-increasing risk of crop diseases and pest outbreaks. These recurring natural calamities — most recently the catastrophic super flood of 2025 — have left farmers extremely vulnerable.
Particularly, small farmers — those holding less than 12.5 acres — are in deep misery in flood-affected areas. Out of 11.7 million farms in the country, nearly 97 per cent of farms are smaller than 12.5 acres, as per the 7th Agricultural Census 2024. In other words, the proportion of such vulnerable farmers is extremely high. Their Kharif crops have already been wiped out, leaving them with no fallback option.
Looking ahead, they face two daunting challenges. First, sustaining their families, especially when many have lost stored wheat stocks and, in some cases, livestock as well; and second, securing agricultural inputs for the upcoming Rabi (wheat) crop, whose sowing is just a month and a half away.
The government has no comprehensive plan to cope with floods or safeguard farmers’ livelihoods. Instead, it continues to focus on reactive, firefighting responses rather than proactive adaptation measures. Successive governments in the past have largely relied on announcing discretionary relief programmes for affected farmers. But these ad hoc, ex-post measures are often plagued by corruption, bureaucratic delays, and time-consuming procedures. In a recent TV talk show, Khalid Hussain Batth, Chairman of Kissan Ittehad, disclosed that a large number of farmers have still not received the compensation announced for the 2022 floods.
 
 

Given the growing scale of climate-induced calamities, it has become imperative for the government to shift from a relief-based model to ex-ante risk management mechanisms. This is particularly urgent for floods, which, unlike droughts and heatwaves, have a sudden and devastating impact on vast agricultural lands, often causing long-term soil degradation.

As climate change intensifies and agricultural risks mount each passing year, the case for universal crop insurance has never been more compelling

The 2025 flood has inflicted unprecedented devastation in Punjab. It is largely due to unchecked settlements on riverbeds in rural areas. Across the Sutlej and Ravi rivers, it is common to see agricultural fields, farmers’ private bunds, and even houses and livestock sheds built on raised platforms after filling up land in the riverbeds. These obstructions have narrowed the river’s natural water-carrying capacity, leading to the inundation of vast tracts that were never previously considered at risk. At the same time, such choke points have placed immense pressure on upstream embankments and bunds, resulting in breaches.
Moreover, in several locations, poorly designed highways and river bridges have obstructed the natural flow of floodwaters. For instance, the Baba Farid bridge on the Sutlej river, connecting Pakpattan to Minchanabad, lacks culverts along an eight-kilometre stretch of its approach road. As a result, the river’s decades-old natural waterways, which allow excess water to pass during floods, have been blocked. Similarly, the bridge’s guide banks are too short in length to streamline the river’s flow through the bridge openings. Such design flaws and neglected maintenance of the structures have intensified upstream pressure, leading to widespread destruction.
 
 

Newspapers and TV talk shows are filled with demands from various stakeholders to remove encroachments from riverbeds. However, it is important to note that unlike canals, rivers naturally shift their course over time.
In many instances, they now flow through land privately owned by farmers for generations. Therefore, if the government truly intends to create space for rivers by clearing artificial choke points to avert future devastation — even partially — it will inevitably need to acquire private lands on a large scale under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, or alternatively enforce the Punjab Irrigation, Drainage, and Rivers Act 2023 (section 4).
Equally pressing is the need to strengthen the financial resilience of farmers in flood-prone areas. Unfortunately, the scope of the federal government’s Crop Loan Insurance Scheme has remained narrow and restrictive, which makes them ineffective in many ways. It covers only small- and medium-sized farmers (up to 25 acres) who take agricultural production loans from banks, excluding millions of non-borrowing farmers. Moreover, coverage is limited to major field crops — wheat, rice, cotton, maize, and sugarcane.
As climate change intensifies and agricultural risks mount each passing year, the case for universal crop insurance has never been more compelling. Such a scheme should ensure that all farmers — regardless of landholding size, access to bank loans, or crop type — are automatically covered against flood risk, with a meaningful sum insured that can genuinely protect farmers’ livelihoods. Advances in computer-based modelling now make it possible to mark flood-prone areas precisely, factoring in weather forecasts, topography of the area, and hydrological data.
In conclusion, creating room for rivers and extending crop insurance to all farmers in flood-prone areas are two fundamental measures needed to address the flood challenge, which carries both technical and humanitarian dimensions. Though these steps demand considerable financial resources, the real question is not about funding but whether the government has the political will to make them happen.

Across the capital, from upscale sectors to suburban communities, residents are hosting online Mahafil-i-Milad, streaming live naat sessions, and attending digital Seerat conferences.
Prominent platforms such as Zoom, Facebook Live, YouTube, and WhatsApp have become key tools for organising and participating in these spiritual events.
University students are actively conducting online naat competitions, Seerat quizzes, and live Q&A sessions with scholars — playing a proactive role in combining religious expression with modern technology.
Anam, a media student at International Islamic University Islamabad, said social media gave people the chance to make religious content more accessible, especially to younger audience.
Many mosques in Islamabad are also adapting the trend.
Some have launched daily live sessions covering Seeratun Nabi, while others have set up online donation channels to fund charitable activities during Rabiul Awwal.
Renowned Islamic scholars have taken to YouTube and Facebook to deliver special lectures, reaching thousands of viewers in real time.
Sadaf Sajid, a Qaria from Sector G-10, said Digital Milad is not a substitute but an extension of devotion.
“It allows people from different cities, even countries, to come together and celebrate the blessed month,” she said.
Joint online gatherings, where families from different cities and countries participate in collective recitations and prayers, are becoming increasingly popular.
Shireen, a resident of F-8, said her son was studying in the UK, and this was the second year they have included him in their family Milad via video call.
While physical celebrations — such as illuminating homes, distributing sweets, and attending mosque events — continue as per tradition, the rise of Digital Milad points to an evolving pattern of religious observance in Pakistan’s urban centres.

The cabinet was told this during its meeting held with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair, said the chief minister’s aide on information and public relations, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif. He said that the meeting was also attended by cabinet members, chief secretary, additional chief secretaries, senior member board of revenue, administrative secretaries and KP advocate general.
According to Mr Saif, the cabinet also approved raising minimum wage from Rs36,000 per month to Rs40,000 per month for adult, unskilled, juvenile and adolescent workers besides approved enhancing share of net hydel profit (NHP) for developmental activities in districts hosting dams, from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.
Mr Saif in a press release that during the meeting, a cabinet committee was formed to finalise Terms of Reference (TORs) for distribution and utilisation of NHP funds, reflecting the province’s increased share following successful deliberations with the federal government.

Cabinet expresses satisfaction over wheat stocks

The cabinet sanctioned Rs1,247.500 million for Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to provide food and non-food support to voluntarily displaced families owing to targeted operations against terrorists in certain villages of Bajaur district.
“The chief minister issued directions that the funds should be released without delay. He stressed that government bears full responsibility of care of displaced people, whether in camps or with host families,” Mr Saif quoted the chief minister as saying during the meeting.
He said that the cabinet approved a wide-range of initiatives covering rehabilitation and welfare, public health services, law and order, archaeology and tourism, forestation and amendments in various Acts and rules.
“A major development was the approval of provincial government’s communication strategy in line with changing dynamics of media and field of public relations in the province,” he said.
Mr Saif said that the cabinet approved reconstruction of Malak Saad Shaheed Police Lines, construction of residential hostels for police personnel at police stations of Daudzai and West Cantonment, and establishment of five new police stations and eight police posts in Peshawar district under a non-ADP scheme worth Rs3,625 million.
He said that four-kanal land was allocated for a new police station in Akbarpura, Nowshera. He said that the cabinet also approved declaring the newly-constructed sub-jail in Swabi as district jail and shifting 165 posts to operationalise its newly-built section, enabling transfer of prisoners from the old facility.
He said that the cabinet approved enhanced cost for upgradation of rural health centre in Oghi to Category-D Hospital, the fund flow mechanism for outsourced health facilities and a grant of Rs10 million for Rukhsana Mother and Childcare Trust Hospital. He added that Rs9.5 million was approved for celebration of the festivals of Kalash and Baha’i communities.
Mr Saif said that the cabinet approved procurement of 50 additional buses for BRT Peshawar. He said that the cabinet approved establishment of the country’s largest safari park in Nowshera by transferring 560 acres of land to wildlife department.
He said that 14,718 acres of barren land in Bund Piru, Tank, was transferred to forest department for its conversion into forest in the first phase and wildlife in the second phase. He added that the cabinet also approved transfer of the historic portion of Chashma Rest House in Dera Ismail Khan from irrigation department to archaeology department for preservation and opening it as an archaeological site.
The meeting sanctioned establishment of ‘KP arts and crafts display centre’ at Small Industries Development Board Plaza in Islamabad. Legislative approvals include KP Healthcare Commission Rules of Registration and Licensing, 2024, amendments in Rule 04, Sub Rule (II) of KP Commission on the Status of Women Rules, 2017, and KP Stamp (Amendment) Act, 1899.
Additional approvals include handing over a government-owned building for establishment of a Nadra office in Dera Ismail Khan on a rental basis, sanctioning MBS-II remuneration for provincial ombudsman under KP Ombudsman Act, 2010, and Rs6 million for kidney transplant of a patient belonging to Dera Ismail Khan.

Camo-clad soldiers seemed omnipresent as the Indonesian Military (TNI) began deploying its troops, at least in Jakarta. Dozens of armed troops on dirt bikes and in vehicles were seen passing major streets in Central Jakarta to the cheers of bystanders.
In comparison the police, which have been the target of public outrage due to their heavy-handed responses to the demonstrations, were nearly absent. Jayakarta Mil­itary Command (Kodam Jaya) commander Maj Gen Deddy Suryadi said the large-scale patrols aimed to ensure public safety in the wake of the series of demonstrations that had turned violent.
The Army meanwhile confirmed that the patrols were not limited to Jakarta, but were also deployed in major cities nationwide. The military has dismissed fears that the mobilisation of troops might lead to a state of emergency, when martial law can be declared to allow the TNI to take necessary measures to restore security and order, including seizing private assets and stifling civil liberties.
Deputy TNI chief Gen Tandyo Budi Revita reaffirmed the military’s allegiance to the Constitution, brushing off speculation that the option of martial law was on the table.

Many people believe that the current domestic security response to the ongoing protests isn’t what they fought for as they still remember the sight of troops in camouflage on Jakarta’s streets almost three decades ago

The wave of demonstrations that erupted last week descended into rioting and looting in some areas. Angry mobs broke into and ransacked the homes of several government officials over the weekend, while an unidentified group attempted to attack an upmarket residential complex in Bekasi, West Java, where many ethnic Chinese reside.
These violent actions signaled an escalation to a level of crisis that the National Police were not equipped to handle. Just a little over two months since the 27th anniversary of the May 1998 tragedy, we have been struck by déjà vu. Notwithstanding the TNI’s brushing aside a martial law scenario, the mass deployment of soldiers in our cities is a reality. The law allows for domestic deployment of the military to support the police’s public order operations.
One high-ranking official said no less than 76,000 troops were guarding Jakarta, which is likely why President Prabowo Subianto could take off to Beijing for his China visit after canceling the trip on Saturday. There is no official data on the number of Kodam Jaya troops on the ground across Greater Jakarta, but according to its former commander in 2020, the provincial command had around 15,000 soldiers ready to support flood mitigation efforts in the capital.
 
 

The chatter about potential martial law has emerged, especially on social media, as a reaction to escalating tensions due to mass demonstrations in cities across country, parti­cularly where mobs have vandalized public facilities and targeted government buildings, including those housing regional legislative councils. The arson attack on the Makassar Legislative Council on Aug 29 claimed three lives.
A potential declaration of martial law as a means to restore public order only indicates authorities’ collective failure to identify and resolve the root cause of the protests. People have take to the streets to vent their disappointment, if not anger, with officials’ poor performance and behavior, especially of those elected to represent their interests and aspirations in government.
The people’s struggle to make ends meet contrasts sharply with the privileges their representatives enjoy, such as a monthly housing allowance around 10 times the minimum wage.
This yawning gap, combined with some officials’ arrogance and lack of empathy and the police’s use of excessive force, has fueled the unrest.

Police sources told Dawn that the transperson, who made a living by dancing at wedding functions, was at her home in Allama Iqbal Town, Maroot, on Sept 9 when two young men, residents of Chak 314-HR, reached there to invite her to dance at a wedding function.
Meanwhile, one youth forcibly raped the transgender person while the other kept watch. When people reached the spot after hearing the transperson’s screams, the duo took the victim’s wallet containing cash and documents and her mobile phone and fled.
A police spokesperson said the suspects had been arrested.
FRATRICIDE: A youth, along with his two cousins, was booked for shooting his elder brother to death over a domestic issue at Chishtian on Sunday.
The FIR registered with Saddar police stated that Ali Waqas, a resident of village Mari Shoq Shah, along with his cousins, Imtiaz and Qasim, argued with his elder brother, Zaffar Iqbal, over some domestic matter.
On Sept 6, Imtiaz and Qasim once again started arguing with Zafar. Meanwhile, Ali Waqas shot his brother with a rifle, killing him on the spot. Police said the main suspect had been arrested.

Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former National Party senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.

Traders, transporters, and businesses pledge support to opposition alliance

Leaders of six opposition parties — Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aain-i-Pakistan, Awami National Party (ANP), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and National Party — strongly condemned the tragic incident in a meeting and announced a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike throughout the province.
They declared that during the strike highways, intercity roads, and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked. Other airports in the province would also be shut, with no air travel allowed.
 
 

Opposition leaders and their supporters also distributed pamphlets about the strike among traders, business centres, hotels, and the general public. They urged the business community and transporters to support the strike.
Trader organisations and transporters had already expressed their support for the strike call. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, also announced closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing.
Though the government has not announced the closure of its educational institutions today, the Private Schools Association declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.

The 22-year-old Alcaraz won 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to capture his second US Open crown and sixth Grand Slam title, avenging his lone defeat in a major final by Sinner at Wimbledon in July.
“It’s a great feeling. I’m working really hard just to lift this trophy. It’s my second one but it’s still a dream come true,” said Alcaraz.
Alcaraz will reclaim the world number one ranking from Sinner, returning to top spot on Monday for the first time since September 2023 after ending the Italian’s 27-match winning run at hard-court Grand Slams.
 


“It was one of the first goals that I had, to recover the number one (ranking),” said Alcaraz, who also defeated Sinner in an epic French Open final in June.
Alcaraz has now won seven of the past eight meetings and is 10-5 overall against Sinner.
“I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more,” said Sinner. “I felt like he was doing everything slightly better today.
“He raised his level when he had to … He played better than me today.”
Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the last eight Grand Slams on offer, winning four apiece to assert their superiority over the rest of the sport, including Novak Djokovic.
But while Sinner is 109-4 against the rest of the tour over the past two seasons, Alcaraz has had his number.
“It’s going to be on me if I want to make changes or not,” said Sinner. “That’s what I have to do, trying to become a better tennis player.”
 


Sinner’s defeat at Flushing Meadows extends the longest drought without a successful men’s title defence of any Grand Slam in the Open era.
No man has retained the US Open crown since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004 to 2008.
Anticipation for the third straight Grand Slam final between the game’s top two players assumed an even greater dimension with the presence of Trump.
It was the latest in a series of visits to major sporting events for the US leader after his trip to the NFL’s Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.
 


He appeared before the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, waving to the crowd, which greeted him with a mix of cheers and boos. He was given a frostier reception later in the match though, when shown again on the stadium’s big screens.
A constellation of showbiz and sports icons turned out as well on Sunday, with rock star Bruce Springsteen, fashion icon Tommy Hilfiger, actor Michael Douglas and basketball superstar Stephen Curry all on hand.
 






Start delayed by Trump visit
The start of the final was pushed back 30 minutes to allow fans additional time to enter Arthur Ashe Stadium as a result of tighter security measures in effect due to Trump’s attendance.
Even then, the 23,000-capacity venue was no more than three-quarters full when Alcaraz broke Sinner in the opening game of the match.
As he did in the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz pinned Sinner on the back foot early and broke a second time for a 5-2 lead before serving out to love.
With hundreds of spectators still waiting to get in at the start of the second set, Alcaraz sought to hammer home his advantage against Sinner.
He created a break point but Sinner hung on and stalled Alcaraz’s momentum, belatedly ramping up his game and surging 3-1 ahead as the Spaniard suffered a brief dip on serve.

Sinner levelled the contest at a set apiece but Alcaraz stormed back with another break early in the third, wriggling out of a tight spot on serve with the help of a sensational baseline smash that sliced away from his rival for a 3-0 edge.
He padded his lead with another break and quickly wrapped up the set, keeping his foot down to corner Sinner again to begin the fourth set.
This time Sinner saved two break points but Alcaraz made another charge in the fifth game, delivering the decisive blow for an advantage he never relinquished as the Spaniard became only the fourth man to win multiple majors on hard courts, grass and clay.</p><small>2025-09-08 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/080803035703fb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940394/pakistan-to-have-cancer-registry-national-institutes-of-health-bill-signed' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to have cancer registry; National Institutes of Health bill signed</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a bid to reform the health sector, President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday appro­ved the National Institutes of Health (Reorganisation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to reorganise the institution and also set up a cancer database.
The president also approved the Anti-Dumping Duties Amend­ment Bill 2025 for legal clarity regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on projects funded by Chinese grants.
The National Assembly passed the NIH bill on August 12, 2025. “There is a dire need for establishing the national cancer registry to understand the actual burden of disease, and to implement a nati­onal action plan for cancer prevention, and management strategies to control the growing epidemic,” according to the bill.
“Through this bill, the structure and governance of the National Institute of Health will be made more effective. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the reorganisation of the institution and enhance its performance,” the President Secretariat’s press wing said in a press release. It said that the approval of the bill marked a significant step toward reforms in the health sector and institutional improvement.
The NIH bill said that the centre “shall assure the registration of cancer patients in central repository” to understand the actual burden of disease and to implement a national action plan for its prevention.
It also envisaged management strategies to control the growing epidemic, collect data on the cancer cases and establish a database of the cancer pat­ients.
Through this bill, the government also aimed to encourage awareness at the village and union council level and to work with other governmental and non-governmental agencies whose goal was the eradication of cancer.
It said the center would register the cancer cases under the ‘confirmed cancer cases’, ‘deaths due to cancer’, ‘recoveries from cancer’, ‘hospitalised pendency of cancer’, and cancer demographic information (age, gender, location).
 
 

As per the bill, the personal particulars of a cancer patient would not be disclosed to any unauthorised person without the prior written consent of the patient.
The bill said the cancer cases were rising globally at a remarkable rate. According to the Global Cancer Observatory, the total number of cases in Pakistan was 178,388 in 2020; and these figures were provided by the Punjab Cancer Registry, which represented the population of Lahore and some parts of central Punjab.
“Considering the overall 220 million population, these figures are severe underestimation of the true cancer burden in Pakistan,” the bill added. It said that several atte­mpts at establishing a national cancer registry in the country had failed in the past due to resource limitations.
Anti-dumping duties bill
President Asif Ali Zardari has approved the Anti-Dumping Duties Amendment Bill 2025. “Following his approval, the duties will be effective from July 1, 2020. The bill was sent to the President after (it was) adopted by the National Assembly and (the) Senate,” the President Secretariat’s media wing said.
 
 

It said that the bill was approved to provide legal clarity regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on projects, funded by China.
The decision for this amendment was made during the progress review meeting of the Gwadar projects in October 2022.

While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
“Thunderstorm and rains are expected tomorrow [Monday] in Karachi with possibility of heavy falls,” said PMD’s focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham.
An advisory issued by the PMD stated that a depression over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Guajrat has intensified further into a deep depression. “It is very likely to move westward and entered in southeastern Sindh during the next 24 hours causing widespread rains with strong winds.”
During the day, Karachi experienced overcast and humid conditions, with dense cloud cover persisting throughout. Light rain was also reported in the outskirts of the city.
The maximum temperature in the city was 32.6 degrees Celsius with 75 per cent humidity, increasing the discomfort for residents even before the anticipated downpour.
The Met office has warned that thundershowers with strong gusty winds and scattered “heavy to very heavy falls” are likely in Karachi Division, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Dadu, and Mirpurkhas until September 10.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has called on all institutions to remain fully prepared in view of the heavy rains in Sindh.
He directed provincial, district and municipal authorities to stay on high alert and ensure advance arrangements. He also emphasised the need for close monitoring of water levels in Hub Dam and other reservoirs to safeguard communities.

His livestock grazing at a distance inside the main dyke of the river was his only concern. The main dyke that covers a certain mileage of Hyderabad and Matiari districts is located downstream of Sukkur and the area here provides ample land for crops as well as grazing grounds for cattle. “Pani aaye ga tu dekhey gey (We will worry once the floodwater arrives),” Zubair said smilingly when asked if he had an idea about when floodwaters from the Sukkur barrage would reach the katcha area. He looked somewhat uninterested in talking about the anticipated flood, unlike other members from his community.
At a distance, a separate group of Hajjano men were sitting underneath an acacia tree before returning to their village located across Ghalyan Bund — a 13-mile-long dyke starting from Matiari to the Jamshoro front bund. Acacia trees are a common sight in Sindh’s katcha area on both sides of the river within its two dykes, whose construction began by the British when they started building Sukkur in 1930s.
Unlike Zubair, Sajjad and Zaheer were a bit more cautious, whom I met about 1km beyond the main dyke. Amid all the hullabaloo about super floods, they were making their own assessments about the incoming deluge daily. Their quest to predict the floods was guided by indigenous knowledge.

Unruffled Indus riverine area dwellers rely on indigenous methods to prepare for deluge

“Water gradually rises on a daily basis when floodwaters enter the area,” Sajjad explained. He pointed towards a manmade bank of a drain, called Chandhan, that brings effluent from Matiari located on the left bank of the Indus downstream of Sukkur. The drain’s outfall is inside the riverine area, touching the Ghalyan Bund in the Hyderabad district.
“When flows increased last month, the water had touched this drain’s bund…before it receded, leaving its mark behind,” he recalled, alluding to a brief high flood of 510,798 cusecs in Guddu downstream on Aug 24’s afternoon. The barrage attained a medium flood level of 477,864 cusecs at 6pm the same day.
“I check a certain stone or a piece of wood to see whether it is soaked or drowned. If the surface shows some dried surface, then it means the levels are still lower than expected. The next morning, I repeat the exercise again…” a complacent Zaheer added.
“For our communities, different landmarks serve as determinants of floods’ arrival,” said Chakar Chalgari, an irrigation department employee. Ahmed Ali Chalgari, another resident, agrees with him. “The month of August is a harbinger of floods for us. We do maintain benchmarks inside the area. For instance, I will keep checking some plants like devi — wild vegetation — in the area to have an idea of increasing river flows”.
The Hajjano community lives in the Bodhani village across Ghalyan Bund, feeding off the riverine land. Many of them own small pieces of land for agricultural purposes, while others work as peasants managing the lands of influential landlords. These large tracts of land are, by and large, owned by those having political connections or government backing, and they either have direct land ownership or have occupied massive forestlands. Successive orders by the Sindh High Court a couple of years back led to the retrieval of encroached forest land and entry in revenue record.
Katcha economy
The katcha area — infamous for its bandits — is actually the region’s breadbasket due to its rich soil. Various streams flow from the Indus to water these farmlands, with several protected by private embankments. Landowners build these private bunds, called zamindari bund, around their lands to protect them against floods, but if the Indus has very high or super floods, like in 2010, these are washed away.\
 
 

The riverine area contributes to the country’s food security to a great degree, producing grain and other crops. Kharif crops, like cotton, and winter crops like wheat, pulses, gram and vegetables, are grown here besides the large-scale sugarcane cultivation. A previous visit in 2021 revealed a mindboggling scale of cane cultivation inside the katcha area.
A Board of Revenue document showed that Sindh’s katcha land and river island spanned an area of 977,527 acres (3,697 square kms); 3pc of Sindh’s total land i.e. 34,820,640 acres (140,914 sq kms).
Katcha dwellers pay 50pc of dhal (revenue charges) when compared with their settled area farmers. Abiyana (water charges) are not recoverable from them, as they are not dependent on regular irrigation supplies.
“Output from the katcha area is part of the overall production of grain and other crops in Sindh,” informed Agriculture Extension DG Munir Jumani. He said the recent flooding downstream of Guddu and Sukkur, however, damaged sugarcane, cotton and vegetables.
For the locals, if inundation becomes evident, then they move out with their livestock and wait for the water to recede.
In the 2010 floods, water flows had hit this dyke. In July of that year, officials had not expected floodwaters would inundate gauges — usually installed along every river dyke to record historic flows — at the Ghalyan dyke. This super flood still haunts the dwellers.
Wahid Magsi, who actually hails from Jhalg Magsi, said it was water everywhere, forcing them to settle atop this embankment. These floods proved to be the most destructive for Sindh, displacing millions and washing away hundreds of cattle heads.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Hum­a­n­itarian Affairs reports that during the current monsoon season, 785 lives have been lost; the number is increasing with each passing day. July 2025 saw 82 per cent more rain than July 2024, reports the Pakistan Meteorological Department. In Punjab alone, two million people have felt the season’s impact; and visuals from KP and Sindh are grim to say the least.
Sadly, it will only get worse as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects 26pc faster warming rates till 2050. This means more frequent heatwaves, erratic weather, glacial lake outburst floods and riverine and pluvial floods.
 
 

Pakistan’s challenges are multifold; they include an aging infrastructure, fragmented institutions working in silos, and under-resourced local governments, to name a few. Most urban areas have non-existent storm-water management, often piggybacking on decaying sewerage systems, and leading to compounded fiascos. For the urban poor living in informal settlements on city margins, the situation is even more dire — when downtowns catch a cold, slums catch fever. Every year, the monsoon triggers disasters that result in life-threatening conditions for the less-privileged urbanites in particular.
As a developing country with limited resources, Pakistan must make smart choices to address the aforementioned ills while improving public service delivery too. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can learn from global best practices, leading to customised solutions for our local challenges. Globally, there are two approaches when it comes to dealing with storm-water: get rid of it as soon as possible or treat it as an asset instead of viewing it as a threat. The latter approach is reckoned as more progressive, and cities adopting it are referred to as ‘sponge cities’. A sponge city essentially acts like a sponge: it absorbs water and can release it whenever needed. This property can resolve a problem faced by our cities: deluges and droughts throughout the year.
Sponge cities are based on blue-green infras­t­r­u­c­ture (BGI), comprising a specially designed network of water bodies and green spaces such as urb­an parks, wetlands, bioswales and water plazas.

The BGI model presents Pakistani urban centres with an opportunity to enhance livability.

BGI, unlike single-purpose grey infrastructure (storm-water drains), is multifunctional and provides ecosystem services through urban nature. This climate infrastructure is not buried underground and provides flood mitigation, storm-water management, urban heat island impact reduction, recreational opportunities as well as enhanced biodiversity.
We present Copenhagen’s example and how the city’s climate adaptation model can help Pakistani cities be climate-proofed for the future. Cop­enhagen has made great strides towards climate resilience using BGI over the last decade or so. The city was jolted by a cloudburst event in 2011, sending shockwaves and losing more than $1 billion in damages. Consequently, the city came up with its pioneer Cloudburst Management Plan, 2012.
The plan serves as a blueprint for the city’s climate adaptation and envisages urban nature as its fundamental pivot. The plan provides a robust system consisting of BGI to manage storm-water on the ground in addition to four underground tunnels. The city found out that its limited sewer capacity led to combined sewer outflows during intense downpours.
The Cloudburst Plan responded to this challenge through a unique idea. Relying on hydraulic modelling, experts divided the city into seven catchment areas based on where it would rain and where the city would want its rainwater to go. The surface system comprises more than 350 projects spr­­­ead over seven catchments. Further, each cat­chment area is divided into cloudburst branches comprising various BGI projects in diffe­rent neighbourhoods. These projects are meant to stop storm-water from entering the sewers as the city expects 30pc more than usual rain in the future.
A Copenhagen climate neighbourhood (building block of the system) comprises streets, courty­ards and parks acting as BGI. With a focus on the water in the neighbourhood, these urban spaces are all connected and have a dual function. The system ensures that rain falling in the neighbourh­o­od can flow through the BGI projects. The water, which cannot infiltrate, has an outlet to the next system. Therefore, the idea is not just to drain water quickly, but to slow it down, store it and use it, turning excess water into an urban asset. These functions to retain, detain and convey storm-water are performed by various cloudburst typologies. For example, parks and plazas are designed to ret­ain storm-water from surrounding rooftops. Green roads delay storm-water conveyance and clo­­­udb­urst boulevards ensure its speedy transportation.
 
 

Instead of relying solely on conventional drainage systems, the plan reimagines Copenhagen’s streets, parks and public spaces as dynamic tools for managing storm-water, reducing flood risks, and enhancing urban livability. These BGI projects in Copenhagen are expected to be completed over 30 years, aligning with the city’s broader urban development agenda.
The model presents Pakistani urban centres with an opportunity to enhance urban livability while managing storm-water and urban flooding effectively. It would create synergies amongst government agencies, break management silos as well as provide a systemic approach for cost-effective and integrated sustainable development. Every city with a peculiar water cycle, topography and public participation must chalk out its own unique plan to climate-proof itself through a multifunctional climate infrastructure. This is a crucial moment for Pakistan to propose pragmatic climate-adaptation projects for climate justice funding worldwide. The time to act was yesterday; let’s at least start today. n

The force said 857 people had been arrested under anti-terror laws for supporting a proscribed group during Saturday’s demonstration, with an additional 33 arrested for other offences including assaults on police officers.
“We have a duty to enforce the law without fear or favour. If you advertise that you are intending to commit a crime, we have no option but to respond accordingly,” Deputy Assis­tant Commissioner Claire Smart said in a statement.
The government in July proscribed Palestine Action under the UK’s Terrorism Act, 2000, following several acts of vandalism, including against two planes at a Royal Air Force base, which caused an estimated 7 million pounds in damage.
Critics, including the United Nations, have condemned the ban as legal overreach and a threat to free speech, but ministers insist that people are still able to attend pro-Palestinian marches.
“The contrast between this demonstration and the other protests we policed yesterday, including the Palestine Coalition march attended by around 20,000 people, was stark,” Mr Sm­art added. “You can expr­ess your support for a cause without committing an offence under the Ter­rorism Act or descending into violence and disorder, and many thousands of people do that in London every week.”
An estimated 1,500 took part in the Palestine Action protest outside parliament, with the Met condemning the “intolerable” abuse it claims its officers suffered. Of the 33 people arrested for non-terror offences, 17 were for assaults on police officers, the force said.
The organisers of the protest, the campaign group Defend Our Juries, said the “Lift the Ban” rally had been “the picture of peaceful protest.” Many of those detained for showing support for Palestine Action appeared to be older people.
Most face six months in prison if convicted, but orga­nisers of the rallies could be sentenced to up to 14 years if found guilty.

This has been driven largely by President Donald Trump’s disruptive policies, which have upended global trade by a tariff war and also reordered Washington’s geopolitical priorities. The US president’s aggressive trade policy applied against both allies and adversaries has encouraged them to seek closer ties with each other even as they pursue negotiations with Washington to secure lower levies.
Trump’s coercive approach has pushed China and Russia even closer together. His trade assault on India and imposition of penalties over Indian import of Russian oil has undermined strategic ties built over decades with New Delhi. This has urged India to reach out to China and deepened the thaw in their relations. It is also the principal reason why Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to undertake his first visit to China in seven years to attend the SCO summit.
These developments shaped the environment for the high-profile SCO summit. This was its biggest gathering so far since the Eurasian organisation’s inception in 2001. It was attended by leaders of 10 member states and another 16 observer or dialogue partner countries as well as heads of 10 international organisations. A regional security and economic grouping, SCO represents over 40 per cent of the world’s population and accounts for a quarter of the global economy.
 
 

The summit marked an opportunity for President Xi Jinping to set out an alternative vision for the global order that places emphasis on cooperation in contrast to the confrontation represented by Trump’s policies.
In a volatile international landscape created by Trump’s actions, China offered stability and more responsible and reliable global leadership. It also offered to be a strong voice for the Global South.

The summit convened in the backdrop of Trump’s disruptive actions that accelerated geopolitical trends.

The summit was important for its symbolism, messages to the world, especially the US, display of Global South solidarity and for bilateral meetings on the sidelines aimed at strengthening regional relationships or as some said, “redrawing the geopolitical map”. President Xi’s speech called for a fairer, more equitable international system. He reiterated China’s support for multilateralism, stressing the need to strengthen it and accord the UN a key role. Taking aim at the US, without naming it, he rejected “bullying behaviour” by certain countries and decried the “Cold War” mentality that “continues to haunt the world”. He also called for “a clear stand aga­inst hegemonism” and to oppose “u­n­­­­i­­lateralism”.
Declaring the global governance system was at a crossroads, he announced a ‘Global Governance Initiative’ predicated on international law and equal participation of all states with a greater voice for developing countries. More significantly, President Xi received support from member states to establish a new SCO development bank and pledged two billion RMB in grants and 10bn in loans for SCO members. This marks the first time the organisation’s economic role has been backed by development finance funds and reflects China’s increasing weight in the global finance system.
The Tianjin declaration issued at the summit called for the “creation of a more just multipolar world order”. In implicit criticism of the US, it said member states opposed “confrontational approaches to resolving international issues”. It rejected “unilateral coercive measures”, including economic ones and vowed to boost trade within the organisation — again a veiled reference to Trump’s tariff actions. The joint communiqué “strongly condemned the military strikes by Israel and the US against Iran in June 2025”, calling them “a gross violation of the UN Charter and international law”. It expressed concern at the continuing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza. It called for an immediate ceasefire and a just settlement of the Palestinian issue. Conspicuous by its absence was any mention of the Ukraine war.
A significant part of the lengthy declaration was devoted to affirming the collective commitment to fight terrorism. In a display of even-handedness, it condemned both the Pahalgam incident and the terrorist attack on the Jaffer Express without mentioning where these took place. This language obviously had both Pakistan and India’s approval.
The bilateral meeting ahead of the summit between President Xi and Prime Minister Modi — the second this year — received much international attention. Positive statements by both sides after the meeting reflected the warming in their relations that had gone into deep freeze in 2020. India had previously made normalisation conditional on settlement of the border dispute while the Chinese insisted the bilateral relationship should not be limited to the border issue. The Indians seemed to have now come around to the Chinese view.
The Sino-India thaw had in any case begun earlier especially with the border management agreement reached in August. The meeting between the two leaders in Tianjin was seen as helping to further normalise the relationship. How far this is tactical, reflecting Modi’s reaction to Trump’s humiliating conduct towards India, or a shift that could gather momentum, remains an open question. It would be a mistake to read too much into the Sino-Indian re-engagement because they have more divergent interests than convergences.
 
 

Interestingly the Indian opposition cautioned the Modi government against adopting a “knee-jerk foreign policy” because of the current hostile US stance towards India.
The other bilateral meeting that attracted attention was between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Russian President Vladimir Putin. This underlined the desire of both countries to improve relations and expand trade. It also signalled Pakistan’s intent to chart an independent course in its foreign policy. Sharif held important meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang. Both countries committed to further solidify their strategic partnership, usher in the next phase of CPEC and upgrade the Free Trade Agreement. They also approved an Action Plan for 2025-2029 and signed over a dozen MoUs. This indicated that for all the recent warming in Pakistan-US ties, China remained Pakistan’s overriding strategic priority.
The Tianjin summit reflected the geopolitical shifts underway in a world marked by growing multipolarity and in which Trumpian policies are accelerating some of these shifts. Of these, efforts by non-Western powers to shape the new world order may turn out to be the most consequential.

At least 46 people have been killed in strikes on a school, tents and houses across Gaza on Sunday, while a drone launched from Yemen hit an airport in southern Israel forcing suspension of flights for some hours.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the army was “deepening” its assault in and around Gaza City, as it seeks to step up pressure on the Palestinian group Hamas.
Israeli air strikes have flattened two high-rises in Gaza City as troops intensified their operations in the area, aiming to conquer the Palestinian territory’s largest urban centre. “We are deepening the manoeuvre on the outskirts of Gaza City and within Gaza City itself,” Netanyahu told ministers at the start of a cabinet meeting, according to a video shared by his office.

Netanyahu says army ‘deepening’ assault on Gaza City

“We are destroying terrorist infrastructure, we are demolishing identified terror towers,” Netanyahu said.
Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 64,368 people and wounded 162,776 others since October 2023.
The Israeli military has claimed that the two high-rises flattened in the latest strikes were used by Hamas to “monitor” Israeli troops — an accusation denied by the Palestinian group.
The escalation has fuelled fears of a further deterioration in already dire humanitarian conditions for Palestinians living in the area.
Netanyahu said that Israel had “established another humanitarian zone to allow the civilian population in Gaza to move to a safe area”.
Netanyahu said around 100,000 residents had already left Gaza City, accusing Hamas of trying to prevent evacuations and of using civilians as “human shields”.
Mustafa Al-Jamal, who lives in Gaza city, told AFP that he did not plan to leave. He said the area in southern Gaza residents were told to evacuate to has been repeatedly bombed despite being declared “a safe zone”.
“Where can we go? We have no money, no tent, no house, no food.”
Meanwhile, families and supporters of Israeli prisoners take to the streets, demanding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sign a deal to secure the release of their loved ones instead of prolonging the war. Israeli protesters took to the streets to call on their government to reverse the decision to conquer Gaza City, fearing for the fate of prisoners believed to be held there.
“I am mortified by the fact that the Israeli army is conquering Gaza right now,” said Edith, a protester in Jerusalem who declined to give her full name.
Ramon airport hit
Earlier, Israel’s Airports Authority said that a drone launched from Yemen struck the arrivals hall at Ramon Airport near the Red Sea city of Eilat. It said takeoffs and landings at the airport were halted. Hours later, normal operations were restored.
The Israeli military said it was investigating the crash of a drone that was launched from Yemen and fell in the airport’s area. The military said the incident was under review without providing details on the impact.
The airport located near the resort city of Eilat on the border with Jordan and Egypt mostly handles domestic flights.
Israel’s military said it intercepted on Sunday three drones launched from Yemen, whose Houthi rebels have vowed to avenge the killing of their prime minister in an Israeli air strike last month.
“A short while ago, the IAF (Israeli air force) intercepted three UAVs that made their way from Yemen,” the military said in a statement, adding two were downed before entering Israeli airspace. It did not specify what happened to the third.
Israel assassinated the head of the Houthi government together with 11 other senior officials in air strikes two weeks ago. In retaliation, the Yemeni group launched eight ballistic missiles and seven UAVs at Israel, all of which were intercepted or fell on the way, according to Israeli media reports.

“Following the interior minister’s directives, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency has constituted a special inves­tigation team to probe into the matter and submit its report within 14 days,” says an official press rel­ease issued by the Interior Ministry here on Sunday.
It said the team will thoroughly examine the circumstances and those involved in the data leakage will be identified and brought to justice through legal action.
Media reports say that data of all SIM holders, including Interior Minister Naqvi, was sold at Google.
They further said that information regarding mobile location was being sold for Rs500, mobile data record for Rs2,000 and details of foreign trips for Rs5,000.
A couple of months ago, the National Cyber Emer­gency Response Team of Pakistan (PKCERT) iss­ued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan have been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures. Media reports said PKCERT had identified the global breach involving a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing more than 184 million unique account credentials.
“The breach exposed user names, passwords, emails and associated URLs tied to major social media services, as well as government portals, banking institutions, and healthcare platforms worldwide,” the reports said quoting the PKCERT’s advisory.
“The leaked database is believed to have been compiled using infostealer malware — malicious software that extracts sensitive information from compromised systems,” it added.  “This data was stored in plain text and left completely unprotected, without encryption or password safeguarding.”
PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
It outlined the potential impacts of the data breach, warning that the stolen credentials could be used for account takeovers, identity theft and unauthorised access to government portals or other sensitive sites.
The advisory highlighted that the publicly hosted database was storing credentials stolen from “infected endpoints” without any form of authentication or protection and “included sensitive login information for major platforms, enterprises, government agencies, and financial institutions”.
“Attackers may exploit this breach through credential stuffing across services with reused passwords; phishing attacks using associated emails and historical data; targeted social engineering leveraging exposed personal content; unauthorised acc­ess to business and gove­rnment accounts; and malware deployment using credentials,” the advisory warned.
The advisory also recommended that people change their passwords annually and use a credible online service to find out about potential breaches.
In March 2024, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registr­ation Authority (Nadra), told the interior ministry that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million people had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.

• Judges, bar councils wary of rules approved by circulation instead of deliberations in full court
• Justice Shah sent letter to CJP on the issue
ISLAMABAD: While the full court comprising all Supreme Court judges is scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon, other than the tweaks suggested by Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) to the proposed Supreme Court Rules 2025, no feedback on the matter has been received by the four-member committee that had prepared the draft months ago.
Senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, however, in a recent strong-worded letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had questioned why the historic revision of the 1980 rules was ‘approved by circulation’, rather than after a thorough discussion in the full court.
An informed source said when the draft of the new rules was circulated among the judges for consideration, some senior judges opposed the idea of approving them without a full court meeting, while legal fraternity also expressed reservations about certain provisions.
Subsequently, CJP Yahya Afridi convened a full court meeting on Sept 8 (today) to finalise the rules and reconstituted the four-judge committee under Rule 1(4) of the proposed rules to recommend solutions for any difficulties in implementation.
The same committee comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had earlier prepared a comprehensive draft on March 13 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 after deliberation and thorough review of the earlier Supreme Court Rules, 1980. However, apart from SCBA, the committee has not received any other suggestions.
The committee had formulated the draft with an aim to enhance transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness in judicial proceedings. It had invited proposals from judges, office of the Supreme Court, bar councils and associations, keeping in view modern legal requirements and the need for streamlined procedures.
Once the new rules were uploaded on the Supreme Court’s website, various stakeholders, including bar councils and associations raised concerns. Some senior judges were also of the opinion that instead of circulating the draft, the proposals should be discussed in a session of the full court.
The full court, comprising all Supreme Court judges, will meet on Sept 8 (today) at the start of the new judicial year. The meeting will be held on the administrative side in the committee room, not in Courtroom No. 1. Deliberations are expected to begin at 1:00 pm, with the CJP presiding, and will focus solely on written suggestions submitted by SCBA and earlier statements issued by the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC).
It is also expected that a newly-built facility centre in the Supreme Court building will be inaugurated on the occasion of the new judicial year.
On Sept 3, SCBA proposed open inquiries by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) into complaints against superior court judges, arguing that open hearings would not only ensure accountability but also uphold the constitutional guarantees of equality before law under Article 25 and the right to fair trial under Article 10A.
According to SCBA, once a complaint is admitted, the SJC should hold open proceedings subject to safeguards of dignity and decorum and decide references within a fixed time frame, preferably six months.
The key reform proposals include rationalisation of court fees demanding withdrawal of the recent increase to ensure inexpensive justice, as seen in Norway and Germany, where only nominal fees are charged.

Besides CM Khan, members of GB Legislative Assembly Surayya Zaman, Shamsul Haq Lone, Raja Nasir Khan Maqpoon, Raja Azam Khan Amacha, Syed Amjad Zaidi, Mushtaq Ahmad, Haji Shah Baig, Dilshad Bano, Abdul Hameed and Fazal Rahim were given formal termination notices, all containing identical wording.
“This letter serves as formal notice of termination of your membership, effective immediately. This decision has been made in accordance with party’s policy and procedures. The reason for this termination is your actions in the GB Assembly, specifically making a forward bloc and voting against the party decision, which is a clear violation of our party’s policy.
“Your actions have caused harm to the party’s interests and reputation,” stated the letters issued by Additional Secretary General of PTI Firdous Shamim Naqvi.

Party announces complete support for strike in Balochistan against lawlessness

All the 11 lawmakers were directed to “refrain from using party’s [PTI] name, designation and/or membership in any manner or whatsoever, failing which the party reserves to take action against you which may also lead to legal action,” the letters stated.
However, according to a party insider, the issuance of letters may not make any difference to them, as the “whole system” was allegedly backing them.
Also, the PTI issued a show-cause notice to former GB governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon, according to Dawn.com. The notice, dated Sept 5, said it had come to PTI’s notice that Mr Maqpoon had “conspired against the party and approached party members for defection”.
“In view of these reported activities, you are hereby called to explain yourself in writing within two days of this notice. If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules,” it added.
Backs strike in Balochistan
Meanwhile, acting on the direction of PTI founder Imran Khan, the PTI announced complete support for the wheel-jam and shutter-down strike in Balochistan on Monday against escalating lawlessness, rising terrorism, and the government’s failure to protect citizens.
The call for province-wide strike was given by a six-party opposition alliance comprising Balo­chistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP), and Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen (MWM).
A statement from PTI’s central media department explained that the coalition had announced the joint protest against the recent attack at Shahwani Stadium on BNP-M rally, which claimed several precious lives and left many others injured. It emphasised that the strike was intended not only to mourn the victims of the tragedy but also to expose the government’s abject failure to provide security to its citizens.
The PTI warned that militancy and extremism were witnessing an alarming resurgence in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and other parts of the country due to government’s policies and priorities.
“PTI strongly believes that the people’s voice cannot be suppressed by terrorism, state oppression, or the use of coercive force. Our democratic struggle for peace, justice, and fundamental rights will not only continue but will be pursued with renewed determination and even greater resolve,” it stated.
On the other side, the PTI extended felicitations to the nation on Pakistan Air Force Day. It stated, “September 7 stands as a symbol of the unmatched bravery, sacrifice, and valour demonstrated by the Pakistan Air Force in the defence of our homeland.
On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to safeguard the nation’s sovereignty.”

• Authorities order evacuations in downstream cities; seven die

LAHORE: An extremely high flood threatened to engulf Jalal­pur Pirwala, a tehsil of Multan district, as the water level in the Chenab River continued to rise on Sunday, prompting the authorities to evacuate residents from a city with a population of 500,000.
Multan City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Ali Dogar told Dawn that low-lying areas of the city had been inundated and could be completely submerged by Sunday night. He, however, assured that evacuations from most areas had been completed. The police official stated that the water was not moving towards Head Panjnad and could submerge the entire city, and the administration had called in helicopters to rescue people from hard-to-reach areas.
A senior official, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that the government attempted to breach a bund to divert the water, but the villagers did not allow them to do so. He claimed that the government was planning to “save the city by diverting the water towards villages but did not succeed”. He said it was not possible to divert the flow since the water had already started entering the city. Residents of Jalalpur also confirmed this version.
In order to aid the administration in relief measures, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority provided three helicopters for aerial rescue — two from the army and one from Askari Civil Aviation. The PDMA director general said a coordinated rescue operation was underway, involving multiple agencies.
 
 

A rescue spokesperson said that 38 additional rescue boats were sent to the most-affected areas of Jalalpur Pirwala. “Another shipment of boats has been dispatched for Jalalpur Pirwala,” the spokesperson said.
Amid rising water levels, the authorities ordered evacuations in the downstream cities. According to the rescue spokesperson, an appeal has been made to the people of Muzaffargarh, Alipur and Jatoi to evacuate immediately.
Seven drown
Meanwhile, five people, including four children, drowned in Jalapur Pirwala after a boat capsized in the Chenab during the evacuation.
“The causes of the boat accident are being carefully examined. Initially, five deaths… have been confirmed,” Multan Deputy Commissioner (DC) Wasim Ham­id Sindhu was quoted as saying in a statement. A statement from the PDMA also put the toll at five. “Rescue operations are being carried out to search for more people who were present on the boat,” Sindhu said.
The initial report from Rescue 1122 explained that while evacuating people from floodwaters in Jalalpur Pirwala, the boat had hit a tree and overturned due to the strong current. It added that mostly the women and children were on board and the water was 15 to 20 feet deep where it had capsized.
According to the rescue authorities, more than 9,000 people had been rescued in the Multan district, while over 350,000 people and more than 300,000 animals had been evacuated in advance.
In another incident, a man drowned while trying to cross the Chenab near Head Panjnad on Saturday evening. His body could not be recovered. A young man in Alipur tehsil drowned as he atte­mpted to reach his submerged house in a catchment area near Head Panjnad.
River flow
As of 10:30pm on Sunday, the Marala Headworks on Chenab reported a steady flow of 89,604 cusecs, while both Khanki (steady) and Qadirabad Headworks (rising) reported flows of 147,294 and 147,039 cusecs.
At the Chiniot bridge, the flow was steady with 91,528 cusecs and Riwaz Bridge was holding steady with 521.60 ft (max value 525 ft). Trimmu Headworks (steady) reported a very high flow of 543,579 cusecs.
Jassar on River Ravi was steady with 48,360 cusecs and Ravi Syphon reported a steady flow of 91,463 cusecs. Sidhnai Headworks was rising with a very high flow of 120,239 cusecs. On the River Sutlej, G.S Wala reported an exceptionally high flow of 319,295 cusecs and Sulemanki Headworks reported 135,832 cusecs. Islam Headworks was steady with 110,028 cusecs, while Punjnad Headworks reported an extremely high flow of 609,664 cusecs. Mailsi had reported flows of 99,811 cusecs and steady.
Rain forecast
Amid floods, torrential rainfall is expected across Pakistan, particularly in Sindh, till Sept 10.
In Punjab, rain and thunder showers with isolated heavy falls are expected in Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Sahiwal, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, Vehari, Khanewal, Mul­tan, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Rahimyar Khan, Rajanpur, Kot Addu, and Dera Ghazi Khan till Sept 9.
According to the Met office, heavy to “exce­ptionally very heavy falls” are exp­ected in Tharparker, Umer Kot, Mir­purkhas, San­ghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Bena­z­i­rabad, Matiari, Tando Allayar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Hyderabad, Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Dadu, Kashmore, Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Shikarpur and Ghotki for next couple of days with occasional gaps.
The rainfall will occur at isolated pla­ces in Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Attock, Jhelum, Mandi Baha­uddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafi­z­a­bad, and Wazirabad during the forecast period.

In KP, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Man­sehra, Abbottabad, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Swabi, Peshawar, Mardan, Kohat, and Kurrum will receive rainfall till September 9.
 
 

The rain spell would likely cause urban flooding in cities and flash floods and landslides in the hilly areas across the country, warned the Met office.
It said that the water level may rise in the Hub Dam, while the deluge may exacerbate the situation in the flood-affected areas during the forecast period.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed special vigilance to ensure the transportation of petroleum products to the flood-affected areas without any interruption.

Around a hundred people, mostly women, had gathered for a Holy Quran recital at a community hall in West Java’s Bogor district to commemorate the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) birthday when the building suddenly collapsed, said Adam Hamdani, an official from the local disaster mitigation agency.
“According to initial data, 84 people are being treated, three people died,” Hamdani said. 
He said it was likely the building, which was used as a meeting hall as well as a place of worship, collapsed because it was overcrowded.

Over 80 injured in tragedy during Eid Miladun Nabi event

“Perhaps the structure was not strong, as people were enthusiastic to follow the event to commemorate the holy prophet’s birthday,” he said.
All the people inside had been accounted for, he said.
Victims were immediately taken to nearby hospitals, with the majority suffering minor injuries.
Hamdani said it was not raining at the time and there did not appear to have been a landslide.
Lax construction standards have raised widespread concerns about building safety in Indonesia.
In 2022, a three-storey minimarket in South Kalimantan collapsed and killed five people. Two people were also injured when a five-storey building in Jakarta partially collapsed two years earlier.
Teenagers rehearsing for a musical show were among seven people killed in Cirebon, east of Jakarta, in 2018 when the building they were in collapsed.
At least 75 people were also injured the same year when a mezzanine floor at Indonesia’s stock exchange building in Jakarta collapsed into the lobby.

Player of the match Nawaz became the third Pakistani bowler to take a hat-trick in T20Is for the Green Shirts and ended up with figures of 5-19 as the Afghan batters had no response to his wily left-arm spin — getting bowled out for a paltry 66.
He also contributed with the bat in Pakistan’s first innings by hitting two sixes and scoring 25 of 21 deliveries.
 






Earlier, Afghanistan men’s spinners restricted Pakistan to 141-8 after skipper Salman Ali Agha had elected to bat first after winning the toss, and the Green Shirts had one change since their last encounter against Afghanistan on Tuesday, with spinner Abrar Ahmed playing in place of pacer Haris Rauf.
Spinners Abrar and Sufyan Moqim picked up two wickets each as the Pakistani spinners outbowled their Afghan counterparts to win the final by 75 runs at the packed Sharjah Cricket Stadium.
In the first innings, Pakistan suffered an early blow when they lost opener Sahibzada Farhan to an inswinger by Fazalhaq Farooqi that made a mess of his stumps.
Fazalhaq, along with left-arm leg-spinner Noor Ahmad, continued their good form with the ball against the Green Shirts — grabbing two wickets each and supporting skipper Rashid Khan, who ended up with three wickets.
Fakhar Zaman hit the first maximum of the match off the bowling of Muhammad Nabi when he danced down the wicket and deposited the ball in the stands.
Pakistan were 41-1 at the end of the powerplay with the Afghan bowlers keeping scoring in check.
Opener Saim Ayub was the next wicket down for the Green Shirts as he prodded at a length delivery by spinner Noor Ahmed — resulting in a regulation catch for Afghan skipper Rashid Khan at covers.
Fakhar did not last long after that, getting out leg before wicket to a straighter delivery by Rashid in the very next over.
At the halfway mark of the innings, the Green Team managed 61-3 as the Afghan spinners continued to cause trouble.
Batter Hasan Nawaz tried to up the momentum but got out miscuing an aerial shot off Rashid — getting dismissed trying one shot too many after hitting a six earlier in the over.
Mohammad Haris was the next to go, as his troubles against spin continued in the series. Noor beat him all ends up as he attempted an aerial shot on a flighted delivery.
The innings meandered along till Mohammad Nawaz hit a six off newcomer AM Ghazanfar in the 15th over to regain some momentum.
Skipper Salman hit two sixes off Rashid in the 17th over before top-edging one to short third man — getting dismissed for 24 off 27 balls.
Faheem Ashraf and Nawaz hit a couple of boundaries before getting dismissed as the Pakistani innings ended at 141-8 at the end of 20 overs.
 






Afghanistan’s reply never got going after losing regular wickets from the very first over of the innings and got the wind knocked out of their sails when Nawaz took a hat-trick by dismissing key batters in the 6th and 8th overs.
Pakistan had secured their spot in the T20 tri-series final by a second 31-run win over the United Arab Emirates, while Afghanistan beat the UAE in a close finish by 4 runs on Friday.
In the tournament that was played as a warm-up ahead of the Asia Cup — which starts on September 9 — both teams faced each other twice in the lead-up to the final, with both winning one encounter each.
Pakistan beat Afghanistan comprehensively by 39 runs in the tri-series opener, while Afghanistan won the last encounter on Wednesday by 18 runs.

According to the Met Office, the eclipse began at 9:27pm. The total eclipse phase started at 10:31pm.
The eclipse will reach its peak at 11:12pm, offering a striking celestial view for skywatchers across the country. The total eclipse phase is expected to end at 11:53pm.
The partial eclipse will continue until 12:57am, while the entire eclipse event will conclude by 1:55am.

According to Suparco, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are completely safe to observe with the naked eye, binoculars or telescopes.
In a press release on Saturday, the space agency had said that the eclipse will be visible in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, with clear visibility expected in most regions of Pakistan if the weather permits.
“The event will start at 8:30pm and reach its maximum at 11:57pm,” the press release read, stating that the eclipse will conclude at 1:55am.
Sunday’s eclipse is also known as a “blood moon”, due to its red hue during the event. When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022. A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.</p><small>2025-09-07 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07232933929ff75.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940309/balochistan-govt-warns-protesters-against-disrupting-law-and-order-ahead-of-shutter-down-strike' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan govt warns protesters against disrupting law and order ahead of shutter-down strike</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan government on Sunday put out a statement warning protesters against disrupting law and order during a shutter-down strike across the province, including Quetta, on September 8 (Monday).
Six opposition political parties announced a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike earlier this week, to protest against the suicide bombing that targeted a Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) pu­­blic meeting at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium on Tuesday, which left 15 dead and 38 injured.
The strike call has been given jointly by six political parties, including the BNP-M, PTI, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), National Party, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen and Jamaat-i-Islami.
While the provincial government noted in the statement that protest is a fundamental right, it warned demonstrators against blocking roads and highways.
“Strict and immediate action will be taken against those who try to obstruct the freedom of movement and routines of life of citizens,” the Balochistan Home Department warned.
“Elements who take the law into their own hands will not be tolerated under any circumstances and those who put citizens in danger through force or violence will not be forgiven.”
The statement added that nobody would be allowed to obstruct public facilities and that “strict legal action will also be taken against any attempt to affect any federal subject”.
The department declared that hospitals, public transport, fuel stations and markets will remain functional at all times and the closure of schools and medical facilities would not be tolerated.
Meanwhile, BNP-M chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal issued a video statement calling upon people to join the strike. Calling the suicide attack a “painful and tragic act”, he asked why the state did not respond to it.
“Isn’t the state responsible for this? Wasn’t it the duty of the state to protect these innocent people?” he asked. “What was their (BNP-M workers) fault? They did not pick up a gun. They did not kidnap anyone or engage in corruption. They raised the BNP flag.
“The Balochistan National Party, Pashtun Khamili Awami Party, National Party, PTI, Wahdatul Muslimin, have decided that on September 8, the Balochistan Bar will be shut down, and a mass strike will be carried out,” he added.
“My request to all the people of Balochistan, regardless of whether they are from a certain district or speak a certain language, or whether they are Baloch, Pashtun, Hazara, or settlers, is to make the strike on September 8 successful.”
Mengal said that the protest “will not affect the rulers”, but noted that the world would observe their movement.
“We want the world to know that these criminals, whoever they are and their atrocities, will be exposed,” he added. “I would like to request the people of every sect of thought to succeed in this protest and prove to the world that the people and protectors of Balochistan are alive.”</p><small>2025-09-07 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622472-kazakh-dpm-to-arrive-in-pakistan-tomorrow-on-two-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakh DPM to arrive in Pakistan today on two-day visit</strong></a><br><p>

It would witness “rain-wind/thundershowers with a few moderate to isolated heavy falls/ very heavy falls”, the forecast said.
According to DawnNewsTV, Bahria Town, Liaquatabad, FB Area and North Karachi began receiving rain today evening. Rainfall was also reported in North Nazimabad, Scheme-33, Gulshan-i-Hadeed and the M-9 motorway.
According to the forecast by the Met Office, this spell of rain will possibly continue till Thursday “with occasional gaps” and may cause urban flooding and waterlogging in low-lying areas.
At 5pm, the Met Office issued a weather warning, directing all concerned authorities to remain on high alert for the duration of the rain spell.
 

The weather warning issued by the Met Office on Sept 7.

Earlier, the Met Office also predicted “widespread rain wind/thundershower with scattered heavy to very heavy falls” in Sindh’s Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Dadu, Mitiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal and Jamshoro till Thursday with occasional gaps.
It has also forecast “widespread rain wind/ thundershower with scattered moderate to isolated heavy falls” in Larkana, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Sukkur, Jacobabad and Ghotki districts of Sindh till Thursday with occasional gaps.
Meanwhile, DawnNewsTV reported that a fresh spell of rains had also begun in Umerkot, Tharparkar and Tando Muhammad Khan.
All teams are on alert amid the ongoing rain, says Mayor Wahab
In the wake of the ongoing rains in Karachi, Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that all teams are on alert.
“Municipal services staff are present at selected locations with machinery,” Wahab was quoted as having said in a press statement.
Rapid response teams have also been deployed to deal with any emergency situation, he added.
“Along with this, city wardens and anti-encroachment staff will also be present on the roads for the relief of citizens,” the Karachi mayor said.
The staff should be in constant contact with the officers; strict action will be taken in case of negligence, according to Wahab.
“A rain emergency centre will be established in case of further or heavy rain,” he continued.
However, the rainfall in Karachi turned the weather pleasant, as its citizens welcomed the decline in mercury.
 


Last month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.
Most of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.</p><small>2025-09-07 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/07184116b741e10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940293/social-media-influencers-kidnap-bid-case-islamabad-court-extends-remand-of-suspect' target='_blank'><strong>Social media influencer’s kidnap bid case: Islamabad court extends remand of suspect</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Sunday extended the remand of a suspect, who allegedly threatened and attempted to abduct social media influencer Samiya Hijab.
The suspect was arrested on Monday and a case was registered in the capital’s Shalimar Police Station at her complaint under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 392 (punishment for robbery), 500 (punishment for defamation), 509 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code. He was later remanded in police custody by a judicial magistrate.
According to a copy of the court order issued today, available with Dawn.com, police requested that the suspect be further remanded for eight days, but the court ordered three days.
“Learned counsel for the accused has opposed the request of the IO (investigating officer) and submitted an application that on a previous date, two days [of] physical remand was granted, thus the accused was supposed to be produced on [September 4], however, has been produced today,” the order read.
The court ordered that the suspect be produced before it on September 10.
The hearing
The suspect was produced in court before Duty Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Azhar Nadeem today after completing five days of physical remand. Police stated that the suspect had a two-day remand before his defence counsel, Chaudhry Zubair Gujjar, noted that the suspect had been produced after five days.
“We can see the first remand order,” Gujjar argued, to which police responded by saying that the two-day remand was a clerical error that was quickly resolved.
 
 

Meanwhile, the suspect’s transaction history with the social media influencer, as well as a video statement of her addressing her parents, were presented before the court.
“The suspect and the plaintiff are engaged,” Gujjar stated, showing photographs of their engagement.
However, the prosecution said that Rs45,000 had been recovered from the suspect and that his alleged accomplices needed to be arrested.
“[The suspect] got bail in one case but was deliberately arrested in another case,” Gujjar argued. “The suspect was in the Jinnah Super area at the time of the incident.
 
 

“When [the suspect] demanded money back from Samiya Hijab, false receipts were given,” he added.
The influencer alleged in a first information report (FIR) that the suspect had stalked her for several days. She added that last Sunday at 6:30pm, an attempt was made to forcefully take her out of the house.
“Today’s incident further escalated when he attempted to forcibly abduct me from my house while I was returning his gifts. This amounts to abduction, harassment, and assault under the law. For evidence, I have CCTV footage,” she was quoted as saying in the FIR.</p><small>2025-09-07 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622401-parts-of-karachi-receive-heavy-rain-amid-urban-flooding-risk' target='_blank'><strong>Parts of Karachi receive heavy rain amid urban flooding risk</strong></a><br><p>
