As the founding father of Hindutva, Savarkar’s ideas have long informed Modi’s actions.
And those ideas are pretty basic. “India should follow the German example to solve the Muslim problem,” Savarkar said in 1938, “…Germany has every right to resort to Nazism and Italy to fascism — and events have justified those -isms.”
 
 

Given such events reduced Europe to the bloodlands of World War II, Modi now wishes the same for South Asia: Pakistan and India have been closest to war in half a century; fighter jets tango overhead; and a new generation wakes up to the sirens their grandparents once had to.
At the brink of war, again
But we’re here now, and it mostly has to do with Delhi’s own neuroses: the rabid base, the status anxiety, and an occupation that refuses to resolve itself. Modi’s annexation drive in Kashmir was demographic change 101; the “Muslim problem”, to quote Savarkar, would be resolved, even if India had to shred its own supreme law to do it.
But no one asked Kashmir’s sons and daughters. The Pahalgam attack wasn’t a cause; it was a reply — one that came on the heels of mass murder and repression.
Even here, however, Pakistan’s response was to condemn it, call for a neutral probe, and talk up peace. India’s response was to try and choke the water supply to an entire civilian population, fire missiles at a three-year-old girl, and name its operation after the hair choices of married Hindu women.
Because Modi takes the same policy decision each time there’s a Kashmir crisis: to externalise it to Pakistan, and then scream revenge. For Uri in 2016, for Pulwama in 2019, for Pahalgam today. The evidence provided — for an accusation that could lead to nuclear war and the end of the world: none yet.
Instead, the prime minister has again rushed to the border on fumes: at the close of India’s saffron decade, Modi has fed off his manic base, and his base has fed off him — peace is political suicide. Every election demands a war, and every corpse is campaign fodder.
 
 

More the pity for his Western allies, long banking on India as the region’s net security provider. But while the ’20s may vary from century to century, a Nazi is still a Nazi.
And no Nazi ever stopped his ingress without a punch to the face: courtesy the excellent Pakistan Air Force doing its job, and only its job (other services take a hint), five planes were shot out of the sky in the middle of their bombing run. CNN, Reuters, and French intelligence would also confirm the first-ever demise of a prize Rafale, India’s shiny new toy.
Memes against drones
Hence, also, the second problem: in the same way that Modi’s revenge in 2019 climaxed with wing commander Abhinandan getting checked for microchips on his return from Wagah, the 2025 remix saw Pakistani pilots use Chinese tech to down million-dollar death machines. As Western defence contractors looked on aghast, the global war economy changed overnight.
Of course, much of this is the world the West has made for us: amid the rivers of blood in Gaza, amid the collapse of the post-1945 world order, amid free reign to genocidairres in Tel Aviv and to brutes in Moscow. Asked about the Pak-India conflict, vice president JD Vance shrugged, “None of our business”.
So be it: Pakistan would have to stand up to bullies on its own. Now it has — Modi’s war kicked off with the IAF losing five warplanes, all to self-defence. Before Pakistan could even mention retaliating, Operation Sindoor had become Operation Duckshoot.
None of this was meant to happen: the lotus boys have been trying for escalation for some time now — a goofy theory they’ve borrowed from fellow dimestore Nazis in Israel. Borders, balance, proportion, none of it means anything. All international law is to be discarded, while targets are to be inflicted with shock-and-awe violence.
 


Just that it hasn’t worked there, and it especially isn’t working here. As one US defence czar put it, “Anyone who thinks they can control escalation through the use of nuclear weapons is literally playing with fire.”
But the lesson of Modi’s entire public life has been that playing with fire benefits his politics — from the inferno of Gujarat in 2002 to Muslim massacres in Delhi in 2020. Where this throughline stops is Pakistan: at the Muslims that got away, and learned to shoot back.
Repelled at the outset, Delhi has tried sating its far-right hordes in other ways. It switched to suicide drones swarming Pakistan’s cities. It tried to change the subject online, by unleashing its IT zombies. (The usual Hindutva triple feature followed: fake news, rape threats, and pornography.)
Yet headlines across the world carried on: this jet, that jet, Dassault stocks versus Chengdu’s. Even The Economist, an otherwise reliable Pakistan-basher, pointed to the conflict’s core cause: “India needs to end its self-defeating repression of the part of Kashmir it controls.”
 
 

India’s legacy media didn’t fare much better. After destroying Karachi port — if entirely on the Internet — war hawk Barkha Dutt took cover in a blacked out hotel, where she told us the “moonless night did not even allow for a sliver of light” — nor, perhaps, a sliver of integrity. By the time morning broke, the only thing India had managed to end was Fawad Khan’s Instagram.
If there was a story in all this, it was, as always, Pakistanis themselves. Facing neo-fascists next door and indifference abroad, they responded with memes and jokes. When force was called for, they mostly urged it in defensive terms. They called out their own state for its censorship, for its unrepresentativeness, for its tone-deaf ministers, yet rallied behind the white and green. They mourned seven-year-old Irtiza Abbas Turi, while refusing to mirror Hindutva’s poisonous demonisation of children. And they refused to part with their humanity, wishing for peace from start to end.
They still do.</p><small>2025-05-09 23:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603851-india-launched-missiles-at-three-airbases-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>India launched missiles at three airbases: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement issued today, the IMF said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform program supported by the EFF Arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52 billion). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1 billion),” it said.
It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP. Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and “the failure of India’s high-handed tactics” against Pakistan.
“The country’s economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country’s development through unilateral aggression.
 
 

“International institutions have responsibly rejected India’s false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” it quoted the prime minister as saying.
The premier said the programme would help stabilise the economy and put it on the path towards long-term recovery, adding that the government was working on priority areas such as tax reform, improved energy sector performance and private sector development.
“The improved economic indicators in the last 14 months are a reflection of the government’s positive policies.
“Pakistan’s economic stability strategy, effective performance and sustainable planning are committed to this,” the statement said.
The approval of the IMF’s executive board has led to an immediate disbursement of $1bn, bringing total disbursements under the loan programme to about $2bn. On successful completion of seven half-yearly reviews, Pakistan is entitled to seven equal instalments of about $1bn (SDR 760 million) under the loan programme.
Pakis­tan and the IMF had reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
The two sides had reached a staff-level agreement on March 25 on the first biannual review of the 39-month $7bn loan programme, agreeing on a series of reforms including the introduction of a carbon levy, timely revisions to electricity tariffs, increased water pricing and liberalisation of the automobile sector.
The staff-level agreem­ent also entailed a new 28-month RSF arrangement, providing total acc­ess to around $1.3bn (1bn special drawing rights, or SDRs).
This takes the combined size of the IMF support to about $8.3bn. The additional RSF fina­n­cing, unlike the bailout package’s biannual review and disbursement schedule, is subject to disbursement on completion of specific projects and policy actions to build climate resilience.
The board approval would be soon followed by another IMF mission visiting Pakistan to finalise the 2025-26 budget to be presented in the National Assembly in the first week of June.
The implementation of major reforms — including the carbon levy, water pricing and automobile protectionism — would begin gradually from July 1.
The overall ongoing fiscal consolidation will continue in the coming budget through a reduction in energy subsidies and tight development spending.</p><small>2025-05-09 20:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09162358958e49b.jpg?r=172304' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909746/unfortunate-that-indias-reckless-conduct-brought-two-nuclear-armed-states-closer-to-major-conflict-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct brought two nuclear-armed states closer to major conflict: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Friday said it was unfortunate that “India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict” as military tensions between Pakistan and India escalate.
The statement comes amid the ongoing escalation between Pakistan and India, which started after New Delhi launched attacks in several Pakistani cities. Islamabad promptly responded to the attacks.
The escalation began following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, killing 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
While addressing his weekly press briefing in Islamabad today, FO Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said: “Indian actions are a flagrant violation of the UN charter, international law, and established norms governing interstate relations.
 






“It is most unfortunate that India’s reckless conduct has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict,” he said.
“India’s jingoism and war hysteria should be a source of serious concern for the world,” he added.
The spokesperson noted that South Asia is home to one-fifth of the world’s population, who can “ill-afford the irresponsible actions like the ones being carried out by India.”
He said that in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has “once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace.”
The spokesperson reiterated that Pakistan rejected any attempt to link it to the attack in Pahalgam.
He noted that a number of countries and international organisations had called on both countries to exercise restraint over the past two weeks, and it was “highly deplorable that India did not pay heed to these calls”.
“The international community should hold India accountable for its irresponsible, unlawful and belligerent conduct,” he said.
He rebutted referenced remarks made yesterday by India’s Foreign Secretary Shri Vikram Misri during a press briefing.
“The assertion that Pakistan escalated the situation through the Pahalgam attack of April 22 is totally absurd. To date, India has not been able to produce any credible and verifiable evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the attack.
“To the contrary, the acts of aggression committed by its armed forces had the approval and support of its entire government,” he said. “Thus, it is India that has escalated the situation by violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing civilians.”
He continued that “the Pakistani forces did not attack Pahalgam, but the Indian forces did attack multiple locations in Pakistan,” adding that Pakistan reserves the right to take all measures in its self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter.
Earlier in the day, state-run PTV said that Pakistan has taken down a total of 77 Indian drones so far.
The spokesperson noted that on April 26, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called for a “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, yet “India chose the path of belligerence and aggression.”
“We are amazed to see the importance that the Indian government attaches to the anonymous and dubious social media posts, upon which it has built the case for The Resistance Front’s involvement in the Pahalgam Attack. Can any country in the world be allowed to attack another country on the basis of a few social media posts? India is attempting to act as a judge, jury and executioner.”
He added that “while India portrays itself as a victim of terror, it conveniently ignores its own role in planning, sponsoring and abetting terrorism in Pakistan.”
The FO spokesperson said Indian claims of targeting terrorists or terrorist infrastructure “are blatantly false [and] it is a matter of record that Indian strikes resulted in the martyrdom of civilians, including women and children.”
 
 

He noted that Pakistan was “well within its rights” to demand that India be held accountable for its “crimes”, referring to Indian strikes on mosques in Pakistan. As many as three civilians were kil­led when four Indian missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura and an ad­­joining house in Muridke, some 40 kilometres from Lahore.
Khan said that “the current Indian dispensation is bent upon weaponising water; holding in abeyance of IWT is unilateral and illegal.
“Pakistan is an agrarian economy. Millions of people are dependent on the water being regulated by the treaty. The Indian decision is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and the economy.
“For Pakistan, the Indian announcement is of no legal consequence. The treaty remains enforced and fully binding on the parties,” he said.
He further said that the Indian allegation of Pakistan’s refusal to enter into government-to-government negotiations is incorrect. “Pakistan has been continuously engaged with India on the subject.”
“We particularly regret the Indian foreign secretary’s indecent and undiplomatic remarks that Pakistan has been in the habit of lying since its creation in 1947. We expected better from a diplomat of his status,” he said.
“It is most unfortunate that nowadays, India’s ruling dispensation is trying to rewrite history, making a number of absurd claims. India’s founding fathers must be turning in their graves.
“In fact, India remains a permanent factor of instability in the region owing to its hegemonic ambitions. It has constantly been working to destabilise its smaller neighbours and has stonewalled all efforts to promote regional cooperation.”</p><small>2025-05-09 19:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09163019c453560.gif?r=163109' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909718/may-9-and-military-courts-what-the-sc-decision-means-for-civilians' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 and military courts: What the SC decision means for civilians</strong></a><br><p>In a momentous ruling, the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday allowed civilians accused in the May 9, 2023 riots — triggered by the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan — to be tried in military courts.
“The legal fate of some 103 individuals facing military trials remained in limbo from December 2023 till Tuesday, a period of about a year and a half,” noted Dawn’s editorial today.
The 5-2 verdict by the Constitutional Bench overturns an earlier ruling that had declared military trials of civilians null and void, and restores key sections of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow military jurisdiction over certain civilian offences.
The bench not only overturned that decision but also restored three contentious provisions of the PAA that had previously been struck down. It also directed the government to introduce legislation within 45 days to ensure that civilians tried in military courts are granted the right to appeal their sentences in a high court.
However, the decision was not unanimous — the two dissenting judges, Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — declared military court convictions “without jurisdiction” and unconstitutional. Rights groups and leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have likewise decried the ruling, citing concerns over due process.
The legal fraternity has weighed in too, warning that the judgment threatens the right to a fair trial and chips away at civilian justice system.
‘Total surrender of civilian rights’
Lawyer Basil Nabi Malik criticised the SC’s verdict, calling it “as shambolic as it was hurried”. He added, however, that the ruling was unfortunately expected. “As many are saying out loud nowadays, the purpose of the 26th Amendment has been achieved. And with history as its witness, judges are being said to be doing the bidding of the ruling elite, once again,” he remarked.
Malik added that the verdict shows “a total surrender of civilian rights”, with “fundamental rights becoming nothing more than irrelevant provisions in a Constitution that is being treated like a book of fiction by those ordained to protect it”.
‘A setback for our justice system’
In a similar vein, Barrister Rida Hosain said that by sanctioning the trial of civilians by military courts, “the court has surrendered our fundamental rights and displayed a complete lack of faith in the civilian justice system. The verdict is a huge setback for our justice system”.
“In a remarkable finding, the court held that the right to a fair trial is ‘fully protected’ under the Army Act. Under military law, members of the executive act as judges, trials take place behind closed doors, and there is no reasoned judgment. Fundamental rights are at the discretion of executive authorities, who grant or deny them at their whim,” she noted.
Hosain further pointed out an apparent contradiction in the judgment’s reasoning: “The court has referred the matter to Parliament for ‘considering and making’ a law providing an independent right of appeal to the High Court. If the right to a fair trial is protected in military courts, why is an independent right to appeal required?” According to her, “this is a concession by the bench, that the law, as it currently stands, does not comply with fair trial standards”.
“Civilian judges have revived a law first introduced by a military dictator, Ayub Khan, allowing the court martial of civilians. The order is rife with contradictions and undermines the principle of institutions acting within their constitutional domain,” she concluded.
‘Death of citizens’ right to a fair trial’
Drawing on the said concerns, lawyer Mirza Moiz Baig added that the ruling “spells the death of citizens’ right to a fair trial”.
“While the announcement of the verdict coinciding with India launching an attack on Pakistan may have obviated any serious critique, the judgment gives short shrift to the ways in which military court trials offend against the right to due process and a fair trial,” he pointed out.
Like Rida, he expressed concern over the erosion of public trust in the judiciary, noting: “With serious concerns already surrounding the constitutional benches formed after the 26th Amendment, the judgment further erodes public confidence in the SC’s ability to uphold citizens’ rights”.
Baig, however, admitted that it would be remiss to not acknowledge the importance of Justice Mandokhel and Afghan’s dissents, adding, “Will the brooding spirit of the law heed their words though?”
Absence of an independent forum of appeal
Lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii described the SC’s ruling as “devoid of any reasoning other than the regurgitation of facts as narrated by the government”. He shed light on the absence of an independent forum of appeal against such convictions rendered by military courts. “The judgement is pinned upon the hope that an admitted fundamental legal defect … will hopefully be cured,” he says.
Jaferii went on to argue that the Constitutional Benches had fulfilled their mandate. “They have given back to the establishment the ability to play judge, jury and executioner with civilians they deem worthy of their attention,” he said. Referring to the delay in the court’s decision, he added, “These benches took six months after the 26th Amendment to put this order together. It was perhaps an effort to try and make us all forget this was their raison d’être (reason for being)”.
Institutional inconsistency
“The recent short order reveals how deep the rot runs,” commented lawyer Ahmad Maudood Ausaf.
He noted that legal scholars across the board have long maintained that military courts clash with fundamental rights — particularly the right to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution. “That debate has been laid bare, and I will not revisit its anatomy here,” he remarked.
Instead, he highlighted the court’s institutional inconsistency. “In a common law jurisdiction where precedent is seminal, what demands urgent attention is how, within just six months, the court has reversed its decision without any change in facts, law, or context,” he said. “Such institutional inconsistency doesn’t just confuse precedent — it erodes the trust essential for the apex court to exercise its writ”.
“Some might even argue that the court has lost its writ, or a significant part of it, as a consequence of its past decisions and their execution. And if the honourable justices continue interpreting in the same fashion, one must ask: how relevant will the apex court remain?” he said, questioning the very authority of the court in the public eye.
He also cast doubt on the timing of the ruling, stating, “At a time when Pakistan confronts a palpable external threat from India, this judgment — so hollow in reasoning and so strategically timed — feels like a quiet calculation: perhaps, under the pressure of war drums, the public would look away”.
An effort to dismantle judicial independence
According to lawyer Zainab Shahid, the SC’s short order is “a major setback for fundamental rights, constitutionalism and the separation of powers in Pakistan”. She argued the ruling is the result of a “two-year executive effort to dismantle judicial independence”, particularly through the 26th Amendment aimed at overturning the court’s earlier decision against military trials.
Shahid said the judgment “makes a mockery of Articles 8(5) and 10A of the Constitution,” which guarantee the right to a fair trial and prohibit suspension of fundamental rights except as clearly provided by the Constitution. “The Constitution envisions an exception for members of the armed forces — not civilians,” she stressed.
Criticising the bench’s reliance on the government’s narrative of the May 9 events, she said the court “assumes the guilt of those involved” and aims to “make an example of PTI’s protestors” while sidestepping why ordinary courts aren’t fit to try civilians.
She also flagged a “bizarre contradiction” in the ruling: while claiming military courts uphold due process, the bench still asked the government to legislate an independent right to appeal. “This convoluted judicial maneuver is more likely to be a face-saving device… than a just outcome for civilians left at the mercy of court martials,” she said.
‘Nothing has changed in the corridors of power’
Meanwhile, lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir said that despite repeated condemnation of judges such as former justices Muhammad Munir and Abdul Hameed Dogar in the past, “it appears that nothing has changed in the corridors of power”.
“Our highest offices, whether executive or judicial, continue to be occupied by highly compromised individuals,” the lawyer said.
He said that recognising military trials of civilians as constitutional was akin to suspending the chapter on fundamental rights in the Constitution.
“The Supreme Court taking refuge with the military and risking erosion of public trust may provide job security to the judges, but it has robbed the SC of its sanctity,” Nasir said, adding that the very institutions which were to “ensure order in society are sowing seeds for anarchy”.</p><small>2025-05-09 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603827-pakistan-navy-says-fully-prepared-to-counter-any-indian-misadventure' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan navy says fully prepared to counter any Indian misadventure</strong></a><br><p>

Chairing a meeting on the preparation of the federal budget 2025-26, the premier directed that the upcoming budget should be prepared with a focus on sustainable export-driven growth and considering the projects to promote industries and increase production
“The budget should also focus extensively on the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector,” he added.
The prime minister said that the government and private sector must work together for development and prosperity.
Calling the public-private partnerships and youth vocational training among the government’s priorities, the premier noted that positive results were emerging from the power sector reforms, as the reduction in electricity prices for industries would help promote industry and production.
He said that automation and digitisation were being promoted to bring transparency to the government system and facilitate the business community and investors, adding that the government would continue the process of rightsizing to reduce the size of the federal government in the next fiscal year.
During the briefing, it was revealed that consultations with the private sector on budget preparation had been in process for the past three months, besides consultative sessions with stakeholders from various sectors.
The meeting was informed that the five-year trade policy framework for 2025-30 and the e-commerce 2.0 framework would be completed soon, and a plan for tariff rationalisation was also being prepared.
The delegation of businessmen and experts expressed confidence in the government’s economic policies and presented their suggestions, which the prime minister welcomed, directing the inclusion of feasible proposals in the budget.
The meeting was attended by federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Jam Kamal Khan, Shaza Fatima, Sardar Awais Ahmad Leghari, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar, and relevant senior government officials.</p><small>2025-05-09 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603798-how-to-spot-fake-news-amid-pakistan-india-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>How to spot fake news amid Pakistan-India tensions</strong></a><br><p>

Nobel Peace Prize winner Yunus, 84, has led an interim government since Hasina was overthrown by student-led mass protests in August 2024 and fled into exile as crowds stormed her palace.
Friday’s rally came after the sudden departure of Abdul Hamid, a former leader of Hasina’s Awami League party, from Bangladesh early on Thursday.
A crowd, mainly made up of young people, had started gathering outside Yunus’ residence on Thursday night.
Hasnat Abdullah, the chief organiser of the newly formed National Citizen’s Party, said the demonstration would continue until their demands were met.
“Sheikh Hasina robbed the people of Bangladesh of their democratic rights.
She manipulated the system to prevent any real opposition from participating in the election,” Kamrul said.
“We saw Abdul Hamid leave the country safely. The actions of certain advisers are highly suspicious. The delay in justice appears to be part of a broader plan to bring back the fallen dictator and her party,” he added.
Hasina remains in self-imposed exile in India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.
According to the United Nations, up to 1,400 protesters died in July when Hasina’s government launched a brutal crackdown on the opposition, for which she and Hamid are being investigated.
At least three police officers responsible for overseeing airport arrivals and departures have been dismissed for negligence, according to officials, after Hamid’s departure.
While citizens are generally barred from assembling outside the chief adviser’s residence, the student demonstrators were allowed through. The government said on Friday it was seriously considering the demand raised by various quarters to ban the Awami League.
“The government has begun communicating with different political parties to reach a final decision on the matter. It has reviewed UN-documented evidence of atrocities committed by the Awami League and its affiliates,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-05-09 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09180548cd67464.jpg?r=180606' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909752/karachi-to-host-35th-national-games-in-december-murad-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to host 35th National Games in December: Murad Shah</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced on Friday that Karachi would host the 35th National Games from December 6 to 13 after it was  postponed from its initial dates in May.
The games were set to be held from May 1-9 in Karachi but were postponed in April due to “unavoidable circumstances,” according to an official letter issued by the Sindh Olympic Association.
Murad held a meeting today at CM House with a high-level delegation of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) to finalise preparations for the games.
He welcomed the opportunity to host National Games, pledging full cooperation to ensure the games are organised in accordance with international standards.
He directed all relevant departments to provide essential facilities to athletes, including training, medical care, transportation, and modern infrastructure.
CM Murad announced the construction of a new swimming pool and  acquisition of modern electronic timing and scoring systems. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was also signed between the POA, the Government of Sindh, and the Sindh Olympic Association to establish a coordinated framework for organising the games.
“This initiative will be a milestone for athlete welfare and institutional coordination,” the CM said. He emphasised the importance of nurturing young talent and promoting broader interest in sports across the province.
POA President Arif Saeed briefed the chief minister on the history of the National Games and lauded the government’s commitment to their development. He noted that the upcoming event has already sparked fresh enthusiasm among athletes nationwide.
Both the Government and the POA reaffirmed their dedication to enhancing athlete performance and making the 35th National Games a landmark event in Pakistan’s sporting history.
The POA delegation was led by its President, Arif Saeed, and included Senior Vice President Ms. Fatima Lakhani, Secretary General Khalid Mehmood, and Sindh Secretary Ahmed Ali Rajput. Also present were Principal Secretary to CM Agha Wasif and Sports Secretary Aleem Lashari. Secretary Abdul Aleem Lashari gave a detailed briefing on the ongoing preparations, logistics, and planning for the upcoming games.</p><small>2025-05-09 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603787-pm-shehbaz-vows-to-provide-relief-to-common-man-in-upcoming-budget' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz vows to provide relief to common man in upcoming budget</strong></a><br><p>

The Indian media, it would appear, isn’t happy to just kill the truth. Over the last few days, hysterical war-crazed news anchors, buoyed by trolls and pundits on social media, have made every effort to crush the truth, stomp on it, tear it up, chop it into fine pieces, set it on fire and throw away the ashes in the Indian Ocean.
When Greek dramatic Aeschylus (525/524 bc — 456/455 bc) coined the phrase, he may have been referring to the propaganda spread by states through scrolls and word of mouth. That was a simpler time — states could get away with untruths and falsehoods, with the other side none the wiser.
It takes a different kind of arrogance, however, to try to pull this off in the 21st century, when the information ecosystem is no longer inhibited by geographical limitations or even the imperative of a closed media landscape.
Into the metaverse
Over the last 24 hours, in particular, the kind of disinformation coming out of the Indian information ecosystem has been particularly bewildering — ranging from the incredulous to batshit crazy. To put this in context, here’s what the Indian media would have you believe was going on in Pakistan on the night of Thursday and Friday:

The Karachi Port had been destroyed by the Indian Navy (It wasn’t, we
know. We had shrimp karahi and grilled Red Snapper at a restaurant
adjacent to it.)

 



The Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir was arrested following a
coup (No one in Pakistan knows this but the Indian media is super confident.)

 



The Indian Army had attacked and laid claim to Islamabad and Shehbaz Sharif had been shifted to a safe house (could they also please let us know where this ‘safe house’ is?)

 



An F-16 or a JF-17 Pakistani fighter jet had been shot down (This one was confusing to the Indians too because they couldn’t decide which one they wanted to have shot down.)

 



A Pakistan Air Force pilot had been captured (They really can’t get over Abhinandan, can they?)

 



Lahore was overrun by Indian forces (What even is this obsession with Lahore? They’ll just misdirect you back to India)

 


It would be almost comical if it wasn’t so morose. Since the Indian military carried out airstrikes in Pakistan on Wednesday, over 31 civilians have been slain on this side of the border, while dozens have been injured. There are reports of casualties on the other side too. And while civilians pay the ultimate cost, the Indian media has continued to beat the war drums, cheering the BJP government’s unhinged rhetoric with some even calling for the complete annihilation of Pakistan — a country of 250 million people.
One can only imagine how dim-witted you have to be to cheer a war between two nuclear-armed countries. And yet, the Indian media seems to have no qualms about the impending doom should this escalate any further.
Let saner heads prevail
In a parallel universe, where sanity isn’t lost to jingoism and anchors aren’t screeching war cries, the media on both sides of the border would attempt to act as a communication bridge and simmer down tensions in a what is already a volatile situation.
Good journalism relies on facts, not fiction. Good journalism questions authorities’ actions, instead of inciting them to commit more acts of violence. Good journalism seeks to investigate rather than gulp down the state narrative. Most of all, good journalism calls for speaking the truth and trying to get the other side’s version, particularly in times of conflict where there is a huge cost to pay for the minutest misunderstanding.
Misreporting can also create panic among the people and pile on the pressure for action, giving rival actors little time to process and strategise before they make a move, leading to even graver consequences. Moreover, it is equally important to keep your own people adequately informed so they can make decisions for their own safety.
According to handbook on Conflict-Sensitive Reporting published by the German-based Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, in times of conflict, the media must play its role for consensus-building, correcting misconceptions and humanising the other side, among other functions.
Granted, there will always be the fog of war. A lack of credible, verifiable information, combined with misinformation are a part of conflict. It is difficult to know what is happening in real time, and even for a long time afterwards — but the Indian media went far beyond that to report entirely made-up events.
At the same time, the Indian media has never exactly been known for its predilection for the truth. In fact, quite the contrary — in 2016, the EU Disinfo Lab’s excellent report, titled India Chronicles, uncovered a rather sophisticated disinformation campaign involving “resurrected dead media, dead think-tanks and NGOs” to serve Indian interests.
But what we have witnessed over the last couple of days is one for the history books. It’s not just the self-proclaimed pundits on social media peddling the state’s narrative and dehumanising people on this side of the border; it’s not even the mainstream media’s blatant disregard for facts and accuracy when pushing the BJP government’s vitriol; what is most incredible is that many seemingly progressive voices seemed only too eager to jump the bandwagon and push the same falsehoods, sprinkled with cries of war and revenge.
All of this begs the question: was this all about ratings? Perhaps, but it is more likely a  sloppy, panicked attempt to save face, even if temporarily, in front of a bloodthirsty population amid international confirmation of IAF jets being shot down. It was, after all, incredibly humiliating for India to lose multiple jets, especially the much-vaunted Rafale — the purchase of which was at the heart of a corruption scandal in India — in a single ‘surprise’ operation. Coincidentally, the media blitz began just before a Reuters story of US officials confirming it.
Perhaps this was part of the psychological operations against their own people to create the impression of a victorious India for the time being. What no one seemed to care about was a potential backlash from the masses who have been cheering them on once the truth does come out or even the dent in the credibility and moral legitimacy of the Indian media in the eyes of international observers.
As I write this, there are reports that the Indian government has banned The Wire, one of the few publications questioning the popular narrative. In a sea of yes-men, The Wire stood out, refusing to lap up the hateful rhetoric and trying to tell the full story. It’s about time more Indian journalists realise that becoming the BJP’s propaganda arm and spewing hate for those across the border will only take them so far — without credibility and the courage to speak to the truth, a journalist is but a pen-pusher.</p><small>2025-05-09 12:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0916190450c5004.jpg?r=161926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909732/workers-remittances-clock-in-32bn-for-april' target='_blank'><strong>Workers remittances clock in $3.2bn for April</strong></a><br><p>Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers clocked in at $3.2 billion for the month of April, up 13 per cent year-on-year, according to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data released on Friday.
Topline Securities, a brokerage firm in Karachi, noted, “Worker remittances clocked in at US$3.2bn, up 13pc YoY in Apr-2025.
“This takes 10MFY25 remittances to US$31bn, up 31pc YoY,” it added.
 


According to the firm, inflows during April were mainly sourced from Saudi Arabia ($725m), UAE ($658m), UK ($535m), and US ($302m).
Earlier, the government had set a target of $35bn in remittances for the current fiscal year (FY25), but financial experts believe the inflow would exceed the estimate. “The inflows could reach up to $36bn in FY25,” said a currency dealer in the banking market.
A study published by the Asian Development Bank found that Pakistani migrants tend to remit more when economic conditions are improving back home and when there is a positive association between remittances and domestic economic activity.
The study’s findings indicate that domestic and abroad economic activity is positively associated with remittances to Pakistan.</p><small>2025-05-09 11:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0915520954ea7a4.jpg?r=164013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909733/new-pope-leo-xiv-vows-to-bring-light-to-worlds-dark-nights' target='_blank'><strong>New Pope Leo XIV vows to bring light to world’s ‘dark nights’</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo XIV on Friday celebrated his first Mass in Vatican City’s Sistine Chapel where he was elected less than 24 hours earlier and prayed that his historic papacy can help the Catholic Church be a beacon illuminating “the dark nights of this world”.
Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost and the first US pope, looked serene as he said the Mass in the famous, frescoed chapel with the same cardinals who chose him to be the 267th pontiff and the successor to Pope Francis.
Dressed in relatively simple white and gold vestments, Leo, who was born in Chicago but spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, said a few words in English before continuing his homily in fluent Italian. He painted the spiritual picture of the Church he would like to see under his papacy.
“God has …. entrusted this treasure to me so that, with his help, I may be its faithful administrator for the sake of the entire mystical Body of the Church,” he said.
“He has done so in order that she may be ever more fully a city set on a hill, an ark of salvation sailing through the waters of history and a beacon that illumines the dark nights of this world,” he added, according to the official translation.
The 1.4 billion-member Church, was great not because of “the magnificence of her structures or the grandeur of her buildings … but rather through the holiness of her members.”
Swift Appointment
Leo, aged 69, was elected at the end of a swift two-day conclave that was wrapped up on Thursday evening when white smoke billowed from the chimney of the chapel.
Before his election, US cardinals had largely been written off as papal contenders because of a widespread assumption that the global Church could not be run by a superpower pope.
However, he also holds Peruvian citizenship, meaning that he has deep knowledge of both the West and less developed nations.
After the Mass, Leo will have lunch with the cardinals who elected him and they will then be free to leave the Vatican and return to their homes around the world.
The successor to Pope Francis, who died last month at the age of 88, inherits a number of major challenges, ranging from a budget shortfall to divisions over whether the Church should be more welcoming towards the LGBT community and divorcees, and should let women play a greater role in its affairs.
US President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Leo. However, the new pope has a history of criticizing Trump and Vice President JD Vance’s policies, according to posts on the X account of Robert Prevost.
The new pope worked for decades in the north of Peru, first as a missionary and later as Bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. Catholics took to the streets of the small city in northwestern Peru, and church bells rang out to celebrate the election of a man who they embraced as one of their own.
One of the clues to what kind of a Church leader Leo would be was in his choice of name, something that pontiffs often use to send a signal about the priorities of their new papacy.
The last pope with this name was Leo XIII, who led the Church from 1878-1903. He was known for his devoted focus on social justice issues and is often credited with laying the foundation for modern Catholic social teaching.
Prevost became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given a few media interviews and is known to have a shy personality.
Francis brought him to Rome two years ago to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world’s bishops.</p><small>2025-05-09 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0911072972b8454.jpg?r=110740' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909677/psx-gallops-to-recovery-after-day-of-historic-losses' target='_blank'><strong>PSX gallops to recovery after day of historic losses</strong></a><br><p>Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recovered nearly 4,000 points on Friday after the index suffered its largest-ever plunge a day earlier, causing losses to the tune of Rs820 billion loss to equity investors following Indian drone attacks in major cities across the country.
The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 799.65, or 0.77 per cent, to stand at 104,326.46 from the previous close of 103,526.81 at 11:06am.
At 4:31pm, the index recovered 3647.82, or 3.52pc, to stand at 107,174.63 from the last close.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, said that after falling sharply by 6pc yesterday, the stocks had recovered.
“So far, there has been no news of any major escalation which helped restore confidence,” he said.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “Stocks on the PSX remained volatile today, opening higher as participants increasingly factored in that an all-out war with India is unlikely.
“Some investors have begun accumulating stocks trading at highly attractive valuations following the sharp drawdown over the past week,” he added.
“Technical analysts also noted this morning that the market had entered oversold territory,” Farooq said.
On yesterday’s decline, he stated it was primarily “driven by individuals unwinding leveraged positions and redemptions from mutual funds”.
“Such corrections and short-term volatility are a normal feature of equity markets,” he said, adding that they continued to “advise that only long-term investors participate in the market, maintaining discipline during periods of uncertainty and gradually building their portfolios over time”.
“Market attention now remains on developments in Pakistan-India tensions and the IMF board meeting scheduled for today, where Pakistan’s next tranche will be considered,” he said.
Sana Tawfik, head of research at Arif Habib Limited, noted that the primary reason behind the recovery was investor optimism regarding the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting today.
“Most likely, the Executive Board will approve the tranche today,” she said.
The Fund is set to meet today to approve the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Faci­li­ty and allow an additional arrangement for the $1.3bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
Furthermore, she highlighted that the market now provided “attractive valuations” due to yesterday’s market dip.
“Lastly, fears of a major escalation have been placated due to no major development on that front,” she added.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that the “panic triggered by yesterday’s drone attacks from the Indian side is subsiding, as the Pakistan Armed Forces demonstrated ability to intercept the threats has reassured investors”.
“The recent market correction following the onset of the escalation has presented investors with a valuable opportunity to build their portfolios at more attractive valuations,” he added.
The market capital had lost Rs1.3 trillion in value in the previous three sessions as jittery investors preferred to exit the market amid growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as geopolitical tensions turned into a military standoff after India hit three cities with missiles in the wee hours of Wednesday, martyring over 31 innocent civilians. Pakistan’s armed forces responded with the downing of five Indian fighter planes.
The market crash followed alarming geopolitical developments after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry announced that Pakistani forces had neutralised 25 drones sent by India since last night. He also confirmed that four army personnel were injured after one drone managed to partially strike a military target, despite the majority being intercepted.

The one issued by five judges this Tuesday will one day prove equally significant, albeit for entirely different reasons. Earlier this week, while Pakistanis were still cheering for their air force after it successfully tackled the late-night marauders next door, the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench threw a wet blanket on the public mood with the announcement that it was restoring sections of the Pakistan Army Act that allow for civilians to be court-martialled.
Ruling with a 5-2 majority, the bench overturned the unanimous decision issued in October 2023 by five senior justices of the Supreme Court — including three who are still serving, most notably the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan — who had ruled that there could be no justification under the Constitution for military trials of civilians.
It may be recalled that the original judgement also ruled that all cases against civilians being tried under the Act should be transferred to civilian courts, where they would be retried under ordinary criminal law. Unfortunately, that was never to be.
The latest ruling issued by the Constitutional Bench was salt on the wound for many in the legal community, who had hailed the original judgement for restoring a measure of sanctity, fairness, transparency and due process in the Pakistani justice system, only to see it taken away within two months by an appellate bench set up by former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa.
It may also be recalled that, as the then senior puisne judge had alleged, this appellate bench was formed in violation of the Practice and Procedure Act and in response to petitions moved by controversial caretaker governments whose tenure had already exceeded their constitutional expiry dates. To top it off, the appellate bench was then handed over to a judge who had already revealed their mind on the military trial of civilians.
Thereafter, the legal fate of some 103 individuals facing military trials remained in limbo from December 2023 till Tuesday, a period of about a year and a half. The final call was to undo the gains achieved for civilian rights under the original verdict and revert to status quo ante. Sadly, while the people took heart from the victory in the skies, they were defeated by the courts. It is up to the people to draw their own conclusions.

Security analysts and diplomats say China’s military modernisation has reached a point where it has the ability to deeply scrutinise Indian actions in real-time from its border installations and Indian Ocean fleets as well as from space.
“From an intelligence perspective, this is a rare target of opportunity right on China’s borders involving a key potential adversary,” said Singapore-based security analyst Alexander Neill.
Two US officials said a Chinese-made J-10 Pakistani jet fighter shot down at least two Indian military planes — one of them a French-made Rafale fighter.
India has not acknowledged the loss of any of its planes while Pakistan’s defence and foreign ministers have confirmed the use of J-10 aircraft but have not commented on which missiles or other weapons were used.
The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries around the world to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle.
Competing regional giants and nuclear powers, India and China are widely seen as long-term strategic rivals, sharing a 3,800 (2,400 mile) Himalayan border that has been disputed since the 1950s and sparked a brief war in 1962.
The most recent standoff — which started in 2020 — thawed in October as the two sides struck a patrolling agreement.
Security analysts say both sides have taken steps to strengthen their military facilities and capabilities along the border, but it is also from above that China packs an intelligence-gathering punch.
The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) notes that China now fields 267 satellites — including 115 devoted to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and a further 81 that monitor military electronic and signals information. It is a network that dwarfs its regional rivals, including India, and is second only to the US.
“Both in terms of space and missile tracking capabilities, China is much better off now in terms of being able to monitor things as they happen,” said Neill, who is an adjunct fellow at Hawaii’s Pacific Forum think-tank.
China’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ questions about the deployment of its military satellites and other questions about its intelligence gathering.
Pakistan’s military media wing and information minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any information sharing with China. Pakistan has previously said it has an “all-weather strategic, cooperative partnership” with China.
India has not commented on the issue, but its top diplomat in Britain, High Commissioner Vikram Doraiswami, told Sky News on Thursday that China’s relationship with Pakistan was not a concern for India.
“China requires a relationship with all of its neighbours, that includes us,” he said.
Missile deployments
Chinese military intelligence teams would be eager to garner information on any Indian use of air defences and launches of cruise and ballistic missiles - not just in terms of flight paths and accuracy but also command and control information, analysts and diplomats say.
Any deployment of India’s BrahMos supersonic cruise missile — a weapon it developed jointly with Russia — would be of particular interest, some analysts say, given they do not believe it has been used in combat.
China has also beefed up its intelligence gathering at sea. It has been increasingly active in the Indian Ocean in recent years, with China deploying space tracking ships as well as oceanographic research and fishing vessels on extended deployments, open-source intelligence trackers say.
Regional diplomats say that while the Chinese navy has been relatively cautious about extensive warship deployments into the Indian Ocean, still lacking a broad network of bases, it actively seeks intelligence with these other vessels.
Over the last week, some trackers noted unusually large fleets of Chinese fishing vessels moving apparently in unison to within 120 nautical miles of Indian naval drills in the Arabian Sea as tensions rose with Pakistan.
Pentagon reports on China’s military modernisation and analysts note that China’s fishing fleets routinely perform a coordinated militia function that plays an important intelligence-gathering role.
“These vessels may double up as listening posts, tracking development rhythms and response patterns, feeding early warning, naval intel to their sponsors,” wrote open source tracker Damien Symon in an X post that highlighted the deployment of 224 Chinese vessels near Indian naval exercises on May 1.
Chinese officials do not usually acknowledge the existence of fishing militia or intelligence work carried out by other nominally civilian vessels.
Given its deep and broad strategic relationship with Pakistan, Beijing can also be expected to fully exploit its network of envoys and military teams there for key nuggets.
“The presence of Chinese military advisers and other personnel in Pakistan is well-known given how Pakistan’s Ministry of Defence has been importing some of its most advanced military hardware from China, so we can be certain the PLA would be able to access relevant data,” said James Char, a Chinese security scholar at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.</p><small>2025-05-09 10:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603770-us-vp-vance-says-war-between-india-pakistan-will-be-none-of-our-business' target='_blank'><strong>US VP Vance says war between India, Pakistan will be 'none of our business'</strong></a><br><p>

An IPL match on Thursday was abandoned midway after fighting began in India’s border regions, but the cricket board attributed the disruption to a power failure at the stadium in the hill city of Dharamsala.
“Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues of the tournament will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders,” said the statement from BCCI Honorary Secretary Devajit Saikia, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“The decision was taken by the IPL Governing Council after due consultation with all key stakeholders following the representations from most of the franchisees, who conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans; while the BCCI reposes full faith in the strength and preparedness of our armed forces, the Board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders.
“At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the Government of India, the Armed Forces and the people of our country,” the statement said.
“While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation,” the statement added.
Earlier today, the Press Trust  of India reported that “a cloud of uncertainty had loomed over the future of the ongoing edition since the cancellation of Thursday’s match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala midway following air raid alerts in neighbouring cities of Jammu and Pathankot.”
“It does not look nice that cricket goes on while the country is at war,” a BCCI official told PTI, confirming the suspension of the league, which was to wind up on May 25 in Kolkata.
 






The world’s richest cricket tournament began its current season on March 22, and the final fixture was scheduled to be played on May 25, with matches being spread over 13 venues across the country.
According to ESPN Cricinfo, IPL 2025 was 58 games old, including the abandonment in Dharamsala. There were 12 games left to play in the group stage, scheduled for Lucknow (2), Hyderabad, Ahmedabad (3), Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru (2), Mumbai, Jaipur, followed by the playoffs, to be played in Hyderabad and Kolkata.
Pakistan and India have been locked in conflict since Wednesday, when India targeted multiple locations in Pakistan, claiming they were “terrorist infrastructure” in response to a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir last month.
New Delhi named two Pakistani nationals as suspects and accused Islamabad of being involved in the attack, a charge Pakistan denied. Subsequently, Islamabad sought an independent probe.</p><small>2025-05-09 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/09140807a811eff.jpg?r=140948' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909714/global-militaries-to-study-india-pakistan-fighter-jet-battle' target='_blank'><strong>Global militaries to study India-Pakistan fighter jet battle</strong></a><br><p>A dogfight between Chinese-made Pakistani jets and French-made Indian Rafale fighters will be closely scrutinised by militaries seeking insights that could offer an edge in future conflicts.
A Chinese-made Pakistani fighter plane shot down at least two Indian military aircraft on Wednesday, two US officials told Reuters, marking a potential major milestone for Beijing’s advanced fighter jet.
The aerial clash is a rare opportunity for militaries to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle.
Experts said the live use of advanced weapons would be analysed across the world, including in China and the United States which are both preparing for a potential conflict over Taiwan or in the wider Indo-Pacific region.
 
 

One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters there was high confidence that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets.
Social media posts focused on the performance of China’s PL-15 air-to-air missile against the Meteor, a radar-guided air-to-air missile produced by European group MBDA. There has been no official confirmation these weapons were used.
“Air warfare communities in China, the US, and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn’t,” said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
“You have arguably China’s most capable weapon against the West’s most capable weapon, if indeed it was being carried; we don’t know that,” Barrie said. The French and Americans would likely be hoping for similar intelligence from India, Barrie said.
“The PL-15 is a big problem. It is something that the US military pays a lot of attention to,” a defense industry executive said.
Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation declined comment and the MBDA consortium could not immediately be reached for comment on a French public holiday.
Scant details
Western analysts and industry sources said crucial details remained unclear including whether the Meteor was carried and the type and amount of training the pilots had received. Arms firms would also be anxious to separate technical performance from operational factors, analysts said.
“There will be audits of what works and what doesn’t work, but I think the other overlay is the proverbial fog of war,” said Byron Callan, a Washington-based defense expert and managing partner of Capital Alpha Partners.
US arms companies are getting constant feedback about how their products are working in the war in Ukraine, he said.
“So I absolutely expect the same to be the case with India’s European suppliers, and Pakistan and China are probably sharing the same feedback. If the PL-15 is working as advertised or better than expected, the Chinese would like to hear that.”
A defense industry source from a Western country operating the Meteor said an online picture of a seeker appeared to feature the component of a missile that had missed its target.
There are conflicting reports on whether Pakistan has the domestic version of the PL-15 from the PLAAF, China’s air force, or the lower-range export version publicly unveiled in 2021.
Barrie, who has written extensively on the missile, said he believed that Pakistan most likely has the export version.
A Western industry source dismissed claims that the rocket-powered PL-15 had longer range than the air-breathing Meteor but acknowledged that its capability “may be greater than was thought.” The Meteor’s range has not been officially published. “At the moment it’s not possible to judge anything. We know so little,” the industry source said.
The PL-15’s range and performance have been a focus of Western interest for years. Its emergence was seen as one of many signals that China had moved well beyond reliance on Soviet-era derivative technology.
The United States is developing the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile via Lockheed Martin partly in response to the PL-15 and its beyond-visual-range performance — part of a broader reset of Western priorities toward China.
European nations are exploring a mid-life upgrade for Meteor, which specialist publication Janes says could involve propulsion and guidance, but analysts say progress has been slow.
US President Donald Trump in March awarded Boeing the contract to build the US Air Force’s most sophisticated fighter jet yet, which would likely include stealth, advanced sensors and cutting-edge engines.</p><small>2025-05-09 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603759-in-talks-pakistan-must-set-condition-india-doesnt-repeat-war-drama-every-two-years-ex-foreign-secretary' target='_blank'><strong>'In talks, Pakistan must set condition India doesn't repeat war drama every two years'</strong></a><br><p>

On Thursday night, Indian news channels were flooded with reports claiming that India’s air defence systems had shot down Pakistani jets during alleged attacks on  multiple locations across Jammu in India-held Kashmir and Punjab in  India.
Although the claims were widely repeated, no evidence or footage was offered to substantiate them.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed the claims that India shot down Pakistani jets, including an F-16 and two JF-17 fighter jets. He termed the claim “absurd and false”.
“Fake and concocted stories will get you nowhere. Such false claims only reflect your desperation. Denied and rejected,” the minister said in a post on X.
 






Separately, speaking to Geo News, the information minister challenged the Indian government to provide proof of downing any PAF fighters or capturing a pilot.
“I am 100 per cent denying it. With fullest confidence at my command, I am denying it,” the information minister said.
 






Jammu attacks
Also on Thursday evening, Indian media claimed Pakistan had launched attacks using missiles and drones across Jammu in India-occupied Kashmir.
The Foreign Office immediately rubbished this claim as well.
 
 

“[Pakistan] categorically rejects the baseless and irresponsible allegations propagated by the Indian media, accusing Pakistan of launching attacks on Pathankot, Jaisalmer, and Srinagar. These claims are entirely unfounded, politically motivated, and part of a reckless propaganda campaign aimed at maligning Pakistan,” it said in a statement on Thursday night.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also contradicted the Indian misinformation.
“We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far,” Mr Asif told BBC in an interview. The minister added that when Pakistan does strike, everyone will know it. “We will not strike and then deny.”
He said Pakistan will not deny any actions it takes.
Earlier, Indian media reports claimed that explosions were heard in held Kashmir and there was a blackout in the region.
In a statement on X, the Indian military said there have been no losses reported and that the threat has been “neutralised”, without giving any proof.

In a press briefing on Thursday, Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, said the US was aware of Pakistan’s offer for a neutral investigation into the attack.
“Pakistan wants an independent investigation … and [the US] want the perpetrators to be held accountable, and we are supportive of any efforts to that end,” she added.
When asked if the two neighbours have offered any commitments,
Ms Bruce said Secretary Rubio had been clear on two things: “that this should not escalate” and “communication was fundamentally key”.
When the spokesperson was asked if the US shared India’s view that Pakistan was supporting terrorist groups, she refrained from affirming the accusation.
She said the Pahalgam attack was “awful”, but the “back and forth and continuation” of attacks should stop.
Ms Bruce added that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan over the past few weeks were “not surprising but very, very disappointing”.
She said both sides should remain engaged in conversation and the US would remain involved in this process.
Mr Rubio also spoke with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. They discussed regional security matters, economic engagement, and efforts to de-escalate tensions between India and Pakistan, Ms Bruce added.
She acknowledged the situation was “very delicate and dangerous” and said any discussion about ongoing negotiations shouldn’t be made public.
“That’s certainly our policy. We think it’s important to not put details in the midst of the worldwide media when the work is being done in private between leaders.”
When asked whether India provided the US with any intelligence to back up its claims against Pakistan, Ms Bruce refused to give details.
“We, though, will not engage in the nature of discussing what the conversations have been or what we have conveyed,” she added.
She urged both India and Pakistan to “work towards a responsible solution”.
US consulate advisory
The US Consulate General in Lahore has directed its staff to shelter in place after Indian drones were shot down in the city. The consulate said it has also received initial reports that authorities may be eva­cuating some areas adjacent to Lah­ore’s main airport, a statement said.

Heading the five-judge CB, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned whether the authority to determine the seniority of superior court judges should lie with the President or the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP).
He also recalled how, under civil service procedures, when officers were transferred from the surplus pool to a different department, their seniority started from the bottom in the new department. He wondered whether there was any rule or convention for finalising the seniority of judges or whether it should be compared with civil service rules.
The bench was hearing a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.

Justice Mazhar questions who should determine seniority — president or CJP?

Senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, representing the petitioners, argued that the consultation process for transfer of the three judges to the IHC was neither purposive, meaningful, nor consensus-oriented on all relevant aspects. Consequently, he said, the transfers should be struck down.
During the hearing, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan recalled earlier transfers to the IHC, noting that one such transferred judge was even appointed as chief justice of the IHC. He also asked the counsel whether the judges in those instances had taken a fresh oath upon transfer.
The counsel replied that these transfers occurred after the IHC was re-established under the 18th Amendment, following its abolition by the 2009 SC judgement and subsequent re-establishment through the Islamabad High Court Act, 2010.
The counsel contended that, during the consultation process, the consultees — namely the CJP and the chief justices of the high courts concerned — were not presented with any information or data explaining why Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar was selected or shortlisted for transfer to the IHC out of a pool of 33 Lahore High Court judges, particularly when he was ranked 16th in seniority.
“You are suggesting as if there was no evidence that any option was afforded to other judges of the LHC to opt for transfer to the IHC,” remarked Justice Salahuddin Panhwar.
The counsel said Justice Dogar’s appo­intment was not random but premeditated, intended to place him ahead of the senior puisne judge of the IHC in seniority.
“You seem more aggrieved by the transfer of Justice Sarfraz Dogar,” Justice Panhwar observed.
When Justice Mazhar noted that one of the summaries had mentioned that the transferred judges would retain their seniority in the high court to which they were transferred, the counsel clarified that this communication was directed to the prime minister, not the CJP.
The counsel argued that following recent developments in the rules governing the appointment of judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the top five judges of a high court now have a legitimate expectancy to become the chief justice. If a seventh-ranked judge is elevated over them, a writ of quo warranto may be filed in the Supreme Court to challenge the appointment.
He contended that the consultees never discussed critical issues such as emoluments or the selection procedure. He cited the example of Justice Muhammad Asif of the Balochistan High Court, who was serving as an additional judge at the time of his transfer. In his case, consent for the transfer was taken from the acting chief justice (ACJ).
When the counsel cited the Al-Jihad Trust case — in which it was held that an ACJ can only perform routine tasks for a limited period and cannot recommend a judge for elevation — Justice Mazhar noted that it made sense, as, at the time, consultations were carried out between the CJP and the President in the absence of the JCP. Now, however, the JCP exists, and every member has an equal vote.
The issue of seniority is critical, the counsel emphasised, because it is not merely about personal satisfaction. He pointed out that there is no law currently in place to fix the seniority of judges.
The hearing was adjourned to Wednesday (May 14).

On Wednesday, Pakistan said it had shot down five Indian Air Force jets, including three Rafales.
Indian officials have yet to confirm the claim. When asked about the downed planes, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri didn’t answer the question directly, or issue a denial. He merely said that official information on this topic will be shared at the right time, BBC News reported.

BBC terms video showing wreckage of French-made jet in Bathinda ‘authentic’

Earlier, on Wednesday, a high-ranking French intelligence official had told CNN that one Rafale fighter jet operated by the Indian Air Force was downed by Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Reuters cited two US officials as saying that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to shoot down at least two Indian jets on Wednesday.
One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was high confidence that Pakistan launched air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets using the Chinese-made aircraft.
Another official said at least one Indian jet shot down by Pakistan was Rafale.
BBC has also confirmed that a Rafale aircraft fell in Indian territory.
BBC Verify said it had authenticated three videos purportedly showing the wreckage of a Rafale fighter jet in a field in Bathinda.
One of the clips geo-located by BBC Verify to a field near Bathinda in Indian Punjab showed troops collecting debris from the crashed jet.
“We have also located two further clips from the same location filmed at night. One shows debris in the field, while another shows a projectile catching fire in the sky, and then fire in an open field,” the British broadcaster added.
Justin Crump, a former British Army officer, confirmed to BBC Verify the wreckage visible in the video appeared to be of a French air-to-air missile used on both Mirage 2000 and Rafale fighter jets.

The show, however, will go on with the closing stages of this season’s PSL to be held in the United Arab Emirates.
“The PCB confirms that the remaining fixtures of the HBL PSL X have been shifted to the UAE,” the PCB said in a statement in the early hours of Friday morning. “The exact sche­dule of matches, outlining the dates and venues, will be shared in due course.”
Four matches of the league stage of the country’s glitzy T20 extravaganza are still to be held, which will decide which four teams advance to the playoffs.
That, after Thursday’s match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings, which was to be held at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, was called off hours before the scheduled start time.
Pakistan’s military on Thursday said it took down nearly two dozen Indian drones sent on this side of the border since the previous night. One of those drones crashed within the stadium’s complex, inflicting some damage.
The worsening situation saw the PCB, PSL and government officials gather for a meeting, which continued till late in the night with other venues, including Karachi and Dubai, coming into consideration for the remaining eight matches of the league.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that the board had decided to shift the remaining matches to the UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers could be saved from “the possible reckless targeting by India”.
He also stressed it was important for the board “to ensure the mental well-being of all players” participating in the tournament.
PCB spokesperson Amir Mir had told Dawn earlier on Thursday the security of the players, especially the foreigners is the most important for us. “There have been drones brought down in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi We will decide in due course what needs to be done.”
Carrying out the matches in Rawalpindi only also came under discussion, sources said.
Asked if postponing all the remaining matches for an indefinite period was an option, sources in PCB said that it was highly unlikely as foreign players due the national and international commitments of foreign players.
BBC Sport had reported that a postponement was being considered.
Earlier on Thursday, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Pakistan’s interior minister held a meeting with the PSL teams — except Multan Sultans, who are currently in their home city — in Islamabad and met foreign players.
Out of remaining eight matches — four were slated to be held in Rawalpindi, one in Multan and three in Lahore, including the final.
The cross border tensions also affected Thursday’s Indian Premier League match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in the Himalayan region of Dharamsala, which was called off midway due to a “floodlight malfunction” according to the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
The incident occurred hours after the BCCI had said that it had shifted the match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians — scheduled to be held on Sunday in Dharamsala – to Ahmedabad.
Cricket boards around the world were monitoring the situation across the two countries with several foreign-based players featuring in both the PSL and the IPL.
Bangladeshi media reported that The Bangladesh Cricket Board was working to bring home Nahid Rana and Rishad Hossain — participating in the PSL for Peshawar Zalmi and Lahore Qalandars respectively — “in a timely and secure manner”.
“The BCB is in active coordination with the PCB and the Bangladesh High Commission in Islamabad to ensure that all necessary measures are in place to guarantee the security of our players,” the board said in a statement.
BBC Sport reported that some English players participating in the PSL were considering leaving while others wanted to stay.
The Professional Cricketers’ Association (PCA) has been in regular contact with the 15-person contingent, it said.
Cricket West Indies (CWI) also said that it was in touch with their players in the PSL and IPL and has engaged West Indies Players’ Association (WIPA) “to coordinate and ensure the safety, security, and well-being of all West Indies players and support personnel in the region”.
