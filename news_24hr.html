• Parallel drawn between Dogra regime and Modi govt actions
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s top leadership on Sunday reaffirmed the country’s unwavering support for the Kashmiri’s people right to self-determination and their resistance against oppression, marking Kashmir Martyrs’ Day with renewed pledges of political, diplomatic and moral backing.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, paid tribute to the resilience and sacrifices of Kashmiris in their decades long struggle against Indian rule.
Both leaders vowed that Pakistan will continue to support Kashmir cause until the region achieve self-governance in accordance with UN resolutions.
President Zardari commended Kashmiris for their “steadfast bravery and sacrifices” against Indian control and called upon international bodies and human rights groups to address the alleged state terrorism and rights violations in the occupied region.
PM Shehbaz echoed these sentiment, emphasising the “ongoing sacrifices made by Kashmiris in their fight for self-determination”.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to supporting their cause “politically, ethically, and diplomatically”.
Naqvi condemns ‘oppression’
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the 22 Kashmiri martyrs of July 13, 1931, who, he said, “faced bullets with courage and dignity in reverence of the call to prayer (Azaan).”
He described the day as “harbringer of free conscience against a system that sought to silence the oppressed”, drawing parallel between the Dogra regime and the current violence of Modi’s government.
He accused the Modi government of “oppressive actions against Kashmiris,” including “the genocide of Kashmiri youth, extrajudicial killings, and silencing of journalists”.
Naqvi also referenced former US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate on Kashmir, saying, “US President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate opened a door to peace, but India closed this door, proving its warlike mindset through its rejection of dialogue.”
AJK PM’s warning
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar-ul-Haq, in an interview with a local news channel, said the sacrifice of the martyrs “formed the bedrock of the Kashmiri freedom movement, a fight that will endure.”
He urged the international community to recognise the Kashmiris’ “legitimate right to self-determination” and called for renewed efforts to resolve the conflict through peaceful dialogue.
Anwar-ul-Haq warned that “India’s brutality shows no signs of abating,” and cautioned that continued aggression would “only harden the resolve of Kashmiris, escalate their struggle for freedom, and provoke a fierce and uncompromising response from Pakistan’s armed forces”.
He also accused India of fuelling unrest in Balochistan, calling for international accountability.

Buhari governed Nigeria with a strong hand as a military ruler in the 1980s before reinventing himself as a  “converted democrat”, serving two terms from 2015 to 2023.
“The family of the former president has announced the passing on of the former president, Muhammadu Buhari, this afternoon in a clinic in London,” Garba Shehu, who served as Buhari’s spokesman during his presidency, said in a post on social media.
Current President Bola Tinubu said in a statement that he had spoken with Buhari’s widow and ordered Vice President Kashim Shettima to go to England to accompany Buhari’s body to Nigeria.
The rake-thin 82-year-old Muslim from Nigeria’s far north made history as the first opposition candidate to defeat an incumbent leader at the ballot box in 2015.

The rehearing of a popular and politically charged case is about to take place about a decision by the Commission against the sugar mills.
The CCP had imposed its highest-ever penalty of Rs44 billion against the sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) in 2021 for alleged cartelisation and anti-competitive conduct. However, the sugar mills maintain that the decision was only made to popularise the performance of the CCP and abide by the political decision-makers of that time.
The 2021 sugar mill case has also highlighted the alleged excessive use of powers by the chairperson of the Commission at that time, who voted twice to approve the inquiry against the sugar mills. The decision is available on the CCP’s website, informing the public about the three members and the chairperson of the CCP who conducted the inquiry.
With a 2-2 deadlock, the chairperson, as the chair of the Commission, cast the decisive vote, and the order imposing the highest penalty ever by the CCP was approved. The order, however, was challenged in the Competition Appellate Tribunal (CAT), which questioned the legality of the additional ‘casting vote’ exercised by the chairperson to break the deadlock in the original four-member bench.

The sugar mill 2021 case re-emerges along with questions surrounding cartelisation and pricing decisions

In May, the CAT ruled that ‘no casting vote’ could be exercised in quasi-judicial proceedings under the Competition Act, 2010, and set aside the CCP 2021 order against the sugar mills. The CAT directed the CCP to rehear the matter with the condition that the chairperson or a member of the Commission who was not part of the earlier decision would be present.
The CCP has issued notices to the PSMA and its member sugar mills to appear for a hearing in the matter on August 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th.
The 186-page decision of the CCP against the PSMA in 2021 presents two differing views on cartelisation by sugar mills and the PSMA.
Those who supported imposing heavy penalties on PSMA and its members noted that sugar was an integral part of the quality of life for the general public, and its availability at an affordable price comes under the guaranteed right to life under Article 9 of the Constitution.
 
 

It was noted that there were 53 essential commodities in the Hoarding Act of the country, and sugar was among the top ten. Sugar is not only consumed as a sweeter but is an important ingredient for bottled beverages, confectionaries, the pharma sector and many food processing industries. Thus, the CCP order noted that any change in sugar price will also have a spillover effect over many products.
On the other hand, the different opinions of two members highlighted that the enquiry committee had developed the ‘theory of competitive harm’ as it solely rests on a key assumption that the sugar stock position was a highly sensitive commercial information that allowed sugar mills to formulate pricing strategies and control the supply of sugar in the market.
Incidentally, section 55 of the CCP order has referred that the Sugar Advisory Board (SAB) meeting held in October 2019 discussed the issue of high prices. The chairman PSMA said in the meeting that ex-mill price of sugar have come down from Rs69 in September to Rs65 per kg in October, 2019. Yet, the meeting noted that the wholesale and retail prices did not decrease.
After consulting all the stakeholders, it was concluded unanimously by SAB that to reduce the gap between ex-mill price and retail price, the secretary of industries and production will approach the provincial governments to regulate differentials. The intent was to bring the margin to a reasonable level to manage the recent price hike in wholesale and retail markets.
Incidentally, the CCP order failed to note that the retail price of refined sugar had a direct link with the wholesale markets, and large stocks were purchased by the traders based in these wholesale trading hubs.
Talking to Dawn, a senior Punjab-based PSMA member said that the whole process focused only on the performance of the sugar mills while discussing the retail price of the commodity, whereas there were at least two more stakeholders involved before sugar reached the individual consumer level. “This enquiry was designed to pressurise those who had developed differences with the prime minister of that time,” he said.
Whereas, Iskander Khan, four times PSMA chairman, responding to the query, added that cartelisation was never proven in the CCP inquiry, while the decisions to export or import sugar are made by the government.
“How can CCP or any entity accuse sugar mills of conspiring to export or import sugar mills do so without naming the prime minister, minister for food security, minister for industries, and the commerce minister?” Mr Khan said. He added that blaming some sectors has become a popular fashion in the country without a thorough study of ground realities.

Mr Urubko, with his wife Maria Cardell, arrived at base camp on Saturday and scaled the killer mountain without using supplementary oxygen.
Karim Shah Nizari, a friend of the climbers, told Dawn that the duo successfully opened a new route via Diamir Face on Nanga Parbat. According to the Russian media, they scaled the mountain fast and light and returned safely to the base camp after the summit.
With this achievement, Mr Uru­bko has made 28 ascents of the eight-thousanders, with seven new routes opened and two first winter ascents, including Makalu in 2009 and Gash­erbrum II in 2011. He has also scaled all 14 highest mountains in the world without using supplementary oxygen.
Nanga Parbat is more southern and western than Pakistan’s four other eight-thousanders peaks, including K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum I, and Gasherbrum II. Nanga Parbat, also known as the killer mountain, is situated in the Himalayas. During the ongoing season, at least 24 climbers, including five Pakistani nationals, have summited the peak.
Injured Polish climber
Meanwhile, a rescue team brought  to Camp 1 an injured Polish climber who sustained a leg injury on Broad Peak on Sunday.
Waldemar Kowalewski suffered a fracture above Camp II on Saturday when a snow avalanche hit the trio during their rotation.As a result of the incident, Mr Kowalewski suffered a leg fracture at an altitude of 6,500 metres, while his two colleagues Jarek and Hassan surviving without any injuries. After the accident, a rescue team was dispatched to bring the Polish climber down to the base camp.
According to Karrar Haidri, the vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the injured mountaineer had been brought down to Camp 1 on Sunday and the rescuers were assessing the safest option for further descent. According to organisers, Pakistan Army helicopters will airlift the Polish climber from the Broad Peak base camp to Skardu today (Monday).

• No international party participated in bidding
ISLAMABAD: The government’s ambitious plan to auction old and defunct public sector generation plants under Genco Holding Company Limited (GHCL) — aimed at curtailing operation and maintenance (O&M) expenditure — is in serious trouble, compelling authorities to consider handing over the scrap to Wah Industries of the Ministry of Defence.
Sources said the first round of auction, which appeared to be a success on the sale counter, could not generate any proceeds so far in almost four months amid management’s inability to secure binding contracts while the second round failed to take off even on the scheduled bidding date.
“Frustrated by repeated failures and lack of credible bids in subsequent auctions, the Energy Task Force led by Lt Gen Zafar Iqbal decided earlier this month to make a major policy shift and hand over all remaining power plants to Wah Industries through a government-to-government (G2G) arrangement by the end of the current month”, said the sources.
Last year, the government had decided to close down old, redundant and defunct public-sector Genco plants and auction their obsolete machinery and equipment (excluding land) via an open international bidding process.
The Task Force on Energy Reforms that was holding separate negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) gave the GHCL management three-month target for the auction and close of transaction. On March 18, the first phase of nine old power plants was put up for auction through open bidding. Only seven plants received qualified bids amounting Rs9.05bn against a reserve price of Rs8.07bn.
However, no international bidder participated in the bidding process. As per the contract requirements, the bid money was must to be paid either 100pc in advance or through four installments within three months.
Among the seven awarded plants, six contracts were bagged by M/S Daraza Builders while the contract for the 20MW Multan Cantt plant was awarded to M/S Malik Bashir Traders.
At the 147MW Kotri Power Plant, Genco-I or JPCL signed a contract worth Rs1.88bn with M/S Daraza, which deposited the required 10pc performance guarantee but no further payment has been received to date. Surprisingly, Genco-1 top management did not issue any delay notices or invoke interest penalties — despite clear contractual clauses.
Genco-II (CPGCL) returned a bid security of over Rs96m to M/S Daraza for the 50MW Sukkur Plant without contract finalisation.
At the 57.2 MW Quetta Power Plant, a second-phase bid of Rs601m was submitted by Perfect Tel Company. Payment delays continue, allegedly with the tacit support of Genco-II (CPGCL) and GHCL top brass.
Procedural lapses have also been reported in Genco-III (NPGCL) whose management is internally under scrutiny for delaying contracts of key plants. For example, contract for TPS Multan Cantt plant (20MW) was signed in June 2025 with M/S Malik Bashir Traders — three months after the auction, raising concerns over NPGCL’s intent.
Contracts for NGPS Multan (260MW) and GTPS Shahdara (85MW), both awarded to M/S Daraza, are only now being signed — with delays of over 3.5 months. Contract for GTPS Faisalabad (247 MW) remains unsigned amid speculations of interest-based gains.
Meanwhile, LPGCL (Genco-IV) signed a Rs2.133bn contract with M/S Daraza for the Lakhra Power Plant in May 2025. Although the first installment was paid, the second was delayed by 18 days.

Both Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Jameel Ahmed have recently talked about the transformation of the Pakistani economy as their next goal. While macroeconomic indicators suggest tentative improvement, the real test lies in whether this rhetoric can translate into genuine, systemic reform.
One of the clearest signs of change is in Pakistan’s exchange rate regime. For decades, the policy pendulum swung between artificial overvaluation and abrupt depreciations — breeding uncertainty for businesses and draining foreign reserves. In contrast, SBP’s recent firm stance on a market-driven rupee marks a fundamental departure from the past.
The central bank’s reserves have also tripled over two years — from about $4.5 billion in June 2023 to $14.5bn as of July 7, 2025. Remittances have reached a record high of $38.3bn in FY25, up 26.6 per cent year on year. Merchandise exports also grew 4.7pc to $32.1bn — despite global headwinds, import restrictions, and high energy and financing costs.
Inflation, too, has been reined in more through demand contraction than anything else. The 4.5pc reading in FY25 — the lowest in nine years — signals more than just favourable base effects. A tight, coordinated monetary policy combined with fiscal restraint and notably subsidy cuts helped break entrenched inflationary expectations.

Despite recent improvements on the macro scale, true economic transformation requires confronting Pakistan’s long-standing structural bottlenecks

Fiscal discipline has also improved — though not without trade-offs. Pakistan’s combined federal and provincial fiscal deficit narrowed to 5.6pc of GDP in FY25, according to Fitch rating agency, down from 6.9pc a year earlier. But this came at a steep price: energy subsidies were slashed by Rs450bn, while development spending stagnated. More critically, debt servicing now consumes about half of overall federal revenues — and a staggering 75pc of the Federal Board of Revenue’s tax collections, projections for the new fiscal year reveal.
Financial inclusion is also accelerating. The number of active mobile money accounts has grown substantially, nearing the national target of 65 million set under the National Financial Inclusion Strategy. Women’s financial inclusion has improved dramatically — from 13m in 2018 to 31m by 2023 — raising women’s account ownership from 23pc to 47pc. This growth reflects a major shift in economic participation, supported by mobile wallets, branchless banking, and targeted policy reforms.
 
 

True economic transformation, however, requires confronting Pakistan’s long-standing structural bottlenecks. Take the energy sector: circular debt continues to accumulate at a rate of Rs50bn per month. State-owned enterprises — Pakistan International Airlines, Steel Mills, and the Independent power distributors — collectively bleed hundreds of billions of rupees annually. Judicial inefficiency remains a major obstacle to investment, with contract enforcement still taking 1,039 days, according to the World Bank’s 2024 report. These delays cost Pakistan 4pc of GDP annually. Investors demand contract enforcement, not ad hoc rulings.

The finance minister’s tax push won’t suffice unless elite capture is dismantled. Independent anti-graft courts with prosecutorial teeth are non-negotiable. Over $10bn is lost annually to corruption, according to Transparency International’s 2024 report. Policies made to benefit a few politically connected businesses also must discontinue.
Pakistan’s human capital crisis is equally alarming. Experts argue that Pakistan must allocate at least 4–5pc of GDP to education to lay the foundation of a true economic transformation. Rural poverty stands at 38pc and female labour force participation at just 22pc — both lagging regional peers. Digital identity systems and microloan schemes can help bridge these gaps — but only if provincial and local governments are empowered to act decisively.
From the civil service to state-owned enterprises, appointments remain politicised. The 18th Amendment’s promise of devolution remains unfulfilled. Local councils continue to cry out for both fiscal autonomy and regular elections.
The road ahead is not without peril. The dangers of rising debt loom large, with annual China-Pakistan Economic Corridor repayments of $3.5bn becoming due from 2026. Political risk is also elevated. The million-dollar question: can ongoing reforms survive electoral cycles and shifting coalitions? Climate vulnerability is another immediate threat, with adaptation funding still grossly insufficient.
The recently achieved economic stabilisation is only a beginning. Transformation demands moral courage, not just technical competence. It requires a break from the entrenched power asymmetries that have hollowed out the promise of both democracy and capitalism.
As inflation eases, so must inequality. As reserves grow, so must trust in institutions. The youth — 60pc of the population under 30 — are not waiting for another cycle of broken promises. They demand a new contract.

The above is a summary of a detailed answer, which, credit to the bot, also took into account the different ways unmanned use of AI could be harmful. Unfortunately, the majority of the people, companies and institutions keen on incorporating generative AI into their lives and work are not paying heed to this advice itself and omitting the “always” from “not always essential”.
Generative AI is no longer a new terminology or technology, and neither is its use. The ease of access to AI programmes is also not new; in fact, users don’t even have to go looking for it anymore as even a mundane Google search now thrusts an ‘AI Overview’ upon you right at the beginning — a feature that cannot be turned off.
 
 

What is new, and will remain so with the continuous development of the technology, is how its application is evolving and in majority cases, alarmingly so without taking stock of its legal and ethical implications, or its risks and limitations. It is only fair to think that AI and its capabilities can aid in efficient governance, medical research and practices, academic endeavours, business and technology — across all industries, really. But the notion of AI tools ‘saving’ time or money cannot be the driving force behind using them; the premise has to be whether they are actually improving productivity, quality and/or delivering intended results.

Pakistan is enthusiastic as to what AI can do, but the country has yet to formalise its National AI Policy.

Pakistan, like the rest of the world, is enthusiastic as to what AI can do, but the country has yet to formalise its National AI Policy which was drafted in May 2023 by the Ministry of IT & Telecom. More than two years later, the draft is still that: a draft. In the same time period, AI technology has witnessed leaps and bounds in its functions and adoption.
When the draft was shared, multiple groups, including the Digital Rights Foundation, had given feedback to improve its clauses. Debates over its contents — and the word in Islamabad is that there haven’t been many — have been kept out of public discourse. To think that government departments are not using AI tools in some way to assist with their work in the meantime is far-fetched, which begs the question as to what liberties might be being taken without any regard for the downsides, data privacy to name one.
Many countries have taken steps towards integrating AI consciously; the United Arab Emirates appointed an AI minister — the first ever — back in 2017. Kenya, in March this year, launched its National Artificial Intelligence Strategy (2025-2030), saying: “This is a commitment to shaping Kenya’s digital future. Kenya will not be a spectator; we will be architects of our digital destiny.” This is not to say that these are the metrics one needs to achieve for the ideal use of AI — these are the starting points.
Within industries, some in Pakistan have taken the initiative to use AI with policies in place. The Aga Khan University, for example, alongside a number of guidelines on the matter, has a dedicated AI Division to assist residents, fellows, research staff and faculty members.
A positive ruling also came from the judiciary in April, when a two-member Supreme Court bench acknowledged AI’s advantages, saying that it should support, not supplant, human judgement. The ruling mandated that the National Judicial Committee, in partnership with the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, establish clear guidelines for AI’s ethical and constitutional use. While progress has yet to be made in this regard, tying the use to a policy is still a very encouraging step. The State Bank of Pakistan is also actively working on finalising the guidelines for the responsible use of AI in financial services.
The media industry, however, is lagging even further behind our national AI policy. Most newsrooms don’t even have a draft of a policy or official guidelines but have okayed the use of AI tools. While alarm bells for verifying information or content via generative AI have been rung loud and clear, other risks such as biases — internalised by AI systems from their training data — and hallucinations are largely, if not completely, being ignored. Recently, a prominent media group’s Instagram page had a post on a story to do with black magic in Pakistan, and the AI image featured five women, warts and all, wearing black capes and pointed hats. Such a cliché and gender-biased visual representation of the story shouldn’t need a dedicated person to call it out but at least, if in place, such an authority could have caught it or set some guidelines for future use of the tool and prompt in question.
Companies are also missing the point that such departments will allow room for growth — innovation beyond AI’s obvious and open-to-all uses. At the speed with which generative AI tools are being incorporated, from organisations to individuals, it will only become harder to produce content that can stand apart. Comedian John Oliver’s noteworthy segment on “AI Slop” put it aptly: “Spread of AI generation tools has made it very easy to mass produce and flood social media sites with cheap, professional-looking, often deeply weird content.”
AI evolution is a reality that must be adopted, but questioning how that’s being done doesn’t make you a detractor. Also, using the argument that automated AI tools have always been a part of people’s lives and work operations is a weak and ignorant one, taking away from the fact that we’re now dealing with a much more sophisticated ‘live’ version of the technology that is continuously progressing. It’s only logical then that the same gusto with which we’re embracing a racing technology is shown for periodically updated policies and dedicated departments. After all, AI is not the problem, relying on it without guardrails is.

Most indicators of literacy, education, health, poverty, gender disparity and other aspects of human welfare have deteriorated in recent years, but these issues barely come up in parliamentary or public debate. The media too pays little attention to the human development deficit as the recent discussion of the budget lays bare. There has been virtually no focus in TV programmes on the abysmally low government spending on the social sector.
True, the country’s persistent macroeconomic crisis and rising debt burden have preoccupied governments and sharply limited the attention and resources directed to human development. But this reflects a failure to acknowledge that economic progress is intrinsically linked to investment in human capital. The country’s growth and development prospects are severely constrained by the lack of such investment. This has serious implications for Pakistan’s economic future.
The overall picture of various dimensions of human development remains exceedingly grim. The UNDP’s latest global Human Development Report of 2025 puts Pakistan in the ‘low’ human development category with a rank of 168 out of 193 countries in the Human Development Index. In its 2023 report Pakistan Human Capital Review, the World Bank says Pakistan faces a “silent, deep human capital crisis” which will adversely affect its future economic trajectory.
No issue is more important for the country’s future than the coverage and quality of education available to our children. Yet Pakistan still has the world’s second highest number of children, over 26 million (aged five to 16), out of school. Over half of them are girls. It means 45pc of children in this age group do not have access to school. This violates the obligation set out in Article 25A of the Constitution that enjoins the state to “provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of five to sixteen years”. Among children who go to school, drop-out rates remain high as does learning poverty.

Unless Pakistan invests in its people it cannot make meaningful economic progress.

In September 2024 on International Literacy Day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced an education emergency across the country and vowed to work with the provinces to get the 26m out-of-school children enrolled. This was the second time he declared an education emergency, having also done that in May 2024. This was an important recognition of what needed to be done, but nothing happened to translate these pious declarations into policy — a reminder that platitudes often substitute for policy.
Similarly, while the government’s ‘Uraan’ economic plan, announced last December, acknowledged the need for “urgent investment” in human capital, these words were not matched by policy action. In fact, federal and provincial government spending on education has plummeted to a new low of 0.8pc of GDP (from 2pc in 2018), which makes it among the lowest in South Asia.
No surprise then that literacy levels have shown little improvement in recent years. The latest Pakistan Economic Survey puts literacy at 60pc, which means 40pc of the population is illiterate. No country has achieved economic progress with this level of illiteracy. Given the population’s youth bulge, the education deficit has very troubling implications. Over two-thirds of the population are below age 30. That means the young will determine the country’s destiny. But if they are uneducated and unemployed, they face a hopeless future, which will jeopardise the country’s prospects. To reap the demographic dividend, Pakistan has to educate the young and equip them with skills. The youth bulge offers an opportunity for accelerated economic growth if the country makes the needed investment in human capital. Failure to do so will have far-reaching economic and social consequences.
The scale of poverty is also alarming. It has risen to 44pc according to the World Bank’s revised income thresholds. With anaemic growth, cost-of-living crisis and limited job creation, poverty has not only increased but become more severe. People living in extreme poverty has increased to 16.5pc of the population from 4.9pc.
Health indicators are equally disturbing. Expenditure on health, at 0.9pc of GDP, is abysmally low. A disturbing phenomenon and consequence of malnutrition is child stunting, which the Human Capital Review calls a “public health crisis”. The report finds around 40pc of Pakistani children under five are stunted — a shocking number. This condemns these children to a life of physical disability, poverty and deprivation and also exposes them to premature mortality. Stunting results from malnutrition, which is mainly associated with poverty.
Despite some modest gains, progress in gender empowerment has stalled. Gender gaps in education, health, access to employment, financial services, information, political and other opportunities, continue to be wide. Pakistan has plunged to the bottom in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2025, being ranked last among 148 countries. Female participation in the labour force remains low at around 22pc compared to over 80pc for males. This is among the lowest in Muslim countries and well below rates for countries at comparable income levels. It is a well-established fact that more women in the workforce helps economies grow and increases GDP per capita. This indicates how much needs to be done for gender empowerment.
Pakistan’s rapidly rising, unsustainable population growth, the highest in South Asia, also warrants the government’s attention. This is putting enormous pressure on the country’s scarce resources, physical infrastructure and shrinking job and educational opportunities at a time of economic difficulty. Population planning rarely figures in government priorities. A task force on population was established in 2018 on the Supreme Court’s directive. Headed by the president it has been non-functional for years. For it to be effective the PM needs to head and drive it. Unless Pakistan implements a comprehensive population planning policy, whose elements are well-known, a demographic disaster awaits the country.
This dismal picture of human development puts Pakistan’s future at risk. Economic growth and human development are mutually reinforcing. Unless significant investment is made in its people, the country cannot hope to achieve economic growth, boost productivity, build a skilled workforce and become globally competitive. Above all it cannot become a country its people aspire for and deserve.

The call is backed by major chambers of commerce and industry, as well as other leading trade bodies. For what it’s worth, the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry too has threatened to join the protest unless the government revokes what its leaders have termed ‘anti-business budgetary measures’. The opposition to the new measures cuts across the political divide among traders, underlining a wider consensus against documentation.
The contested provisions of the budget include powers of FBR officials to arrest taxpayers on allegations of fraud, depute taxmen at factory premises to check evasion, implement digital invoicing and e-billing, and penalise the use of cash for over Rs200,000 worth of business transactions, and other similar steps the government has taken to discourage the use of cash in transactions and check tax fraud.
Business leaders say those measures are impractical and unjustified, and will “push the businesses into informal economy”. According to them, harsh punitive actions had been introduced unilaterally, triggering widespread fear among traders, SMEs and manufacturers. None of the arguments offered by the protesting trade bodies and their leaders against new tax enforcement measures have a leg to stand on. Indeed, some of the measures introduced in the Finance Bill to raise taxes worth Rs389bn through enforcement may appear quite harsh.
However, there is no denying the utility of such measures in a country where the majority of businesses and wealthy individuals deliberately stay out of the tax net and short file returns to evade taxes. Pakistan is not the first nation to adopt such enforcement tactics in order to increase their low tax-to-GDP ratios. A major factor behind Pakistan’s abysmally low tax-to-GDP ratio of 10pc — one of the lowest in the region and the world — is unwillingness of most businesses and high-net worth individuals to become part of the tax net and pay their due.
It is, therefore, crucial to support any government action that aims at broadening the tax base, and punishes evasion and fraud in order to reduce the burden on compliant salaried individuals and corporate businesses. The government so far has resisted the traders opposed to enforcement measures. But it has a very poor track record of staying the course of tough decisions that affect the ruling party’s core political base. Given its past record of buckling under pressure from politically influential trader lobbies, there is concern that backing down now would derail tax reform efforts for years to come.

The recent power division data shows that the debt has grown to nearly Rs2.4 trillion as of March 2025, straining the power sector and putting enormous pressure on the country’s broader fiscal landscape. Past attempts to resolve circular debt, which mostly revolved around frequent upward tariff adjustments or sporadic bailout packages, have failed due to the power sector’s underlying inefficiencies.
 
 

The latest attempt involves significant resolution of circular debt stock, even if the flow remains a looming threat, through bank borrowings of Rs1.29tr, comprising Rs683 billion as the largest restructuring of power sector debt sitting on bank balance sheets and Rs612bn as the largest ever fresh “syndicated financing”.
Collectively, according to the Pakistan Banks Association (PBA), this represents the largest banking transaction in Pakistan’s history, nearly 4.5 times bigger than the previous largest transaction.
Initially, some of the participating banks were not happy with the deal because they had to agree to a 135 basis point reduction in their rate both for the restructured and new debt, closing the new facility to Kibor minus 90 bps. Some were unhappy because their balance sheets are suddenly laden with what they call “risky power sector debt”, as the government has decided to spread the debt among 18 banks according to the size of their share in the total bank deposits. But that is water under the bridge now.
Many in the power sector and the banking industry consider the liquidation of debt as a “departure from the old cycle of borrowings and patchwork solutions”. PBA chairman Zafar Masud, who played a key role in negotiations with the government, notes that more than half of the Rs1.29tr debt is already on the banks’ books. It’s been sitting there for a while and currently lacks identifiable cash flows to support its repayment.

Fresh efforts tackling the recurring circular debt offer cautious optimism that might finally steer the country out of its power problems

“Now cash flow in the shape of an already existing debt service surcharge (DSS) in the electricity bills will be utilised by the lending banks to recover loan repayments at source. There’ll be no new burden on consumers, and the deal will help in clearing up all the new and old debt in the next four to six years, depending on where the interest rates stand. The lower the interest rates, the quicker the payment of this debt,” he said.
The government has indeed taken some steps to control leakages, improve governance, enforce cash flow discipline, and ring-fence funds to pay the sector debt. The finance ministry’s decision to redirect the Rs3.23/kWh DSS solely towards debt reduction, rather than letting it disappear into the general pool, reflects fiscal prudence.
“This time reforms go beyond temporary bailouts. There is an emerging focus on plugging systemic leakages, enforcing timely payments across the supply chain and rethinking subsidy structure to reach the vulnerable without distorting the entire revenue cycle. Enhanced governance in Discos [distribution companies] and technology-led oversight using digital monitoring tools are being rolled out to cut theft and line losses — the chronic ailments that have drained the sector for decades,” Mr Masud observes.
Nonetheless, he cautions, “This is not the end, only a breather. Nepra [National Electric Power Regulatory Authority] warns that average utilisation of the 45,888 MW installed generation capacity remains just 34 per cent, and even peak utilisation is a mere 56pc. Consumers continue to pay for idle capacity while distribution companies remain plagued by infrastructure decay, theft, inflated billing and dismally low recoveries.

While the debt stock has been resolved at this point in time, the flow must stop going into the future — circular debt is not a disease in itself; it is a symptom of a broken system

This is exactly what worries most power sector experts. “We have been down this road before. In 2013, the PML-N government paid Rs480bn to clear outstanding circular debt, only for it to start accumulating again shortly after, because the root causes remained unaddressed,” Tahir Basharat Cheema, a former Pakistan Electric Power Company chief, had told this correspondent shortly after the government had begun negotiations with banks.
Giving details of the deal, the PBA chief says all credit goes to Pakistan’s banking industry for demonstrating professionalism and commitment to the national economy. “Banks stepped up, taking a larger view of the economic revival, knowing that healthier power sector cash flows will reduce financial risks and unlock growth opportunities for banks themselves.”
If rates fall further, the debt repayments will accelerate, freeing up the banks’ balance sheets, releasing sovereign guarantee headroom for priority sector financing, and reviving liquidity within the power sector itself. Power companies could now gain room to invest in upgrades, efficiency, and financial discipline, while banks can redeploy freed capital into productive lending for small and medium enterprises, agriculture, green energy, and industrial revival.
However, Mr Masud urges: “Let us be clear-eyed: the real battle is far from over. While the debt stock has been resolved at this point in time, the flow must stop going into the future. If we lose momentum, if the governance reforms stall, if privatisation of Discos remains shelved, if distribution efficiency improvements and collections falter, we will end up back where we started. Circular debt is not a disease in itself; it is a symptom of a broken system. The power sector crisis was not created overnight, nor will it be resolved overnight.”
While challenges remain, the momentum generated by the fresh efforts offers hope that the country, grappling with the repeated energy shortages and economic pressure, might finally steer out of the recurring power debt spiral.
The success of this initiative will hinge on rigorous implementation and sustained oversight. If the current roadmap holds, there is cautious optimism that the power sector could emerge as a case study in structural turnaround rather than a perennial fiscal liability.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday threw months of painstaking negotiations into disarray by announcing that he would hammer the 27-nation bloc with the sweeping tariffs if no agreement is reached by Aug 1.
“The United States has sent us a letter with measures that would come into effect unless there is a negotiated solution, so we will therefore also extend the suspension of our countermeasures until early August,” von der Leyen told journalists.
“At the same time, we will continue to prepare for the countermeasures so we’re fully prepared,” she added.
The move by von der Leyen will spur hope that Trump’s latest threat — in which he also targeted Mexico — has not killed off the progress made in negotiations so far between Brussels and Washington.

27-nation bloc also announces ‘political agreement’ with Indonesia on trade deal

Brussels has readied duties on US goods worth around 21 billion euros ($24 billion) in response to the levies Trump slapped on metal imports earlier this year.
But it announced in April it was holding off on those measures to give space to find a broader trade agreement with the Trump administration.
‘Hand remains outstretched’
EU trade ministers are set to meet on Monday in Brussels to discuss the bloc’s response to Trump’s latest move — and crucially, how strong a line to take with Washington.
Germany’s finance minister Lars Klingbeil said on Sunday that “serious and solution-oriented negotiations” with the US were still necessary, but added that if they fail, the European Union would need “decisive countermeasures to protect jobs and businesses in Europe”.
“Our hand remains outstretched, but we won’t accept just anything,” Klingbeil told the daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
Since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has unleashed sweeping stop-start tariffs on allies and competitors alike, roiling financial markets and raising fears of a global economic downturn.
But his administration is coming under pressure to secure deals with trading partners after promising a flurry of agreements.
So far, US officials have only unveiled two pacts, with Britain and Vietnam, alongside temporarily lower tit-for-tat duties with China.
EU-Indonesia ‘political agreement’
Meanwhile, the European Commission president and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday announced a “political agreement” to conclude a long-awaited free trade deal.
“We’re living in turbulent times, and when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together. So today we’re taking a big step forward in this partnership,” von der Leyen told journalists in Brussels.
“I am very pleased to report that we have just reached a political agreement on an ambitious Free Trade Agreement,” she said.
A European Commission statement called Sunday’s agreement a “decisive milestone” towards striking the deal — which is to be concluded in September by EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic and Indonesia’s chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto.
“There’s a lot of untapped potential in our trade relationship. And therefore, this agreement comes at the right time, because the new agreement will open new markets,” von der Leyen said.
Prabowo called the announcement in Brussels a “breakthrough”.

• Absence of quorum potentially leaves water body’s decisions open to audit objections, legal challenges
LAHORE: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), one of the country’s largest state-owned entities with a portfolio of almost $70 billion, has found itself mired in red tape in the absence of key decision-making officials.
The failure to fill two vacant slots on its governing body despite the passage of nine months, has hampered its operations.
This bureaucratic paralysis is particularly worrisome, given that Wapda is currently tasked with executing three of the biggest hydroelectric projects in the country’s history — the dams at Diamer-Bhasha, Dasu and Mohmand.
In addition, the authority effectively serves as the operative wing of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa), which distributes water among federating units and ensure national irrigation supplies.
Ironically, Irsa too is embroiled in litigation over the composition of its board, with the appointment of a permanent member from Sindh being the focus of the dispute.
The Wapda Act envisions a governing body, comprising three permanent members — for water, power and finance — and a regular chairman heading the authority, which looks after hundreds of billions of rupees allocations every year.
Currently, the body is without permanent members for water and power, and their functions are being “looked after” by two senior officials — Syed Ali Akhtar Shah and Muhammad Arfan, respectively.
The former previously served as General Manager Water (South), while the latter is also the CEO of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Company.
‘Look after’ charge
By its very definition, ‘look after’ charge implies that the current holder of the post cannot take “financial and administrative decisions” of any consequence — much like a caretaker government.
In June, when former chairman retired Lt-Gen Sajjad Ghani stepped down, the sole permanent member, Naveed Asghar Chaudhry, was given additional charge of that role too. Mr Chaudhry’s original designation is member for finance, and he is a permanent appointee on that post.
This means that, effectively, the four-member board is currently operating with one permanent officer and two who have been given ‘additional charge’.
Mr Chaudhry also served as the interim Wapda chairman in 2022, after retired Lt-Gen Muzammil Hussain resigned due to “personal reasons”. He then passed the role to Lt-Gen Ghani three months later.
According to a former director general of human resources at Wapda, “This is administrative chaos with a huge national cost”. For instance, the authority at present cannot meet even its quorum requirements – a legal necessity for taking any decision.
For quorum to be complete, the chairman and at least one regular member are required to be present, but these posts are currently held by the same person.
In such a situation, any decision taken by the board can potentially attract audit objections or legal challenges.
Blame game
Dawn made several attempts to contact Muhammad Moeen Wattoo, the incumbent federal minister for water resources, over the course of two weeks.
However, both the minister and his spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the composition of Wapda’s governing body.
But insiders told Dawn that the tenure of the two members for water and power expired in November last year.
Sources claimed the ministry was also informed of this in advance, and an advertisement to fill both posts was sent to the ministry for approval in October 2024. However, the ministry has not advertised the posts, nor allowed Wapda to do so, they said.
The outgoing members, meanwhile, were reportedly instructed to remain in their posts. This arrangement continued till March 13, 2025, when they eventually relinquished their posts on verbal instructions from on-high, after the ministry inquired about the expiry of their tenures. After that, the authority gave ‘look after’ charge of the two vacant posts to two senior officers.
Wapda sources claimed they kept pressing the ministry for the appointments, but to no avail. It was in the midst of this confusion that the previous chairman abruptly quit on June 20.
Following his exit, the ministry handed his responsibilities to the only surviving permanent member (finance) of the authority.
The ministry, however, shifted the blame for blocked appointments onto the PM’s Office. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official from the water resources ministry told Dawn that selection boards were named to hire these officers and sent the PMO, but there had been no response.
The ministry was subsequently told that the names of the selection board members had been sent for “vetting” and the process is still ongoing.

• Boat ‘Handala’ with 15 activists on board carrying medical and food  supplies
• No breakthrough in talks for temporary ceasefire
SICILY/GAZA: A Gaza-bound boat carrying pro-Palestinian activists and humanitarian aid left Sicily on Sunday, over a month after Israel detained and deported people aboard a previous vessel, as Israel struck 150 times across Gaza in the past 24 hours, killing more than 40 Palestinians, most of them civilians, amid a deadlock in ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas.
The Handala boat, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, left the port of Syracuse shortly after 12pm carrying about 15 activists.
Several dozen people, some holding Palestinian flags and others wearing keffiyeh scarves, gathered at the port to cheer the boat’s departure with slogans of “Free Palestine”.
 






The former Norwegian trawler — loaded with medical supplies, food, children’s equipment and medicine — will sail for about a week in the Mediterranean, covering roughly 1,800 kilometres (1,120 miles), in the hope of reaching Gaza’s coast.
The boat will make a stop at Gallipoli, in southeastern Italy, where two members of the hard-left France Unbowed party (LFI) are expected to join.
The initiative comes six weeks after the departure of the Madleen, another ship that left Italy for Gaza transporting aid and activists, including Greta Thunberg.
Israel authorities intercepted the Madleen about 185 kilometres west of Gaza’s coast.
“This is a mission for the children in Gaza, to break the humanitarian blockade and to break the summer silence on the genocide,” said Gabrielle Cathala, one of the two France Unbowed party members set to board the boat on July 18.
“I hope we will reach Gaza but if not, it will be yet another violation of international law” by Israel, she added.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes on Sunday killed more than 40 Palestinians, most of them women and children, including at a market and a water distribution point, as talks for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas stalled.
Delegations from Israel and the Palestinian group have now spent a week trying to agree on a temporary truce to halt 21 months of devastating fighting in the Gaza Strip.
But on Saturday, each side accused the other of blocking attempts to secure an agreement at the indirect talks in the Qatari capital, Doha.
On the ground, civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said at least 43 people were killed in the latest Israeli strikes, including 11 when a market in Gaza City was hit.
Elsewhere, eight children were among the 10 victims of a drone
strike at a water point in the Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza, Bassal said.
Khaled Rayyan told journalists he was woken by the sound of two large explosions after a house was hit in Nuseirat.
“Our neighbour and his children were under the rubble,” he said.
150 targets in a day
The Israeli military said in a statement its air force struck 150 times across Gaza in the past 24 hours. It released aerial footage of what it said were fighter jet strikes attacking what it claimed Hamas targets around Beit Hanoun, in northern Gaza, showing explosions on the ground and thick smoke in the sky.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing many areas mean journalists are unable to independently verify tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency and other parties.
Talks to seal a 60-day ceasefire and Israeli prisoner release were in the balance on Saturday, as Israel and Hamas accused each other of trying to block a deal.
Hamas wants complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, but Israel had presented plans to maintain troops in more than 40 per cent of the territory.
A Palestinian source said Israel wanted to force hundreds of thousands of Palestinians into the south of Gaza in preparation for forcibly displacing them to Egypt or other countries.
Hamas-run Gaza’s health ministry says that at least 57,882 Palestinians, most of them women and children, have been killed in Israel attacks. The UN considers the figures reliable.

• KP CM claims party will decide after three months ‘whether to continue with politics’
• Days after founder eschewed talks, Gandapur claims Imran ready to sit with powers that be
LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by PTI founder Imran Khan, which is expected to climax on Aug 5, marking two years of the former PM’s imprisonment.
At a press conference on Sunday, where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, CM Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’.
Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of  Imran Khan and his spouse, CM Gandapur said that the 90-day countdown had already begun.
However, the mixed messages left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether.
At the press conference, the KP CM appeared to surprise even his party colleagues when he said, “The protest campaign had started last night and would reach its crescendo in 90 days for a final showdown”.
The KP CM did not mention any date, but when quizzed by reporters, he reiterated the party’s position that the protest campaign would be taken to its peak by Aug 5 using political means.
“We have to decide within 90 days whether we should even do politics in this country… if [political means] do not lead to a result, then we will let you know about our plan of action that will come forward,” he said, adding that he had given himself three months to prepare for the protest.
“We will either do or die,” the KP CM said, adding there was no use of politics in the country as “there is no politics”.
Dissent from Aliya
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik was conspicuous by her absence from the presser. While PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja explained that she was “busy”, Ms Malik questioned this claim in a subsequent tweet.
“What strategy has been announced for the release of Imran Khan, how and where the protest campaign will begin? Who replaced the Aug 5 plan with 90 days?”
“I myself do not know where I was busy for the past two days,” she said, in a jibe at Mr Raja.
Some PTI workers also said that it appeared as if the party had let them off the hook for the Aug 5 protest. Some voices also questioned why the party leadership had yet to announce a proper plan for the movement, given that Aug 5 was just a few weeks away, and wondered whether this meant the protest plan had been postponed.
‘Door open for talks’
Even though the idea of dialogue was shunned in a tweet from Imran Khan’s official X account last week, the KP chief minister, apparently on behalf of the former premier, once again offered the military establishment to engage in dialogue with the party.
“Now we are giving an open offer (to the establishment) to hold dialogue with us or we will get to ‘tread on our own path’ with clear timeline and targets”.
He also criticised the powers that be for indulging in politics. Reiterating that the establishment had hijacked the system, the KP CM said the PTI would hold dialogue with the powers that be and went on to add that “they can let the (puppet) politicians sit beside them”.
“We no longer want to waste time talking to the ruling politicians, who carry no power to make a decision,” he added.
While the PTI has consistently been demanding talks with the establishment, these overtures have not received a positive response from the concerned quarters thus far.
The KP CM also blamed state institutions for a spike in terrorism in Balochistan and KP.
“When it is asked about making and breaking governments, it simply says the institution is apolitical,” he quipped, while asking the establishment to accept its mistakes and rectify them. He said the army was earning a ‘bad reputation’, and asked where it wanted to take the country.

• Flood protection wall found encroaching on river bed, gave tourists ‘false sense of security’
• Provincial Inspection Team advocates inquiries over illegal constructions in Swat since 2010
PESHAWAR: It was a race against time: every second, every minute counted as the lives of over a dozen tourists stranded in the midst of a raging deluge hung by a thread.
“The window of time was narrow”, noted the three-member inquiry committee in its report on the tragic drowning of thirteen vacationers at Khwazakhela, Swat.
What unfolded subsequently was a tragedy of unspeakable proportions, with men, women and children being swept away by raging waters as onlookers watched helplessly from the riverbank.
The committee’s report presents a detailed, minute-by-minute account of the incident, incorporating statements from officials, eyewitnesses, and survivors, as well as contents of WhatsApp messages exchanged during the crisis.
Based on the efforts by the Provincial Inspection Team (PIT) to uncover the facts behind the tragedy of June 27, the provincial government released a statement summarising the committee’s findings. However, the devil lies in the details.
The 63-page report reveals systematic failure, the highest levels of incompetence, inefficiency, criminal negligence and even land grabbing, that led to the loss of precious human lives. In hindsight, had the appropriate systems been in place, those poor souls might have been saved.
The report noted with concern “deeply embedded failures in disaster preparedness, regulatory enforcement, institutional oversight and emergency response mechanisms.”
Failures
Rescue 1122 emerges as the primary accused in this tragic incident: the district emergency officer was absent from duty and had left the station without prior approval, leaving an operational vacuum.
Furthermore, two individuals recru­ited as drivers were informally performing the duties of divers. In a shocking revelation, pointing to politically-motivated recruitments in this critical life-saving department, one of the divers was said to be afraid of water.
“Recruitment practices appear to be flawed, with non-technical individuals appoi­nted to specialised roles. One such individual, reportedly hydrophobic, was appointed as a diver”, the report noted.
One driver failed to report for duty on that eventful day, but was still marked present, while the other did not show up at all.
The water rescue vehicle and ambulance were dispatched without a diver. Only after realising the gravity of the situation did the ambulance leave the site to pick up one of the “divers” — who was actually a driver.
The staff also discovered the rope was too short and that they didn’t have the throw-gun, life jackets and floatation equipment.
In a crisis where every minute was counted, 38 minutes were wasted back and forth to pick up divers and arrange jaala (net) and a local rubber boat, which took another six minutes to assemble and move about a kilometre upstream for launch.
The call recording system at the Rescue-1122 in Swat, had been “deliberately” turned off. The official in charge claimed it was done on orders from his senior, to protect equipment from lightning and thunderstorms. However, the committee said it was done to avoid any post-event accountability.
The Early Warning System was also not functional, while the official responsible for recording the river flow levels delayed reporting by four hours – during which the water flow surged from 6,738 cusecs to a staggering 77,782 cusecs.
The secretary of the irrigation department informed the committee that out of the 131 gauges installed throughout the province, only 22 were equipped with a telemetry system.
Shockingly, the telemetry gauges at Khwazakhela and Shamozai — both critical for flood forecasting — were found non-functional at the time of the tragic incident.
Encroachment
The committee also detailed gross negligence on the part of a major contractor working on an Asian Development Bank-funded Emergency Flood Assistance Project (EFAP). The contractor had constructed a bund roughly 200 feet upstream from the site of the tragedy.
This temporary diversion gave tourists the false impression that the area was outside the active river channel — which it was not.
“The bund was raised using loose riverbed material during peak monsoon season in blatant violation of basic engineering norms and safety protocols. No safety signage, barriers, or cordoning were installed at construction site.”
Further, the flood protection wall was found to encroach deep into the riverbed, narrowing the river’s natural flow. The committee cited locals claiming, this appeared to a deliberate attempt to grab precious land.
The wall spanned approximately 850 meters. If it intruded even 100 feet into the riverbed, the reclaimed area would equal about 278,880 square feet. At the prevailing market rate of Rs20,000 per square foot, this translates into an estimated Rs5.57 billion worth of potentially commercial land.
The committee found that the land revenue records had been altered and pages changed.
“The sheer scale of financial incentive, coupled with a clear violation of zoning regulations and river protection ordinances, raises serious concerns about speculative land encroachment under the guise of public infrastructure,” the report stated.
The committee apportioned the blame of illegal encroachment on the district administration and the Tehsil Municipal Administration for ignoring and facilitating regularisation of illegal structures since 2010.
Administration
The committee further said the district administration failed to initiate or coordinate rescue efforts, while the police did not take timely action to keep tourists away from the river.
The tourism department, too, was found to be entirely absent. It failed to regulate or manage tourist safety, did not licence hotels as required, and its helpline remained unknown and unused.
The hotel, which was used by the tourists to access the river, the committee said, was constructed in clear violation by encroaching on the riverbed without No Objection Certificate (NOC) or approved building plan.
While recommending a slew of recommendations to introduce regulatory and legislative framework to overcome judicial restraint, arrest illegal encroachment, mining and overcome institutional weaknesses and lapses, the committee also called for inquiry against all DCs in Swat and TMA officers posted in Babuzai since 2010 and other officers.
A detailed audit and investigation of the EFAP was also proposed to determine whether the project’s design was feasible and whether it encroached upon the riverbed. An inquiry, it said, might also be conducted into the non-functioning of the early warning system in Swat district.

Amid reports of a possible change of PTI-led government in KP, a PML-N source told Dawn that Mr Kundi has planned a meeting of opposition leaders at Governor House soon.
The Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam-F (JUI-F) has opposed any change of provincial government through a presidential order, Governor’s Rule, but did not rule out a constitutional and parliamentary way like a ‘no-confidence motion’, JUI-F leader Maulana Ghafoor Haideri said on Sunday.
The source said Gover­nor Kundi and Amir Muqam discussed the possible change in KP as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a committee to seek the support of oppo­sition leaders in the province to achieve the goal.
 
 

Meanwhile, Mr Kundi visited the residence of former PTI leader and incumbent adviser to the PM Pervez Khattak to condole the death of his sister.
A few days ago, the governor also met JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
Mr Kundi also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently, followed by the issuance of a press release stating that the PM tasked Mr Kundi with starting a campaign to form a new government in KP and hold consultations with opposition members of the provincial assembly. Both Mr Kundi and Mr Muqam had been tasked with meeting JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman for further consultations.
Last week, Opposition Leader in the Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Assembly Dr Ibadullah visited Governor Kundi. The meeting, which was also attended by PPP’s KP chapter president Mohammad Ali Shah Bacha, discussed overall political situation in the province.
Media reports said that Dr Ibad had briefed the governor on the ongoing coordination and mutual engagement among members of the opposition parties.
The two leaders also exchanged views on the recent outreach by independent members of the provincial assembly and discussed the upcoming Senate elections.

• Legislation says shift necessitated by ‘changing dynamics of national security’; allows for countrywide deployment of Federal Constabulary
• Force to have dedicated division for special protection and riot control
ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to transform the Frontier Constabulary (FC), a border security force, into the Federal Constabulary to maintain law and order, supplement the law enforcement agencies, and address the diverse security needs in a coordinated manner.
Soon after the promulgation of the ordinance, the Law and Justice Division issued an official notification to this effect. According to the ordinance, the Frontier Consta­bulary was originally established to maintain law and order in frontier and border areas, ensuring the security of these critical regions, and preserving public peace in remote territories.
However, the changing dynamics of national security, the increasing frequency of emergencies, natural disasters, civil unrest, and other emerging threats necessitated a more adaptable and versatile force to respond to such challenges.
“As the Senate and the National Assembly are not in session and the President of the Islamic Repu­blic of Pakistan is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate act­ion,” the ordinance said. The ordi­nance called the Frontier Cons­tabulary (Re-organization) Ordi­nance, 2025, came into force at once.
A former interior secretary told Dawn that the ordinance gave complete and legitimate authority to the federal government to use FC across the country and for any purpose, in the name of security.
He said the Frontier Consta­bulary was first deployed in Kara­chi about 25 years ago and then it was used in the federal capital. Later, it was deployed in Gilgit-Baltistan for the protection of the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) and major dam projects.
Before this ordinance, the use of force by the government for VIP security often attracted criticism, but now, under the name of protecting “escort”, the force can be freely used for the personal security of the elite.
The ordinance said that the force would be headed by an inspector general to be appointed by the federal government. The FC, it said, be used as a reserve force, to perform specialised duties in aid of the Islamabad Capital Territory Police, provincial police forces, and other security and law enforcement forces and agencies.
The Federal Constabulary shall be under the overall command of the inspector general, who shall be assisted by additional inspectors general, deputy inspectors general, and assistant inspectors general and such other officers of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP), as may be appointed in the prescribed manner. It shall comprise two divisions, namely the Security Division and the Federal Reserve Division.
The structure of the Federal Constabulary shall comprise wings, companies and platoons, commanded by officers of the rank of superintendent of police, assistant superintendent of police, or deputy superintendent of police, inspector, sub-inspector, and assistant sub-inspector, respectively.
 
 

The FC’s Security Division shall comprise the existing strength of the Frontier Constabulary and shall consist exclusively of the personnel appointed through the traditional system as prescribed by regulations.
There shall be a dedicated division for anti-riot and special protection in the Federal Constabulary called the Federal Reserve Division. The Federal Constabulary shall have the powers as enshrined in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898), Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 (XXVII of 1997), the Police Order, 2002 (Chief Executive’s Order No. 22 of 2002) and any other law for the time being in force.
Shifting all powers
In addition to such powers, the federal government may, by general or special order, confer or impose upon any member of the Federal Constabulary any of the powers or duties conferred or imposed on a police officer of any class or grade by any enactment for the time being in force.
The ordinance also shifts all powers and assets of the Frontier Constabulary to the Federal Constabulary, as it said: “Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force all members and employees of the Frontier Constabulary serving in the defunct Frontier Constabulary immediately before the commencement of this ordinance, immediately after the commencement of this ordinance shall stands transferred to the Federal Constabulary reconstituted under this ordinance on same terms and conditions as applicable to them before commencement of this ordinance.”
“All assets and liabilities of the Frontier Constabulary, of whatever nature and wherever situated, shall, upon commencement of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance stand transferred to and vest in the Federal Constabulary,” it added.
“All rules, regulations, notifications, and orders made or issued under the Frontier Constabulary Act, 1915, insofar as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Federal Constabulary Ordinance, shall be deemed to have been made or issued under the corresponding provisions of the Federal Constabulary,” the ordinance said.

The two sides met for more than two hours on the weekend. The meeting, chaired by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan,  was also attended by Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar.
The meeting was a follow-up to Friday’s huddle, where both sides agreed to resolve issues through talks after days of acrimony and recriminations.
The PTI lawmakers were suspended for 15 sittings after their protest during the speech of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on June 27.
In addition, 10 members of the provincial assembly were fined Rs200,000 each for “damaging public property”, while disqualification references were also filed against them.
A number of treasury members had also moved for their opposition colleagues’ disqualification. It was these applications which were the subject of Sunday’s discussions.
‘Not a deadlock’
Speaking to the media after Sunday’s meeting, Mr Bhachar acknowledged the talks had not been fruitful so far.
He clarified that neither side had apologised for any verbal altercations, noting that “insults came from both sides.”
He emphasised that more meetings will take place and “no agreement has been reached on any point,” particularly concerning the Rules of Procedure of the House.
“A deadlock means walking away. Until there is no agreement, discussions will continue,” he stated.
He confirmed that discussions on the fines and suspension of the 26 members would also continue.
The PTI leader also talked about the persisting concerns of his party, including legal cases against opposition members and the imprisonment of Imran Khan, which “will not end immediately”.
He said PTI will move forward after consulting with the parliamentary party.
The meeting came a day after PTI’s top leadership, including Khyber Pakh–tunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, arrived in Lahore to support the penalised lawmakers.
Mutual respect
PML-N leader Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman said the two-and-a-half-hour-long talks had been “good”, but nothing was finalised yet.
Mr Rehman, who’s also Punjab’s finance minister, emphasised the importance of upholding the assembly’s dignity.
“There is much to discuss with the opposition,” Mr Rehman said, adding the people of Punjab were watching these negotiations.
He acknowledged public pressure from constituencies to end “hooliganism, verbal abuse,  and violent culture” within the assembly.
He indicated that PTI would consult with its parliamentary party, and the government would also hold consultations before the two sides reconvene for future talks.
“Our goal is not to de-seat anyone,” he said, adding negotiations among elected representatives “should lead to a point of agreement”.
He revealed that four or five agenda points were discussed and agreed upon during Sunday’s meeting.
Regarding the reference against the suspended members, Mr Rehman said the speaker had sent the reference as per articles 62 and 63.
He compared the speaker’s move to the reference against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif under Articles 62 and 63, which led to the loss of his premiership.
He also mentioned a harassment complaint received by the speaker, clarifying the current discussions were about assembly rules and not a compromise.
He hoped the situation inside the assembly matters would soon improve.
“The assembly rules and law stipulate how punishment and reward are meted out,” he said, adding both opposition and government should play a role in running the House smoothly.
Bilal Yasin, another PML-N lawmaker, also addressed the media.
He said PML-N leaders have trained party workers to engage in political dialogue with politicians.
Mr Yasin said CM Maryam also wants things to “move forward”.
However, he added that being CM Maryam, should be treated with respect whenever she entered the assembly.
Similar respect was also “obligatory” for the opposition leader.
He said protest was a democratic right, but agitations should be “within some limits”.

Of 24 sewage samples tested, 13 were negative while 11 were positive for poliovirus, an official of the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the NIH said. 
The progress, especially in high-risk areas, was hailed as a sign of successful eradication efforts. 
“Environmental Surveillance (ES) results continue to reflect encouraging progress, particularly in high-risk regions.” the official said. 
“In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), positivity rates have declined from 14 positive ES sites in January to seven in June 2025. 
Of these seven positive sites in June, four are from south KP. Notably, all six sites in Peshawar tested negative for the first time in over two years.” 
Similar progress was reported across other provinces. 
“Balochistan also reported a marked reduction, with only four positive ES sites in June, down from 19 in January. In the Quetta Block, six out of seven samples tested negative,” the official said. 
“In Punjab, the number of districts with positive detections decreased from seven in January to five in June. In Sindh, the number of positive ES sites has also declined compared to previous months.” 
Officials attributed the declining numbers to intensified surveillance and immunisation campaigns. 
“Thanks to high-quality campaigns with rigorous vaccination schedule, polio cases and positive environmental samples nationwide have declined,” the official said. 
To build on this momentum, several targeted immunisation drives are scheduled. 
A special campaign will run from July 14 to 18 in Diamer and three districts of KP, targeting 158,497 children. A similar drive in Rawalpindi and Islamabad next week aims to immunise 161,422 children. 
A cross-border effort with Afghanistan will take place from July 21 to 25, targeting 378,122 children in bordering union councils to synchronise with Afghanis­tan’s sub-national polio campaign. 
Also, a campaign using a combination of fractional inactivated poliovirus vaccine and oral poliovirus vaccine will be conducted in seven districts of Baloc­histan from Aug 4 to 11, aiming to vaccinate approximately 600,000 children.

The world number one is the first Italian to win at the All England Club and now has four Grand Slams to his name at the age of 23.
The tennis world has been captivated by the emergence of the new rivalry to follow the storied “Big Three” era of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic.
Sinner and two-time defending Wimbledon champion Alcaraz have now shared the past seven Grand Slam titles between them, with the Italian winning four of those.
Defeat in Paris last month was a bitter blow for Sinner, who led by two sets and squandered three match points in the final.
Prior to Sunday’s victory, he had lost five consecutive times against Alcaraz, including the final of the Italian Open in the first tournament he played after returning from a three-month doping ban.
But this time, he turned the tables in impressive fashion.
Both players were solid on serve until the fifth game, when Alcaraz sprayed a forehand long to hand Sinner the first break of the match.
But the Spaniard levelled at 4-4 to the delight of the Centre Court crowd, which included Prince William and his wife Catherine, Princess of Wales.
Sinner double-faulted to hand Alcaraz a second set point.
The Italian laced a searing forehand down the line, but Alcaraz produced a magical backhand winner, pointing his finger to his ear as the crowd rose to their feet.
Momentum shift
Sinner, still wearing a protective white sleeve after his nasty fall in his fourth-round match against Grigor Dimitrov, broke in the first game of the second set and led 3-1 after play was briefly halted by a flying cork.
Sinner shook his racket after winning the first point as he served for the set and was rewarded with cheers before levelling the match with a whipped forehand.
The third set was a tense affair that went with serve until the ninth game when Sinner broke as Alcaraz slipped over on the baseline, and he went 2-1 up.
The momentum was now all with Sinner and he broke again in the third game of the fourth set to take the match by the scruff of the neck.
The chance was always there that Alcaraz would produce the magic he found at Roland Garros, but Sinner stayed ice-cool.
The Spaniard had two break points to hit back in the eighth game, but Sinner shut the door impressively.
Sinner stepped up to serve for the championship amid a cacophony of noise, staying focused to seal the deal on his second championship point.
The Italian cruised through the first three rounds at Wimbledon, losing just 17 games — equalling an Open era record set in 1972. But he got lucky in the fourth round against inspired Bulgarian 19th seed Dimitrov, who was leading by two sets when he suffered an injury that forced him to quit.
Sinner got back into the groove against 10th seed Ben Shelton in the quarter-finals before demolishing seven-time champion Djokovic in the last four.
Alcaraz had been aiming to become just the fifth man in the Open era to win three consecutive Wimbledons after Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Federer and Djokovic.</p><small>2025-07-13 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13230410bf546a1.jpg?r=233528' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923959/inexcusable-failures-led-to-trump-assassination-attempt-us-senate-report' target='_blank'><strong>‘Inexcusable’ failures led to Trump assassination attempt: US Senate report</strong></a><br><p>A congressional inquiry into the attempt to assassinate US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally a year ago lamented on Sunday “inexcusable” failures in the Secret Service’s operations and response and called for more serious disciplinary action.
On July 13, 2024, a gunman shot the then-Republican presidential candidate during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing his ear.
One bystander was killed and two other people, in addition to Trump, were wounded before a government sniper killed the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Crooks.
“What happened was inexcusable, and the consequences imposed for the failures so far do not reflect the severity of the situation,” said the report released by the US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
The dramatic incident energised Trump’s bid to return to the White House, with his campaign using a photo of him bloodied and pumping his fist as he was hurried offstage to woo voters.
The report did not shed new light on the gunman’s motive, which still remains a mystery, but accused the Secret Service of “a cascade of preventable failures that nearly cost President Trump his life.”
“The United States Secret Service failed to act on credible intelligence, failed to coordinate with local law enforcement,” said the committee’s Republican chairman, Rand Paul.
“Despite those failures, no one has been fired,” he added. “It was a complete breakdown of security at every level—fueled by bureaucratic indifference, a lack of clear protocols, and a shocking refusal to act on direct threats.
“We must hold individuals accountable and ensure reforms are fully implemented so this never happens again.”
‘Mistakes were made’
The Secret Service cited communication, technical and human errors and said reforms were underway, including on coordination between different law enforcement bodies and establishment of a division dedicated to aerial surveillance.
Six unidentified staff members have been disciplined, according to the agency. The punishments range from 10 to 42 days’ suspension without pay, and all six were put into restricted or non-operational positions.
Reflecting on the assassination attempt earlier this week, Trump said “mistakes were made” but that he was satisfied with the investigation.
In an interview with his daughter-in-law on Fox News’ ‘My View with Lara Trump’, Trump said the sniper “was able to get him from a long distance with one shot. If he didn’t do that, you would have had an even worse situation.”
“It was unforgettable,” Trump said of the events.
“I didn’t know exactly what was going on. I got whacked. There’s no question about that. Fortunately, I got down quickly. People were screaming.”</p><small>2025-07-13 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613851-pti-expels-five-mnas-for-voting-in-favour-of-26th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>PTI expels five MNAs for voting in favour of 26th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Khanzala Quraishi, spokesperson for the Bannu Regional Police Officer, told Dawn.com that the Chairman of the Betani Qaumi Tehreek, Inamullah Khan, was returning from a weekly protest in the Pul Ahmadzai area when his vehicle was hit by an IED planted on Tejori road.
“Inamullah survived the attack,” Quraishi said. “However, initial reports suggest that a man was killed in the incident.”
Quraishi said that a police team had been dispatched to the site of the incident and that a detailed report would be submitted.
A police report shared later by Lakki Marwat Police’s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Aamir Khan, stated that the incident took place at 8pm on Sunday.
“Near Bukhmal Ahmadzai checkpoint, an IED exploded near Inamullah’s vehicle, causing it to catch fire,” the report, shared with Dawn.com, read.
“Inamullah and the remaining leaders of the movement are safe, but two people were injured in the explosion, while a man was killed.”
The report added that the injured have been moved to DHQ Hospital Tajazai for medical treatment.
Later, the PRO reported that District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan reached the scene of the incident and that police were collecting forensic evidence.
“An investigation has been launched and a search operation is underway,” the PRO added.
In a video posted to Facebook, Inamullah can be seen appealing to the public to come out of their homes and “engage the attackers”, while gunfire can be heard in the background.
This incident comes days after the assassination of Awami National Party senior leader Maulana Khan Zeb by unidentified suspects in KP’s Bajaur district.
Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafiq told Dawn.com that the politician was shot dead in Shindai Mor while campaigning for the July 13 peace parade, adding that a policeman was also killed in the attack.
“Three other people were injured in the shooting,” DPO Rafiq said. “This was a targeted killing carried out by unidentified shooters on motorcycles.”

Some separatist groups in northeastern India have ethnic, linguistic and cultural ties with minorities across the border in Myanmar and maintain a presence there.
Three commanders of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) were killed and 19 others wounded in a drone attack in Myanmar near the border, the separatist group said in a series of statements.
According to Indian outlet The Hindustan Times, the ULFA-I claimed that three of its members were killed in the attack that used over 150 Israeli-made drones.
In a statement, the ULFA-I claimed that the attack by “Indian occupational forces” took place at several camps from the border with Myanmar near Longwa in Nagaland till Pangsai Pass in Arunachal Pradesh between 2am (1:30am PKT) and 4am (3:30am PKT) on Sunday.
The outfit claimed that nearly 150-plus drones used in the attack were manufactured in Israel and France. It said the attacks claimed the life of the outfit’s lieutenant general Nayan Medhi (alias Nayan Asom), and injured 19 others.
In a second release, the ULFA-I said that two more leaders, “Brigadier Ganesh Asom and Colonel Pradip Asom, were killed in a subsequent missile attack.”
“While the last rites of Nayan Asom were being carried out, missile attacks were carried out in which Ganesh Asom and Pradip Asom became martyrs and several officers, cadres and civilians sustained injuries,” the statement issued on Sunday said.
The ULFA-I statement added that Indian Army operations in the area across the border were still continuing till Sunday morning. The outfit vowed to give a befitting reply to the action on its camps.
Indian daily The Hindu reported that, according to the group, the subsequent strikes were carried out with missiles and struck a funeral for the commander killed in the drone attack.
Indian authorities have yet to confirm the strikes.
Camps belonging to another rebel group, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), were also targeted, the ULFA-I added.
The ULFA-I is one of several insurgent groups in India, and wants independence for the northeastern state of Assam, while the PLA advocates for the secession of Manipur state.
One faction of the ULFA laid down arms and signed a peace deal with the Indian government in 2023. According to the Indian outlet The Deccan Herald, the group was split, with those against talks making up the ULFA-I faction.
Separatist attacks have drastically reduced in recent years, but the violence has killed thousands of people, mostly civilians, over the last three decades.</p><small>2025-07-13 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613838-govt-opposition-agree-to-continue-dialogue-on-punjab-mpas-disqualification' target='_blank'><strong>Govt, opposition agree to continue dialogue on Punjab MPAs' disqualification</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan faces a significant education crisis, with an estimated 25.37 million out-of-school children (OOSC) aged 5–16. NFE serves as a vital alternative, providing flexible and accessible learning opportunities for these children.
According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan 2024-25, the segregated data showed that the literacy rate was 60.6pc — with men at 68pc compared to 52.8pc among women. During the first three quarters of the ongoing financial year, the education-related spending decreased 29.4pc, dropping to Rs899.6 billion from Rs1,251.06bn.
According to the report by the Pakistan Institute of Education (PIE), “The number of NFE centres across the country has reached 35,427, where more than 1.29 million students are studying, which shows a 20pc increase compared to the previous year.”
A total of 57pc of the students are girls, a development which the report termed as “encouraging progress towards gender balance”, adding that 82pc of teachers are women, reflecting their inclusion in the education system.
 
 

The report describes NFE as a “second chance education” model that is cost-effective, flexible, and socially inclusive. The monthly cost per child is Rs1,000 to Rs1,500, which is many times less than that of formal education, it adds.
The report highlights the significant disparity in enrollment rates by region and gender, saying, “According to the economic survey, the literacy rate of women is much lower than that of men, especially in rural Balochistan, where only 31pc of women are literate.”
Earlier in the week,  “Pakistan’s Non-Formal Education Report 2023–24,” was launched at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU).
“This number [of OOSC] has risen alarmingly, influenced by the impacts of COVID-19 and recent floods. Recent years have witnessed significant developments in the NFE sector,” said the report.
The report recommended the expansion of accelerated learning programmes (ALP), prioritising the expansion of ALP (Middle-Tech) programmes due to their high retention rates (70pc) and their ability to provide both academic and vocational skills.</p><small>2025-07-13 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/13215558b02445a.png?r=215731' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923951/5-pti-mnas-expelled-from-party-for-voting-in-favour-of-26th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>5 PTI MNAs expelled from party for voting in favour of 26th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>The PTI formally expelled its five members of the National Assembly (MNA) for voting in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment Bill last August, it emerged on Sunday.
The Constitution (Twenty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2024, also known as the Constitutional Package, is legislation that takes away the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers, sets the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowers the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.
 
 

The party last October decided to take legal action against its lawmakers, who had voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment in violation of the party’s policy.
Expulsion notices — dated July 12 and available with Dawn.com — were issued to MNAs Aurangzeb Khan Khichi (NA-159, Vehari IV), Muhammad Ilyas Choudhry (NA-62, Gujrat I), Usman Ali (NA-142, Sahiwal II), Mubarak Zeb Khan (NA-8, Bajaur), and Zahoor Hussain Qureshi (NA-146, Khanewal III).
“[During] the PTI … parliamentary party meeting held on September 2, 2024 [in] Islamabad, … it was unanimously resolved that [the] PTI parliamentary party will not support the proposed amendments [to] the Constitution and will oppose the bill when it is moved in the National Assembly or is put to voting at any stage,” the notice read.
“You voted in favour of the bill and, therefore, you violated the directions and instructions of the PTI parliamentary party [that] were binding on you as a parliamentarian especially when you had won the election with support of [the] PTI and had taken oath that you would follow instructions of [the] PTI and that you would stand loyal to the party.”
The document recalled that show-cause notices were issued to the five MNAs in November to prove that they had not “defected” from the party, but they did not respond. Moreover, personal hearings were held for the MNAs, but they did not offer any explanation or defence, the notice read.
Two of the notices, addressed to Khichi and Mubarak Zeb, noted that they had defected and joined the PML-N. The remaining three notices took note of the fact that the recipients were sitting on treasury benches and “attended meetings of that [ruling] party”.
“Thus, you having voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional (Amendment) Act, 2024, have violated the party’s instructions and directions which were binding on you,” the notice read.
“Therefore, you are hereby declared to have violated your commitment, oath and loyalty to the party. You have acted contrary to the instructions of the party … and joined another parliamentary party in the National Assembly. You are therefore expelled from the party (PTI) forthwith. Needless to add that you also stand disqualified on account of aforesaid conduct.”

Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made the administration’s case on Sunday talk shows, just a day after a farm worker died in California after being injured in a raid on a legal cannabis farm.
On Friday, District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ordered a halt to “roving patrols” targeting suspected undocumented migrants in Los Angeles, saying a person’s race, language or workplace was not sufficient justification.
“Physical description cannot be the sole reason to detain and question somebody,” Homan said on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’, adding: “It’s a myriad of factors.” But he acknowledged that appearance was one of those factors, and said there were sometimes “collateral arrests” of innocent people in targeted raids.
He said the administration would comply with the judge’s decision but fight it on appeal.
Noem called the judge’s ruling “ridiculous” and slammed what she called the “political” nature of the decision.
“We always built our operations, our investigations on case work, on knowing individuals that we needed to target because they were criminals,” Noem said on ‘Fox News Sunday’.
 


Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to deport millions of undocumented migrants, has taken several actions aimed at speeding up deportations and reducing border crossings.
As a so-called “sanctuary city” with hundreds of thousands of undocumented people, Los Angeles has been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration since the Republican returned to power in January.
After ICE raids spurred unrest and protests last month, Trump dispatched the National Guard and US Marines to quell the disruption.
California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.
On Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided a cannabis farm in Ventura County outside Los Angeles. About 200 migrants were detained, and clashes erupted with protesters.
One worker being chased by ICE agents fell from the roof of a greenhouse and died on Saturday.
Homan called the death “sad” but specified that the man was not in ICE custody at the time of his death.
American dream ‘no longer’
In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of “thugs” throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing “tremendous damage.”
Trump said he was authorising law enforcement officers who are “on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these slimeballs, using whatever means is necessary to do so”.
“I am giving total authorisation for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the public,” he said.
Trump has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.
The Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against round-ups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.
The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an AFP reporter on Friday, as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.
“We’ve been here since six this morning asking questions, but they’re not giving us any information,” said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.
“I just want to know how he’s doing,” Munoz said. “Bring him back to me and if it’s time for us to leave, we’ll leave.
“The truth is the American dream is no longer really the American dream.”</p><small>2025-07-13 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613842-govt-decides-to-transform-frontier-constabulary-into-nationwide-federal-force' target='_blank'><strong>Govt decides to transform Frontier Constabulary into 'nationwide federal force'</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, Pakistan completed an extraordinary undefeated campaign to claim the Asian Youth Girls Netball Championship title, overpowering the Maldives 60-35 in the Plate Group (PG) final.
Eleven teams were participating in the championship and had been divided into two groups: Group A (Gold Cup Division) with Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and India, while Group B (Plate Cup Division) had Chinese Taipei, Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, Maldives and Saudi Arabia.
In an explanation letter issued by PSB on Sunday, reference was made to PNF’s letter, in which the federation claimed the team had secured first place. According to PSB, the claim was worded in a manner that created the impression of a gold medal victory.
The Board also raised concerns that PNF Chairman Mudassar Razzaq Arain reinforced this misleading impression during televised interviews on mainstream media, where he explicitly referred to a gold medal win and publicly thanked senior government officials for their appreciation.
A viral video of such an interview was also referenced in the official notice.
According to PSB, this purported achievement was used by the federation to apply for cash rewards under the 2024 Cash Award Policy, which subsequently led to government-level recognition and benefits.
The notice has instructed the netball federation to provide a comprehensive written explanation within three days. Failure to do so will result in the matter being referred to the competent authorities for further necessary action, according to APP.
Responding to the PSB’s letter, PNF Chairman Arain said in a video message that the sports board had misunderstood.
“I would like to clarify that Pakistan was in Pool ‘B’ and won all their matches in the Plate Division after competing against teams like Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, Maldives and Saudi Arabia,” Arain said.
He added that the PSB had neither provided any funds nor assistance for participating in this championship.
Copies of the PSB’s letter have also been sent to relevant federal ministers, the chairman of the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, the secretary of the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination, and the president of the Pakistan Olympic Association, APP added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also lauded the team for their victory.
“Special appreciation for staying undefeated throughout the tournament!” he said in a post on X. “Very well played!”
The tournament took place from June 27 to July 4 at the Jeonju Hwasan Gymnasium in South Korea.</p><small>2025-07-13 16:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1319244359eea97.png?r=192526' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923943/foreign-minister-ishaq-dar-to-travel-to-china-for-sco-meeting-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to travel to China for SCO meeting tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will travel to Tianjin, China, tomorrow for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, state media outlet Radio Pakistan reported on Sunday.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. Their foreign ministers’ meeting was held as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders set for the autumn.
According to the report, the top diplomats from Belarus, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan will also attend the event.
“The upcoming Council of Heads of State will take place on August 31 and September 1 in Tianjin, China,” Radio Pakistan reported.
“At the invitation of the Foreign Minister of China Wang Yi, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Pakistan Ishaq Dar will lead the Pakistan delegation to the meeting of the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers,” the Foreign Office (FO) said.
The CFM is the third-highest forum in the SCO format. It focuses on the issues of international relations, as well as the foreign and security policies of the organisation, the FO said.
The press release added that the forum approves the documents, including declarations and statements that are to be presented for the consideration of the Council of Heads of State (CHS), as well as the decisions to be adopted by the CHS.
“The upcoming CHS will take place from August 31 to September 1 in Tianjin, China,” the FO said.
The FO also reported that Dar spoke with Uzbekistan’s Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov today and discussed progress on the Framework Agreement on Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project.
“Both leaders also agreed to meet again at the sidelines of the upcoming SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Tianjin, China,” the FO added.
 






Pakistan is heading into the meeting amid heightened tensions with India.
India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the fighting.
Last month, the SCO’s meeting of defence ministers failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal, while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reaffirmed the country’s commitment to combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and security within the body’s framework.</p><small>2025-07-13 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613835-rs32bn-financial-irregularities-unearthed-in-kp-cities-improvement-project' target='_blank'><strong>'Rs32bn financial irregularities' unearthed in KP Cities Improvement Project</strong></a><br><p>

Pakis­tan had secured a three-year aid package deal in July 2024. The programme, approved by the IMF two months later, is set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan Mahir Binici noted that the country’s performance under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) had been “strong so far”, according to a press release issued by the SDPI on its guest lecture in Islamabad.
Binici termed the EFF’s successful first review — also encompassing agreement on the federal budget blueprint — by the IMF Executive Board in May as a key milestone.
 
 

“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici was quoted as saying.
He stressed that structural reforms remained central to Pakistan’s long-term economic sustainability, particularly reforms that strengthen tax equity, improve the business climate and encourage private-sector-led investment.
Addressing economists, researchers and policy experts, the SDPI statement said, Banici reaffirmed the Fund’s continued support for the country’s economic and climate reform agenda.
In March, Pakistan unlocked a new $1.3 billion arrangement with the IMF under its Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation.
Binici noted that the RSF was designed to help countries like Pakistan bolster resilience to climate-related vulnerabilities and meet international climate commitments, the SDPI press release said.
 
 

The IMF official mentioned that the key areas of reform under the RSF included enhancing public investment planning, promoting efficient and sustainable use of water resources, improving institutional coordination for disaster preparedness and financing, along with expanding the availability and transparency of climate-related data.
Binici stressed that “support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory”.
The IMF official also shed light on the evolving economic landscape across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region and Pakistan. He stated that growth across the Mena region, as well as in Pakistan, was expected to strengthen in 2025 and beyond.
However, he cautioned that “elevated trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation and weakening global cooperation continue to generate exceptional uncertainty and weigh on the global economic outlook”, underscoring the urgent need for prudent and forward-looking policy actions.
SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri welcomed the IMF representative’s outreach, noting the importance of informed economic dialogue and multilateral cooperation in Pakistan’s journey toward sustainable development.
The lecture concluded with an interactive discussion on fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, external buffers and the role of international institutions in fostering inclusive growth, the statement added.
 
 

The IMF had also praised Pakistan’s implementation of the $7bn EFF as strong in March after both concluded the programme’s first biannual review on a positive note.
In May, an official said the IMF Executive Board found that Pakistan had “met all of the targets” under the package and made progress on some of the reforms.</p><small>2025-07-13 12:04</small></div><hr>
