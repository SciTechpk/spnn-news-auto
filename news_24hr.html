South Africa were reeling early in their chase of 229 when pacer Diana Baig took two early wickets, leaving them 27-3 inside six overs.
Sune Luus and Anneke Bosch rebuilt the innings and added a 100-run partnership for the fourth wicket.
Chloe Tryon ensured there were no further hiccups for the Proteas Women after losing five wickets with 151 on board, guiding South Africa home with an unbeaten 45. sealing a comfortable win with almost ten overs to spare.
 






Pakistan, batting first, were bowled out for 229 in 46 overs.
Captain Fatima Sana top-scored with a terrific 64 laden with 8 boundaries and a six,
Batters Sidra Amin and Sidra Nawaz also made useful contributions at the top, being involved in crucial partnerships.
However, Pakistan struggled for momentum as wickets fell at regular intervals.
Ayabonga Khaka and Masabata Klass secured two wickets each for South Africa.
“The result will boost South Africa’s confidence heading into their opening clash against England on October 4, while Pakistan will take positives from Fatima Sana’s batting and Diana Baig’s fiery opening spell as they begin their World Cup campaign against Bangladesh on October 3,” The International Cricket Council said.

The Women in Green arrived in the Sri Lankan capital late on Tuesday as the tournament is set to start on September 30 in India’s Guwahati.
The eight-nation showpiece will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from Sept 30 to Nov 2. However, Pakistan — under an International Cricket Council (ICC) hybrid model decided by the ICC due to political strains between New Delhi and Islamabad — will play all their matches of the event in Colombo.
Their first warm-up encounter with Sri Lanka on September 25 was rained off.
Despite losing the recent one-day International (ODI) home series against South Africa, Pakistan were well prepared and had no extra pressure to face arch-rivals India in the forthcoming ICC World Cup, captain Fatima Sana said on Tuesday.
The Fatima-led team won the third and final ODI against South Africa in Lahore last week, but the tourists took the series 2-1.
Pakistan had qualified for the World Cup on the back of an unbeaten run in the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifiers held in Lahore in April of this year.</p><small>2025-09-28 22:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/290215533fb4b13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945354/politics-spill-over-again-in-cricket-as-india-refuse-to-collect-asia-cup-trophy' target='_blank'><strong>Politics spill over again in cricket as India refuse to collect Asia Cup trophy</strong></a><br><p>The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi, as politics continued to spill over the pitch.
India had earlier beaten Pakistan by five wickets in the last over after a close contest to win a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, but they caused the post-final formalities to be inordinately delayed due to their refusal to budge from their stance.
There were no customary handshakes between the teams after India refused, with tensions high from their previous two clashes in the competition, which witnessed political posturing and aggressive on-field behaviour.
 
 

The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naqvi, who is also the Interior Minister, was supposed to present the winners’ trophy, but there were indications that India would resent that when their captain Suryakumar Yadav did not participate in the customary pre-toss photoshoot before the final.
“I have been informed by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said.
When asked about his refusal to collect the trophy at the post-match press conference and their actions leading to the politicisation of the game, the Indian skipper declined to answer the question.
 


The post-final ceremony saw Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha receive the runners-up trophy while Indian players Tilak Varma, Kuldeep Yadav and Abhishek Sharma collect their respective individual awards.
 
 

India’s refusal to collect the trophy from Naqvi marks a historic low in the cricketing relations between the neighbours, with the game having acted as a stage for diplomacy in the past.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a political reference in his post on X congratulating the Indian team. “Operation Sindoor on the game’s field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he wrote.
Suryakumar’s men had earlier capped a remarkable unbeaten run with their third victory against Pakistan at the Asia Cup.
Put into bat, Pakistan could not capitalise on an 84-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) and were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings.
Pakistan lost their last nine wickets for 33 runs in a spectacular meltdown, with India’s left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) being the wrecker-in-chief.
The Green Shirts struck back to leave India reeling at 20-3 with their top 3, including captain Suryakumar Yadav, back in the dugout.
India lost their in-form opener Abhishek Sharma, also the tournament’s leading scorer, and the skipper inside the first 10 deliveries of their innings.
Varma and Sanju Samson (24) got to rebuilding the innings.
 
 

Even that recovery would not have been possible but for the reprieve Samson, then on 12, got when Hussain Talat dropped him in the deep.
Abrar Ahmed dismissed Samson to break the 57-run stand, but Shivam Dube (33) combined with Varma to take India closer to the target before falling in the penultimate over.
Needing 10 runs from the last over from Haris Rauf, Varma hit the second ball for a six to effectively seal India’s thrilling victory and triggering wild celebrations in the Indian camp.
“It’s a tough pill to swallow,” Pakistan captain Salman said at the presentation ceremony. “We could not finish well in the batting. Bowling, we gave everything. If we could have finished well, it would have been a different story.
“We could not rotate the strike properly, and we lost too many wickets. That was the reason we could not score what we wanted. We have to sort out our batting very soon. They bowled really well, outstandingly well. They needed 63 off six overs. I thought we had the game. The bowlers bowled really well; we have to give them credit, but the batting was a concern.
“We fought really well. We are proud as a team. So much to look forward to, we will improve and come back stronger.”</p><small>2025-09-28 22:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/29014005c4a617c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945341/still-very-much-a-rivalry-despite-indias-hat-trick-of-wins-over-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Still very much a rivalry despite India’s hat-trick of wins over Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>NOT a rivalry? Well, still very much a rivalry.
It is very much a rivalry when the Dubai International Cricket Stadium is filled to capacity to witness its spectacular nature. It is very much a rivalry when Indian faces on the ground, in the stands and in the dressing rooms fall in disappointment when a Pakistan player hits a six or takes a wicket.
It is very much a rivalry when Gautam Gambhir, who went on record saying India shouldn’t play against Pakistan, bangs the table like a maniac in the dressing room when Shivam Dube breaks the shackles to get India back into the match. It is very much a rivalry when India’s top broadcaster wants the country to play the maximum number of matches against Pakistan in the face of calls for “boycotting” the contest.
It was very much a rivalry when India as the best Twenty20 International side in the world found itself under pressure chasing a paltry 148 before India’s Tilak Varma’s brilliance with the bat, and Pakistan’s Haris Rauf’s meltdown with the ball, stood out in the former’s five-wicket victory in the Asia Cup final on Sunday. Although India won — and full credit to them for it, the country’s government’s unsporting narrative, communicated by its mouthpiece Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav over the 20-day course of the tournament lost.
India had convincingly won the two previous matches between the two rivals at the Asia Cup. Pakistan, meanwhile, had admitted ahead of the final that they had yet to play the “perfect” match. And when openers Sahibzada Farhan and Fakhar Zaman were owning the Indian bowlers until the former fell in the 10th over, it looked like the day Pakistan had waited for had arrived.
But the team’s decision to replace power-hitter Hasan Nawaz with conventional batter Hussain Talat came back to sting them a week later. After a good start by the openers, none of the Pakistan middle-order batters — including the captain Salman Ali Agha — looked equipped with the skill of capitalising on it. A collapse proved inevitable hence as India licked their lips at the sight of a small total to chase.
But Pakistan walked on to the ground to field with their fighting spirit running high and Faheem Ashraf’s fist pumps after removing India dangerman Abhishek Sharma and Shubhman Gill symbolised it perfectly. So did Salman’s dive forward to take an acrobatic catch to complete Suryakumar’s dimissal off Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf’s arms stretching out to send back Gill.
 


But — no matter how much denied — the occasion was big, and Varma rose up to it. The left-hander would go on to play a chanceless, unbeaten knock of 69 off 53, pouncing on each and every loose delivery — with Haris bowling the most of them for Pakistan.
Haris was also punished by Shivam Dube, whose power was evident with two sixes and as many fours as he stroked away his match-winning 33 off 22. By the time the left-hander became Faheem’s third wicket, India had all but won the match, before Rinku Singh hit the winning shot.</p><small>2025-09-28 21:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626045-visionary-trump-coas-asim-munir-are-men-of-peace-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Visionary Trump, COAS Asim Munir are men of peace: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

United States President Donald Trump’s special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler, welcomed the decision to release the American citizen and called it a good moment for him, the statement read.
Muttaqi was quoted as saying, “The Afghan government does not view the issues of its citizens from a political angle and makes it clear that ways can be found to resolve the issues through diplomacy.”
He added that the step taken by his government to release the American citizen was a positive development and thanked the government of Qatar for its role in facilitating the release of the prisoner.
According to the statement, Boehler described the previous round of talks between Kabul and Washington as “constructive” and expressed hope that talks on the remaining issues would continue.
This was the second visit to Kabul by the American delegation.
The Afghan ministry said that during its last visit, the US delegation demanded the release of American prisoners; however, Taliban leaders had called for the release of Afghan national Mohammad Rahim, who is believed to be imprisoned in the Guantanamo Bay detention centre.
The US delegation had agreed in principle to free Rahim, who would be brought to Qatar and remain there. However, the Afghan Foreign Ministry statement did not mention whether Rahim would be released or not.
An elderly British couple detained in Afghanistan for almost eight months were released earlier this month, Taliban authorities said, after pressure built to free the pair due to fears over their health.
Taliban officials have refused to detail why Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbara, 76, were arrested in February as they were returning to their home.
“We’ve been treated very well. We’re looking forward to seeing our children,” said Barbara, in a red headscarf, standing next to her bearded husband, near a plane on the tarmac of Kabul airport.</p><small>2025-09-28 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281916018341e81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945212/child-bride-found-dead-under-suspicious-circumstances-shangla-police-investigating' target='_blank'><strong>Child bride found dead under ‘suspicious circumstances’; Shangla police investigating</strong></a><br><p>A 12-year-old girl, who had been married to her 10-year-old cousin for six months, was found dead under “suspicious circumstances” on Sunday in the Damorai area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district, according to a police official.
Ali Hussain, station house officer (SHO) at Olandar police station, said that the incident occurred within the limits of Olandar police station in Damorai. According to the SHO, the boy was the girl’s mother’s nephew.
“My team and I visited the girl’s home, where her mother was reluctant to hand over the body to police for an autopsy,” SHO Hussain said. “We took the body to the Alpuri district headquarters hospital and conducted an autopsy.
The SHO added that the cause of her death would be determined once the medical report is received.
“We have confirmed that both the deceased and her spouse were underage,” SHO Hussain said. “The deceased was 12 years old and her husband was only 10.
“The marriage was illegal and the girl’s death is also suspicious.”
Police launched an inquiry under Section 176 (inquiry by magistrate into cause of death) of the Criminal Code of Procedure to determine the cause of the girl’s death.
Replying to a question, SHO Hussain said that after consultation with the district public prosecutor, a first information report would be lodged against the Nikah registrar and all witnesses present at the Nikah of both children.
The SHO said that both children’s parents would also be arrested and “justice would be ensured”.
Sahil’s ‘Cruel Numbers’ report reveals that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country last year.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. Forty-eight cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.</p><small>2025-09-28 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/282212390607cba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945260/anchorperson-imtiaz-mir-succumbs-to-injuries-suffered-during-last-weeks-karachi-gun-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Anchorperson Imtiaz Mir succumbs to injuries suffered during last week’s Karachi gun attack</strong></a><br><p>Anchorperson Imtiaz Mir, who was shot and wounded last week in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbed to his injuries on Sunday, according to his family and police.
Mir, an anchorperson for private TV channel Metro 1 News, was headed home in a car driven by his older brother, Mohammed Salih, when six suspects riding two motorcycles began firing on their vehicle in Malir.  Mir and his brother were both injured and admitted to Liaquat National Hospital.
His brother, Riaz Ali, who is the complainant in the case, told Dawn.com on Sunday night that his brother had succumbed during treatment.
Saudabad police Station House Officer (SHO) Ateequr Rehman also confirmed the death of the journalist, as the incident took place in his jurisdiction.
“Police have registered a case against a man and his sons over the attack on the journalist,” the SHO said. “The incident was motivated by a land dispute in the town of Thul in Jacobabad. A hitherto little-known group claimed responsibility for the attack, but it lacked credibility.”
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed his regret over Mir’s death and directed the Sindh inspector general of police to arrest the killers immediately.
“The killers of Imtiaz Mir will be brought to justice,” CM Shah vowed, according to the statement. “The services of the late journalist to the media will be remembered and the government will take this case to its logical conclusion.”
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon issued a statement expressing grief over Mir’s passing, hailing the late journalist as “a hardworking and fearless journalist, who always highlighted public issues”.
“The Sindh government will leave no stone unturned to bring those involved in the attack on Imtiaz Mir to justice,” Memon said. “The Sindh government is committed to protecting the lives and property of journalists.”</p><small>2025-09-28 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28212146d70878a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945250/karachi-police-constable-suspended-over-allegation-of-sexually-assaulting-polio-worker' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police constable suspended over allegation of sexually assaulting polio worker</strong></a><br><p>A constable of Mithadar police in Karachi has been suspended over allegations of sexually assaulting a female polio worker, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com on Sunday.
DIG Raza has directed the South senior superintendent of police to conduct a “transparent inquiry” of the case.
“The girl is an orphan and a polio worker,” the DIG said. “The suspended policeman was a part of the polio team.”
In her complaint, the victim stated that she is a divorcee and the mother of two children. She alleged that the suspect took her phone number from the team’s WhatsApp group and started sending her messages saying that he loves her and wants to marry her.
She alleged in the complaint that the suspect took advantage of her and took her to a guest house, where he sexually assaulted her. The victim added that she has become pregnant with the policeman’s child, but now he is refusing to marry her.
Earlier this week, the body of a seven-year-old boy who went missing was found in the Landhi area, while a post-mortem examination confirmed that he had been raped before being murdered. A police surgeon said the body was in an advanced state of decomposition and bore multiple bone fractures.
“The findings are consistent with anal sexual violence,” she said. The cause of death was determined to be massive head trauma inflicted by a hard and blunt object.
A few days later, two men confessed before magistrates to raping the boy and murdering him by strangling him with a shoelace and striking him in the head with a brick.</p><small>2025-09-28 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28200820bc93d39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945234/russia-pounds-kyiv-other-regions-in-mass-drone-and-missile-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Russia pounds Kyiv, other regions in mass drone and missile attack</strong></a><br><p>Russia launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Kyiv and other parts of Ukraine early on Sunday, killing at least four people and injuring dozens, in one of the most sustained attacks on the capital since the full-scale war began.
Neighbouring Poland closed its airspace near two southeastern cities and its air force scrambled jets in response until the danger had passed.
Ukraine’s military said that Russia launched 595 drones and 48 missiles overnight and its air defences shot down 568 drones and 43 missiles. It noted that the main target of the strike was the capital Kyiv.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attack, which lasted more than 12 hours, damaged a cardiology clinic, factories and residential buildings.
Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday it had carried out a “massive” attack on Ukraine using long-range air and sea-based weapons and drones to target military infrastructure, including airfields.
Moscow has denied targeting civilians in its war against Ukraine, although thousands have been killed and residential areas extensively damaged by its attacks.
Zelensky urges international partners to act
Zelensky again urged the international community to act decisively to cut off Russia’s energy revenues that fund its invasion. Ukraine has so far failed to convince US President Donald Trump to impose punitive sanctions on Moscow.
“The time for decisive action is long overdue, and we count on a strong response from the United States, Europe, the G7, and the G20,” he said on the Telegram messaging app.
Kyiv awoke to loud explosions, drones flying overhead and air defences booming. Smoke from one of the strike sites drifted across the morning sky as the air raid alert ended at 9:13am, nearly seven hours after it began.
Reuters journalists visited an area in the suburbs of Kyiv, where rows of newly built homes were almost totally destroyed, and parked cars flattened by falling debris.
Residents sifted through the wreckage of an apartment block after their windows were blown in by the force of a blast.
Some people hurried to metro stations underground, from where they followed events on their mobile phones.
Ukraine’s defences stretched by large-scale attacks
Attacks on such a scale have stretched Ukraine’s limited air defences throughout 2025. Zelensky said on Saturday an additional Patriot missile system from Israel had been deployed and he expected two more to arrive this autumn.
He and other officials have asked international partners for more to protect Ukraine’s skies, but air defence systems are limited in availability and other nations are keen to bolster their defences amid perceived threats from Russia.
Zelensky said Sunday’s attack targeted several regions, including the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, where authorities said at least 16 people were injured.
Emergency services said at least four people were killed, while 67 people were reported wounded across the country by local authorities.
Among the fatalities was a 12-year-old girl, although that has not been officially confirmed, Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said on Telegram.</p><small>2025-09-28 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2818553915e31e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945208/pm-shehbaz-hopes-for-encouraging-results-of-trumps-moot-with-muslim-leaders-on-gaza-to-come-soon' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz hopes for ‘encouraging’ results of Trump’s moot with Muslim leaders on Gaza to come soon</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed on Sunday the hope for “encouraging” outcomes of US President Donald Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders in Washington earlier this week where the American head of the state presented his plan to end Israel’s invasion of Gaza.
“We fully participated in the meeting on Gaza, and God willing, its encouraging results will come out soon,” he said, flanked by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar while addressing overseas Pakistanis at the High Commission in London.
According to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan, he also said that Pakistan was also part of Trump-led efforts to bring peace to Palestine and end oppression against the people of Gaza.
The premier also expressed distress over the situation in Gaza, which has been subjected to Israeli onslaught since October 2023, and prayed that the cruelty and barbarity being witnessed there ends soon.
Trump’s meeting with Muslim leaders on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia.
Ahead of formal consultations, Trump told his guests: “We have to get the hostages back … This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world … so it’s an honour to be with you.”
Trump also emphasised the urgency of ending the conflict: “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started.”
 
 

According to reports from Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios, President Trump’s plan envisions an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, both alive and deceased; phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza
Governance excluding Hamas but incorporating the Palestinian Authority; deployment of Arab and Muslim peacekeepers to secure Gaza and facilitate Israel’s withdrawal; and internationally supported reconstruction and transition programmes funded by regional contributors.
These details were reportedly shared with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though Israel did not draft the plan.
Dar, who also attended the meeting with Trump, also expressed the hope for positive outcomes of the meeting, saying that once these results materialised, “we will share them with the nation”.
He also said that follow-up communications after the meeting were going on until last night.
Earlier during the talk, PM Shehbaz also referred to his engagements in New York, where he led Pakistan’s delegation to the UNGA’s 80th session. He said his speech at the UNGA was a reflection of the sentiments of Pakistanis and that he fought the case of India-occupied Kashmir there.
The PM also touched upon his bilateral meeting with Trump in Washington during the recent US trip, saying that it was a “productive” and “constructive” engagement.
“It was held in a conducive environment,” he said, adding that he hoped it would help further strengthen Pakistan-US ties.</p><small>2025-09-28 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625981-pakistan-part-of-trump-led-efforts-for-gaza-peace-says-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan part of Trump-led efforts for Gaza peace, says PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

Britain, France and Germany initiated the return of sanctions on Iran at the UN Security Council over accusations it had violated a 2015 deal that aimed to stop it from developing a nuclear bomb. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.
The end of the decade-long nuclear deal originally agreed by Iran, Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China is likely to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, just months after Israel and the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
UN sanctions imposed by the Security Council in resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 were reinstated at 8pm EDT on Saturday. Attempts to delay the return of all sanctions on Iran failed on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN this week.
“We urge Iran and all states to abide fully by these resolutions,” the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany said in a joint statement after the deadline passed.
European Union (EU) foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas confirmed in a statement on Sunday that the bloc would “now proceed to implement the re-imposition of all previously lifted UN and EU nuclear-related sanctions without delay”.
Israel hailed the reimposition of sanctions on its arch foe as a “major development”, citing what it called Tehran’s ongoing violations over the nuclear programme.
“The goal is clear: prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. The world must use every tool to achieve this goal,” the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a post on X.
 






Tehran denounces ‘unjustifiable’ return of sanctions
Iran on Sunday condemned as “unjustifiable” the reinstatement of United Nations sanctions over its nuclear programme, after the collapse of talks with Western powers and Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear sites.
“The reactivation of annulled resolutions is legally baseless and unjustifiable… all countries must refrain from recognising this illegal situation,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will firmly defend its national rights and interests, and any action aimed at undermining the rights and interests of its people will face a firm and appropriate response.“
Tehran had allowed UN inspectors to return to its nuclear sites, but Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said the United States had offered only a short reprieve in return for handing over its whole stockpile of enriched uranium, a proposal he described as unacceptable.
An 11th-hour effort by Iran allies Russia and China to postpone the sanctions until April failed to win enough votes in the Security Council on Friday, leading to the measures taking effect at 3:30 am in Tehran (5am PKT) on Sunday.
Germany, which triggered the return of sanctions alongside Britain and France, had “no choice” as Iran was not complying with its obligations, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
“For us, it is imperative: Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon,” he told the UN General Assembly.“But let me emphasise: we remain open to negotiations on a new agreement. Diplomacy can and should continue.”
Iran calls in ambassadors
Tehran has warned of a harsh response to the reimposition of sanctions. Iran said on Saturday it was recalling its ambassadors to Britain, France and Germany for consultations. But Iranian President Pezeshkian said on Friday Iran had no intention of leaving the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Russia has disputed the return of UN sanctions on Iran.
“It is unlawful, and it cannot be implemented,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters at the UN earlier on Saturday, adding that he had written to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning that it would be “a major mistake” for him to acknowledge a return of UN sanctions on Iran.
The European powers had offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months to allow space for talks on a long-term deal if Iran restored access for UN nuclear inspectors, addressed concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engaged in talks with the United States.
“Our countries will continue to pursue diplomatic routes and negotiations. The reimposition of UN sanctions is not the end of diplomacy,” the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said, urging Iran to “return to compliance”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that President Donald Trump has been clear that diplomacy is still an option for Iran and a deal remains the best outcome for the Iranian people and the world.
“For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks, held in good faith, without stalling or obfuscation,” Rubio said, adding that until there was a new deal it was important for countries to implement sanctions “immediately in order to pressure Iran’s leaders”.
Rial falls to record low
Iran’s economy is already struggling with crippling US sanctions reimposed since 2018 after Trump ditched the pact during his first term.
Iran’s rial currency continued to weaken over fears of new sanctions. The rial fell to 1,123,000 per US dollar, a new record low, on Saturday, from about 1,085,000 on Friday, according to foreign exchange websites, including Bon-bast.com.
With the return of UN sanctions, Iran will again be subjected to an arms embargo and a ban on all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, as well as any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
Other sanctions to be reimposed include a travel ban on dozens of Iranian citizens, asset freezes on dozens of people and entities and a ban on the supply of anything that could be used in the nation’s nuclear programme.
All countries are authorised to seize and dispose of any items banned under UN sanctions and Iran will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in any commercial activity in another country involving uranium mining, production or use of nuclear materials and technology.</p><small>2025-09-28 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28201829291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945197/fia-arrests-its-two-staffers-at-islamabad-airport-for-alleged-role-in-illegal-immigration-deals' target='_blank'><strong>FIA arrests its two staffers at Islamabad airport for alleged role in illegal immigration deals</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Sunday said it had foiled an attempt to send citizens abroad for hefty bribes and arrested two of its own personnel posted at Islamabad International Airport.
According to an FIA statement, the action was taken on the instructions of the director of the agency’s Islamabad Zone during a surprise inspection of the immigration staff under the supervision of Deputy Director (Immigration) Salman Liaquat.
The statement read that an assistant sub-inspector and a constable were taken into custody while on duty “after they were found using mobile phones”, which the immigration staff are prohibited from carrying during duty.
Their phones were searched on suspicion, and “important evidence related to illegal immigration” was recovered.
The FIA reported that according to initial investigation, the two men were in “contact with passengers and agents” and “charging Rs50,000 per person to send citizens to the Philippines and Uzbekistan”.
Records of transactions amounting to “millions of rupees were recovered from the suspects’ mobile phones”, and the pair was “using microfinance accounts to receive payments”, the statement read.
A case has been registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle in Islamabad, and a three-day physical remand of the suspects has been obtained, it added.
Last month, the FIA took notice over videotaping of passengers, mostly female migrants, on Pak-Afghan border crossing Torkham.
A video went viral on the social media, prompting the agency to take notice of the FIA official recording passengers and being negligent during duty at the border.
A statement read that the DG FIA had sought a detailed report of the incident from the Director FIA Peshawar Zone and the official had been suspended immediately.</p><small>2025-09-28 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281255026307e09.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945182/pakistan-calls-india-regional-bully-at-unga-says-attempts-to-distort-islamabads-name-utterly-shameful' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls India ‘regional bully’ at UNGA, says attempts to distort Islamabad’s name ‘utterly shameful’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called India a “regional bully” at the United Nations General Assembly after an Indian diplomat referred to the country as “terroristan,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported on Sunday.
Ties between Pakistan and India have long been fraught, with four wars fought since independence. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention.  Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The spat unfolded during the fifth day (Sept. 27) of the 80th UNGA session in New York, where exchanges turned heated in the absence of the usual prime ministerial face-off.  The sharpest blows came in the Right of Reply, with Indian representative Rentala Srinivas branding Pakistan a terrorist state, declaring: “No arguments or untruths can ever whitewash the crimes of Terroristan.”
Responding, Muhammad Rashid, Second Secretary at the Pakistan Mission, condemned the remarks as “utterly shameful,” saying India had stooped so low as to distort the name of a fellow UN member state.
Also refuting the terrorism claims made earlier by Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar and calling the distortion attempt “undignified”, Rashid went on to say that India itself “is not just a serial perpetrator of terrorism, but a regional bully that is holding South Asia hostage to its hegemonic designs and radical ideology.”

He called on the international community to pay attention to India’s “reckless behaviour.”
“By engaging in this kind of rhetoric, India diminishes its own credibility, showing the world that it has no substantive argument to offer—only, I am sorry to say, cheap slurs which are not worthy of serious discourse.”
Questioning the tone of the language, Rashid further said: “Such language reflects neither maturity nor responsibility. Instead, it exposes that India is frustrated and reveals its pettiness on the world stage.“
He claimed India “itself has been implicated in supporting and sponsoring terrorism beyond its borders.”
Calling it unfortunate, the Pakistani diplomat added that Indian “intelligence operatives have been accused of financing and directing groups engaged in sabotage and targeted killings across the world.”
“Undermining regional stability and violating international law is a habit for India.“
Rashid also noted that actions such as these “expose duplicity of India’s counterterrorism claims, and raise concern regarding India fuelling terrorism rather than combating it”.
He stressed that the claims made by Jaishankar were “completely devoid of facts” and an attempt to “malign” Pakistan’s name.
Earlier, the Indian minister had said that “India has confronted this challenge since independence, having a neighbour that is an epicentre of global terrorism,” without naming Pakistan.
Outlining Pakistan’s losses in the fight against terrorism, Rashid highlighted that Pakistan is “one of the strongest pillars in leading global efforts for combating terrorism.”
On the other hand, India, the diplomat pointed out, “is in the league of those who illegally occupy territories, oppress populations and violate fundamental human rights, as is the case in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
“State terrorism — in the form of: extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, staged encounters and collective punishment under the cover of counter terrorism.”
While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to peace in South Asia, Rashid noted that “these goals cannot be achieved through threats and intimidation.”
On that note, he invited India to “embrace” peace, stating, “True progress requires sincerity, mutual respect, dialogue and diplomacy — principles Pakistan has upheld, and which India must finally choose to embrace, if it truly seeks peace.”
On Friday, in his address to the UNGA, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif highlighted the need for “proactive” rather than “provocative” leadership for South Asia, citing India’s recent aggression against Pakistan.</p><small>2025-09-28 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28170437c3b8fae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945195/vietnam-evacuates-thousands-shuts-airports-as-typhoon-bualoi-nears' target='_blank'><strong>Vietnam evacuates thousands, shuts airports as Typhoon Bualoi nears</strong></a><br><p>Vietnam closed airports and evacuated thousands of people in areas under storm threat on Sunday, as intensifying Typhoon Bualoi barrelled towards the country, days after causing at least 10 deaths and widespread flooding in the Philippines.
The typhoon was generating winds of up to 133 km/h (83 mph) as of 1000 GMT  (3pm PKT) and is forecast to make landfall in central Vietnam around 0100 on Monday, slowing as it nears the coast, state-run Thanh Nien newspaper reported.
“This is a rapidly moving storm - nearly twice the average speed - with strong intensity and a broad area of impact,” the national weather forecast agency said.
“It is capable of triggering multiple natural disasters simultaneously, including powerful winds, heavy rainfall, flooding, flash floods, landslides, and coastal inundation.” Northern and central provinces may see up to 600 mm of rain through October 1, with rivers rising by 9 meters and risks of flooding and landslides, it said.
Authorities in the central province of Ha Tinh have started to evacuate more than 15,000 people, the government said, adding thousands of troops were standing ready.
Residents in Vinh, capital of Nghe An province, where the typhoon is expected to make landfall, were rushing to secure homes, tie down boats, and stack sandbags or water-filled sacks on rooftops.
“We already suffered from losses from recent Typhoon Kajiki this year and haven’t recovered yet,” said Bui Thi Tuyet, a 41-year-old resident. “Over the last 20 years living here, I have not felt this terrified because of storms.”
Vietnam suspended operations at four coastal airports from Sunday, including Da Nang International Airport, and adjusted the departure time of several flights, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
Schools in the typhoon-affected area will be closed on Monday, with closures potentially extended if necessary, according to news site VnExpress.
Heavy rain has already caused flooding in Hue and Quang Tri, the government said.
With a long coastline facing the South China Sea, Vietnam is prone to typhoons that are often deadly. Last year, Typhoon Yagi killed around 300 people and caused $3.3 billion of property damage.</p><small>2025-09-28 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281646185b44806.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945191/shama-junejo-claims-pm-shehbaz-included-her-in-pakistans-un-delegation-as-adviser' target='_blank'><strong>Shama Junejo claims PM Shehbaz included her in Pakistan’s UN delegation as adviser</strong></a><br><p>The controversy surrounding the supposed inclusion of columnist and social media activist Shama Junejo in Pakistan’s delegation to the United Nations this week took a new turn on Sunday when she claimed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had included her among the delegates as an adviser.
The controversy had surfaced when photos from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s address at a UN Security Council session on artificial intelligence (AI) spread like wildfire on social media platform X, with users pointing to Junejo sitting in the background. Several of them also shared screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel — a position sharply at odds with Pakistan’s longstanding pro-Palestinian stance.
After social media furore, Asif said on X that only the Foreign Office could explain Junejo’s presence at the session. Later, the FO clarified that she had not been part of Pakistan’s accredited delegation.
Following that, Asif also spoke about the matter on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’. Asked whether he was “taken aback” by the FO’s statement, Asif emphatically said: “I was taken aback, rather I was a bit disturbed that such people could be with the delegation whom no one owns later.” He also denied Junejo having written PM Shehbaz’s speech for the 80th UN General Assembly session, further stating that as far as he knew, she did not have any official position, be it of an adviser or a special assistant.
However, Junejo claimed in a post on X today that she had been working for the prime minister for the past many months.
“My policy briefs, advice and points during the Pakistan-India escalation are all part of the record and preserved,” she said, further claiming that the premier had assigned her the task of “writing the UN speech”.
The London-based social media activist went on to claim that the PM himself had included her in the UN delegation as an adviser and that she was also issued a security pass.
“I worked with his team day and night. I travelled with him, stayed with his team in the same hotel and was also a part of his important meetings on the sidelines (of the UNGA session), such as the one with Bill Gates,” she said, adding that in another conference on climate on the UNGA sidelines, she was sitting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar behind the prime minister.
According to Junejo, after the session on climate, the protocol team escorted her to the session on AI, where she sat behind Asif alongside a man she identified as Bilal. In her post, she also shared a picture of herself with Asif and Pakistan Crypto Council Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, as well as that of her UN card.
Junejo maintained that at the AI conference, Bilal continued to write a new speech and “we had tea together afterwards”.
“We sat together for 40 minutes waiting for the car, and returned to the hotel together in the same car. Khawaja Asif sahib sat with me on the backseat of the car,” she maintained.
Junejo claimed that she was also at the UN “with the others” when PM Shehbaz was delivering his speech. “There, Khawaja Asif was sitting in front of me, and we all applauded together for the prime minister.”
 






According to her, the PM’s “historic speech was not only written by her, but it was teamwork”. Junejo had claimed about being a part of the minister’s speech-writing team since April earlier as well.
In her post today, she claimed that her return flight was also booked beforehand, and the mission protocol team had dropped her at the airport.
She questioned, “Why is Khawaja Asif sahib issuing such statements now and under what agenda is he tarnishing a historic visit of his government?”
“The prime minister should ask him about this, as his authority has been challenged, not mine.”
In a similar post on X in English, she said Asif’s statements and the FO’s post “
have embarrassed Pakistan globally“.
She added, “If anyone attempts to malign my character or professional integrity, I reserve the right to pursue legal action in the UK.”
Minister passes the buck, FO distances itself
When the controversy had initially surfaced, Asif, facing a barrage of criticism, publicly distanced himself from Junejo’s appearance with the delegation and pointed the finger at the FO.
In a post on X, the defence minister had clarified that he had given the speech instead of PM Shehbaz at the UNSC session as the latter had other engagements.
 






“This woman or whoever sat behind me was and is at the discretion of the Foreign Office,” Asif said. “Who is this woman? Why is she with the delegation, and why was she seated behind me? Only the FO can answer these questions. It is not appropriate for me to respond on their behalf.”
Subsequently, the FO issued a clarification, stating: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has noted queries regarding the seating of a certain individual behind the defence minister at a recent meeting of the UNSC.
“To clarify, the individual in question was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th UNGA session, signed by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
 






“As such, her seating behind the defence minister did not have the approval of the deputy prime minister/ foreign minister.”
Official sources confirmed to Dawn that while the FO did not issue the required letter of credence, Junejo joined PM Shehbaz’s entourage from Britain, where she had been staying at the same hotel.
On arrival in New York, Pakistan’s mission to the UN was directed by “a senior political leader” to issue a note verbale for facilitating her accreditation so that she could attend meetings, including the UNSC debate, the Dawn report said.
It added that the leader’s argument was that though she wasn’t part of the official delegation notified by FO for the session, she was part of the entourage. Therefore, the mission was asked to get her accredited.
A source categorically told Dawn that the FO did not even have prior knowledge about Junejo’s inclusion in the entourage.
Junejo clarifies stance on Israel
Meanwhile, Junejo has also posted about her stance on Israel.
In a post on X today, she said that an impression of her being pro-Israel was created on the basis of a 2018 post on X. “Whereas, I have been writing against the massacre in Gaza and Netanyahu almost daily since 2023. But nobody sees that.”
She said her statements about Pakistan recognising Israel were given during Abraham Accords — a set of agreements that normalised ties between Israel and multiple Arab states — and that she had always condemned Israel’s atrocities since its invasion of Gaza. “I will keep doing so,” she added, referring to a video of Pakistani delegates walking out during the recent UNGA session.
 






At the UNGA, delegates from several countries had walked out, boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech.
Earlier, Junejo had shared screenshots on X of previous posts where she had called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
The Dawn report from yesterday mentions that in her social media posts from London, Junejo had also said she was in possession of the ‘secret files’ raising questions about the security of such documents.
Junejo, in a post on X, also appeared to be clarifying this matter. She said: “There was a fire incident at the Churchill Hotel which left me panicked. I am disabled and was not assisted during evacuation. I carried hard copies of speech drafts and meeting notes — my personal intellectual property. These were sensitive but not state documents. I held no access to or custody of any official files beyond my remit.”

Manhas was the only nominee to be chief of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and was appointed after the board’s annual general meeting in Mumbai.
Rajeev Shukla was elected as vice-president, while Devajit Saikia will stay on as secretary, the BCCI said in a statement.
Manhas, 45, never played for India but turned to the game’s administration after his first-class playing career ended.
He replaces India’s former World Cup-winner Roger Binny, who quit in August after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70.
Cricket’s massive popularity in India has helped the BCCI become by far the wealthiest of all of the sport’s boards, netting massive money from sponsorship and TV deals.
Manhas’ rise has apparently been backed by India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
He was chosen at a key meeting in New Delhi last week that was also attended by senior BJP members, the Indian media reported.
The meeting was held at the residence of India’s Home Minister Amit Shah, who is the father of International Cricket Council chief Jay Shah.
Manhas most recently worked as director of the cricket association in Indian-occupied Kashmir.
A middle-order batsman who scored 9,714 runs at an average of 45.82 in 157 domestic matches, Manhas remained on the fringes of national selection.
Cricket pundits have said he was unlucky to play in the same era as Indian greats Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, and VVS Laxman.
He was also overshadowed by the presence of Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir in his Delhi team, but led the side with those two star players often on national duty.
Manhas has played more than 50 matches in the Indian Premier League.</p><small>2025-09-28 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28145449081c6e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945183/taliban-govt-welcomes-russia-china-iran-and-pakistans-stance-against-foreign-military-bases-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Taliban govt welcomes Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan’s stance against foreign military bases in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Afghanistan’s Taliban government has welcomed the recent stance by Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan against the establishment of foreign military bases in and around Afghanistan.
This position was affirmed in a joint statement released after foreign ministers from the four countries met on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York. They emphasised respect for Afghanistan’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and said re-establishment of foreign military bases is “not conducive to regional peace and security.”
According to Hamdullah Fitrat, deputy spokesperson for the Taliban government, his country not only welcomed the stance of the four countries but said that “Afghanistan will not allow its territory to be used against other countries, nor permit armed groups to operate from its soil.”
While the joint statement did not refer to any specific country seeking bases in Afghanistan, it follows one by US President Donald Trump where he said Washington was trying to get Bagram air base in Afghanistan back.
Bagram Air Base served as the linchpin for US operations in the rugged country, where the long war against the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies was fought with air strikes and resupply missions from the airfield. In July 2021, all US and Nato troops left Afghanistan’s biggest air base, signalling the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country after two decades of war.
After his initial statement about Bagram in the United Kingdom, Trump had threatened Afghanistan with unspecified consequences if it refused to give control of the Bagram air base to the US.
For their part, the Taliban government in Afghanistan rejected his demand.
‘Want positive ties with all’
In their joint statement, Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan also urged the Taliban rulers to take “effective, concrete and verifiable actions in fulfilling the international obligations and commitments made by Afghanistan to fight terrorism, and dismantle, and eliminate all terrorist groups, and to prevent recruitment, fundraising and their access to weapons, as well as their collaboration with foreign terrorist fighters”.
The four countries further urged the Afghan authorities to dismantle any terrorist training camps or any other terrorist infrastructure on their soil.
Moreover, their joint statement said: “The four sides expressed deep concern over the security situation related to terrorism in Afghanistan, noting that terrorist groups such as ISIL, Al Qaeda, the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Jaish ul Adl, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other similar groups in the region including Majeed Brigade, as well as others, based in Afghanistan, continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security.
“They emphasised that strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan and countering the threats of terrorism, radicalism, and drug crime emanating from its territory are in line with their common interests in the region.”
To this end, Fitrat termed the idea of “Afghanistan posing any threat to other countries baseless”.
“Afghanistan is taking serious steps against corruption, drugs and all kinds of undesirable issues and considers this process its responsibility,” he said, stressing that the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan wants to establish positive relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect”.
Fitrat said “prioritising relations with regional and international countries in the context of security, stability and development in Afghanistan” was a “realistic” approach.
The Afghan government deputy spokesperson asserted that Kabul’s policy was “based on mutual trust, positive contacts and promotion of friendly relations and any false concerns or baseless allegations regarding Afghanistan are strongly rejected”.
JI delegation meets Afghan FM
Separately, a delegation of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) from Pakistan, led by JI Deputy Ameer Professor Muhammad Ibrahim, met with Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi during a visit to Afghanistan, according to a statement issued by the party.
The delegation included JI Deputy Ameer in Balochistan Dr Atta-ur-Rehman, JI Ameer in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa North Inayatullah Khan, JI Ameer in KP Central Abdul Wasi, and Dr Muhammad Iqbal Khalil, the statement said.
Muttaqi also posted about the meeting on X. According to a translator of his post, Pakistan-Afghanistan relations were discussed during the conversation.

Tang took bribes, including cash and property worth over 268 million yuan ($37.6 million) in various positions held from 2007 to 2024, Xinhua said.
The Changchun Intermediate People’s Court suspended his death sentence for two years, noting he had confessed to his crimes, it added.
China’s Communist Party expelled Tang in November 2024, six months after he was placed under investigation by the anti-graft watchdog and removed from his post.
Tang’s investigation was unusually swift and followed similar investigations into Defence Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor Wei Fenghe.
President Xi Jinping started a campaign of purges of China’s domestic security apparatus in 2020, seeking to ensure police, prosecutors, and judges are “absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable”.
Tang was governor of the western province of Gansu from 2017 to 2020 before being named minister of agriculture and rural affairs, according to official biographies.
In January, Xi said corruption is the biggest threat to China’s Communist Party and remains on the rise.</p><small>2025-09-28 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625932-daesh-commander-behind-2022-peshawar-bombing-killed-in-afghanistan-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Daesh commander behind 2022 Peshawar bombing 'killed in Afghanistan'</strong></a><br><p>

The HPV vaccine, first launched in Pakistan in 2022, has now been rolled out nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities.
In the latest incident yesterday, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor.
According to Kathian Sheikhan’s Station House Officer Sabir Iqbal Sindhu, the suspect “tried to attack the supervisor with a stick and by lifting a chair, threatened serious consequences and used foul language”.
“The sudden attack caused a stampede in the school, and the vaccination process had to be stopped immediately,” he added.
Statement of the affected supervisor
Speaking to Dawn on the telephone, Health Supervisor Shamim Anjum said that she and her team were forced to leave the school to save their lives.
She said that after the incident, she submitted a written application to the Kathian Sheikhan police station, following which a case was registered.
However, she added, “The assurance of security given by the provincial health minister on the first incident of September 25 has not been fulfilled yet, and no practical action has been taken by the police.”
The SHO said that a case has been registered on the complaint of the affected woman. The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered under sections 186 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the police, action has been initiated against the suspect, who will be arrested soon.
An HPV vaccination team was also attacked in Mandi Bahauddin’s Chak No. 38 on Thursday, in which a woman was beaten up by locals.
The provincial health minister of Punjab, Khawaja Imran Nazeer, had taken notice of the incident and issued instructions to provide security to female health workers. Health workers, however, say there has been no implementation given Saturday’s attack.
When contacted by a Dawn representative about the matter, Mandi Bahauddin’s Chief Executive Officer of Health, declined to comment, hanging up the phone.
The repeated incidents of violence are affecting the performance of the campaign, as health workers say that unless they are provided with police security, it will not be possible for them to perform their duties.
The HPV vaccination campaign is being implemented in three phases: Phase 1 covered Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Islamabad Capital Territory; Phase 2 will expand to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026; and Phase 3 will reach Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027.
Phase 1 of the campaign ran from 15–27 September. The goal is to vaccinate 90 per cent of girls aged 9–14 in Phase 1 regions by the end of 2025, and to sustain high coverage through routine immunisation in the coming years.</p><small>2025-09-28 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281250159db36e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945181/massive-crowd-chaos-preceded-deadly-india-rally-stampede' target='_blank'><strong>Massive crowd, chaos preceded deadly India rally stampede</strong></a><br><p>A stampede that killed dozens at a south Indian political rally happened after a crowd of thousands waited hours in baking heat without sufficient safeguards, officials and witnesses said on Sunday.
Some 27,000 people thronged a public road in Tamil Nadu state in hopes of seeing popular actor-turned-politician Vijay on Saturday, but panic broke out and 39 were killed, authorities said.
Witnesses cited hours of delays, insufficient police presence, and people falling from a tree branch onto the audience as contributing to the tragedy.
Tamil Nadu police have registered a criminal case against leaders of Vijay’s political party.
Senior police official V Selvaraj told Reuters that the filing of the case was the first step toward potential charges, “against TVK party senior leaders Bussy Anand, Nirmal Kumar and VP Mathiyalagan, and the investigation is under way”.
“TVK originally sought permission for a gathering of 10,000 people, but the actual crowd was more than double,” he said.
Deadly crowd incidents happen repeatedly during mass gatherings in India, often blamed on lax safety measures.
Vijay, known by one name, was addressing the rally when the crowds surged suddenly, forcing him to halt his speech in Karur district.
Videos on social media showed him tossing water bottles to supporters shortly before the panic broke out.
“My heart is shattered at this tragedy,” the 51-year-old star said in a statement.
State Chief Minister M.K. Stalin told reporters on Sunday that 39 people had died, raising an earlier toll of 36.
Nine children were among the dead, he added, announcing a judicial enquiry into the disaster.
State police chief G. Venkataraman said crowds had been waiting for hours under the hot sun without sufficient food and water after the public was informed that Vijay would arrive at the venue by noon.
“The crowds started coming in from 11am. He came at 7:40pm. The people lacked sufficient food and water under the hot sun,” he told reporters.
He added that 10,000 people were expected, but some 27,000 turned up.
Vijay launched his own party in 2024 and has drawn huge crowds at campaign events ahead of state elections due next year.
“I was pushed down by the crowd all of a sudden. There was absolutely no space to move,” B. Kanishka, a survivor, told the Hindu newspaper. “I subsequently fainted.”
Others said poor organisation and an hour-long wait left people restless before the situation spiralled dangerously out of control.
Karthick, a survivor, told the publication that the situation could have been prevented “if people were not forced to wait for hours together”.
“Poor planning and execution of the programme and lack of police personnel at the spot were also the reasons,” he said.
The Indian Express newspaper said panic spread after supporters who had climbed onto a tree branch fell onto the crowd below.
In January, 30 people were killed in a crush at a major religious fair, and last year 121 died during a Hindu prayer meeting in Uttar Pradesh.
In July last year, 121 people were killed in northern Uttar Pradesh state during a Hindu religious gathering.

It had taken time but the necessary trust had been gained — a tottering Pakistan were pinning hopes on Shaheen Shah Afridi to dig them out of a hole and, for a change, with the bat.
Bangladesh had reduced Salman Ali Agha’s men to 58-5 in their 2025 Asia Cup Super Four clash and Pakistan were searching for some inspiration when the transformed Shaheen hoicked Tanzim Hasan Saqib to the top tier of the Dubai International Cricket Stadium for the first six of the match.
Taskin Ahmed, Bangladesh’s most successful bowler of the night, was then clubbed for another in the next over to pave way for Pakistan to post a respectable 135-8; the defence of which he would later spearhead with the ball.
There is a viral video from the 2024 T20 World Cup in which Shaheen jokingly complains to the ICC crew for putting ‘bowler’ next to his name instead of ‘all-rounder’. Only days later, his unbeaten 16-ball 23 not out helped Pakistan to a respectable score against a much weaker and lower-ranked USA — a game they went on to lose and resulted in an upheaval in the T20 side — after a listless showing from batters had left Pakistan in jeopardy, much similar to this night in Dubai.
The two massive sixes had been anticipated from the moment Shaheen had walked into the middle ahead of all-rounders Mohammad Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf. This was only the fourth time in his T20I career that Shaheen had walked out to bat above number eight.
Such has been this tournament for him, after all. His runs have taken Pakistan to decent totals from embarrassing positions and they have come at scorching strike rates, turning his lower-order contributions into impactful knocks.

There was an uproar only days ago, in their opening Super Fours fixture, when Pakistan kept Shaheen in the dugout as India asphyxiated their middle order after a flying start to restrict them to 171. Shaheen had come into that game after being the second-highest scorer for Pakistan in the last two matches. His best T20I score of 33 not out off 16 balls had taken Pakistan to 127 against India in their first meeting of the tournament and his 29 not out off 14 had propelled them to 146 against UAE. He hit four sixes against India that were the most a batter had managed that night.
There have been instances in the Pakistan Super League when Shaheen has promoted himself up the order for the very job that needed to be done in the latter half of Pakistan’s innings during their Super Fours meeting with India. The most famous instance being the 2023 PSL final when he rushed out of the dressing room to cross the rope ahead of David Weise after the fall of wicket in the 15th over and smashed 44 not out in only 15 balls.
“My job is to deliver [for the team] whether it is in the batting, bowling or fielding,” Shaheen said during this Asia Cup. “I try to give my 100 per cent whenever I play regardless of whether I am sick or I am carrying an injury. I don’t show it because my job is to lift the morale and energy of the team.”

In Shaheen, Pakistan had found an attacking bowler who bowled at express pace and moved the new ball around. His high release point helped him extract bounce from the slow surfaces, but his most threatening weapon has always been his pitched up in-swingers.
He found success across formats and transformed into Pakistan’s all-format leader of the attack, before that ill-fated dive in Galle derailed his career.
Unable to run and bowl, it was during the days of his rehabilitation that Shaheen began to work on his batting. Later, in a PCB in-house video that captured his batting session, Shaheen recalled how he had always liked to bat, but only got the opportunity to work on it during the rehab.
And his efforts have started to pay dividends.
Shaheen has hit 23 sixes and 15 fours in T20Is and 22 and 14 of those have come since his return from the injury. He averages 16.41 and has been scoring at a strike rate of 134.13 since, a marked improvement from 9.50 and 95 from his pre-injury days.
That he had the greatest six-hitter Pakistan has ever produced at his house helped. A video of Shahid Afridi, his father-in-law, teaching him bat swing and feeding him under arm full tosses at the Moin Khan Academy in Karachi in early 2023 went viral. In the PSL that year, Shaheen made 133 runs at a strike rate of 168.35. The next PSL, his 107 runs were scored at 164.61. Across the 2023 and 2024 seasons, Shaheen hit 21 sixes and 13 fours.
Now, he’s unwaveringly translated that to the international stage.

In this Asia Cup, only five players from Pakistan have scored more than 80 runs and Shaheen’s strike rate of 188 is the best among them. In fact, his strike rate, among batters with at least 80 runs, is only bettered by Afghanistan’s Azmatullah Omarzai (217.07) and India’s Abhishek Sharma (204.63) in this tournament.
He has the joint-fourth most sixes in the tournament behind Sharma (19), Bangladesh’s Saif Hasan (12), and Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka (11). Sahibzada Farhan, who Pakistan brought into the side after a chart-topping PSL for his six-hitting abilities, has hit the same number of sixes as Shaheen.
What augurs well for Pakistan is that he seems to be peaking in both aspects of the game just at the right time as they head into the Asia Cup final against India as it was his lethal opening bursts that set Pakistan’s wins in the last two matches against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
He took a wicket each in the first over — which has now become his trademark — and dismantled their top orders inside the powerplay. Following his consecutive three-wicket hauls, he now has the joint-second most wickets in this tournament with nine scalps with each wicket costing 16 runs.

The last two years have not been a smooth sailing for Shaheen. He has been in and out of the side and has remained embroiled in off field controversies. He was sacked as the captain of the T20I side after only one series at the start of 2024 and was later quoted in a PCB media release without his consent that caused friction between him and the management.
 
 

He was dropped from the Test side after the first Bangladesh Test and again after the first Test against England. He was not included in the squad for the Tests in South Africa, despite the pitches there ripe for fast bowling, and was later dropped from the T20I side for the home and away series against Bangladesh in summer this year despite leading Lahore Qalandars to their third title. He is the only captain to have multiple PSL trophies.
There had been concerns about Shaheen’s waning bowling speed and effectiveness. And, in all fairness, he is yet to be as good as he was before the knee injury. But, the signs, of late, have been encouraging.
Shaheen has had wickets in every match of this tournament, except against India. He got smashed at 11.50 and 10.43 runs per over on the last two Sundays.
India’s batting dominance in this tournament has come at the back of the staggering top-order performances and the battle between the Indian openers and Shaheen sets for a spicy subplot.
T20 is a fickle format and it takes only one bowling spell or a batting cameo to take the game away from the opposition. Shaheen knows a thing or two about it. He had orchestrated Pakistan’s famous 10-wicket win over India in the 2021 T20 World Cup inside the first 2.1 overs and has proven himself as a reliable lower-order contributor with the bat over the last two weeks.
A bit of both this Sunday and he will not have to ask anyone to write ‘all-rounder’ next to his name.</p><small>2025-09-28 07:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/280759205720865.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945127/17-terrorists-eliminated-in-karak-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>17 terrorists eliminated in Karak: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>• TTP terrorists targeted in intelligence-based operation
• Four civilians killed in Bajaur blast, caused by old explosive device

LAKKI MARWAT/ BAJAUR: Seventeen militants were killed in an intelligence-based oper­ation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district on Friday night, while four civilians fell victim to an explosion in the Bajaur district on Saturday.
Three security personnel were also injured in the operation conducted in the Darshakhel area of Karak.
The operation was conducted “on the reported presence of khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and, resultantly, 17 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” it added.
Karak District Police Officer Shahbaz Elahi said that the police and security forces launched the operation in the remote rural area within the limits of Shah Slaim police station on information about the presence of militants there.
“We had credible reports that terrorists affiliated with the Mullah Nazir group of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban were present in the area with an intention to execute their nefarious plans,” he said.
He added that an intense exchange of fire took place when security personnel reached the area and started laying a siege around the mountainous hideouts of militants.
“The fierce gun battle lasted for several hours, resulting in the killing of 17 Fitna al Khwarij terrorists and their six accomplices were injured,” Mr Elahi said.
“The anti-state and anti-peace elements will not find any place to hide and the police and security forces will carry out joint operations to eliminate them,” the district police chief added.
Another police official said that heavy contingents of police and security forces remained present in the area on Saturday and continued search in the mountains on the border between Lakki Marwat and Mianwali districts for the injured and fleeing militants.
He said that announcements were made in the Darshakhel and adjacent villages and hamlets, advising people to stay indoors as the operation was underway.
“People were also advised not to allow anyone to enter their houses seeking shelter and cooperate with police and security forces,” he added.
Bajaur explosion
In Bajaur’s Lowi Mam­und tehsil, four people were killed and two critically injured when an un­­e­­xploded device went off in a field in the Laghari area on Saturday afternoon, officials and locals said.
They told Dawn that the tragedy occurred in the Laghari area around 3pm when a group of local youths were passing through the field.
Israr Khan, public relations officer of the district police in Khar, confirmed that the blast was caused by an old explosive device.
Riaz Ahmed Khan, a spokesman for Rescue 1122 Khar station, told Dawn that among the four fatalities, one person died at the scene, while others were pronounced dead upon arrival at Khar’s district hospital. He said that the victims were identified as Sajad Khan, 18; Nawshad Khan, 13; Faw­ad Khan, 18; and Jawad Khan, 15.
The official mentioned that 17-year-old Waqas Khan and 15-year-old Attaullah were among the wounded. They were initially taken to the district headquarters hospital in Khar but were later airlifted to a hospital in Peshawar via a specially arranged Frontier Corps North helicopter for adv­anced medical treatment.
Local political leaders from the ANP, JI, and PTI visited Khar Hospital to donate blood and express solidarity with the families.
PTI MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman said he would press authorities for the early return of displaced residents to their homes.
Talal Chaudhry
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Saturday that Pakistan’s response to militancy would be firm, suggesting those “who understand the language of bullets will be explained with bullets” if negotiations with Afghanistan fail to stop cross-border attacks.
 
 

Speaking at a press conference, he described Pakistan’s diplomacy as at a 75-year high and defended ongoing security operations.
Mr Chaudhry said terrorism remained the cou­ntry’s biggest challenge and insisted the government was committed to making Pakistan safe for investment.
“Today red carpets are being laid for the prime minister abroad,” he said, contrasting current diplomatic outreach with past isolation. He added that federal and provincial governments must cooperate closely on security.
The minister accused militants of entering Pakistan from across the border and charged that “80 per cent of terrorist attackers are Afghans”.
Mr Chaudhry said the government would streng­then measures to prevent cross-border infiltration, curb sectarian violence and stabilise restive areas.
He called on all political parties to unite for nat­io­nal development and noted that foreign observers acknow­ledged impro­vements in Pakistan’s security situation.
On media conduct, he warned journalists again­­st supporting “those who hide behind the guise of journalists” and critici­s­­ed what he described as “false vloggers” who, he said, traded national security for money. He said the government was taking action against such individuals and hinted that laws could be further toughened.

Sources said that the procedure was successfully performed by experts of the livestock and fisheries department — a second such procedure in recent months.
The experts included Dr Shalla Hayat, Dr Muhammad Ali Ayaz, Dr Javed Khoso, Dr Zulfiqar Haider Otto and Dr Muhammad Ali Gopang. The disease investigation was carried out by Dr Abdul Manan Khokhar, who is also the government focal person.
The 18-month-old camel — now affectionately named Chandni — is currently being kept under 24-hour observation at the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) shelter home, located in the Murad Memon goth.
A separate unit has been created at the facility to meet her intensive health needs. Officials say Chandni is recovering.

Female camel’s right hind leg surgically removed ‘to prevent infection’

Sources said her post-operation blood tests showed presence of a potentially life-threatening blood parasitic infection that had caused a significant drop in her haemoglobin level. This situation, they said, forced the medical board — constituted by the provincial government for her care — to consider treatment options that would minimise blood loss.
“The team had to amputate her right hind leg as there was no sensation in her limb. Second, it was a strategy to help prevent the spread of the infection that’s still being treated,” an official told Dawn.
He added that her multiple jaw injuries were attended to through “bone pinning techniques” — a surgical method in which a metal pin is inserted into the centre of the broken bone to hold the pieces in place when they heal.
According to her post-operation report, a copy of which is available with Dawn, “Both procedures were performed under local and dissociative anaesthesia. Both surgeries were bloodless and painless. The animal female camel Chandni is now out of danger and in complete senses,” it says.
The medical team reaffirms that the animal will be able to swallow food within two days and eat solid food within three to five weeks. Now the focus is on her health stability and vital control, it adds.
Sources said Chandni’s complete recovery was expected in two months, after which the team would reassess her condition and plan to fit a prosthetic limb.
Meanwhile, the chief minister has directed the officials concerned to ensure good care of Chandni until she fully recovers.
“Till she heals, experts in making artificial limbs should be consulted,” a statement released by CM House says.
It might be recalled that Chandni, earlier named Sumi, was “punished” for drinking water from a pond in a landlord’s field in Sukkur. The camel was later brought to the CDRS shelter in Karachi for treatment.
The poor camel had been battling multiple life-threatening injuries, including a crushed leg and multiple jaw fractures.
The police have claimed to have arrested two of the three suspects allegedly involved in the torture reported in the Januji area in taluka Salehpat, Sukkur.
According to the complainant, when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond, one of the suspects hit one of the camels with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor. The complainant said he kept pleading with the suspects to spare the camel, but they did not listen to him. According to the FIR, the suspects reacted angrily, saying that the camel had “destroyed their crops”.
 
 

Earlier, Cammie, another female camel, suffered a similar brutality in Sanghar as punishment for foraging in a landlord’s field.
She was able to stand on her feet with the help of a prosthetic leg following a major surgery in July this year.

The court proceeded with the hearing irrespective of objections from Mr Khan’s legal team, who requested a halt to the video link trial, insisting on his in-person appearance.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah resumed proceedings in the General Headquarters (GHQ) protest case as lawyers for Mr Khan submitted an application seeking his personal appearance. They urged the court to stop the trial being conducted via video link, where Mr Khan appears from Adiala Jail.
Raja Ikram Ameen Minhas, head of the prosecution, argued that a similar application had already been dismissed and the defence counsel did not challenge that order before the Lahore High Court. He alleged the defence filed the previously decided application to disrupt the court proceeding.

Judge overrules plea for ex-premier to appear in person; says he can’t stop the trial without an appellate forum’s restraining order

The judge observed that he could not stop the trial unless an appellate forum restrained him from doing so.
The court then recorded statements from three prosecution witnesses: Tehzeebul Hassan, Asmat Kamal and Akbar. The testimony of 44 of the 50 prosecution witnesses has now been recorded. The court summoned three more witnesses for a hearing on Sept 30.
The legal arguments on Saturday reflect an ongoing dispute over the trial’s format.
On Sept 19, Judge Shah had ruled that the trial would be held on court premises instead of at Adiala Jail but said Mr Khan’s attendance would be marked through a video link, an order passed after a Punjab government notification cited security concerns.
Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, faces multiple cases. He was indicted in December last year in the GHQ protest case and was formally arrested by Rawalpindi police in connection with it in January 2024.
His initial arrest from the Islam­abad High Court on May 9, 2023, triggered violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations were vandalised.
During Tuesday’s hearing, defence lawyers again sought a deferment to challenge the video link order, but the prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum.
The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement.
The prosecution has said it expects to conclude its evidence against Khan and other leaders of his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party next week, after which cross-examination of the witnesses is expected to begin.

The formal bilateral interaction between the two leaders was held at the Oval Office and was closed to the press. According to a statement issued from Pakistan, the leaders discussed regional security and cooperation on counter-terrorism, among other matters.

Calls Trump talks ‘very encouraging’

During an interaction with the media in New Jersey, aired on Saturday, the prime minister said the US was ready to share “techniques” with Pakistan in the areas of artificial intelligence, information technology and agriculture. He added that the US was also open to investment opportunities in the country.
At the airport, the PM along with the foreign minister and others was seen off by UN and US ambassadors.

Documents filed in a US federal court reveal new charges against the alleged assassin, Nikhil Gupta, incl­uding money laund­ering, credit card fraud, drug and arms trafficking, and atte­mpted murder of a person in Nepal or Pakistan.
According to fresh court documents, US gover­nment lawyers claim that the alleged murder-for-hire plot was not limited to New York but also included plans to kill another person in Nepal or Pakistan.
US prosecutors allege that former Indian RAW officer Vikash Yadav promised to supply firearms and even arrange clearance for an aircraft to transport weapons from India. This was allegedly intended so that Gupta could sell the weapons to a man he believed was a trafficker, who would, in turn, help him hire a hitman to target a Sikh separatist in the United States.
In WhatsApp messages dated June 22, 2023, Yadav allegedly promised to provide “assault rifles and pistols” and to “arrange for the clearance of an airplane to transport the weapons from India.”
On June 26, Gupta reportedly followed up, asking Yadav to check on the “toys,” a coded reference to firearms. Prosecutors say Yadav res­p­o­nded that he could obtain the weapons once the killing was complete.
US prosecutors argue that these exchanges show Yadav’s alleged support was conditional on Pannun’s assassination, linking the arms offer directly to the murder-for-hire plot.
Beginning in May 2023, when Yadav instructed Gupta to “save my name as Aman,” he told Gupta over WhatsApp that there were multiple targets, including one in New York (the primary victim) and another in California, and, by reference to addresses, at least one target in Nepal or Pakistan, according to a prosecutor’s letter to the judge.
Regarding the Nepal discussions, the government stated that Yadav provided Gupta with the target’s location to pass on to hitmen, whom Gupta described as “soldiers.” On May 8, Gupta wrote to Yadav that the men had “already arrived [in Nepal] and were looking for” the target. Yadav pressed Gupta to increase their payment and stressed that the task was “urgent.” In one message, Yadav instructed: “If they have really captured the target, they should kill him. Otherwise, we won’t get another chance.”
Prosecutors argued that communications between Yadav and Gupta about the Nepal task were substantially similar to their communications regarding the New York target and described the Nepal plot as “strikingly similar” to the Pannun plan.
Nikhil Gupta’s extradition, arrest
Gupta, also known as Nick, 53, was arrested in the Czech Republic on June 30, 2023, and extradited to the United States under the bilateral treaty between the US and Czech Republic. He arrived in the US on June 14 and was presented on murder-for-hire charges.
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said the extradition “makes clear that the Justice Dep­artment will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens.” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco described the plot as “a brazen attempt to silence a political activist for exercising a quintessential American right: his freedom of speech.”
FBI Director Christopher Wray emphasised that the bureau “will not tolerate attempts by foreign nationals, or anyone else, to repress constitutionally-protected freedoms in the United States.”
DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said the extradition was “the result of the hard work and commitment of the DEA New York Division’s Drug Enforcement Task Force” and praised international law enforcement cooperation, inc­luding the Czech Republic’s Nat­ional Drug Headquarters.
Assassination plot
According to court documents, Gupta conspired with an Indian government employee, identified as CC-1, to target a US-based Sikh separatist leader who advocates for Khalistan, a sovereign Sikh state. CC-1, a former RAW officer with training in battlecraft and weapons, allegedly directed the plot from India.
Gupta, a resident of India with prior involvement in narcotics and arms trafficking, attempted to contract a hitman to kill the US citizen. The supposed hitman was, in fact, a DEA undercover officer. CC-1 allegedly agreed to pay $100,000 for the murder, and an initial payment of $15,000 was delivered in Manhattan in June 2023.
The plot included surveillance of the target, with Gupta sending photos and updates to CC-1. Gupta instructed the undercover operative to avoid carrying out the assassination during upcoming US-India diplomatic engagements.
Nijjar’s murder link
On June 18, 2023, masked gunmen murdered Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was associated with the target and also led the Sikh separatist movement, outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia, Canada. Gupta informed the undercover operative that Nijjar “was also the target” and emphasised multiple potential targets. CC-1 later instructed Gupta to prioritize the main target.
Gupta faces charges of murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, each carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The case is being prosecuted by the southern district of New York, with the FBI and DEA actively investigating.
The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs coordinated with Czech authorities to secure Gupta’s arrest and extradition. Trial attorneys from the National Security Division and the US Attorney’s Office are handling the case.

ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: As the Punjab government on Saturday launched a survey to assess the losses caused by recent floods, the PPP urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to accept its demand for providing immediate relief to the flood-affected people through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The PML-N and the PPP — coalition partners at the Centre and in Punjab — have been at odds over how to help the flood victims, with the former’s government in Punjab insisting on using its own resources, while the latter is adamant about channelling the aid through the BISP.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan, Senator Palwasha Khan and the party’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leader Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha criticised the Punjab government, saying that the BISP already had the required data and was the most effective mechanism to assist flood-hit families.
Humayun Khan said the people were enduring severe hardships due to the floods, recalling that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had visited flood-affected areas in Punjab, and reiterated the demand for immediate relief through the BISP.
Palwasha Khan expressed regret over what she termed “unfortunate remarks” from some PML-N ministers against the PPP despite being coalition partners. “It is regrettable that the Punjab government has used such language for its coalition partner. The Punjab government says it will not bow down to anyone. Then why go to the IMF? The impression is being created that Punjab belongs to one party. Punjab is not the domain of any one party; similarly, no province is the exclusive domain of any party. All provinces of Pakistan belong to all Pakistanis,” she said.
She proposed that the electricity bills of flood-affected families be waived until they fully recover. She said the scale of the damage caused by the floods was immense and could not yet be fully estimated.
She recalled that BISP funds had previously been disbursed during the holy month of Ramazan and asked: “Why does the name of BISP cause so much pain?”
Without elaborating, she said that when the Punjab chief minister faced challenges, “the most vocal voices of support came from Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the PPP”.
 
 

Ali Shah Bacha criticised not only the PML-N but also the PTI’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for what he called its failure to help flood victims despite being in power in the province for the past 12 years. He said the floods in KP were different in nature from those in Punjab and Sindh, as they were caused by cloudbursts that wiped out entire villages and caused hundreds of deaths.
“The prime minister and the chief minister came for just one day, distributed cheques and left,” Mr Bacha said, terming the role of both the federal and provincial governments in rescue and relief efforts “disappointing”.
“The Punjab chief minister says they do not need the PPP’s advice. But when the PML-N government is in trouble, it remembers the PPP and its leadership. When the PML-N wants votes on a bill, it turns to Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari,” he added.
“If Maryam Nawaz is the daughter of Nawaz Sharif, then don’t forget that Bilawal Bhutto is the son of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto and the grandson of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” he remarked.
Flood losses survey
The Punjab government launched a survey to assess the losses suffered by people in the province due to recent floods, but refrained from giving any timeline for completing the exercise or for the start of compensation payments to the more than four million affected residents.
“Some 2,200 survey teams comprising 10,000 members of Pakistan Army, revenue, agriculture and livestock departments and district administration will carry out the survey. Full compensation to the affected families — Rs1 million for a completely destroyed house, Rs500,000 for a partially damaged house, Rs500,000 for loss of livestock, and Rs20,000 per acre (up to 12 acres) for farmers — will be provided based on the survey report,” Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said at the launch of the Punjab Flood Survey Campaign.
“We will make sure that every single flood victim is compensated and resettled. These survey teams are my eyes, ears and hands,” she said, administering an oath to the survey teams, whom she described as the “sons and daughters of Punjab”.
Indirectly responding to criticism from the PTI and PPP over what they termed her ‘flood photo/video shoot,’ the chief minister said: “If someone is working, the camera should show it because the public deserves to know what its CM is doing. We don’t seek the camera as the real work is happening, it speaks for itself.”
She said Punjab was working while other provinces were busy criticising it. The chief minister said she was often asked how she coped with criticism. “I say Punjab is progressing and that is why criticism exists. We close our ears to negativity and keep our eyes fixed on the goal,” she remarked, adding that people from other provinces wished to live in Punjab.
She thanked Pir Pagara for appreciating Punjab’s flood management.
The CM criticised the PPP for suggesting the use of the BISP database to help flood-affected people. “Distributing Rs10,000 to each flood-affected person through BISP data will do no good,” she said.
The PPP leadership, including MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, had urged the Punjab government to use BISP data instead of undertaking a lengthy survey to provide immediate relief to flood victims.
Tensions over loan remarks
As the dispute between the two coalition partners over the BISP issue continued, senior PPP leader Nadeem Afzal Chan said on X: “Punjab has emerged as the biggest borrower among all provinces, securing a staggering Rs405 billion loan from the State Bank in just the first 38 days (July 1 to August 8, 2025) of the current fiscal year (2025-26).”
Responding to the claim, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari threatened to sue Mr Chan under defamation laws and the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
“Chan Sahib, you were a decent man, but for the past few days it seems you are either under mental stress or deliberately running fake propaganda against Punjab,” she said, emphasising that the facts about the loan issue had already been shared with the media on Aug 26. “Now repeating this false narrative falls under Peca.” Ms Bokhari added that under the Punjab Defamation Bill, Mr Chan would have to prove the “fabricated news” in court.

The show of force by the government came as the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) escalated its campaign, vowing to shut down the region to protest what it calls the decades-long denial of fundamental rights. 
In Muzaffarabad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir, a core member of the action committee, toured several neighbourhoods with colleagues and dozens of followers. 
“Let it be clear once again: we are not running a campaign against any ideology or institution, but for the bona fide rights of our people that have been denied for over seven decades under one or the other pretext,” he told a cheering crowd in Plate.  

Traders vow to keep shops open

“The lockdown will send a loud and clear message that enough is enough. Either grant the rights or face the wrath of the people.” 
He said the lockdown was plan A, while the alliance had also prepared plans B and C. “And plan D,” he warned, “is the harshest.” 
While the government has not publicly outlined its strategy for the Sept 29 event, officials said strict security measures have been established.  
On Saturday, large convoys of vehicles carrying armed police and paramilitary personnel conducted flag marches in almost all district headquarters. Heavy contingents were also deployed at city entry and exit points, with strict surveillance at sensitive sites. 
Separately, traders’ associations announced they would forgo their  weekly holiday and keep shops open on Sunday to allow citizens to  purchase essential food and household items ahead of the planned  lockdown. 
At the Muzaffarabad  meeting, Divisional Commissioner Chaudhry Guftar Hussain noted that  federal and AJK ministers had already held “open-hearted” dialogue with  the JKJAAC but stressed that peace must be ensured collectively.  “Disorder and lawlessness benefit no one,” he remarked. 
District  Magistrate Mudasser Farooq, speaking at the same meeting, warned that no  one would be allowed to disrupt public life or free movement. 
“Maintaining  peace is a shared responsibility of the administration, police, and  citizens,” he said. “We have no quarrel with anyone, but our mission of  public service will continue at all costs.” He added that safeguarding state property, including vehicles and machinery, was the “foremost duty of all employees.”
