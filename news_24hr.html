Authored by Justice Athar Minallah, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, while extending the benefit of doubt, ordered the acquittal of all charges against petitioner Anwar Keneth after accepting his jail plea but with a direction to release him if not required in any other case.
 
 

In a nine-page judgement, the bench consisting of Justices Athar Minallah, Irfan Saadat Khan and Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan also expressed the expectation that the Pakistan Institute of Mental Health (PIMH) executive director, where the petitioner was being treated, will ensure continuation of his medical treatment.
The blasphemy case against Mr Keneth was registered on Sept 25, 2001, by the Gawalmandi police for alleged offences under Section 295C of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Bench says elderly suspect diagnosed with mental illness, prosecution failed to prove case beyond reasonable doubt

The complaint registered by Inspector Nasrullah Khan Niazi concerned the Aug 27, 2001, letter to a person named Haji Mehmood Zafar and following investigation, a report under Section 173 CrPC was filed before the competent court. The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge framed and admitted writing the letter.
 
 

The trial court convicted the appellant under Section 295C and sentenced him to death with a fine of Rs500,000. The high court later confirmed the death sentence.
Subsequently, a jail petition sent through the prison superintendent was received by the Supreme Court in 2014, whereas the letter was sent to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) on March 12, 2024.
Later, the PIMH medical board diagnosed the petitioner as suffering from ‘Bipolar Affective Disorder’ (a disorder causing extreme mood swings, including emotional highs and lows) and that the mental disorder was in the ‘hypomanic’ stage. The medical board also advised admission of the appellant to the institute for treatment.
In its order, the Supreme Court regretted that the prosecution in the case produced only two witnesses, Maulana Naeem Akhtar Adnan (PW-1) and Haji Mahmood Zafar (PW-2). The investigating officer of this case did not enter the witness box. It appears that the prosecution, besides producing two witnesses, made no attempt to prove its case against the appellant, the order regretted.
The judgement said the appellant professes the religion of Christianity and that the letter was attempting to propagate and profess his faith with a claim that ‘he belonged to the Juda tribe and a descendant of King David’.
The appellant claimed to be the ‘King of Israel and rule the whole world,’ and asserted that the ‘great Lord of Heavens will establish the Kingdom in Israel’.
In his letter, he attempted to build an argument that his faith was the true religion, the judgement said, adding that the entire letter unambiguously showed its author was suffering from some mental disorder.
The conduct of the appellant during the investigation and the trial was not that of a sane person, the judgement said, adding the contents of the letter reflected signs of grandeur, hallucination, and delusional flight of ideas.
Though the abnormality was obvious from the conduct and contents of the letter, neither the prosecution nor the trial court had the appellant medically examined by specialists in the field of psychiatry.
According to the judgement, the offence under section 295C is penal and attracts the punishment of death. It added that it was a settled principle of criminal administration of justice that the prosecution has to prove its case against an accused beyond a reasonable doubt and it was not absolved of this duty if the accused has been unsuccessful in proving a plea in his/her defence.
The appellant was not aware that his actions were influenced by the mental disorder from which he was suffering, the judgement noted, adding that the culpability of the offence for which the appellant was charged required establishing the ‘actus rea’ and ‘mens rea’.
The opinion of the medical board has raised a serious doubt regarding the existence of criminal intent or ‘mens rea’.The CII, in its interim report, has rightly observed that the followers of all religions enjoy the right to profess, practice and propagate their respective beliefs but the exercise of such right is subject to law, the judgement said.

Mr Gandapur left for Dera Ismail Khan after saying farewell to his staff at the chief minister’s house, despite his resignation not yet being formally accepted by the province’s governor.
In his first media interaction after resi­g­ning, Mr Gandapur had pressed for the swift acceptance of his resignation on Thu­rsday night. He said any delay in the process would be detrimental to the province.
 
 

However, the resignation cannot be processed until the governor reviews it. An official on Governor Faisal Karim Kundi’s staff told Dawn the governor was in Islamabad and not expected to return to Peshawar until Saturday (today).

Withdrawal is pending as governor is out of town

“The resignation letter may have arri­ved in mail but I could not say anything in this regard right now,” the official said.
A spokesperson for Gandapur confirmed the chief minister’s departure in a statement, noting that a large number of employees from the chief minister’s house and secretariat were present to see him off. Mr Gandapur thanked the staff for their cooperation during his tenure.
Upon reaching Dera Ismail Khan later in the afternoon, Mr Gandapur was greeted by supporters at the Yarak Interchange who showered his convoy with rose petals. In a brief address, Mr Gandapur reiterated that his political career was focused on public service rather than power.
“My politics was never about power but about serving the people,” Mr Gandapur said, stressing that the trust of his constituents remained his “greatest strength despite his resignation”.
 
 

Meanwhile, a leader from Gandapur’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, said they were awaiting the governor’s approval.
“The moment Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi approves the resignation, the process for the election of the new chief minister would be started,” the PTI leader said.
He noted that any decisions about a future provincial cabinet would be made by the nominee for chief minister, Sohail Afridi, after meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan.
 
 

According to Article 130 (8) of the Constitution of Pakistan, “the Chief Minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the Governor, resign his office.” The governor can, however, invoke Article 133 to ask the chief minister to continue his duties as an interim arrangement until a successor is in place.

“The president of the republic has nominated Mr Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister and has tasked him with forming a government,” the Elysee Palace said in a statement as the deadline he had fixed to appoint the premier ended on Friday.
Lecornu, in a message on X, said he accepted his reappointment “out of duty”, adding that “we must end the political crisis” gripping France.
“It is my duty to accept the mission entrusted to me by the President to do everything in my power to give France a budget for the end of the year and to respond to the everyday problems of our compatriots.

Macron reappoints him after consulting parties, except two largest stakeholders in assembly

“We need to put an end to this political crisis, which is exasperating the French people, and to this instability, which is bad for France’s image and its interests.”
Earlier, Macron welcomed mainstream political leaders to a crunch meeting at the Elysee, as the country’s central bank chief warned political turmoil was sapping growth.
Before the reappointment of PM Lecornu, Macron was looking for a sixth prime minister in less than two years. The gathering was aimed at finding a figure whose appeal spans the centre-right to centre-left in order to steer the budget for 2026 through a fragmented and fractious parliament.
Party leaders from the left, right and centre arrived at the Elysee, but the far-right National Rally (RN) and hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) — two of the largest political parties in the National Assembly — were excluded.
While reacting to the reappointment of PM Lecornu, RN President Jordan Bardella said, “The Lecornu II government, appointed by Emmanuel Macron who is more isolated and out of touch than ever at the Elysee Palace, is a bad joke, a democratic disgrace and a humiliation for the French people.”
Socialist Party lawmaker Francois Kalfon said, “Our scepticism grows by the day. We want something concrete on the pension reform. We are not afraid to return to the polls.”
National Assembly President Yael Braun-Pivet said, “I note the reappointment of Sbastien Lecornu as Matignon. For weeks now, the National Assembly has been in full working order, ready to play its role to the full: debating, scrutinising and voting. Now it’s time to get down to work. It’s about time!”

In the latest mass attack targeting the energy system as winter approaches, electricity was interrupted in nine regions, and around 854,000 consumers were temporarily without power across the country.
In southeastern Ukr­aine, a seven-year-old was killed when his home was hit, and at least 20 people were injured.
In Kyiv, an apartment block in the city centre was damaged by a projectile, while on the left bank of the  Dnipro that divides the capital, crowds waited at bus stops with the metro out of action and people filled water bottles at distribution points.
“We didn’t sleep at all,” said Liuba, a pensioner, as she collected water. “From 2:30am there was so much noise. By 3:30 we had no electricity, no gas, no water. Nothing.”
Ukraine’s air force said it downed 405 of 465 drones and 15 of 32 missiles in the attack. Moscow said its overnight strikes were a response to Ukr­aine’s attacks on Russian civilian facilities.
The assault was among the heaviest concentrated strikes on energy infrastructure, Ukranian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. Her deputy, Oleksiy Kuleba, said two million customers in Kyiv temporarily faced problems with water supplies.
Ukrainian President Vol­­odymyr Zelenskiy said Russia’s main target ahead of the heating season is civilian and energy infrastructure and called for more support from Kyiv’s allies. “What’s needed is not window dressing but decisive action from the US, Europe, and the G7 in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,” he said on X.
 






Ukraine’s Energy Min­ister Svitlana Hrynchuk met with G7 ambassadors to discuss how allies could help protect the country against further attacks and repair the damage.
Ukrainian private ene­r­gy firm DTEK said its thermal power plants suff­ered significant damage. The government said it ex­­pe­cted to restore the water supply to the capital by the end of Friday.

Because of its proximity to rivers, it is a fertile region but prone to disastrous flooding. This is not just because of the rivers but also due to the mismanagement of the embankments and headworks. Besides its delicious mangoes, dates and pomegranates, the district has also produced dozens of (in)famous and powerful politicians for decades now. We can mention a few of the ruling clans here — the Dastis, Gourmanis, Qureshis, Khars, Jatois, and Sials.
The scions of these clans have, each in line with their influence, contributed to the district’s underdevelopment. A large majority of the district’s people remain destitute, marginalised and vulnerable to periodic disasters. They are at the mercy of both large landlords and callous bureaucrats. Both official and independent sources identify Muzaffargarh as one of Punjab’s poorest districts, which is deprived in terms of land ownership, consumption, education, sanitation and housing rights. For instance, its literacy rate is estimated as being 30pc lower than that of central Punjab. Its population density too is far less than that of central Punjab. These two indicators suffice to highlight the difference in human development in the two regions. The tale of Muzaffargarh is the tale of the Seraiki belt too.
 
 

Now consider the scale of the recent flood losses. The Rapid Need Assessment Report of UN-OCHA published on Sept 23 and covering 18 flood-affected districts in Punjab states that 4.2 million people were impacted. Shockingly, more than 3m were in just five districts of the region, which account for nearly 64pc of the total 28 flood-affected districts. Muzaffargarh appears to be the most devastated district in Punjab as far as its share in the overall affected and displaced populations is concerned. Out of a total of 2.8m displaced people, 33.6pc or 0.92m belonged to the district, followed by Jhang 14pc, Bahawalpur 13pc, Khanewal 11.5pc and Multan 10pc. The report concludes that “The top four most vulnerable hotspots are Muzaffargarh, Jhang, Bahawalnagar and Khanewal”. On food insecurity, too, the report finds that, of those interviewed, between 61pc and 81pc of respondents expressed fear of food shortages in the coming weeks in the southern districts.

The differences between Punjab’s northern and southern districts are the outcome of deliberate negligence spread over decades.

Though the National Disaster Management Authority’s website showed only four fully and 234 partially damaged houses in the whole of Punjab until Sept 25, the OCHA report shows as many as 46,000 fully and 115,700 partially damaged homes in the province. South Punjab remains at the top. However, interestingly, the UN-OCHA report shows very few damaged schools in south Punjab in comparison to the rest of the province. This is intriguing. Lower literacy levels in the Seraiki belt is a result of the skewed children-school ratio. The literacy rate is likely to drop in future should the government fail to repair the damaged schools quickly.
These differences between the northern and southern districts are not a result of any organic development. This is the outcome of deliberate and sustained negligence spread over decades. As each flood disaster washed away schools, illiteracy continued to rise or literacy levels remained stagnant. Since the 1992 super floods, Muzaffargarh district has suffered from three colossal flood disasters and four not-too-large calamities.
As in 2025, in 2010 too Muzaffargarh’s share in Punjab’s total losses was the highest. As in the case of previous flood disasters, the 2025 floods once again uncovered the regional, class, power and gender inequalities. A wise man once said that in contradictions lie hope. Either we heal the root causes of these contradictions and remove their drivers or continue to survive with the contradictions that we have been living with for centuries now.
But perhaps the status quo will not be sustained (think Nepal) for long — unless, in the words of Senator Mushahid Hussain, “a healing touch” is witnessed. If that did not happen in the last millennium, it may not take place in the future either. But the recent statement of a federal minister provided some clue. He said that the ‘entrenched elite’ was not only responsible for violating the law of the land but also for causing flood destruction and meting out miseries to the poor. I have no reason to disagree with his blunt outburst. Rather, we must be thankful for his straight talk, though unfortunately, he appears to be serving the interests of the same elite. So, let us move ahead. If the elite constitute one end of the stick, the people make up the other. But the kind of democracy we have legitimises the same elite that the people resent.
So, in Lenin’s words, what is to be done? If most of the people’s vulnerabilities are likely to emanate from the policies of the elite, then so are their miseries and losses. This can’t be reversed unless people reform the situation through peaceful and sustained pressure.
The elite mismanage dams, embankments, barrages and headworks. They fail to implement laws, rules and policies in letter and spirit. Our Constitution, in particular Articles 37, 38 and 140A, our public policies on disaster management and our commitments under various UN conventions provide sufficient grounds for pressuring the elite. Moreover, the concept of ‘build-back-better’ is a vital pillar of the disaster-reduction framework. The concept is not, as some tend to believe, limited to physical structures; it also means ending socioeconomic vulnerabilities and building the capacities of ordinary people — so that today’s vulnerable segments can be enabled to cope with disasters on their own, and, hence, lessen the burden on the exchequer.

• Hamas expected to release 20 living Israeli prisoners after which Israel will release 1,950 Palestinians
• US plans 200 troops deployment for task force
JERUSALEM: Thousands of ­displaced Palestinians streamed back towards their abandoned homes on Friday after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect and Israeli troops began pulling back from parts of Gaza.
A huge column of displaced Gazans filed north through the dust and rubble towards Gaza City, the enclave’s biggest urban area, which had been under attack just days ago in one of Israel’s biggest offensives of the war.
“Thank God my house is still standing,” said Ismail Zayda, 40, in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City. “But the place is destroyed, my neighbours’ houses are destroyed, entire districts have gone.”
The Israeli military said the ceasefire agreement had been activated at noon local time (0900 GMT). Israel’s government ratified the ceasefire with Hamas in the early hours of Friday, clearing the way to partially pull back troops and fully suspend hostilities in Gaza within 24 hours.
Hamas is expected to release the 20 living Israeli prisoners within 72 hours, after which Israel will release 250 Palestinians serving long terms in Israeli prisons, and 1,700 others detained in Gaza during the war.
US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said the Israeli military had completed the first phase of a withdrawal in Gaza and the Israeli, prisoners’ release period had started.
 
 

Once the agreement is operating, trucks carrying food and medical aid will surge into Gaza to help civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom have been sheltering in tents after Israeli forces destroyed their homes and razed entire cities.
Israeli troop pullout
In Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, some Israeli troops pulled back from the eastern area near the border, but tank shelling was heard, according to residents.
 
 

In Nusseirat camp in the centre of the enclave, some Israeli soldiers dismantled their position and headed east towards the Israeli border, though other troops remained in the area after gunfire was heard in the early hours of Friday.
Israeli forces pulled out from the road along the Mediterranean coast into Gaza City.
“As soon as we heard the news of the truce and ceasefire, we were very happy and got ready to go back to Gaza City, to our homes. Of course there are no homes — they’ve been destroyed,” said Mahdi Saqla, 40.
“But we are happy just to return to where our homes were, even over the rubble. That too is a great joy. For two years we’ve been suffering, displaced from place to place,” he added.
US to deploy troops for Gaza task force
The United States will deploy up to 200 troops to Israel to establish a task force to support stabilisation efforts in Gaza, but no Americans are expected to be deployed into the Palestinian enclave, US officials said on Thursday.
The US military’s Central Command will stand up the task force, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Center, or CMCC, one of the officials said.
The CMCC’s job will be to facilitate the flow of assistance into Gaza, including security assistance and humanitarian aid, officials said.
Two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US troops would be the core of the CMCC, but it would also include representatives from Egypt’s military, Qatar, Turkiye and probably the United Arab Emirates.
The officials said the joint control centre would coordinate with Israeli forces and other security forces to avoid clashes.
“No US troops are intended to go into Gaza,” said one of the officials.
Gaza reconstruction
Meanwhile, Germany wants to organise an international conference with Egypt for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday, as Israel and Hamas edged closer to ending hostilities.
The main goal of this conference “should be to address the most urgent needs, such as rebuilding water and energy supplies and medical care”, Merz said in a statement.

Bound by an agreement with Kashmiri leaders, its people lived under direct federal control, with no say in their future. It was only in 2009 that the then PPP government gave it back its name, discarding the colonial label of ‘Northern Areas’. A legislative assembly, a chief minister, and a governor followed, an arrangement trumpeted as the birth of a fifth province. But beneath the fanfare, the structure was hollow: the assembly had meagre powers, every decision remained hostage to Islamabad, and the promise of equality with Pakistan’s provinces proved illusory.
Encouraged by the idea that full provincial integration was their rightful due, the people began pressing successive PML-N governments for equal constitutional rights as citizens. An irritated government sought to defuse the discontent by forming a committee, this time under Sartaj Aziz, the then adviser on foreign affairs. A principled individual, Aziz produced a report endorsing most of the people’s demands. Meanwhile, the government faced another challenge in the form of a Supreme Court case on the issue. Hearings were delayed while the government introduced a new decree — the Gilgit-Baltistan Order 2018 — claiming it would ensure “political empowerment and good governance” in the region, ostensibly based on the committee’s recommendations.
When the PTI assumed power, the issue was still before the Supreme Court, which had questioned the GB Order 2018 and directed the government to present a revised framework ensuring that the rights enjoyed by GB residents equalled those accorded to other Pakistanis. The result was the GB Order 2019, a draft the court reviewed and even endorsed, raising genuine expectations in GB that the constitutional deadlock was nearing resolution. Yet, those hopes soon collapsed: the government failed to implement the order, and the court let the matter drift. Though hearings were later scheduled on a petition, reportedly no stay order was issued. Taking advantage of this passive process, the federal government quietly sidestepped the ‘troublesome’ decision. As a result, the region remains bound by the discarded GB Order 2018, an arrangement the Supreme Court itself had directed be replaced six years ago, exemplifying how successive governments disregard binding judgments, thereby undermining the process of granting long-denied constitutional rights to a strategic region that has remained loyal to Pakistan. Unless addressed, the present unrest over multiple governance issues could escalate into a broader movement for constitutional rights, one that anti-state actors might exploit, with potentially tragic consequences for this historically peaceful region.
It is a farce that the very political parties which denied GB its constitutional rights, despite making loud promises before the last assembly elections, are once again preparing to peddle the same slogans as the next polls approach. Once more, they will vow integration as a federating unit, if not permanent then at least provisional, with token representation in parliament. And once more, with the help of their pliant local ‘leaders’, these hollow declarations will be recycled and sold to voters, who in their desperation may fall for the deceit.

The upcoming polls in Gilgit-Baltistan are a rare opportunity to reset governance in the area.

The litmus test of intent lies not in the electioneering noise but in the manifestos of the three major parties, published on their official websites. I read them closely, line by line, expecting some clarity of purpose where policy positions are laid bare. This should have been the basis for our local leadership, political parties, and educated citizens to make informed choices, rather than being short-changed yet again by opportunists masquerading as champions of GB.
When manifestos are released, many expect them to reflect serious commitments. And they do mention GB, including special regional development, inclusion in federal awards, and fiscal allocations. But none of the three major political parties, namely the PPP, PTI and PML-N, make a clear and binding promise to settle GB’s constitutional status as a province or provisional province.
The PTI’s 2024 manifesto, for instance, promises “regional development and social inclusion … focus on areas such as … Gilgit-Baltistan …” but does not mention granting it provincial status or full constitutional rights. The PML-N similarly refers to allocations and reforms involving GB, but again, its texts do not pledge constitutional provincial status. The PPP is the only one that comes closest, promising its inclusion in the National Finance Commission award and fiscal autonomy. It refers to the GB Empowerment Order, but the wording stops short of a binding constitutional amendment.
What emerges, instead, is a damning report card. The manifestos, coupled with the historical record, expose how the people of this resource-rich but sensitive region remain trapped under governance by decrees, orders, and notifications drafted in bureaucratic corridors and rubber-stamped by ‘leaders’ with no real stake in the future of this region.
For GB’s educated class and opinion leaders, this should be a moment of reckoning. The solution to every core problem lies in meaningful constitutional rights with assured representation in the institutions where policy is made, and protection under the same legal framework enjoyed by the other federating units. Today every province has a voice in the fate of CPEC, but the very region that is Pakistan’s gateway to China is excluded, occasionally represented only as a token gesture through handpicked ‘leaders’.
The upcoming elections in GB are a rare opportunity to reset governance in the region. Voters and civil society should insist that every political party — the three major parties and all others — meet these non-negotiable conditions before receiving public support.
i) Each party must include an explicit, categorical promise in its manifesto to grant full constitutional rights to the people of GB with a realistic timeline for implementation.
ii) The parties currently in power (the PML-N and PPP) must promptly implement the Supreme Court’s orders and formally notify the Draft Governance Order 2019, replacing the GB Order 2018.
iii) Every party must publish a transparent, step-by-step framework for integrating the region as a province.
If any party refuses these conditions, civil society should lead an organised voter-education campaign urging the electorate to withhold support from that party until it complies. Continued disregard for judicial verdicts and the denial of constitutional rights to a region under de facto state control are unsustainable. The status quo is not a choice. The electorate must demand clarity, compliance and a credible route to full constitutional enfranchisement for Gilgit-Baltistan.

LAHORE: The numbers paint a grim picture: Pakistan ranks as the world’s third most polluted country according to World Population Review 2025, while Germanwatch’s Climate Risk Index 2025 — analysing three decades of data from 1993 to 2022 — places the nation at the very top of the list of countries most ravaged by climate change. From Lahore’s annual smog siege that sends residents scrambling for air purifiers to the black smoke billowing from brick kilns dotting the city’s periphery, the evidence is visible in the grey skies above Pakistan’s major cities.
It is against this backdrop that DawnMedia, under its Breathe Pakistan project, is convening a critical conversation on the crisis. The Air We Breathe: A Focused Conference on Air Pollution, will be held at Lahore’s Expo Centre today (Saturday), bringing together experts, policymakers, and industry leaders to confront one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing the country.
The conference has drawn high-level attention, with judges of superior courts, federal and provincial ministers, technical experts and foreign dignitaries set to grace the event. The day-long gathering will feature multiple sessions tackling the multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan’s air quality crisis.
 
 

Key discussions will span governance, financing, and regional cooperation — from “Better Governance for Air Pollution” and “A Greener Punjab to Combat Air Pollution” to “Financing Clean Air for Pakistan”. Sessions will also examine “The Smog Equation”, explore “Tackling Trans-Boundary Air Pollution in South Asia: Diplomacy and Regional Cooperation”, and chart pathways for “Developing a National Air Quality Management Framework for Pakistan”. The health dimension will be addressed in a dedicated session on “A Health Crisis in the Smog”, acknowledging the toll that toxic air takes on millions of Pakistani lungs each year.

DawnMedia hosts seminal conference on air pollution today

Speaking about the conference, Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani, the chief executive officer of DawnMedia, said, “Building on the success of the first Breathe Pakistan conference, The Air We Breathe one-day conference focuses on a single pressing, and vital aspect of environmental degradation. As Punjab heads into a period when air quality indices nosedive, The Air We Breathe aims to explore viable policy options, practical solutions, and collaborative frameworks across public, private, and academic sectors.”
 
 

The timing is deliberate — as winter approaches, Punjab braces for its annual air quality emergency when cooler temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, turning the province’s skies into a toxic blanket. Ms Saigol-Lakhani added that attendees could expect a series of high-impact sessions on air quality management, climate governance, financing for clean air initiatives, the role of the judiciary in securing citizens’ rights to clean air, and data-driven environmental action.
The conference has garnered broad political support, with endorsements spanning the spectrum — from government figures to opposition voices and civil society stakeholders working on environmental issues.
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari thanked DawnMedia for taking the initiative, calling it particularly timely given Pakistan’s precarious position as one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. She termed the move a national service, noting that the country was bearing the brunt of climate change effects in the form of devastating floods, cloudbursts, and increasingly erratic monsoon spells. “Creating awareness among the public and bringing together all the departments and institutions concerned is a national service,” she added, underscoring the need for coordinated action across sectors.
Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan echoed this sentiment, calling the programme the need of the hour. “Our country is in trouble due to climate change and projects like Breathe Pakistan were required to counter the challenge and create awareness among the people,” he said. He stressed that every citizen should make a contribution to make the climate better — a reminder that while policy and governance are crucial, individual action remains an essential piece of the puzzle.
Abid Omar of the Pakistan Air Quality Index, a community-led initiative to monitor air pollution, described air pollution as the most pressing issue facing Pakistan today. “It’s an internal threat. It’s a clear and present danger. Every year, over 100,000 people are dying from air pollution. It is causing a tremendous loss to our economy,” he said, his words highlighting a crisis that kills more Pakistanis annually than many recognise — a silent epidemic claiming lives through respiratory diseases, heart conditions, and stroke.
The economic toll is equally staggering: lost productivity, healthcare costs, and reduced life expectancy translate into billions in economic damage, draining resources that could fuel development.
Mr Omar, who will be among the experts attending the conference, expressed the hope that DawnMedia, in convening this critical gathering, would prove “seminal in making the policy required to clean Pakistan’s air” — a recognition that while the data documenting the crisis is clear, what Pakistan desperately needs now is actionable policy and political will.
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman also lauded the Breathe Pakistan initiative, emphasising that the country desperately needs greenery and trees. “Trees should be planted and they should be protected. The mafia involved in deforestation should be controlled and the government should be pressured to not support such mafias,” he said, alluding to the powerful timber and land-grabbing interests that have stripped Pakistan’s forests — from the dwindling conifer forests of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the mangroves along the southern coast — at alarming rates.
Deforestation not only removes nature’s air filters but also accelerates soil erosion and reduces the land’s capacity to absorb carbon emissions. “If we want clear air and save ourselves from climate change, initiatives like this conference should be supported,” he added, calling for collective action beyond partisan politics.
The DawnMedia CEO outlined the conference’s robust institutional backing: “The Air We Breathe is being held in collaboration with the Environment Protection and Climate Change Department, Government of Punjab and the United Nations as our principal partners, the Pakistan Business Council as our knowledge partner, and IPSOS, CFP, and Carbon Track as our research partners.” The partnership structure reflects the multidimensional nature of the air quality challenge — requiring coordination across government, international agencies, business, and data-driven research.
She added that The Air We Breathe builds on the momentum from the first conference “by shifting the focus from pledges to practical, tangible measures to reduce air pollution.
We’re also introducing new mechanisms to track progress and sustain accountability, ensuring that what began as conversation now translates into long-term, measurable action.”
The emphasis on accountability signals a departure from Pakistan’s long history of environmental commitments that fade once the cameras stop rolling.
Ms Saigol-Lakhani said the conference focused on the quality of the air and everyone should attend it to become better informed and be agents of change in their own spheres. “But more specifically, this conference is for policymakers, industry leaders, urban planners, environmental experts, academics, and students who want to play an active role in shaping Pakistan’s response to the air quality crisis,” she explained.
The speaker lineup reflects this cross-sectoral approach: Federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal and Musadik Masood Malik, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Supreme Court justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha Malik, and Jawad Hassan, Punjab Environment Prot­ection and Climate Change Secretary Silwat Saeed, UN Resident Coor­dinator Mohamed Yahya, Emma Fan of the Asian Development Bank, and Zafar Masud of the Bank of Punjab will be among those addressing the gathering — a mix of judicial authority, political leadership, technical expertise, and financial institutions necessary to drive systemic change.

Shortly after the shooting, two policemen depl­oyed on the opposite side of the road retaliated and killed him.
 
 

CCTV footage showed a suspect carrying a pistol approached the worship place, Baitul Mehdi, in Rab­wah and opened fire on the security guards, who were volunteers from the community. Six gu­a­­­rds were injured, but they managed to close the main gate of the worship place.
The injured guards were shifted to a nearby hospital where four were reported to be stable while two remained critical. Police shifted the body of the attacker to the morgue.
Attack condemned
Ahmadi community spo­k­e­sperson Aamir Mahm­ood condemned the attack, saying that continuous hate speeches were being made against the community. He urged the state to take notice of such hateful rhetoric and take strict action against those responsible. He demanded effective measures to ensure the safety of Ahmadi community members.
 
 

Chiniot DPO Abdullah Ahmad told Dawn that the worship place had been attacked by a gunman, resulting in injuries to six private security guards.
He said police and the guards returned fire, killing the attacker on the spot. One of the guards was in critical condition, while five were stable, he added. He said the attacker had arrived in a car along with another person. His identification card was recovered from the vehicle.

As per reports, explosions were heard in the Afghan capital on Thursday, though the Taliban government spokesman claimed there was no harm done. When the ISPR chief was asked during a presser on Friday to comment on Mehsud’s reported elimination, he neither confirmed nor denied it but repeated the official demand that Afghanistan take action against terrorists on its soil.
He also added that Pakistan will do “whatever is necessary” to protect its citizens and territory. On Thursday, the defence minister had also raised the issue in the National Assembly, saying that the state was deliberating over sending another delegation to Kabul to convince the Taliban to “dismantle safe havens” that were being used by the terrorists.
 
 

The fact is that the Afghan Taliban, despite their denials, have hosted terrorists of various persuasions on their soil. For example, the US strike that took out Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in the Afghan capital in 2022 left the Taliban red-faced, as it was a clear violation of the Doha Agreement between them and the Americans. Therefore, it is not implausible that Noor Wali Mehsud was eliminated while in Kabul.
Pakistan has in the past launched cross-border attacks into Afghanistan, while pursuing terrorists responsible for violence in this country. It is, indeed, a complex situation; the state must act as terrorists, many taking refuge on Afghan soil, martyr civilians and soldiers in brazen attacks. Yet going after militants across the border is not without risk, as it could inflame matters further with the Taliban regime.
 
 

Pakistan does not have many good options in this regard. On the external front, it appears that the best course may be to continue relaying the message — bilaterally and together with regional partners such as China, Russia and Iran — to the Afghan Taliban that sheltering terrorists will have costs, such as reduction in trade activities, or downgrading of diplomatic relations.
Kabul must be told that the current situation — where terrorists seek refuge on Afghan soil but the Taliban government remains in denial — is not tenable. What the Afghan Taliban do with their militant ‘guests’ is their problem; Pakistan and the rest of Afghanistan’s neighbours must be assured that their security will not be threatened by these malign actors.
Internally, along with kinetic actions to take territory back from the militants, there is also a need to pursue the non-kinetic elements of NAP, which the ISPR head alluded to. This was a process that had the buy-in of all state institutions.

• Dozens of personnel hurt; TLP alleges casualties from police firing
• Trenches dug up to block marchers on G.T. Road; Chenab, Jhelum bridges sealed
• Talal warns against violence or ‘mob blackmail’
• ATC grants 12-day remand for 110 TLP activists
LAHORE: The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) began marching towards Islamabad after Friday prayers, with a large number of supporters reaching Shahdara and staging a sit-in after clashes with police, partially paralysing the provincial capital.
The law enforcers repeatedly tried to contain the procession near the group’s headquarters by erecting barricades and containers and using tear gas and other crowd-control measures.
In the Gujrat district, local authorities on Friday night dug up trenches at least three locations along the G.T. Road to block the march headed towards Islamabad.
However, the TLP, led by its chief Saad Rizvi, not only managed to take out the main procession in Lahore as part of its “Gaza March” but also kept on moving ahead amid religious slogans, rendering the police helpless.
Reports suggest that protests turned violent following Friday sermons delivered by prominent religious figures of the organisation at local mosques before the march began to move towards Islamabad from Lahore’s Multan Road.
Video circulating on social media appeared to show protesters commandeering heavy vehicles, including cranes reportedly belonging to government departments such as the Lahore Waste Management Company, Rescue 1122 and the Punjab police, to use them in the procession.
Scuffles reportedly broke out soon after TLP chief Saad Rizvi delivered a major sermon at the main Friday congregation at the central mosque near the organisation’s headquarters on Multan Road.
Later, he addressed a big rally and gave the party workers the go-ahead to move towards Islamabad as per the given plan.
Confrontations were reported at multiple locations along Multan Road, including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, near the Civil Secretariat, Bhati Gate, Azadi Chowk and Ravi Bridge (Shahdara).
Witnesses said some protesters occupied sections of the Orange Line track to throw stones at police, injuring several officers. Protesters were seen carrying sticks, rods and bricks.
Police responded by firing tear-gas shells and, according to witnesses, warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd.
 
 

On some occasions, the two sides were seen chasing and repelling each other. Sources said three police vehicles were seized and some personnel briefly taken hostage and assaulted, turning stretches of Multan Road into a battleground and disrupting life for nearby residents.
A second wave of major scuffles was reported near Azadi Chowk, where several police vehicles were damaged and many officials were injured.
Footage on social media showed officers retreating for cover; two superintendents of police were also seen taking positions at safer locations. One video showed an officer being knocked to the ground and bleeding.
Police sources said dozens of officers were injured, some seriously, after being pelted with stones and attacked by baton-wielding protesters. The TLP said many of its supporters were injured and alleged that some had died from police firing during the march. Neither claim could be independently verified and no official casualty figures were released.
Authorities also accused TLP-linked social media accounts of circulating old images and videos to inflame tensions. By evening, hundreds of TLP workers had gathered near Ravi Bridge awaiting further instructions from Mr Rizvi.
Talal’s presser
State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of holding protests to misuse the issue of corruption for political gain, reiterating that the government would not allow any group to use violence or blackmail the state. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he said policy is clear: peaceful protest within the democratic and constitutional framework is a constitutional right. “There is no space for groups to blackmail others, to use mobs, or to use violence to achieve their demands or objectives,” he said.
 
 

Mr Chaudhry said hundreds of suspects planning violence had been identified, and that provincial governments had already made arrests. “For the government, stopping around 2,000 people is not a problem, but a policy decision was made to use minimum force,” he noted.
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday handed 110 TLP activists to police on a 12-day physical remand in a case relating to violent protests and attacks on law enforcers. Police produced the suspects before the court and sought their custody for interrogation. ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill approved the remand and directed police to conduct the investigation strictly in accordance with the law.
Nawankot police have registered an FIR alleging the suspects attacked law enforcement personnel, opened fire, resorted to violence and damaged public property during a protest.
Those remanded include Qari Umar Farooq, Basharat Ali, Qari Shabbir Farooqi, Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar, Qari M. Hussain, Qari Muharram Aslam, Qari Khurshid, Hammad Ali, Imran Hussain, Ghulam Nabi, Nazir Hussain aka Nazir Chishti and Muhammad Usama. The judge ordered police to produce the suspects again upon completion of the remand for further proceedings.
Meanwhile, local authorities in the Gujrat district on Friday night dug trenches at least three locations along the GT Road.
Earlier in the day, both bridges over the Chenab and Jhelum rivers were sealed by parking heavy vehicles across the carriageways. Entry to and exit from Gujrat via several other points were also curtailed for vehicular traffic.
However, pedestrians were still allowed to cross the bridges, though officials warned this may become difficult today if further vehicles are added to the barriers.
Trenches have been dug near the Jhelum bridge at Sarai Alamgir and on the Wazirabad side of the Chenab.
For the first time, a trench has also been dug on GT Road within Kharian city to render vehicular movement virtually impossible. Previously, such trenches were typically limited to approaches near river bridges, including during the 2021 TLP march.
A senior law-enforcement official said preparations were in place to create additional trenches at various points along GT Road within the Gujrat district if the march cannot be contained in Gujranwala.
Heavy containers have also been parked at multiple locations in Gujrat city and in the towns of Lalamusa, Kharian and Sarai Alamgir.
The closures have paralysed daily life, with numerous social and business events postponed. The local business fraternity voiced concern over the prolonged blockade and urged the government to adopt a viable policy to tackle such situations without crippling commercial activity.

The FO, moreover, also emphasised the need for continued dialogue and cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism.
At the weekly FO briefing, spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the security and well-being of its people.”
 






Pakistan “respects the sovereignty of Afghanistan, and remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering dialogue and cooperation with our neighbour to address the shared challenges of terrorism”, the spokesperson said, adding that the security operations were intelligence-driven and aimed at protecting its citizens from terrorist groups, including the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement came after twin explosions shook Kabul on Thursday night. Local Afghan media, quoting witnesses, reported fighter jet overflights and bursts of automatic gunfire. They described the blasts as precision air strikes that hit a vehicle and a compound linked to the TTP, suggesting that the intended target was TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud.
Meanwhile, reports on Noor Wali Mehsud’s fate were conflicting. Some Pakistan military-linked social media hailed the strike as a potential blow to the TTP leadership, while pro-TTP channels released an audio message purportedly from the TTP chief denying his death and calling the reports “enemy propaganda”. The incident marks one of the most serious escalations between the two neighbours since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021.

Stresses continued dialogue, cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism, says Afghanistan’s sovereignty is respected

Analysts say that if confirmed a Pakistani strike inside Kabul would be the first such incident in the Afghan capital, although Pakistan has previously conducted operations against TTP targets in other parts of Afghanistan.
Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces patience has worn out,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said a day earlier in the National Assembly.
Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the Foreign Office briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.
Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.”
India-Afghanistan agreement
The Foreign Office refrained from commenting on the agreement between New Delhi and Kabul to reopen their long-shuttered embassies.
The agreement was reached during talks in New Delhi between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Afghanistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, which marked India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021.
“Our position on Afghanistan’s bilateral relations with any other country remains that it is a matter between those two countries,” Mr Khan said, adding, “Afghanistan is a sovereign, independent country, and we do not have any particular comment to offer on it.”
He further noted that Pakistan’s consistent request to Afghanistan, while respecting its sovereign right to pursue an independent foreign policy, has been that Afghan territory should not be used against Pakistan.

A day after he stepped down as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister — on the directive of PTI founder Imran Khan — it seemed that his resignation got lost in red tape, with the Governor House denying having ever received it.
Officials at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat told Dawn that Gandapur’s resignation had been delivered to the Governor House on Wednesday night — the same day he was asked to vacate the post. A copy of the letter seen by Dawn showed it was received by the governor’s staff at 10:57pm.
However, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who was in Islamabad on Thursday, and other officials at the Governor’s Secre­tariat remained tight-lipped about the issue.
An official on Kundi’s staff told Dawn that they were yet to receive the resignation letter. “As far as I know, the resignation has not yet reached the Governor’s Office,” the official said, adding that the governor would sign it whenever he received it.
Meanwhile, speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Kundi described reports regarding the receipt of the resignation letter at the Governor House as “fake news”.
While ambiguity surrounds the whereabouts of Gandapur’s resignation letter, the PTI has picked Sohail Afridi, an MPA from the Khyber district, as his potential replacement. But, to assume the CM’s office, he will first have to ensure the backing of the majority for himself in the 145-strong KP Assembly.
Dissolution and election
It is understood that the provincial cabinet is also dissolved when the CM’s resignation is accepted.
While the Constitution does not explicitly elaborate on this, lawyer Asad Rahim explained to Dawn.com that “it has developed as a strong convention supported by constitutional interpretation”.
He referred to Article 130(1) of the Constitution, which states: “There shall be a cabinet of ministers, with the chief minister at its head, to aid and advise the governor in the exercise of his functions”.
This can be read to imply that power flows through the CM to the cabinet, and once the head is gone, the rest dissolves automatically, he said. Relevant instances that demonstrate this are of Mohammad Azam Khan’s demise in 2023, when he was the caretaker KP CM and Jam Kamal stepping down as the Balochistan CM. About Kamal’s case, Rahim said, “His cabinet was deemed to have been dissolved as well despite no mention of him saying so in his resignation”.
So Gandapur’s cabinet will also most likely be dissolved when, and if, his resignation is accepted.
After accepting his resignation, the governor would have to call a session of the provincial assembly for the election of the new CM.
For the election of a chief minister following general elections, Article 130 of the Constitution states: “The provincial assembly shall meet on the 21st day
Following the day on which a general election to the assembly is held, unless sooner summoned by the governor.
“After the election of the speaker and the deputy speaker, the provincial assembly shall, to the exclusion of any other business, proceed to elect without debate one of its members to be the chief minister.”
But, it is silent on how swiftly the election is to be conducted when a CM resigns without completing their tenure.
Rahim said there didn’t seem to be an explicit time frame in the Constitution for the governor to summon the assembly to hold the CM’s election following a resignation.
“In fact, Article 133 states that ‘The Governor may ask the chief minister to continue to hold office until his successor enters upon the office of chief minister’,” he said.
However, he also cited a Lahore High Court judgement issued regarding the delay in oath-taking of Hamza Shehbaz Sharif after he was elected as the Punjab Assembly CM in 2022.
The judgement refers to Article 130(3) of the Constitution, which states: “After the election of the speaker and the deputy speaker, the provincial assembly shall, to the exclusion of any other business, proceed to elect without debate one of its members to be the chief minister.”
Rahim explained that the provision only applied when a CM was to be appointed following a general election and not a resignation, and the judgement also used the term “earliest election” without giving a specific time frame.
The judgement, however, does underline that the use of the words “exclusion of any other business” in the provision directed the “the prompt exercise to elect the chief minister”.
“The mandate of this Article manifests the importance of the earliest election of the chief minister. Certainly, without the cabinet, the assembly would not be able to perform its functions and the chief minister, being head of the cabinet, who has to constitute/formulate his cabinet, must have been elected without further loss of time after the election of the speaker and the deputy speaker so that the government is functional.
“From this analogy, it can safely be concluded that whenever the office of the chief minister falls vacant, the same shall be filled promptly by election keeping in view the desire of the Constitution and Rules 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the Rules of Procedure framed under the mandate of the Constitution in terms of Article 67 read with Article 127, which provide the procedure for completion of the election within two unified days from summoning of the session,” the judgement states.
How many votes count?
A candidate shall be elected as the CM by “votes of the majority of the total membership of the provincial assembly”, according to clause 4 of Article 130 of the Constitution.
The Constitution further explains that if no member secures the required majority votes in the first poll, a second round of contest shall be held between the two members who garner the highest votes.
“The member who secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting shall be declared to have been elected as chief minister, provided further that, if the number of votes secured by two or more members securing the highest number of votes is equal, further polls shall be held between them until one of them secures a majority of votes of the members present and voting,” the Constitution states.
After a Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court rendered the PTI ineligible for reserved seats in national and provincial assemblies, its position in the 145-member KP Assembly has weakened.
The opposition currently holds 52 seats, while the government, according to the PTI, has the backing of 93 MPAs, around 40 of whom are those who had filed nomination papers as independent candidates from the very beginning and later decided to support the PTI.
The remaining PTI-aligned independent MPAs had initially submitted nomination papers as PTI candidates during the 2024 general elections. But after the Election Commission of Pakistan stripped the party of its electoral symbol, a bat, they eventually contested elections as independents.
Going by these numbers, hopefuls for the CM office need to secure at least 73 votes in the 145-member assembly to win the election.
This means that the opposition’s candidate would need the support of just 21 members from the treasury benches— which doesn’t seem unachievable given the fissures within the PTI.
What are the chances?
The opposition leader seems hopeful about their chances of fielding a candidate who would manage to defeat the PTI’s candidate.
Earlier, Opposition Leader in the KP Assembly Ibadullah Khan, reportedly told Dawn.com that he had called a meeting of opposition members on Tuesday to discuss the future strategy. “The political situation in the province, following the resignation of the chief minister, which was an expected development, will be thoroughly reviewed and a comprehensive strategy will be discussed,” he said.
However, the meeting wasn’t held due to the unavailability of opposition MPAs.
Ibadullah, who is from the PML-N, highlighted that there were a large number of independent candidates in the KP Assembly — albeit them backing the PTI — and added, “Elections do lead to upsets […] Everything is possible in politics.”
But, PPP MPA Mohammad Ali Shah said while speaking to Dawn.com that it was too early to say anything about the elections.
“We, including the joint opposition, will reach a consensus to nominate a favourable candidate,” he said, adding that after seeking instructions from PPP Chairperson Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari, his party would jointly devise a strategy with the rest of the opposition.
“We need a CM who can successfully deal [with] the current security situation in KP. We need a CM who can fight for provincial rights,” he emphasised.
Senior journalist Lehaz Ali, meanwhile, does not see the opposition outperforming the PTI in the election for CM. He was not of the opinion that a forward bloc could create an upset for the PTI.
“PTI members seem well convinced that any move against the party decision would damage their public image,” he said while speaking to Dawn.com.
Ali further stated that Afridi’s nomination was a “message that Imran Khan would be doing aggressive politics going forward”.
On this, Special Assistant to the KP Chief Minister on Population Welfare Malik Liaqat commented while speaking to Dawn.com that “Sohail Afridi’s nomination was Imran Khan’s decision. Each member will stand with this decision”.
“Afridi has never been a part of any group. The opposition can continue to dream however they like,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-10 22:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10232832bfc2b26.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947923/security-forces-repulse-attack-on-di-khan-police-training-centre-at-least-3-terrorists-killed' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces repulse attack on DI Khan police training centre; at least 3 terrorists killed</strong></a><br><p>At least three terrorists, including a suicide bomber, were killed in retaliatory fire by police forces after an attack on a police training centre in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan was repulsed on Friday night.
DI Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed that three terrorists were killed by police forces and added that a large contingent of security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area.
Police confirmed that the training centre premises were cleared and all terrorists involved in the attack were killed.
A search operation, led by DPO Sahibzada, was also conducted in the surrounding areas to ensure no other terrorists were present.
A large contingent of security forces reached the incident site soon after the attack commenced and cordoned off the area. Earlier, there were reports of a loud explosion in the vicinity of the police facility.
DI Khan Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Yaqoob Khan earlier told Dawn.com that a “suicide bomber and two terrorists have been killed”.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the district a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday.
Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area.
According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.</p><small>2025-10-10 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628019-can-pakistan-reverse-its-dismal-record-on-ocean-protection' target='_blank'><strong>Can Pakistan reverse its dismal record on ocean protection?</strong></a><br><p>

“We can confirm there has been an explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems in the Bucksnort area,” located in Hickman County, Tennessee, the local sheriff’s office wrote on Facebook.
“Emergency services are currently on the scene working to address the situation,” it added.
The mayor’s office in Hickman County told AFP that it could not immediately confirm any fatalities or the cause of the explosion.
Hickman County Mayor Jim Bates told CNN the plant did not have a history of safety problems, although there was a small ammunition explosion there in 2014. That incident killed one person and injured three, according to the Tennessean newspaper.
However, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis reported “some” fatalities and added that several people were missing in the “very devastating blast” that engulfed an entire building at the facility.
“We do have several people at this time that’s unaccounted for. We are trying to be mindful of families and that situation,” Davis said. “We do have some that are deceased. But we’re going to go back and, like I say, talk to these families, notify these families.”
Davis said authorities had secured the area, but warned of the possibility of smaller explosions around the site.
Accurate Energetic Systems, an explosives manufacturer founded in 1980, develops, manufactures and stores explosives for “military, aerospace, and commercial demolition markets,” according to the company’s website.
The 1,300-acre headquarters in Bucksnort, Tennessee, includes eight production buildings and a quality lab.

“Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the Afghan Defence Ministry said in a post on social media.
For its part, Pakistan remained tight-lipped on the issue, with the the military spokesperson neither confirming nor denying the strikes when questioned about them at a press conference earlier in the day. The Foreign Office, meanwhile, did not respond to a request for comment till the publication of this report.
On Thursday evening, residents in the border town of Marghi reported that a market selling second-hand weapons had been bombed. Around the same time, Afghan government spokesman Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabeehullah Mujahid confirmed on X that an explosion “was heard in the city of Kabul”.
Many social media accounts speculated that TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud was targeted, but Mujahid refuted the reports in an interview with Anadolu Agency and claimed Mehsud was not present in Kabul or Afghanistan.
The development comes amid Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s first visit to India. During the visit, New Delhi announced it was upgrading its mission in Kabul to a full embassy.
The top Afghan diplomat addressed the Kabul incident while speaking at a press conference, saying: “There has been an attack near the border in remote areas. We consider this act of Pakistan wrong. Problems cannot be solved like this … We have kept the door to discussion open. They should solve their problem on their own.
Earlier, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry did not directly respond when questioned whether Pakistan was responsible for the attacks. “To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,” he told reporters.
Surge in terrorism
Terrorism has surged in Pakistan since the withdrawal of US-led troops from Afghanistan in 2021 and the return of the Taliban government.
The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistani Taliban (TTP), a separate but linked group to the Afghan Taliban, along with its affiliates, is behind most of the violence — largely directed at security forces.
A lieutenant colonel and a major were among 11 security personnel martyred in an exchange of fire with the TTP in the Orakzai district earlier this week.
The federal government and the army have repeatedly accused Kabul’s authorities of harbouring terrorist groups that launch attacks on Pakistani soil with impunity.
Earlier this year, a UN report said the TTP “receive substantial logistical and operational support from the de facto authorities”, referring to the Taliban government in Kabul.
 
 

A day earlier, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the National Assembly that several efforts to convince the Afghan Taliban to stop backing the TTP had failed.
“We will not tolerate this any longer,” Asif said. “United, we must respond to those facilitating them — whether the hideouts are on our soil or Afghan soil.”
He warned that any response could cause collateral damage. “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough,” he added. “The Pakistani government and army’s patience has run out.“
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also said the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border.
Pak-Afghan tensions
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
With ties between the two neighbouring countries already strained, PM Shehbaz had issued a stern message to Kabul last month, saying Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP.
The prime minister said terrorists entered Pakistan from Afghanistan and, together with the outlawed TTP, carried out attacks that martyred soldiers, brothers, sisters and ordinary citizens. He added that Pakistan was willing to maintain relations with Afghanistan, but if Kabul chose to side with and support the terrorists, then Pakistan had nothing to do with the interim Afghan government and the terrorists would be eliminated at any cost.
Differences between Pakistan and Afghanistan are primarily centred on security and border disputes. Pakistan has made terrorism its central concern in ties with Kabul, citing a sharp rise in attacks by the banned TTP and other militant groups operating from Afghanistan.
Further exacerbating tensions has been the issue of repatriation of Afghan refugees by the federal government, a move that has been criticised by the Taliban authorities.
During a meeting in January held in Peshawar, political leaders had urged Field Marshal Asim Munir that the military engage with Afghanistan to address Pakistan’s internal security problems. The army chief, however, said the Afghan interim rulers had failed to heed repeated warnings in the past. “They don’t listen to us,” sources quoted the field marshal as telling politicians who had called for formal or informal dialogue with the interim Afghan government.
Lack of action by Afghan authorities against terror outfits has also led to reprisal by Pakistan in recent months.
At least three people were killed and seven wounded in two separate incidents in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and Khost provinces in August. Afghan authorities claimed the fatalities were caused by strikes carried out by Pakistan. There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incidents.
Pakistan has targeted terrorist camps in Afghan territory in the past: most recently in December last year, when Pakistani jets bombed positions in Pak­tika province, targeting TTP members.
At the time, the Foreign Office had avoided di­r­ectly commenting on the claim, but admitted that Pa­k­­i­stani forces conducted “operations in border areas to protect the people of Pakistan from terr­­­orist groups”. A number of cross-border infiltration bids have also been foiled.</p><small>2025-10-10 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101812054f89dc3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947905/karachi-university-student-dies-after-being-run-over-by-campus-bus' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi University student dies after being run over by campus bus</strong></a><br><p>A Karachi University student died on Friday after being run over by a campus bus, police said.
The victim was identified as a second-year student of the social work department by traffic police inspector Akmal Rai.
According to police reports, the student had gotten off at a point near the Mehmood-ul-Hassan Library and was attempting to cross the road when another bus passed by her.
Meanwhile, a campus bus, bearing registration number EB-0333, attempted to overtake the first bus and hit the student from the driver’s side.
The student, knocked down by the initial impact, was then run over by the bus, killing her on the spot. The accident angered students, resulting in protests inside the campus.
A notification issued by the university dated October 10, and available with Dawn.com, said an inquiry committee has been constituted to “investigate the tragic incident”.
“Vice Chancellor is pleased to constitute an inquiry committee forthwith to investigate the tragic incident in which a female student succumbed to death,” the notification stated.
Per the notification, the convenor of the committee is the chairperson of the Department of Criminology Prof Dr Naima Saeed, with members including in-charge transport NED University of Engineering and Technology, a final-year student of the social work department M Alam, and another student from the social work department Ms Sarwat.
“The committee is instructed to investigate the incident and submit its report in 15 days,” added the notification.</p><small>2025-10-10 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101410187183149.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947881/venezuela-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-wins-nobel-peace-prize-dedicates-award-to-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado wins Nobel Peace Prize, dedicates award to Trump</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado received the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
The committee chose to focus on Venezuela at this time, in a year dominated by US President Donald Trump’s repeated public statements that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.
Machado was on this year’s TIME Magazine “100 most influential People” list, where current US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said she was the “personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism”.
“She is receiving the prize for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” said Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo.
“As the leader of the democratic forces in the Venezuela, she is one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times,” he said.
 






He said that Machado had been a “key unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided; an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free election and representative government”.
“This is precisely what lies at the heart of democracy: our shared willingness to defend the principles of popular rule even though we disagree. At a time when democracy is under threat, it is more important than ever to defend this common ground,” he said.
He stated that Venezuela had evolved from “a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal and authoritarian state” that was suffering from a humanitarian and economic crisis.
“Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty even as the few at top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against its own population. Nearly eight million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution, and imprisonment,” he said.
He further said that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime made carrying out political work in the country “extremely dangerous”, adding that Machado stood up for free and fair elections more than 20 years ago.
Frydnes said that the Venezuela opposition leader had spoken out for judicial independence, human rights, and popular representation.
“She has spent years working for the representation of the Venezuelan people,” he said. He further said that Machado was the opposition’s presidential candidate for the 2024 elections, but her candidacy was blocked by the regime.
“She then backed the representative of another party Edmundo González Urrutia in the elections. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised across the political divides. They were trained as election observers to ensure a transparent and fair election.
“Despite the risk of harassment, arrest, and torture, citizens across the country held watch over the polling stations. They made sure the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy ballots and lie about the outcome,” he said, adding that the efforts of the collective opposition were innovative, brave, peaceful and democratic.
Frydnes went on to say that democracy was a pre-condition for lasting peace. “However, we live in a world where democracy is in retreat. Where more and more authoritarian regimes are challenging norms and resorting to violence.”
He said the repression of the Venezuelan population by its regime was not unique. “We see the same trends globally. Rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation.
“In 2024, more elections were held than ever before. But fewer and fewer are free and fair.”
Noting that she has been forced to live in hiding in the past year, he said, “Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.”
Frydnes said that Machado “embodies the hope for a different future — one where the fundamental rights of citizens are protected and their voices are heard”.
US President Trump had made no secret of his desire to win this year’s prize.
Since returning to the White House for his second term in January, the US leader has repeatedly insisted that he “deserves” the Nobel for his role in resolving numerous conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated.
But Nobel Prize experts in Oslo had insisted in the run-up to Friday’s announcement that he had no chance, noting that his “America First” policies run counter to the ideals of the Peace Prize as laid out in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will creating the award.
Machado dedicated the award in part to Trump.
“Oh my God … I have no words,” Machado told the secretary of the award body, Kristian Berg Harpviken, in a phone call which the Nobel Committee posted on social media.
 






“I thank you so much, but I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement of a whole society. I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve it,” she added.
She later said, in an X post in English: “I dedicate the prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!”
 






Last year, the prestigious prize went to the Japanese anti-nuclear group Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The prize comes with a gold medal, a diploma and a prize sum of $1.2 million.
The award will be presented at a formal ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of the prizes’ creator, Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel.
The Peace Prize is the only Nobel awarded in Oslo, with the other disciplines announced in Stockholm.
Will she be able to attend ceremony?
It was not immediately clear whether she would be able to attend the award ceremony in Oslo.
Should she not attend, she would join the list of Peace Prize laureates prevented from doing so in the award’s 124-year history, including Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov in 1975, Poland’s Lech Walesa in 1983 and Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991.
Machado is the first Venezuelan to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the sixth from Latin America. Her three adult children are living abroad for safety reasons.
The United Nations human rights office welcomed the award to Machado as a recognition of “the clear aspirations of the people of Venezuela for free and fair elections”.
The head of the award committee, Joergen Watne Frydnes, said he hoped it would spur the Venezuelan opposition’s work.
“We hope that the entire opposition will have renewed energy to continue the work for a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” Frydnes told Reuters after the announcement.</p><small>2025-10-10 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10134306cecf605.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947773/weight-of-trauma-mental-health-in-humanitarian-emergencies' target='_blank'><strong>Weight of trauma: Mental health in humanitarian emergencies</strong></a><br><p>The recent floods across Punjab have upended lives once again, displacing nearly 2.8 million people and affecting more than 4.2m, according to a Rapid Needs Assessment report from the United Nations. Amid the devastation, survivors are struggling not only with loss and uncertainty but with deep psychological distress that shows no sign of easing.
A mother’s silent struggle
Nazeera Bano, 39, a mother of four from Bait Nabi Shah village in Muzaffargarh’s Tehsil Alipur, has been having sleepless nights since this year’s floodwaters swallowed her home and forced her family to seek shelter in a government-donated tent. Now living with relatives in a nearby village, she said, the flashbacks of the ordeal still play out vividly in her mind, leaving her anxious and on edge.
“My daughter is getting married next year, so we had all the dowry kept in the house. When the water entered, we barely had time to save anything. We brought the jewellery with us and some essential items, but not everything could be carried. I am now extremely worried. We are poor. How will we arrange for this again?” she said.

“I get flashbacks of what my house looked like before and what it looks like now. I get nightmares of drowning along with my family. We have been told that we’ll head back home soon, but I am not sure how to forget about it.”
Displacement, she continued, has been far from easy. For years, her biggest concern had been getting her daughter married. Every penny went into saving for her dowry, much of which was lost to the floods. Her husband now fears they might have to sell the daughter’s jewellery just to get by. The thought, Bano added, has left both her and her 19-year-old daughter deeply anxious. Even though her daughter’s in-laws endured the same ordeal, she worries they may not understand the family’s financial loss.
“They are still expecting so much. How can I sleep at night in such circumstances?” she lamented.
Bano’s ordeal shows the quiet anguish of countless families uprooted by the floods. While their homes and livelihoods may one day be rebuilt, the emotional toll is harder to recover from. Yet in most relief efforts, mental health remains an afterthought. When some survivors were asked about their jazbaat — their feelings — many did not even understand what they were being asked.

The weight of trauma
This year’s World Mental Health Day theme, “mental health in humanitarian emergencies,” strikes a chord in Pakistan, where floods have left millions vulnerable. The World Health Organisation estimates that one in five people in such crises develops a mental health condition, yet psychological support remains scarce.
Dr Fauziah Rabbani, Professor of Public Health and Implementation Scientist at the Brain & Mind Institute, Aga Khan University, and Amna Siddiqui, Consultant at the Brain & Mind Institute, told Dawn.com that floods contribute significantly to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) risk because exposure is often both severe and prolonged.
PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a terrifying event, often causing flashbacks, nightmares, and severe anxiety.
“A recent analysis found PTSD prevalence in flood victims to be about 30 per cent as survivors witness injury or death, lose their homes and belongings, and experience repeated aftershocks of fear during ongoing rains or displacement, which can overwhelm coping mechanisms,” they said.
They explained that many survivors experience repeated losses, such as homes, livelihoods, and livestock, which mirror known risk factors linked to elevated PTSD rates.
Displaced individuals often display symptoms including anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts or flashbacks. Physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and rapid heart rate are also common.
Citing the Pareshan study, conducted by the Brain & Mind Institute following the 2022 floods in Sindh’s Badin district, they said: “Approximately 23 per cent of adults had mild to moderate anxiety and 24 per cent had mild to moderate depression, indicating a large burden of psychological symptoms as assessed through standardised psychometric tools.”
Maha Iftikhar, a Clinical Assessment Specialist at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (Lums), observed visible trauma in shelters. “Even when people appear to be coping, there are physical manifestations of stress in the form of appetite loss, difficulty sleeping, and constant worry,” she told Dawn.com. Children often show fear through clinginess or outbursts, while adults display fatigue or irritability.
The pain of losing more than homes
Journalist Akhtar Soomro, who travelled throughout Punjab to report on the floods, described the profound impact of the disaster on families, saying that while people were sad about losing their crops and machinery, they were most affected by losing their animals.
“Families have a bond with their cattle: they name them, treat them like family members, and love them very much. Because of this, people were even more saddened by losing their animals,” Soomro told Dawn.com.

In Kasur and along the Sutlej River, some families refused to evacuate, staying in homes surrounded by water to protect their livestock. Even during Rescue 11 operations, villagers resisted, saying, “We do not want to go. We will stay here. No matter what the water level is, we will go to the roofs.”
Soomro also noted the hidden toll on men. “Male members of a family often don’t cry openly, and it is very hard for them. Seeing their house empty and belongings scattered after a disaster is extremely painful. Even prosperous families are mentally affected despite having resources,” he observed.
The physical echoes of trauma
The stress of displacement manifests in the body as much as the mind. Dr Monica Vaswani, Psychiatrist and Assistant Professor at Karachi’s Asghar Psychiatric Hospital, explained, “People are not just emotionally shaken; their bodies also carry the trauma. We see patients with somatic complaints directly linked to the stress of displacement and loss.”
Bushra Jabeen, Clinical Psychologist at Ittefaq Hospital Lahore, added that prolonged exposure to disaster conditions erodes coping mechanisms, especially for women and children.  “Even when people appear to manage externally, internally the stress is accumulating and affecting their health,” she said.
Both professionals stressed the importance of recognising trauma holistically, acknowledging that the psychological impact of disasters extends beyond the mind and can manifest physically, requiring integrated support for both mental and physical health.
The endless strain of displacement
For Saeed, who hails from Baharewali in Mauza Azmatpur, the floods stole everything. “The government cannot compensate for the loss we have incurred. First of all, we did not get any help,” he told Dawn.com.
He paid to save his family and animals, only to return to a village in ruins. “All our property has been lost,” he said.
Each day brings new worries, including how to rebuild, where to find food, and how to keep his children safe. “I keep thinking about this. There is nothing else on my mind.”

Dr Ehsen Naveed Irfan, a psychiatrist at Irfan Neuro-Psychiatry and General Hospital Mansehra, stressed that prolonged displacement deepens mental health struggles. “People need to be rehabilitated to proper residential facilities close to their original homes. Without this, their mental health struggles intensify, and returning to normal life becomes extremely difficult,” he said. His team, he said, trained local doctors and used psychological first aid, screening communities for PTSD and offering therapies like Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR).
Building bridges to recovery
Psychosocial support is vital for healing in the face of disaster. According to Bushra, “Psychologists and mental health professionals can help disaster survivors process their trauma experiences, strengthening social support, providing problem-solving and resilience training. Priority should be given to fulfilling their basic needs, while specialised therapies may be beneficial after initial support.”
At the same time, she noted, local mental health systems are not well-prepared to handle emergencies, leaving many communities without timely support.
Citing evidence, Dr Rabbani added that early interventions, particularly by trained frontline workers, can significantly reduce PTSD and depression. In Sindh, Lady Health Workers trained in psychosocial support and equipped with digital counselling tools helped communities cope, leading to measurable reductions in anxiety and depression. “Community-based approaches, peer support, and culturally sensitive interventions are key to sustaining recovery,” she emphasised.
A fragile path forward
Nazeera talks about her sleepless nights and constant headaches, but she clings to hope. “My only hope is that we go home safely and get our daughter married. As for my other family members, we will endure it. After all, who can fight nature?”
Her words carry the quiet strength of families across Punjab, piecing together lives torn apart by floods. On World Mental Health Day, their story is a raw reminder: mending broken spirits is as crucial as rebuilding homes, a slow but stubborn journey toward hope, one day at a time.

The first quake of magnitude 7.4, in waters off the town of Manay in the province of Davao Oriental, triggered a tsunami alert for coasts within 300 kilometres of the epicentre, but the warnings for the Philippines and Indonesia were subsequently lifted.
A second earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the same area seven hours later, triggering a new tsunami warning, with the country’s seismology agency Phivolcs warning of possible waves that could be more than a metre higher than normal tides.
 






People living near coastal areas in the southern Philippines were “strongly advised to immediately evacuate” to higher ground, or move further inland, it said in an advisory.
Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol described the twin earthquakes as a “doublet”, two distinct earthquakes that occurred along a massive trench off the country’s eastern seaboard.
There were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges, one official in Manay said, although the full extent of the damage in the Philippines was not immediately clear.
At least seven people were killed, civil defence official Ednar Dayanghirang said in a briefing. The fatalities were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicentre.
The twin quakes were among the strongest in recent years to hit the Philippines, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences more than 800 quakes each year.
It came two weeks after the Philippines experienced its deadliest earthquake in more than a decade with 74 people killed on the central island of Cebu following an offshore quake of magnitude 6.9.

Vehicles shaking, gates rattling
A video posted on social media and verified by Reuters showed people in the city of Davao calmly holding on to parked vehicles that rocked from side to side as the ground shook, as metal gates rattled nearby.
Richie Diuyen, a disaster official in Manay, said the quake lasted 30 to 40 seconds and damaged some homes and the facade of a church, while leaving cracked roads and unpassable bridges.
“We couldn’t stand earlier. I am 46 years old now, and this is the strongest earthquake I ever felt,” Diuyen said by phone.
Earlier, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said authorities were assessing the situation and search-and-rescue teams would fan out once it was safe.
“We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” he said in a statement.
Warning of strong aftershocks
Phivolcs warned of aftershocks and urged people in affected areas to stay away from the shoreline.
Verified footage from the southern Philippines showed workers filing out of buildings to gather in the streets, lamps swaying in shops, and offices with toppled cabinets and workers holding on to desks as structures and fittings around them creaked.
Video images from Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi showed fishing boats returning from sea and children playing on a beach from which water had receded.
Phivolcs revised down the magnitude to 7.4 from an initial figure of 7.6, and put the quake’s depth at 23km. The second quake was also downwardly revised to 6.8 from 6.9, with an depth of 37km.
The governor of Davao del Norte in the Philippines said people panicked when the earthquake struck.
“Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.”</p><small>2025-10-10 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101950174aba43c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947913/karachi-police-developing-web-portal-for-businessmen-to-lodge-extortion-complaints' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police developing web portal for businessmen to lodge extortion complaints</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar announced on Friday that a web portal is being developed to facilitate traders by registering their complaints regarding extortion and other crimes in Karachi.
Earlier this week, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Ghulam Nabi Memon vowed to provide full protection to economic and commercial activities in collaboration with traders across the province.
“All complaints submitted through this portal will be addressed promptly, and police action will be taken immediately to ensure redressal,” Lanjar said while addressing a press conference at the Karachi Police Office.
Flanked by IG Memon and Karachi Additional IG Javed Alam Odho, Lanjar said any complaint related to extortion slips or threats submitted through the new web portal will lead to the immediate registration of a first information report (FIR), and all legal measures will be ensured against those involved.
Additional IG Odho said that the initiative is being taken in light of traders reporting “inconveniences” while visiting police stations for lodging an FIR.
“Protecting the business community and providing them with a safe and free business environment are among the top priorities of the Sindh government,” Lanjar said.
He added that extortion has become a major issue of concern in recent times and emphasised that since Karachi is Pakistan’s economic hub, the government’s foremost priority is to provide a peaceful environment for the business community and all traders, ensuring safe and free business activities at every level.
“Although the issue of extortion has been given significant hype, both the SIU/CIA (Special Investigation Unit/Crime Investigation Agency) and the district police are fully committed to uprooting and eradicating this crime and have been conducting effective and coordinated operations,” the home minister said.
“At present, Wasiullah Lakho and Samad Kathiawari are operating extortion gangs from Iran,” he added. “For their arrest, a formal request for red warrants has been sent, and the Sindh government will also request assistance from the federal interior minister to help ensure the arrest of these criminals involved in such heinous acts.”
The home minister stated that extortion in a city like Karachi is a highly serious and sensitive matter, and the provincial government has always been committed to providing a business-friendly environment to promote economic activity. However, he stressed that public cooperation is crucial to curb extortion.
Lanjar noted that the SIU/CIA and district police have conducted operations in which four extortionists were killed.
“The threats were linked to the Lakho group and Samad Kathiawari, and the government will never allow any group or criminal element to openly distribute extortion slips or intimidate citizens,” he vowed.
Additional IG Odho added that the police had arrested 20 suspected extortionists within two weeks. He said that there would be zero extortion cases in the city and recalled that the police had also controlled targeted killings in the metropolis.
On Wednesday, a police crime data report showed that 118 incidents of extortion were reported in Karachi so far this year, of which only 44 were genuine extortion cases, while the remaining 74 pertained to personal disputes and business quarrels. A police statement added that of the 44 cases, 39 were “solved” — a success ratio of 87 per cent.
Additionally, compared to last year, there has been a “significant” reduction in street crimes during the ongoing year. As of 2024, 252 incidents of street crimes were being reported daily, but this year, only 167 incidents have been reported, a decrease of 52pc.
According to a crime statistics report seen by Dawn.com, only six people were killed as of September 2025, compared to 13 as of January 2024.</p><small>2025-10-10 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10193110b0c5672.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947912/white-house-says-trump-nobel-omission-was-politics-over-peace' target='_blank'><strong>White House says Trump Nobel omission was ‘politics over peace’</strong></a><br><p>The White House lashed out at the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday after it awarded the peace prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and overlooked US President Donald Trump.
“The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace,” White House Director of Communications Steven Cheung said on X.
 






“President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives. He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will.”
Since returning to the White House for his second term in January, Trump had repeatedly insisted that he deserved the Nobel for his role in resolving numerous conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated.
Trump restated his claim on the eve of the peace prize announcement, saying that his brokering of the first phase of a ceasefire in Gaza this week was the eighth war he had ended.
But he added on Thursday: “Whatever they do is fine. I know this: I didn’t do it for that, I did it because I’ve saved a lot of lives.”
Nobel Prize experts in Oslo had insisted in the run-up to Friday’s announcement that Trump had no chance, noting that his “America First” policies run counter to the ideals of the Peace Prize as laid out in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will creating the award.
The president has not yet commented on the Nobel decision, but he did post three videos on his Truth Social account on Friday morning of supporters celebrating the Gaza deal.
“Will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not. They’ll give it to some guy that didn’t do a damn thing,” Trump told top US military leaders last month.
He said it would be a “big insult” to the United States if he didn’t get it.
Nominations for the Nobel must have been made before January 31 to be valid for this year’s prize. Trump returned to the White House for his second term in office on January 20.</p><small>2025-10-10 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627978-ku-female-student-dies-after-being-struck-by-campus-bus' target='_blank'><strong>KU female student dies after being struck by campus bus</strong></a><br><p>

The incident in Orakzai took place on Tuesday night when security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district on the reported presence of  “Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij”.
In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
In the Tuesday operation, 19 “India-sponsored” terrorists were killed, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, adding that 11 security personnel, including two officers, had also embraced martyrdom during the exchange of fire.
In a statement issued today, the ISPR said, “Security forces have been conducting a series of retribution operations against the kharijis involved in [the] heinous incident that occurred in Orakzai District on October 7, resulting in the shahadat of brave sons of soil, including Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq and Major Tayyab Rahat.”
 






It added that during an operation in the Jamal Maya area of Orakzai, conducted on the basis of credible intelligence, “all 30 India-sponsored khwarij involved in the terrorist incident have been sent to hell” after an intense exchange of fire.
“These successful operations have avenged the heinous act and have brought the main perpetrators to justice,” the statement read.
It said sanitisaton operations were under way to “hunt and eliminate any other India-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined and remain steadfast to eradicate and wipe out the menace of India-sponsored terrorism from the country”.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that security personnel were engaged in “safeguarding the motherland against the enemy by risking their lives”.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, he also reiterated the government’s resolve to stamp out the menace of terrorism from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement on the PPP’s X account, lauded the security forces’ “courageous” operation against “India-sponsored terrorists”.
It quoted the president as saying that the nation would forever remember the sacrifices of Lieutenant Colonel Tariq and Major Rahat and that security forces had made the nation proud by dismantling a network of terrorists.
“Continuous successes against terrorism reflect our resolve, [and] the brave sons of the soil have written history by sacrificing their lives for the protection of the motherland,” the president added.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of security forces, saying that the nation stood with them in the fight against terrorism.
A statement posted on the interior ministry’s X account quoted Naqvi as saying, “I pay tribute to the security forces for thwarting the designs of the Fitna Al Khawarij terrorists. The security forces achieved great success by bringing 30 terrorists to a decisive end.
“We will not let the terrorists of Fitna Al Khawarij hide anywhere in Pakistan,” he said.
 






Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Just a day after the Orakzai incident, a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district.
Last month, 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents in a span of a few days.
Following that, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khawarij or stand with Pakistan”.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. But Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters on Wednesday had expressed the resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan.
A day ago, PM Shehbaz said during a meeting of the federal cabinet that the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country, and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a similar warning in the National Assembly same day about going after terrorist facilitators “wherever they are”. Saying “enough is enough”, he added that the facilitators of terrorism would have to pay, whether they were present on Pakistani or Afghan soil.</p><small>2025-10-10 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10145507b435c85.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947887/kp-govt-must-protect-its-people-instead-of-begging-afghanistan-for-security-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt must protect its people instead of begging Afghanistan for security: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government should work on protecting the people of the province instead of “begging Afghanistan” for security.
The DG ISPR made these remarks while addressing a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters.
 


He said governance gaps in KP were being paid for by the blood of security personnel.
“Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he asserted, adding that the state and its institutions would not be bothered by “any political distortions”.
“The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible person for bringing terrorism back to KP.”
He said that he hoped the government would focus on governance and the people it was duty-bound to protect. “We also hope that instead of begging Afghanistan for security, you will protect this province and its people.”
The DG ISPR began the press conference by paying homage on behalf of the armed forces of Pakistan to the “brave sons of soil” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said the purpose of the press conference was to give an overview of the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
For the past two decades, Pakistan, particularly KP, has been facing the issue of terrorism, he said.
In 2024, he said, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP, 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians were killed.
Moreover, he continued, 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025 until September 15. In these operations, 970 terrorists were killed while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred.
When the frequency of terrorism incidents increased in 2021, “the response also went up”, the DG ISPR said. “And more number of kharijis were killed in subsequent years.”
The DG ISPR said following the 2014 attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, security forces had started uprooting terrorism as part of a comprehensive strategy.
“We reached close to [realising] the dream of a peaceful Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. [But], unfortunately, as part of a plan, terrorists and their facilitators were then provided space here.
“Governance and public welfare were deliberately weakened and attempts were made to build a misleading narrative. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are paying its price with their blood and sacrifices even today.”
Factors behind rise of militancy
He then outlined the factors that led to this situation.
First reason, he said, was not fully implementing the National Action Plan, followed by politicising the issue of terrorism, India using Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the provision of modern weapons to terrorists in Afghanistan and the existence of a “terrorism-crime nexus” that had “complete local and political backing”.
Going back to the 2014 APS attack, he said all political parties, and the provincial and federal governments devised the NAP. “All political parties agreed that the implementation of the NAP was necessary for eliminating terrorism.”
But, he added, the then-government removed some provisions of the plan in 2021 despite progress in those areas and came up with the “revised” NAP. All political parties, provincial governments and the federal government then agreed to fully implement all 14 points of the revised plan, he said.
Pointing to a graphic of the plan on the screen, he said the first point concerned kinetic operations.
“Is this being worked on or not? I have presented the data for KP to you. Just in KP, are law enforcement agencies not conducting more than 40 intelligence-based operations?”
He asserted that the empirical evidence demonstrated that work was being done on the first point of the NAP. He then went on to question the work being done on the remaining 13 points.
“Today, are we all standing under one narrative? Do you not hear voices calling for talks with these terrorists? Are we following this NAP?
“Does the solution to all problems lie in dialogue? You tell me. If the solution for every problem is in dialogue, then when India fired missiles on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 … why didn’t the people of this country say let’s hold talks?”
If the solution lay in just holding dialogue, there would be no wars, he emphasised.
Coming to the fifth point, the military spokesperson said it had been decided to “break the terror-crime nexus” in order to eradicate terrorism. Moreover, he said, it had also been decided to “strengthen the judiciary” with regard to counter-terrorism cases.
Then, pulling up another graphic, the DG ISPR detailed the cases in anti-terrorism courts in KP.
He said that no one was convicted, while 34 cases were pending. “This is the judicial system that was to be strengthened. The political government of the time decided it, we did not.”
The DG ISPR further stated that the decision had been made to strengthen KP police. Noting that the provincial police was currently 3,200-personnel strong, he asked: “ The terrorism (situation) is before you all. Is this [number] enough?“
The army spokesperson also noted that the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan was being “politicised”.
“Misleading things were said when these decisions were taken.”
He said that after the US left Afghanistan in 2021, “they left behind weapons and ammunition that are now being used by terrorists. Those weapons were found in the custody of terrorists killed in operations in KP.”
The DG ISPR replied to a question about how things will change concerning the NAP by saying, “We know how things will change … they will change once we work on this NAP with clarity and in unison. There will be change when those who play politics are asked why they are playing with people’s lives and property and why they are supporting the statements of terrorists.”
Last night’s Kabul explosion
During the press conference, the DG ISPR was also asked about media reports alleging a strike was carried out in Kabul last night to eliminate the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) leader Noor Wali Mehsud.
In his response, he said the army had taken note of the reports circulating on social media and the statement issued by the Taliban spokesperson.
“Afghanistan is a neighbourly, Islamic country. We have historical connections, cultural connections. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for four decades. We only say one thing to the Afghan government: do not allow your soil to be used for terrorism against Pakistan,” he added.
He pointed out that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan was also continuing, and many Afghans came to Pakistan for medical reasons. “So we only have an extremely fair demand: don’t let your soil be used by non-state actors and terrorist groups.”
“Is it wrong to ask? It is absolutely fair, it is correct, it is rational, it is our right. And for this, we also engage them at multiple levels,” he said, highlighting several bilateral and multilateral engagements.
“Yes, we do engage them and we clearly communicate [to them] … that these are the [terrorist] leaders, their facilitators and their centres [in Afghanistan]. Yes, we engage [with Afghanistan], but at the same time, we are doing and will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect the lives of Pakistan’s people and its territorial integrity,” the DG ISPR continued.
When pressed by another reporter for more clarity on alleged strikes in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said, “I have made it clear that Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this. And I have also said that all the necessary steps for protecting the people’s lives and property are being taken and will continue to be taken.”
Saudi defence deal and international engagement to curb Afghan terrorism
Questioned about the Saudi defence deal and whether the kingdom could be engaged in the talks with Afghanistan to resolve the issue of cross-border militancy, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan continued to engage the country and its other allies even before the pact.
“We engage the Afghans directly at multiple levels and also through allied countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, China, US, Turkiye and many more. They all understand that the space being given to non-state actors in Afghanistan is not just against Pakistan.”
He said ‘‘every alphabet’’ of non-state actors was found in Afghanistan, pointing to various groups such as the TTP, IS-K, BLA and more.
DG Chaudhry said these terrorists had no affiliation or religious or cultural identity and were available to the highest bidder.
’’If you allow these elements space in your country, then every kind of terrorist organisation will be found. That is why we are engaging them because all of them are concerned because this threat from non-state actors is not only a danger to Pakistan or to the region but it is becoming a threat to the whole world.“
He said the Afghan authorities had to decide whether they would allow Afghanistan to become a sanctuary for terrorists or not, adding that history showed that nurturing such groups often led to them turning on their benefactors.
DG Chaudhry said such groups were a threat to Afghanistan and its people as well. He said Pakistan’s job was to engage the Afghan authorities and take necessary action to defend and protect the lives of its people.
On a question about an international coalition to strike terrorist havens in Afghanistan, he said while such consultations and engagement continued, “we know that your security cannot be granted by external players, while we keep on engaging them, the responsibility to protect your life and property and people is of Pakistan’s state and institutions and military and that is where our first and foremost focus is’’.
The DG ISPR also remarked on whether the presence of non-state actors was a product of the transition of the Afghan Taliban from a non-state actor to a state entity, or due to the interference of foreign actors such as India.
“Perhaps it is the clout and influence of these non-state actors in Afghanistan that has grown beyond control,” he said. “Perhaps it is the factions within Afghan government who cannot agree on how to resolve this problem. But that is for them to decide.”
Past engagement with TTP and change in KP leadership
Questioned about past engagement with the TTP and the change in the KP leadership that saw Ali Amin Gandapur stepping down as chief minister, the DG ISPR said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists). Where is this voice coming from? Who is saying this? Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations.
‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations. It is for everyone to see that today, or five years back or six or seven or eight or in any timeframe, who is that person and political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’
DG Chaudhry said the person saying so was responsible for the state in the past but now he was not and yet he still persisted with his stance.
“It is absolutely clear that this stance and confusing the people through it that the solution to this problem is not in counterterrorism or operations but in talking to the people who slaughtered your children … is for everyone to see.’’
He said the army, police and children of Pakistan were paying the price for the above ‘‘perverted and criminal thinking’’.
DG Chaundry said talks were indeed engaged in but questioned what was the result of it all, pointing to the Afghan Taliban’s promises in the Doha peace talks and their failure to abide by them.
 
 

Questioned about the change in KP leadership and how it might be signalling a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR said the establishment was itself a part of the state.
“Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’
He questioned whether the military could afford distraction by political shenanigans and said the answer was no.
Faiz Hameed court martial proceedings
Questioned about the court martial proceedings against former spymaster retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG Chaudhry said: ‘‘That legal process is ongoing and will come to its logical and just conclusion.’’
To another question about an alleged delay in the court martial proceedings, DG Chaudhry said the matter concerned a former intelligence chief and hence the “gravity” of the matter was high.
’’The state and the institution have to be absolutely and deliberately correct in that. All the requirements of procedure, process and justice have to be met because you would not like to try such an important and critical case in hurry and haste,“ he added.
“The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfill all the requirements of justice and process.’’
He said another reason for the court martial proceedings was that ‘‘when you turn a relation into a political and personal relation, then you will have to answer for that. But who did it? The one who was [heading] the state at the time and doing politics and that is why, we always say not to involve us in your politics.’’
The DG ISPR said all political parties and politicians were respectable for the army but it was unacceptable if anyone considered their politics to be above the state.
“If a single person thinks their being is greater than Pakistan, then that is unacceptable.’’
Giving the example of the current state of Indian armed forces and the creeping influence of Hindutva , the military spokesperson said the military was the ‘‘ultimate instrument of violence’’ of the state and politicising it would lead to ‘‘horrible results’’.
Issue of US weapons left behind in Afghanistan
In response to a question about US weapons in the hands of terrorists, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan was engaged with Washington on the matter.
“This equipment is not only being used in Pakistan by Fitna al-Khawarij or Fitna al-Hindustan but the equipment left with non-state actors can be used anywhere,” he explained. “We do share data and engage with them (the US) and they understand how the equipment is used by non-state actors.”
Collateral damage during operations
In response to a question about collateral damage during operations and criticism by affected locals, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that operations were intelligence-based and “very precise”.
“We cannot believe statements about collateral damage because we are the army of Pakistan and KP,” he replied. “If terrorists have taken a family hostage and are firing at innocent people and we respond, does that make it collateral damage or facilitation?”
The DG ISPR noted that facilitators, whether they were doing it out of desperation or for financial gain, had three choices: “Turn terrorists over to the law. If that is not possible, then join the state and work to eradicate the threat,” the military spokesperson said. “If a terrorist violates the sanctity of someone’s home by entering it, and you do not force him out, that makes you a facilitator. Where is the collateral damage? there’s no collateral damage. There’s a terrorist and a facilitator.”</p><small>2025-10-10 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627966-extortion-a-serious-concern-in-karachi-says-home-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Extortion a serious concern in Karachi, says home minister</strong></a><br><p>

The following are some facts about the democracy campaigner:
Upper-class background
Maria Corina Machado, 58, was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on October 7, 1967. She is an industrial engineer by training, and her father was a prominent businessman in Venezuela’s steel industry. Her upper-class roots have made her a target of criticism from Venezuela’s governing socialist party.
In hiding
Machado won a resounding victory in the opposition’s primary election in 2023, and her rallies attracted large crowds, but a ban from holding public office prevented her from running for president against Nicolas Maduro in an election in 2024, and she went into hiding.
The country’s electoral authority and top court say Maduro, whose time in office has been marked by a deep economic and social crisis, won the election, though they have never published detailed tallies.
Machado emerged from hiding to make a brief appearance during a protest before Maduro’s inauguration in January. She was briefly arrested and then freed.
Advocate of liberal economic reforms
Machado advocates for liberal economic reforms, including the privatisation of state-owned enterprises such as PDVSA, Venezuela’s oil company. She also supports the creation of welfare programs aimed at aiding the country’s poorest citizens.
Political activism
Her political activism has come at a cost, leaving her isolated as nearly all of her senior advisers have been detained or forced to leave the country. Machado herself has accused Maduro’s administration of operating as a “criminal mafia.”
Collective struggle
Though sometimes criticised for being egotistical, even by her own mother, Machado rarely speaks about herself in public. Instead, she frames her campaign as a collective struggle for redemption and unity, aiming to inspire hope among Venezuelans weary of economic hardship and social decay.</p><small>2025-10-10 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10132646eee4c10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947888/girls-remains-identified-14-years-after-japan-tsunami' target='_blank'><strong>Girl’s remains identified 14 years after Japan tsunami</strong></a><br><p>Human remains found in Japan have been identified as those of a six-year-old girl missing since the massive earthquake and tsunami of 2011, police said on Friday.
The disaster killed 15,900 people, with 2,520 people still listed as missing as of the end of February, according to the National Police Agency.
Teeth and fragments of jaw were discovered in February 2023 in the northern region of Miyagi, a spokesman for the local police told AFP.
“After dental and DNA identification analyses, it was confirmed the remains belong to Natsuse Yamane, female, who was six years old at the time,” he said.
The girl had been at her home in Yamada, a town around 100 kilometres away in Iwate Prefecture, when the tsunami swept her away, the spokesman added.
She had been listed as missing ever since.
The remains were found by construction workers sifting through material amassed in a clean-up of coastal areas, the Asahi Shimbun daily reported.
The child’s family issued a statement of thanks.
“We are very happy to have been contacted and to receive this news after having given up hope,” the Asahi Shimbun quoted the statement as saying.
 
 

The last time remains were identified in the three prefectures hardest hit by the disaster — Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima — was in August 2023, the Asahi said.
The 9.0-magnitude earthquake in March 2011 also sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in this century’s biggest atomic disaster.</p><small>2025-10-10 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101217505feb249.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947882/india-to-reopen-its-embassy-in-kabul-after-4-years' target='_blank'><strong>India to reopen its embassy in Kabul after 4 years</strong></a><br><p>India will reopen its embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul that was shut four years ago, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Friday.
India had closed its embassy in Kabul after the Taliban seized power following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces in 2021, but opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support, and humanitarian aid.
About a dozen countries including China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkiye have embassies operating in Kabul, although Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration.
New Delhi’s announcement came as Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi began talks with Jaishankar on what is the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since 2021.
“India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaishankar told Muttaqi in his opening remarks.
“Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” he said, adding that India’s “technical mission” in Kabul was being upgraded to an embassy.
According to Hindustan Times, Jaishankar also said that closer cooperation between the two countries would contribute to “regional stability and resilience“.
“As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,” Jaishankar said, according to the report.
 






Meanwhile, Muttaqi was quoted as saying that India was the first country to respond to “the recent earthquake in Afghanistan”.
“Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations,” the Afghan minister was quoted as saying.
New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries.
The visit comes after Muttaqi attended a regional meeting in Moscow where Afgha­nistan’s neighbours including Pakistan, Iran, China and several Central Asian countries issued a joint statement opposing the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in the region. The statement was regarded as a signal of opposition to US President Donald Trump’s stated objective to retake control of the Bagram military base near Kabul.</p><small>2025-10-10 07:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10124449157c330.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947879/operation-in-kps-bannu-kills-2-terrorists-including-one-wanted-for-killing-4-officials-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>Operation in KP’s Bannu kills 2 terrorists, including one wanted for killing 4 officials: CTD</strong></a><br><p>In a major intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Thursday, two terrorists were killed including one reported to be the mastermind behind the killing of four officials in April, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in a statement
A press release by the CTD issued yesterday said that it had “killed two most-wanted terrorists during a successful intelligence-based operation in Bannu district”.
“The mastermind of the martyrdom of four CTD officials is also among those killed,” it added.
According to the press release, the CTD had received confidential information that terrorists belonging to the banned organisation Fitna-al-Khawarij were planning a “major terrorist operation” on Company Road within the limits of Domail police station.
Fitnah-al Khawarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Per the statement, the CTD’s Special (SWAT) team surrounded the area immediately along with the district police.
“Upon seeing the operation team, the terrorists tried to escape and started indiscriminate firing on the officials,” it said. “CTD and police retaliated vigorously to protect themselves and arrest the terrorists.”
The exchange of fire between the CTD team and the terrorists reportedly continued for about 25 minutes.
After the firing stopped, a search and clearance operation was conducted in the area and two terrorists were found dead, both of whom were identified as being from Bannu, it added.
“Some of the terrorists’ accomplices took advantage of the darkness to successfully escape.”
One of the terrorists killed was identified as the mastermind behind an attack on the Bannu CTD team on April 30, 2025, in which four personnel were killed and one injured. He had also been involved in attacks on two police posts in the district, in which a constable was martyred, the statement saod.
The other was involved in several attacks and targeted killings on CTD and district police in 2023, including attacking and injuring a constable in November of that year, according to the CTD.
“Two Kalashnikovs, six magazines, 23 rounds, two hand grenades, two mobile phones and two cards of the banned TTP were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorists,” the press release said, adding that additional police and CTD personnel had launched a search operation in the area to arrest the escaped terrorists.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
A major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district yesterday, according to the media wing of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The incident occurred a day after the ISPR reported that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, had been killed in an exchange of fire between the forces and TTP terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district.</p><small>2025-10-10 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627901-faceless-e-challan-system-comes-into-effect-this-month-in-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>Faceless e-challan system comes into effect this month in Sindh</strong></a><br><p>
